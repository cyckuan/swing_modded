   LITTLETON, Colo. _ After a long day of agony for victims'
parents and anxiety for police officers searching for explosives,
the authorities on Wednesday evening removed the bodies of 15
people killed in a massacre at Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dead were the two members of the senior class who are
believed to have unleashed the carnage on Tuesday before turning
their guns on themselves. They were found shot in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve of the dead, including both suspects, were found in the
school's library, said the Jefferson County sheriff, John Stone,
who added that there were so many weapons and explosive devices _
including 30 bombs, a semi-automatic rifle and pistol and two
shotguns _ that investigators were still unsure how they got it all
inside the school. They may have hidden it during several trips or
they may have had help, Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   David J. Thomas, the district attorney, at a press conference at
the school Wednesday afternoon, said that investigators are looking
at eight to 10 people who might have knowledge of the case through
familiarity with a Web site connected to the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is evidence to suggest that other people were at
least aware of what was going on. There were a lot of devices. They
took a long time to construct and a lot of people were familiar
with the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said a computer had been seized at a suspect's house, and
they were tracing the e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   An unfathomable set of questions surrounded the motivations of
the two suspects, 18-year-old Eric David Harris and Dylan Bennett
Klebold, 17. They were described by many students Wednesday as
members of a self-styled group of loners and outcasts who called
themselves the ``Trenchcoat Mafia'' after the long black coats they
wore and shared a fascination with violent video games and a
antipathy toward the more popular students who they referred to as
``jocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Harris and Klebold were arrested last year for breaking
into a car, and parents of another student at the school said that
they had complained to authorities last year about death threats
made by Harris against their son. Nonetheless, school authorities
and many students insisted Wednesday that they never seriously
considered either young man to be inclined toward the horrific
violence let loose here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The incident set off a national bout of soul-searching and
debates over whether the killings were spurred by easy access to
guns or by the violent images on television and in video games to
which America's children are routinely exposed.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said in Washington that ``all of us are
struggling to understand exactly what happened and why.''
</P>
<P>
   The shootings also had immediate political reverberations as
well: In at least three states, including Colorado, sponsors of
legislation expanding the rights to carry guns withdrew those
measures Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities were still so concerned about the possibility of
more danger that most of the bodies were removed from the school
only Wednesday evening. They were taken to the county coroner's
office. Some were so unrecognizable that parents were asked to
bring dental records of their missing children to the school.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll, which represents the largest school massacre in
the country's history, was a downward revision from the possible 25
deaths that the authorities had said on Tuesday. But it was unclear
whether it would rise again as the search inside the school
continued.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the dead are male, including at least one teacher and
one black student whom the killers had shot in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen people are still hospitalized, 11 of them in serious or
critical condition, according to a spokesman for the sheriff's
office.
</P>
<P>
   All day long, under sunny skies that turned slate grey with an
approaching storm Wednesday afternoon, students gathered near the
high school for any news about friends still officially listed as
missing. Many were crying or clutching flowers that they brought to
a makeshift memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even imagine walking into that school right now,''
said 17-year-old Dara Ferguson, a junior, who had three friends
whom she feared were dead. ``I don't think I ever want to set foot
in there again.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Jefferson County School District said that
the building, with hundreds of bullet holes and several inches of
water that came from sprinklers that went off after the bombs did,
would remain closed for the rest of the school year.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama and Florida, the school shooting prompted lawmakers
to postpone consideration of bills that would prohibit cities and
counties from suing gun makers for the cost of gun violence. The
bills, similar to others passed around the country, were introduced
at the behest of the National Rifle Association to protect the
firearms industry from liability suits.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, officials of the NRA said they had decided to
scale back their national membership meeting, scheduled for May 1
in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter, the NRA president, actor Charlton Heston, said the
group was canceling a gun show along with all other ``festive
ceremonies normally associated with our annual gathering.'' The
group was nevertheless going to hold its annual members meeting at
the city's convention center.
</P>
<P>
   But he and some other politicians said that the violence might
have been averted if someone else had been armed at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had there been someone who was armed, in this particular
situation, in my opinion, it may have stabilized,'' said Gov. Jesse
Ventura of Minnesota, who supports loosening restrictions on
concealed handguns. ``I believe it supports conceal and carry
because of the fact that what happens when a group of unarmed
individuals are confronted with people with weapons like this, you
have no defense.''
</P>
<P>
   And Heston said the incident showed that there should be armed
guards in the nation's schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there had been even one armed guard in the school, he could
have saved a lot of lives and perhaps ended the whole thing
instantly,'' he said in Los Angeles on Wednesday. There was, in
fact, an armed guard at the school and he exchanged fire with one
of the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   A police officer assigned to the school, Neil Gardner of the
Jefferson County Sheriff's Department, apparently exchanged gunfire
with one of the teenagers shortly after the melee began at 11:30
a.m., and two other patrol officers fired some shots about a half
hour later, according to Steve Davis, a sheriff's spokesman.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CHICAGO _ Boom, boom, boom.
</P>
<P>
   They were like cannon blasts ringing in a new Astros home-run
king, echoing off the Wrigley Field outfield walls and bouncing off
the bricks that line Waveland Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The first one was a towering no-doubt shot over the left-field
grandstand and into the street. The second one sailed like a rocket
into the right-center-field bleachers, pushing this Astros star
with the gun-barrel forearms past the Toy Cannon, Jimmy Wynn, as
the club's all-time home-run leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one to right field,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker would
say later, ``wow. It was a bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   The third one was high, huge and straight into a wind that
earlier in the day knocked back would-be shots hit by two other
players.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeff Bagwell, on the way to 225 career home runs, has done
little like other players. He stands all wrong. He hitches his
hands all wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Just standing there in the batter's box, like he has one foot on
the dock and one on a boat that's drifting away, he looks all
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't teach my swing to anyone,'' Bagwell says.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, it always ends up right. Always, it seems he is
getting better.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the most impressive and revealing thing about
Bagwell's slamming three home runs in Wednesday's 10-3 Astros
victory over the Chicago Cubs is not how many he hit, but how he
hit them.
</P>
<P>
   Two came on two-strike pitches. Two were on breaking balls. None
wound up dribbling their way meekly to the third baseman or
shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   These were home runs that proved to be the most significant
endorsement yet of Bagwell's offseason tinkering with his swing,
even if the statistics said it needed no tinkering.
</P>
<P>
   These were home runs that reflected the drive in a man who is
like few others. Always, Bagwell scrutinizes every detail,
criticizes every failure and allows himself only small doses of joy
for the great moments.
</P>
<P>
   Always, he is searching for perfection.
</P>
<P>
   Even Wednesday, amid the glorious record-setting afterglow,
Bagwell talked about the three home runs being only three-fifths of
the story. In his other two at-bats, Bagwell struck out and
grounded to third.
</P>
<P>
   Of the groundout, Bags shook his head and said, ``I swung at a
bad pitch. I was disappointed I did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the strikeout, he said: ``That was a horrible at-bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Always, there is a search for more. It is something that might
sometimes keep Bagwell from fully appreciating performances such as
Wednesday's. But it also is something that virtually guarantees
there will be more days like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a constant battle for me,'' Bagwell said. ``If I'm
terrible, I'm going to tell you I'm terrible. I'm the first one to
admit it. It's just a constant battle to do it right.''
</P>
<P>
   It's why Bagwell is Bagwell _ a great hitter always seemingly
getting better.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Bagwell might not have come close to hitting three
home runs given the pitches he saw Wednesday afternoon at
wind-whipped Wrigley. A year ago, the deep hitch in his swing might
have had Bagwell ending similar at-bats with groundouts to the left
side of the infield, particularly on the two-strike breaking balls.
</P>
<P>
   It almost seems comical that Bagwell's 34-homer, 111-RBI season
of a year ago was considered a down year by some. It was his third
straight season of at least 30 home runs and 100 RBIs. But Bagwell
himself considered 1998 a down year.
</P>
<P>
   He hated the frequent two-strike dribblers down the third-base
line. He hated how he dropped his hands nearly to his waist as he
loaded for a swing. He called Astros hitting coach Tom McCraw and
asked for help. He worked on starting his hands higher, which would
give him a better chance to extend his arms, protect the plate with
two strikes and drive the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like, `I'm beating the ball around, and I should be
crushing those pitches,''' McCraw said. ``He was committed to
making it better.''
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, he obviously did. Bagwell was the Astros' best
hitter start-to-finish. But once the Cubs arrived in Houston to
begin the regular season, Bagwell got off to a slow start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned he might say the heck with it and go back to
what he was doing before,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bagwell stayed with the new starting point for his swing and
began hitting for average. Finally, on Wednesday, he tore apart the
fences and the Astros' record book and now is hitting .396 with
four homers, 12 RBIs and a .688 slugging percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really watched my swing on tape,'' Bagwell said.
``But on the first (home run) today, I was out in front of it, and
the way I used to hit, I wasn't usually out in front. Something's
definitely different.''
</P>
<P>
   He still looks all wrong standing there in the batter's box. But
it's definitely right. And getting better all the time.

 LITTLETON: sheriff's spokesman.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here in Littleton, a Denver suburb where spiffy new housing
developments and shopping malls are rising out of former farmland
that backs up to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains and where
many parents say they moved to enroll their students in good and
safe public schools, grief and shock were pervasive Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the dead began to filter out Wednesday evening,
though the authorities said they were not prepared to release an
official list. The families of Rachel Scott, 15, and Isaiah Shoels,
18, said that their children had died in the shooting and a
teacher, William David Sanders, was widely identified as the
faculty member who had perished.
</P>
<P>
   Shoels, who was black, was apparently singled out for killing,
according to some of the students who survived the library rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seemed to seek him out,'' Joshua Lapp, a senior at the
school who dove for cover with other students in the library.
``They went past a row of desks and one of them said, `Look,
there's that little nigger.' Then there were three shots and one of
them said, `Is he dead?' and the other one said, `Yes, he's dead
all right.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Crystal Woodman, a junior who was also in the library at the
time, told ABC's ``Good Morning America'' program that the two were
laughing as they went about their killing binge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just, like, they thought it was funny,'' said Miss
Woodman. ``They were just, like, `We've waited to do this our whole
lives.' And every time they'd shoot someone, they'd holler, like it
was, like, exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   In the killers' arsenal, found Wednesdayat several places in the
school, were 30 bombs, including several constructed from propane
gas cylinders, a 9 mm semiautomatic rifle, two pistol-grip
shotguns, one handgun and at least 100 rounds of ammunition, said
Stone.

FATHER OF VICTIM SAYS SON `HAD CONFLICT' WITH SUSPECTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to add information about students Rachel Scott, Danny
Steepleton and Nicole Nowlen.)  (mk) 
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The father of one of the victims in the Colorado school
shootings said his son had ``had a conflict'' with the presumed
gunmen last year and that he believed his son was a target even
before he was shot to death in the library at Columbine High
School.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the 15 victims _ 14 students and one teacher _ had
not been released by Wednesday evening. But a father, Michael
Shoels of Littleton, Colo., said officials had notified him that
his son, Isaiah, was among those killed when two students carrying
semiautomatic weapons stormed the school on Tuesday. The families
of another student, Rachel Scott, 15, and of a teacher, William
David Sanders, 48, also said that they had died in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   After the shootings, there were accounts that the gunmen had
sought out black students and athletes, but Isaiah Shoels, who is
black, may have been shot because of the old conflict, his father
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shoels said that Isaiah, an 18-year-old senior at Columbine whom
he described as a jock with a passion for weight lifting, had had a
dispute with the gunmen last year, but he did not elaborate on what
the dispute was about or why he believed it flared up again, this
time in such a violent way.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he believed, based on accounts from his son's
classmates, that the two students who have been named as the
gunmen, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, had been determined to track
down his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids that got away explained it to us,'' Shoels said.
``They said he was one of the main targets because they hunted him
down. He wasn't in the main area. He was in the library. They came
through the cafeteria, they hunted him down.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoels said that his son wanted to be a record-company executive
like one of his role models, Master P, the rapper and recording
executive whose No Limit label pumps out hit albums and
direct-to-video movies. Master P had also been trying to play
professional basketball, scrimmaging with the Charlotte Hornets
until he was cut from the team in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Master P, he took all of these artists and created an
empire,'' Shoels said. ``That was something Isaiah wanted to do in
his lifetime. He most definitely had the smarts to do it. He was
studying music contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Isaiah Shoels, another victim was apparently
Sanders, a business teacher and coach. Relatives of Sanders said
Wednesday that they had been notified by the Jefferson County
coroner's office that he had been killed. Some students said that
Sanders had been shot twice in the chest as he was trying to
shepherd the students to safety during the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He dedicated his entire life to teaching,'' said Rich Jarmon,
Sanders' nephew, who said that Sanders coached the track team and
the women's basketball team at the school. ``Recently he had talked
of retirement, but he said how hard it would be to leave the
school.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Jarmon said, Sanders was substituting for a science
teacher. ``Anytime anyone needed a favor,'' Jarmon said, ``he was
the first one there. If you needed a hand, he was always there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarmon said that Sanders, who was 48 and had been a teacher in
schools in Jefferson County for 22 years, had four daughters. He
also had 10 grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scott was on the school debate team and had recently acted
in a play written, produced and directed by students, said Bonnie
Baumgart, whose son Nick had gone to the prom with her last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Baumgart said another member of the debating team was also
among the dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole team was really close and they lost two,'' she said.
``It's real hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Marie Hocchalter, a 17-year-old senior who plays the flute
in the marching band and the wind symphony, remained in critical
condition at Swedish Hospital Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a good kid,'' said David Maas, who lives down the block
and described neighborhood basketball games that pitted Ms.
Hocchalter against her brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a very close-knit family and don't have any
problems,'' Maas said. ``It's a shame it had to happen to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Schnurr, 18, was hit by shrapnel and was in fair
condition Wednesday. A neighbor, Loretta Jay, said that Ms. Schnurr
had an after-school job in a bank and was excited about the school
prom. She said Ms. Schnurr was looking forward to attending the
University of Northern Colorado in Greeley in the fall, where she
wanted to study counseling so she could work with troubled people.
</P>
<P>
   A cousin of another wounded student, Jeanna Park, 15, said that
Ms. Park was a senior with a grade-point average of 4.0. The
cousin, who did not want to be identified, said Ms. Park was born
in Korea but grew up in Colorado. Her father, Andrew Park, is an
accountant, the cousin said. ``She told her parents what happened,
but the doctor wants her to rest and not speak much,'' the cousin
said. ``She can get up and move around but she's still weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the victims who were treated and released was Joyce
Jankowski, who taught English and journalism, said a former teacher
who was at Mrs. Jankowski's house in Littleton Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jankowski's husband, Leo, said she was ``pretty shaken
up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a scary situation,'' Jankowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of another student at Columbine, Danny Steepleton, said
he had been shot in the legs. A wrestler whose mother works in
another high school in the area, Steepleton was in the library,
studying, when the shooting began. His younger sister, Lisa, who is
also a student at Columbine High, escaped unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor, Mary Tate, said: ``I live alone and he helps me all
the time, cutting the grass and shoveling the walk. His parents
said the first thing he asked for was a bite of pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   Another injured student, Nicole Nowlen, was released from the
hospital Wednesday after being treated for a stomach wound, her
grandmother said.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmother, Linda Nowlen, said that Nicole Nowlen had moved
to Littleton from South Dakota a couple of months ago to live with
her father. She said that Nicole was ``into computers'' and was a
fan of the movie ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's doing well, but she's pretty sore,'' the grandmother
said, adding that Nicole Nowlen apparently did not see the students
who shot her and did not know who they were. ``From what we
understand, Nicole was one of the early victims. Even though she
was badly injured, she was able to sneak out a back door with some
other girls.''

NEW CHIEFS ARE CHOSEN FOR ARMY AND MARINES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton nominated new chiefs for the Army
and Marine Corps on Wednesday, turning to the highest ranking
Japanese-American officer in the Army's history and a close aide of
Secretary of Defense William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   If ratified by the Senate, as expected, Gen. Eric K. Shinseki
will become the Army's 34th chief of staff in June, replacing Gen.
Dennis J. Reimer, who is retiring from the position he has held for
the last four years. Shinseki took over as vice chief in November
after serving two years as the top Army general in Europe and
commander of the NATO peacekeeping force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The nominee to be the 33rd commandant of the Marine Corps is Lt.
Gen. James L. Jones, a three-star officer who was chosen over a
number of prominent four-star candidates within the service. Jones,
who was also nominated to receive his fourth star, has served as
military assistant to the secretary of defense since Cohen took
over in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Both officers are decorated veterans of Vietnam who have
significant experience navigating Pentagon politics in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For the Army, more so than the Marines, the appointment comes at
what many inside and outside the service consider a time of
wrenching change.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the major services, the Army has had the most difficult
transition from a Cold War force ready to defeat the Soviet Union
to the sort of nimble force needed to fight wars like the one under
way in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Shinseki, 56, was born in Hawaii of Japanese ancestry. He is a
graduate of West Point who went on to earn a master's degree in
English at Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   He served two tours in Vietnam as a young officer and was
seriously wounded twice. An armored officer, he rose through the
ranks in a variety of commands and staff assignments, much of the
time in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Shinseki is respected and well regarded within the Army, but his
appointment is disappointing to critics who have said the Army
needs to move more quickly to restructure itself.
</P>
<P>
   He was selected over other candidates who were thought to be
more open to change, including Gen. John N. Abrams, commander of
the Army's Training and Doctrine Command, and Gen. Barry R.
McCaffrey, the nation's drug czar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the `steady as she goes' choice,'' said John Hillen, a
former Army captain and now a senior fellow at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ``He is a superb
warrior, heroic, smart, but his choice shows the Army would rather
not go through the tumult of innovation.''

   Jones, 55, will replace Gen. Charles C. Krulak, an outspoken
commandant who has left a significant mark on the Marine Corps
during his four years in the post. It was Krulak who initiated
changes in Marine basic training _ including the creation of a
grueling 54-hour endurance test called the crucible, which the
other services are emulating.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was born in Missouri, but spent much of his formative
years in France. He returned to study at Georgetown University,
where he studied at the School of Foreign Service and played
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   After a tour in Vietnam, he held commands at Camp Pendleton and
Okinawa. In the early 1980s he served as the Corps' liaison officer
to the Senate, where he befriended Cohen, then a senator from
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   As commander of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, he led the
effort to provide aid to thousands of Kurdish refugees driven into
the hills in northern Iraq in 1992.

BRYANT LIVES FOR SECOND-HALF PRESSURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ A furious comeback, a close score in the waning
minutes, overtime, and a victory on the opponent's home court.
These are a few of Kobe Bryant's favorite things.
</P>
<P>
   When Bryant scored 25 points in the second half and overtime of
Tuesday's victory at Golden State, it was simply the latest display
for the budding superstar. He did it earlier this season with a
33-point second half at Orlando, and he's taken over many a fourth
quarter this year, often on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kobe lives for games like that,'' Los Angeles Lakers coach
Kurt Rambis said. ``He just absolutely lives for games like that.
It's what he dreams of, it's what he thinks of. If I asked Kobe if
he could have games like that every game, he'd say yes....
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to take the last shot, he wants to be in tight
ballgames, he wants to have that pressure on him. To him that's
just fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant had to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What's most amazing about these late-game heroics from Bryant is
how often they come after horrible starts. He had two points and
five turnovers in the first half Tuesday and he and Derek Fisher
were in such a funk that Rambis replaced them with rookies Ruben
Patterson and Tyronn Lue to start the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said he understood the move, but once he returned to the
game, he returned with a vengeance. His 16-point fourth quarter
included a block of John Starks, a key 3-pointer and game-tying
tip-in at the final buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had to be patient. We all had to be patient,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What is it about Bryant and fantastic finishes?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, I don't know. You just get caught up in the
moment, you know what I mean? You definitely want to make the
comeback, because you kind of sense the buzz of the crowd. I heard
one guy say as we were going to the locker room (at halftime),
`Y'all might as well leave the game now.' Stuff like that, that you
can just feel, motivates you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Rick Fox sat out his third straight game Wednesday,
but said his sore right knee is improving daily and he hopes to
play Saturday at San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day it gets 50 percent better,'' he said. ``It's just a
matter of getting the swelling down.''
</P>
<P>
   Real life: Before tipoff, the Trail Blazers held a moment of
silence to honor the victims of Tuesday's shooting in Littleton,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers had been scheduled to play that night in Denver. The
NBA canceled the game and has rescheduled it for May 2.

<P>
   BELGRADE _ At last, NATO has owned up to the Kosovo convoy
massacre _ but grudgingly, without any real expression of sorrow
and with a lot of unanswered questions.
</P>
<P>
   Brigadier General Leaf referred only to ``the accident scene''
while NATO's spokesmen _ asked Monday what he felt on watching
video of a bomb explosion that killed innocent civilians _ replied
with stunning inadequacy: ``I felt a sense that this is
regrettable.''
</P>
<P>
   This hardly matched the human misery and torn corpses we saw on
the road between Prizren and Djakovica last week.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was General Leaf's presentation entirely accurate. Reporters
did not claim refugees had been killed by machine-gun fire, only
that there were signs they may have been straffed by cannon or
machine-gun fire; we were not told if the A-10s _ which carry
cannons and were present at the scene _ opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did we learn where the mysterious ``intelligence
information'' suggesting the refugee convoy was a ``VJ'' (Yugoslav
army) column came from.
</P>
<P>
   From America's new friends in the Kosovo Liberation Army,
perhaps? And why did the later ``intelligence'' _ to the effect
that the Serb military do not usually travel in long convoys _
reach the American F-16s too late to stop the attacks?
</P>
<P>
   Last week, President Clinton told the world only one NATO bomb
was dropped. Monday, we learned that nine GBU-12 500-lb. bombs had
been dropped on the Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
   We also learned that the markings of bomb parts found at the
scene by the ``Independent of London'' corresponded exactly to the
NATO ordnance dropped on April 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible that there were civilian casualties at both
locations,'' General Leaf said, referring to the four attack areas.
``Possible'' was not the word to cover the reality of the burned
skeletons and eviscerated civilians we saw last week.
</P>
<P>
   Were there Serb military vehicles mixed up in the convoy, as
General Leaf suggested? If there were, none were hit _ for the only
wreckage marks on the tarmac were those of tractors and trailers
that still stood on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   I did see Serb special forces and police using civilian cars on
that same highway the following day _ and General Leaf was correct
when he said the Serb military use civilian vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But what does that imply? That NATO can open fire on every milk
float driving through Kosovo?
</P>
<P>
   The general did his best to prove the pilots had ``acted in good
faith.'' He pointed out the horror felt by an F-16 pilot who saw
house-burning on the ground before he attacked.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO pilots are not supposed to drop bombs according to
their emotions _ and the impression General Leaf left behind was of
a gung-ho air force whose intelligence was first wrong and then _
when it was right _ came too late to avoid the slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Despite ``reports'' that survivors claimed they were attacked by
Serb aircraft, the general admitted there was no military
verification of this.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, NATO came clean _ up to a point _ which is something the
Serbs would not have done; and if the purpose of the briefing was
to put the convoy massacre behind it before NATO celebrated its
50th birthday, the tactic was probably successful.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's admissions would have carried more moral weight if
they had included some remorse for the terrible thing that was done
on the road to Prizren last week.
</P>
<P>
   The final message was simple: we did it _ but don't blame us. &QL;

<P>
   After five days of denials and evasions, NATO has finally come
clean and admitted what this newspaper's correspondent, Robert
Fisk, and others have been reporting from the ground: it was Allied
planes that were responsible for the attack on a refugee convoy
southeast of Djakovica last Wednesday, with the loss of up to 80
civilian lives.
</P>
<P>
   NATO still rejects the notion that Allied aircraft could have
been responsible for machine-gunning some of those slaughtered. Its
generals continue to argue that the Serbs may have removed signs of
military vehicles between the time of the attack and the visit of
Western journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Such prevarication is unnecessary, as the admission is belated.
Accidents do happen in the fog of war. The mistaken Djakovica
attacks bears no equivalence to the deliberate massacres that have
been perpetrated by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and its spokesmen should have trusted the public with the
truth from the start.
</P>
<P>
   What is worrying is not so much the incident itself, although
that is tragic enough, but what it tells us of Allied tactics.
</P>
<P>
   The slaughter on the Djakovica road was the result of bombing
from high altitude in a war in which NATO still feels fearful of
engaging the enemy at close quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Although Allied commanders are reluctant to admit it, the
initial month of bombing has damaged Serbian logistics but it has
not taken out President Milosevic's air defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Low-flying aircraft remain vulnerable to his fixed defenses and
to the hand-held rockets that his troops carry. At the same time,
the dispersal of the Serbian paramilitaries in Kosovo makes it
extremely difficult to target them accurately.
</P>
<P>
   That is no counsel of despair, just one of sober realism. Having
entered this war, however ill-prepared, the Allies must win it.
That requires clear-eyed assessment within NATO and honesty to the
public at large. &QL;

   BELGRADE _ It's not every day the wife of the Serbian leader
writes to Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs. Even rarer when she jots a note to the
Foreign Office while the RAF is bombing her country.
</P>
<P>
   But Mira Markovic _ childhood sweetheart and wife of President
Slobodan Milosevic, Belgrade University professor of Marxism, and
Serbian housewife (a very powerful one, it should be added) _ is
very, very angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was with some ten days' delay,'' she wrote in an open
letter to Robin Cook, ``that I learned how you publicly stated that
my children and I are not in Yugoslavia.

<P>
   ``My first reaction at hearing that was surprise. Could it be
that the Foreign Minister of Great Britain has really nothing
better to do than care what my children and I are doing?''
</P>
<P>
   Irony, readers will have noted, is a principal ingredient of
Mrs. Markovic's letter _ she used it to deadly effect in 1995, when
she chastised the would-be defenders of the Serb cause in Bosnia
and Croatia for idling away their hours in Belgrade restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will allow that you may be idle,'' she berates Cook, ``that
you do not have enough state affairs to attend to, and that you
lack family and personal obligations, so that you spend much of
your ample free time caring about other people's private lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Markovic and her two children, Marija and Marko, are very
much in Yugoslavia, she says; the Milosevic family does not own
five villas abroad, as the Foreign Secretary claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia is far too beautiful to waste money on such luxuries
abroad, she claims, even if the President and his wife had the
money to buy them. ``We could hardly afford to, for financial
reasons of course,'' she adds.
</P>
<P>
   By lying about them, Cook ``wanted to send a message to the
world public that my children and I are dishonest and fearful. To
your regret and to our fortune, you will not succeed in your
intentions _ not where my country nor my family are concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia, Mrs. Markovic adds, has become the ``capital of
international resistance'' to world domination.
</P>
<P>
   The full flavor of her text, however, can only be appreciated by
direct quotation. ``My daughter is still an editor of the most
popular youth radio program in Yugoslavia...my son is in uniform
and cares about his small new family. My children have highly
developed patriotic sentiments, they are indeed courageous, rather
smart and extremely beautiful...
</P>
<P>
   ``As for me, every day, I am at the headquarters of the Party of
the Yugoslav Left in which I am very active. The citizens of my
country can watch me on TV news several times a week...
</P>
<P>
   ``My children are I are in our place as all Yugoslavs. The fact
that you think we fled our country reminds me of an old saying
among my people _ a thief thinks that everybody else is a thief.''
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the body-blow for Cook: ``How come you thought we
fled? Perhaps because if a similar situation befell your country,
you and your family would flee _ if you had one, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not commence (this letter) with the customary `dear
sir,' because you are not behaving like one.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's an old saying among British people _ that
hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. But then again, Cook
probably knows that already. &QL;

   BELGRADE _ It's not every day the wife of the Serbian leader
writes to Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs. Even rarer when she jots a note to the
Foreign Office while the RAF is bombing her country.
</P>
<P>
   But Mira Markovic _ childhood sweetheart and wife of President
Slobodan Milosevic, Belgrade University professor of Marxism, and
Serbian housewife (a very powerful one, it should be added) _ is
very, very angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was with some ten days' delay,'' she wrote in an open
letter to Robin Cook, ``that I learned how you publicly stated that
my children and I are not in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction at hearing that was surprise. Could it be

<P>
   Q: WHY IS NATO NOT ARMING THE KLA?:
</P>
<P>
   A: Any formal decision to arm the KLA would have to be
authorized by the United States, which has specifically ruled that
out.
</P>
<P>
   Until it successfully persuaded the KLA to sign the Rambouillet
agreement, Washington regarded the KLA as little more than a
terrorist grouping, too weak and undisciplined to be effective as a
fighting force. Those suspicions persist.
</P>
<P>
   Washington also fears that victory for the KLA would strengthen
Kosovan claims for independence from Serbia, a change of border
that the U.S. fears would lead to a free-for-all in the Balkans and
strongly opposes.
</P>
<P>
   The precedents are not encouraging either. Arming Nicaraguan
guerrillas without Congressional approval got Ronald Reagan into
the biggest trouble of his presidency; the arms supplied to the
Afghan mujahidin following the Soviet invasion have subsequently
been used by the Islamic fundamentalist Taleban and may have
assisted anti-U.S. terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Official denials, however, do not mean that the KLA will get no
U.S.-funded weapons: Washington repeatedly denied that it had
helped arm the Bosnian Muslims, but was forced eventually to admit
that it had.
</P>
<P>
   Q: NATO ESTIMATED MONDAY THAT SOME 3,000 ETHNIC ALBANIANS HAVE
BEEN MURDERED BY THE SERBS SINCE NATO BEGAN BOMBING ON MARCH 24. IS
THIS SORT OF SLAUGHTER UNPRECEDENTED THIS CENTURY?
</P>
<P>
   A: Alas no. In early 1919, as Belgrade reimposed its rule on the
province after the First World War, events were gruesomely similar
to those of today. Villages which resisted were bombarded.
</P>
<P>
   The enemy consisted of rebel bands of ethnic Albanians known as
kacaks (cedilla under `c'), equivalent of the modern Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   In January and February 1919 alone, 6,000 Kosovan Albanians were
killed and 3,850 houses destroyed, according to detailed figures
published later in Italy. &QL;

   SKOPJE, MACEDONIA _ NATO has acquitted itself with honor. Not
through its military efforts or in the political arena _ but
through the alliance's outstanding response to the aid crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Something unique happened last Thursday afternoon at the refugee
camp called Brazda, close to the border of Kosovo and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   It began after lunch with the sound of distant chanting on the
far side of the huge tent village. The cameramen and reporters
hurried in its direction, and around a corner emerged a remarkable
procession.
</P>
<P>
   It was a large crowd of children, several hundred in all, and
growing all the time, shouting, marching and waving placards. The
oldest were young teenagers, the youngest were toddlers, hoisted on
the shoulders of their elder siblings.
</P>
<P>
   The placards were in carefully printed English, the chanted
slogans in Albanian, and they were dominated by one word.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to make out at first, because in Balkan languages,
it is pronounced with a short ``a,'' to rhyme with ``gateau.''
</P>
<P>
   ``NATTO! NATTO!'' shouted the marchers. ``Thank you, NATTO!''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration was not organized by the children, of course _
a small group of frowning adult refugees discreetly marshalled the
youthful crowd, encouraging the tinier among them to hold their
placards aloft so that the photographers could get a better shot.
</P>
<P>
   But the sentiment was certainly genuine. ``Thank you NATO,''
read one of the more unwieldy placards, ``for the friendship that
you have shown Kosovar refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   Had there ever in history, before the war in the Balkans began
last month, been a pro-NATO demonstration?
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Cold War years, as the military bulwark against
the forces of the Warsaw Pact, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization brought a feeling of anxious security to the countries
of the West, but hardly the kind of high emotion which brings
crowds of kiddies out in praise.
</P>
<P>
   In capital cities from Belgrade to London, the noisiest
demonstrators of late have been those excoriating NATO _ for the
muddled planning and rather fruitless execution of its bombing
raids, culminating last Wednesday in the deaths of dozens of
fleeing refugees mistakenly bombed by an American F-16.
</P>
<P>
   But here in the camps, for the first two weeks of this crisis,
NATO has been everything _ the provider of food, water and shelter,
the guarantor of peace and security.
</P>
<P>
   NATO representatives watching the marching kiddies in Brazda
appeared perplexed, almost embarrassed, by the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're, er, delighted of course that they have found what we've
done of value, especially the children,'' said Tim Cross, the
stalwart British brigadier responsible for logistics at the camp.
``Whenever we are asked, we will help.''
</P>
<P>
   Military presence in the camps was being scaled down throughout
last week, as NATO formally handed over their administration to the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
   By this weekend, the intention was that the 12,583 NATO troops
would return to training and preparing for their original task as
the NATO Peace Implementation Force _ the peacekeepers who,
theoretically at least, will one day enter a Kosovo free of Serbian
soldiers to enforce NATO's terms.
</P>
<P>
   But with tens of thousands more refugees expected to make the
crossing into Macedonia in the next few days, the chances are good
that NATO will soon be back building camps, and helping refugees _
the only job, so far, in which it has acquitted itself with honor
fully intact. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 600. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS TO
</ANNOTATION>
1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Apart from being a much-needed public relations coup, at a time
of confusion and embarrassment within the organization, NATO's
transformation into humanitarian savior has implications for all of
the international aid-giving community.
</P>
<P>
   Tracing responsibility for the refugee crisis which has swamped
Macedonia and its neighbor, Albania, in the last three weeks is a
tricky undertaking, but it is certain that Slobodan Milosevic's
ethnic cleansing of Kosovar Albanians would have proceeded at a far
slower pace if NATO had not launched its air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   But having triggered the problem, and having completely failed
to anticipate its scale and speed, NATO did more to alleviate it
than any of the organizations which formally exist to deal with
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's response eclipsed that of the UNHCR, whose reputation as
the world's social security agency remains tarnished by its
handling of the first weeks of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As tens of thousands of Kosovars wallowed in mud for three days
at the Macedonian border earlier this month, the High Commissioner
for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, wrote to the NATO secretary-general,
Javier Solana, to admit that her organization had been
``overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, NATO created a Refugee Support Coordination Center
at its Belgian headquarters in Mons.
</P>
<P>
   As of last Friday, NATO had flown in 4,083 tons of aid to
Macedonia alone, including 1,100 tons of tents.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, this was provided under the supervision of the
UNHCR. But between the elegant Mrs. Ogata and the hulking figure of
the NATO commander in Macedonia, Lieut.-General Mike Jackson, there
is little doubt who commands more authority.
</P>
<P>
   As a military command designed to wage war, NATO has obvious
advantages over the sprawling bureaucracy of the UNHCR and its
auxiliary agencies.
</P>
<P>
   When supplies were being flown into Macedonia, many of those
arriving on commercial aircraft were held up by customs. UNHCR
officials had to bite their lips and wait; NATO officers were able
to avoid the red tape altogether by ordering military transports to
bring the aid direct.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the organization portrays itself as a willing, but
temporary, Good Samaritan with no intention of adopting a permanent
humanitarian role.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, as well, the issue is sensitive: earlier this
month, Russia complained in the United Nations that the UNHCR was
coming under NATO control.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from its humanitarian efforts, the conduct and progress of
the war has so far convinced almost no one. In the Macedonian
capital of Skopje, pro-Serb activists have been handing out
leaflets in which a few extra strokes have converted NATO's
distinctive star into a Nazi swastika.
</P>
<P>
   It will be hard for NATO soldiers to walk away from the relief
and gratitude in the camps, into the hostile, skeptical world
outside. &QL;

   SKOPJE, MACEDONIA _ NATO has acquitted itself with honor. Not
through its military efforts or in the political arena _ but
through the alliance's outstanding response to the aid crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Something unique happened last Thursday afternoon at the refugee
camp called Brazda, close to the border of Kosovo and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   It began after lunch with the sound of distant chanting on the
far side of the huge tent village. The cameramen and reporters
hurried in its direction, and around a corner emerged a remarkable
procession.
</P>
<P>
   It was a large crowd of children, several hundred in all, and
growing all the time, shouting, marching and waving placards. The
oldest were young teenagers, the youngest were toddlers, hoisted on
the shoulders of their elder siblings.
</P>
<P>
   The placards were in carefully printed English, the chanted
slogans in Albanian, and they were dominated by one word.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to make out at first, because in Balkan languages,
it is pronounced with a short ``a,'' to rhyme with ``gateau.''
</P>
<P>
   ``NATTO! NATTO!'' shouted the marchers. ``Thank you, NATTO!''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration was not organized by the children, of course _
a small group of frowning adult refugees discreetly marshalled the
youthful crowd, encouraging the tinier among them to hold their
placards aloft so that the photographers could get a better shot.
</P>
<P>
   But the sentiment was certainly genuine. ``Thank you NATO,''
read one of the more unwieldy placards, ``for the friendship that
you have shown Kosovar refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   Had there ever in history, before the war in the Balkans began
last month, been a pro-NATO demonstration?
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Cold War years, as the military bulwark against
the forces of the Warsaw Pact, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization brought a feeling of anxious security to the countries
of the West, but hardly the kind of high emotion which brings
crowds of kiddies out in praise.
</P>
<P>
   In capital cities from Belgrade to London, the noisiest
demonstrators of late have been those excoriating NATO _ for the
muddled planning and rather fruitless execution of its bombing
raids, culminating last Wednesday in the deaths of dozens of
fleeing refugees mistakenly bombed by an American F-16.
</P>
<P>
   But here in the camps, for the first two weeks of this crisis,
NATO has been everything _ the provider of food, water and shelter,
the guarantor of peace and security.
</P>
<P>
   NATO representatives watching the marching kiddies in Brazda
appeared perplexed, almost embarrassed, by the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're, er, delighted of course that they have found what we've
done of value, especially the children,'' said Tim Cross, the
stalwart British brigadier responsible for logistics at the camp.
``Whenever we are asked, we will help.''
</P>
<P>
   Military presence in the camps was being scaled down throughout
last week, as NATO formally handed over their administration to the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
   By this weekend, the intention was that the 12,583 NATO troops
would return to training and preparing for their original task as
the NATO Peace Implementation Force _ the peacekeepers who,
theoretically at least, will one day enter a Kosovo free of Serbian
soldiers to enforce NATO's terms.
</P>
<P>
   But with tens of thousands more refugees expected to make the
crossing into Macedonia in the next few days, the chances are good
that NATO will soon be back building camps, and helping refugees _
the only job, so far, in which it has acquitted itself with honor
fully intact. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 600. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS TO
</ANNOTATION>
1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Apart from being a much-needed public relations coup, at a time
of confusion and embarrassment within the organization, NATO's
transformation into humanitarian savior has implications for all of
the international aid-giving community.
</P>
<P>
   Tracing responsibility for the refugee crisis which has swamped
Macedonia and its neighbor, Albania, in the last three weeks is a
tricky undertaking, but it is certain that Slobodan Milosevic's
ethnic cleansing of Kosovar Albanians would have proceeded at a far
slower pace if NATO had not launched its air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   But having triggered the problem, and having completely failed
to anticipate its scale and speed, NATO did more to alleviate it
than any of the organizations which formally exist to deal with
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's response eclipsed that of the UNHCR, whose reputation as
the world's social security agency remains tarnished by its
handling of the first weeks of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As tens of thousands of Kosovars wallowed in mud for three days
at the Macedonian border earlier this month, the High Commissioner
for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, wrote to the NATO secretary-general,
Javier Solana, to admit that her organization had been
``overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, NATO created a Refugee Support Coordination Center
at its Belgian headquarters in Mons.
</P>
<P>
   As of last Friday, NATO had flown in 4,083 tons of aid to
Macedonia alone, including 1,100 tons of tents.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, this was provided under the supervision of the
UNHCR. But between the elegant Mrs. Ogata and the hulking figure of
the NATO commander in Macedonia, Lieut.-General Mike Jackson, there
is little doubt who commands more authority.
</P>
<P>
   As a military command designed to wage war, NATO has obvious
advantages over the sprawling bureaucracy of the UNHCR and its
auxiliary agencies.
</P>
<P>
   When supplies were being flown into Macedonia, many of those
arriving on commercial aircraft were held up by customs. UNHCR
officials had to bite their lips and wait; NATO officers were able
to avoid the red tape altogether by ordering military transports to
bring the aid direct.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the organization portrays itself as a willing, but
temporary, Good Samaritan with no intention of adopting a permanent
humanitarian role.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, as well, the issue is sensitive: earlier this
month, Russia complained in the United Nations that the UNHCR was
coming under NATO control.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from its humanitarian efforts, the conduct and progress of
the war has so far convinced almost no one. In the Macedonian
capital of Skopje, pro-Serb activists have been handing out
leaflets in which a few extra strokes have converted NATO's
distinctive star into a Nazi swastika.
</P>
<P>
   It will be hard for NATO soldiers to walk away from the relief
and gratitude in the camps, into the hostile, skeptical world
outside. &QL;

<P>
   NATO's most experienced planners are poring over U.S. Army
textbooks written in the Sixties which analyze Marshal Tito's
tactics against Yugoslavia's occupying Nazi troops during the
Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the rapid revision is simple. Three weeks of
pulverizing bombardment by the West has not broken Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic's resolve, or his army. This may be
because the Serbian ruler of Yugoslavia is using the tactics his
Croatian predecessor employed so successfully five decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tito's partisans used the classic guerrilla warfare methods of
hit-and-run, avoiding large-scale engagements, and hiding troops
and artillery in forests.
</P>
<P>
   Although the land war is yet to start in Kosovo, there are, for
NATO, haunting echoes in the current conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The much-vaunted degrading of Serb forces has been made
difficult by the fact that Milosevic's tanks and heavy guns are
well hidden and thus cannot be hit. While NATO has destroyed around
half of Serbia's MiG 29s most of the rest have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy used by Milosevic and his high command is straight
out of the Tito manual: hang on in the face of overwhelming odds;
never meet the enemy on his own terms; decentralize and disperse
and live to fight another day.
</P>
<P>
   Allied pilots have been surprised by the lack of opposition from
Yugoslavia's integrated air defense system. By staying under cover,
however, it has been saved from destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The Western leaders broke a cardinal rule of warfare by
revealing that there were no immediate plans for a ground war. So
Milosevic was safe to unleash his ferocious campaign in Kosovo,
``cleansing'' the area of much of its Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   James Gow, a Yugoslav military specialist at the Woodrow Wilson
Center in Washington, said: ``It's a kind of ducking and diving.
You can't have a straightforward stand-up fight. They'll always be
looking to do something that shifts the ground, in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   After seeing off Hitler, one of Tito's main preoccupations was
not to be swallowed up by Stalin.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav army's All People's Defense Strategy, seen as a
``system of total defense,'' foresaw command and control being
devolved to the regions, and active involvement of the civilian
population. In the event of an invasion by Soviet and Warsaw Pact
armies, militias would play a full part in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   For this policy to succeed, Marshal Tito and his advisers knew
they would have to rely on the loyalty and fortitude of the
civilian population.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb psyche has always been one of the underdog, unifying
against an outside enemy. Reports from Belgrade suggest that the
population is uniting behind the Milosevic regime in the face of
the NATO pounding.
</P>
<P>
   Anton Bebler, a former Yugoslav navy officer and analyst now
living in Slovenia, says that elements of Tito's ground war plans
have been retained by the present regime and are likely to be put
into practice if the alliance decide on a land incursion.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a crucial difference which will work to the
advantage of the West. The professional officer corps has been hit
by purges by Milosevic and the army is not the same as the one
which was prepared to fight and die for Marshal Tito, socialism and
an united Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Morale has been sapped by the humiliating defeats inflicted in
Slovenia in l991 and Croatia four years later, and by poor
leadership and low pay.
</P>
<P>
   In October Milosevic replaced the head of the state security
service with a crony from the police force. In November he fired
Momcilo Perisic, the experienced chief of staff who had complained
that his soldiers were being used to wage war on civilians in
Bosnia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Bebler says president Milosevic may be in full control of the
armed forces, but at the cost of a less effective force.
</P>
<P>
   Not all those in the army have the appetite for the type of
grisly work Milosevic needed in Bosnia and now Kosovo. He has
relied on the 80,000-strong internal police force (MUP) and
paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Emerson, a security analyst who has studied the conflict,
said: ``These forces may be good at terrorizing civilians and
taking care of the lightly armed KLA (Kosovo Liberation Army) but
one waits to see how they would cope with the highly trained and
professional soldiers NATO will be using if there is a land war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Undoubtedly, Milosevic has gained from the experience of Tito
as the West is finding to its cost,'' Emerson says. ``But will he
have the right calibre of men to see this thing through the way
Tito could perhaps have done?'' &QL;

   PRIZREN, KOSOVO _ The first Kosovo Albanian towns we came to
were so peaceful. There were small mosques gleaming in the morning
sun, farmers tilling with oxen, housewives coming out of a
supermarket, a local bus. Forests stretched down to the roadside.
</P>
<P>
   Was this really the bandit land that Colonel Stojanovic had
warned us about? ``We have just entered the danger zone where we
can be targeted from the air,'' the Yugoslav officer had told us.
``And we shouldn't exclude a possible terrorist attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Then we noticed a group of Serb special police looking upwards
and pointing. A faint puff of white smoke drifted over the fields,
then another. At one point I heard NATO jets racing through the
firmament, though I couldn't see them.
</P>
<P>
   And still we passed those dainty, undamaged homes. There were
Albanians in the streets, hanging out washing on clothes lines,
taking coffee in the shop at the corner.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Kosovo Liberation Army that absorbed the mind of
Colonel Stojanovic and the four Serb cops in the blue and white
police car in front of our bus.
</P>
<P>
   According to Serb officials, the KLA had recently made
incursions from Albania, attacking Serb villages and burning Serb
homes.
</P>
<P>
   The local cops wore colored cloth on their right shoulders, red
in the first towns we passed through, red and pale blue in the
next, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA have stolen so many police uniforms that the Serbs now
have to color code their men to prevent KLA imposters dressed as
policemen driving into town for a shoot-out.
</P>
<P>
   But after an hour's driving, there wasn't much left for the
policemen to patrol. First one Albanian village, then a second
appeared around the hills, a house burned there, a dynamited
shop-front spilling into the road, a mosque with scorch marks at
the top of its minaret.
</P>
<P>
   Then we turned a corner and saw the hills on fire. From forests
and towns more than 10 miles away, smoke streamed into the sky.
Each Albanian village was more damaged than the last, each more
deserted.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at this place was like trying to read a book in a
strange language.
</P>
<P>
   A row of seven brand new homes lay beside a newly ploughed
field, bright red roofs above gleaming balconies. The fourth house
had been burned out; the rest were untouched, ready for proud new
homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   A street of looted shops was followed by farms with women and
children in the yards. Some Albanians worked the fields. I caught
sight of a young boy and a middle-aged man sitting on a farm gate
in the sun. It was a landscape without coherence.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian journalists on the bus beside me chatted among
themselves as this frightening countryside bounced past us.
</P>
<P>
   In valleys far to the north, curtains of smoke streamed upwards
_ there must have been five or six square miles of land ablaze _
while sparkling rivers wound south towards the snow-white mountains
of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Did the Serbian journalists not see the fires and the burned
homes? We passed a newly torched Albanian house blazing away in the
hot sunshine. Still no heads turned.
</P>
<P>
   At the scene of the NATO air strikes which massacred dozens of
Kosovo Albanians last week, two buses passed us, crammed with
Kosovo Albanian women and children, driving at speed through the
dust, frightened faces at the windows.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the Serbian journalists paid no attention. Their interest
was focused on the scene of slaughter and wrecked tractors.
</P>
<P>
   When we stopped for a new police escort, some men beside the bus
were calmly loading a truck with hundreds of bottles of orange
juice from an Albanian warehouse. At one point a police car arrived
and the occupants loaded the trunk with bottles of Coke. It's
thirsty work being a Serbian cop in Kosovo. Especially, it seems,
when the towns are empty.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in our journey, as we drove through Pozeranje, we
suddenly caught sight of a group of 200 exhausted, fearful
Albanians, old men and women holding plastic sacks of clothes. They
must have been waiting for one of those buses heading for the
border.
</P>
<P>
   It was their moment of catastrophe, the hour of leaving their
homes forever. In front of me, a Serb journalist puffed away on his
pipe.
</P>
<P>
   On the high, back road to Prizren, we climbed into the
mountains, and the Serb villages. Some were intact, many others
destroyed, every Serb house systematically set ablaze, the mountain
homes gutted.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA, Madeleine Albright's friends _ the men whose activities
are recorded with approval by NATO press spokesmen in Brussels _
had done this.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs ``ethnically cleansed,'' It makes an odd headline. It has
not been the stuff of newspaper reports. This was very definitely
not CNN country.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is the Kosovo Albanians in their tens of thousands who
remain the far greater victims. It is they who are being
dispossessed on an epic scale.
</P>
<P>
   Further down the road, when we passed another abandoned village
with a single, burning house, I looked at the Serbian journalists
again. Still they surveyed the road with equanimity.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite all of them. In front of me, my wife Lara _ a
correspondent for the Irish Times _ noticed that one Serbian woman
journalist was wiping away a tear. Then the woman began writing a
short letter in the Serbian language in her notebook. She handed it
to Lara.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll find someone to translate this for you,'' it said at
the top, and continued: ``Dear Lara, There are a large number of us
who do not agree that the Kosovo/Metohija problem should be solved
in this way. Where are the people? Why are their houses and cattle
abandoned? Where are the children? Why are they being punished? All
the children in the world are the same, they should be allowed to
play and laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, when will the innocent stop suffering, regardless of
which nation, which religious confession and which race they belong
to?''
</P>
<P>
   In this awful, sinister landscape, it read like the voice of
God. &QL;

   PRIZREN, KOSOVO _ The first Kosovo Albanian towns we came to
were so peaceful. There were small mosques gleaming in the morning
sun, farmers tilling with oxen, housewives coming out of a
supermarket, a local bus. Forests stretched down to the roadside.
</P>
<P>
   Was this really the bandit land that Colonel Stojanovic had
warned us about? ``We have just entered the danger zone where we
can be targeted from the air,'' the Yugoslav officer had told us.
``And we shouldn't exclude a possible terrorist attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Then we noticed a group of Serb special police looking upwards
and pointing. A faint puff of white smoke drifted over the fields,
then another. At one point I heard NATO jets racing through the
firmament, though I couldn't see them.
</P>
<P>
   And still we passed those dainty, undamaged homes. There were
Albanians in the streets, hanging out washing on clothes lines,
taking coffee in the shop at the corner.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Kosovo Liberation Army that absorbed the mind of
Colonel Stojanovic and the four Serb cops in the blue and white
police car in front of our bus.
</P>
<P>
   According to Serb officials, the KLA had recently made
incursions from Albania, attacking Serb villages and burning Serb
homes.
</P>
<P>
   The local cops wore colored cloth on their right shoulders, red
in the first towns we passed through, red and pale blue in the
next, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA have stolen so many police uniforms that the Serbs now
have to color code their men to prevent KLA imposters dressed as
policemen driving into town for a shoot-out.
</P>
<P>
   But after an hour's driving, there wasn't much left for the
policemen to patrol. First one Albanian village, then a second
appeared around the hills, a house burned there, a dynamited
shop-front spilling into the road, a mosque with scorch marks at
the top of its minaret.
</P>
<P>
   Then we turned a corner and saw the hills on fire. From forests
and towns more than 10 miles away, smoke streamed into the sky.
Each Albanian village was more damaged than the last, each more
deserted.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at this place was like trying to read a book in a
strange language.
</P>
<P>
   A row of seven brand new homes lay beside a newly ploughed
field, bright red roofs above gleaming balconies. The fourth house
had been burned out; the rest were untouched, ready for proud new
homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   A street of looted shops was followed by farms with women and
children in the yards. Some Albanians worked the fields. I caught
sight of a young boy and a middle-aged man sitting on a farm gate
in the sun. It was a landscape without coherence.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian journalists on the bus beside me chatted among
themselves as this frightening countryside bounced past us.
</P>
<P>
   In valleys far to the north, curtains of smoke streamed upwards
_ there must have been five or six square miles of land ablaze _
while sparkling rivers wound south towards the snow-white mountains
of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Did the Serbian journalists not see the fires and the burned

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The cherry and almond trees are in full bloom; the
lawns are freshly mown; the flower beds are ablaze with color and
the streets swept spotless.
</P>
<P>
   Arrayed in its springtime best, Washington is engrossed in final
preparations for its last big show before the Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   This coming weekend, the city that styles itself the capital of
the free world will host its largest diplomatic summit ever: the
50th birthday party of t`e North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO).
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,500 delegates and 3,000 reporters are expected in
town on Friday, and that means gridlock on the grand scale. ``Think
flags. Think motorccdes. Think tight security and traffic
detours,'' warned the Washington Post. But traffic is now the least
of this city's worries.
</P>
<P>
   This party of parties was planned to celebrate ``the most
successful military alliance in history.''
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of post-Cold-War harmony, it was conceived as a
gigantic peace-fest in which everyone could join, even erstwhile
enemies like Russia. Every martial symbol was to be muted and shorn
of menace.
</P>
<P>
   With the first NATO missiles fired on Serbia, that spirit
evaporated. For the first time since its formation, NATO was at
war, and it will probably still be at war in four days' time, when
the Air Force Ones of 43 countries disgorge their delegates in the
Washington suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the war is not going as smoothdy as a late 20th century
high-tech war should: it is messy and risks becoming still messier.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to be quick, easy or neat,'' warned U.S.
Defense Secretary William Cohen last week; casualties are ``a
probability.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it has to be won, for the credibility of the alliance is now
on the line. If its 19 members, led by the sole remaining
suxerpower, cannot impose their will on the recalcitrant rump of
Yugoslavia, what price NATO's survival?
</P>
<P>
   It could so easily have been otherwise. If Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic had signed the Rambouillet accord or capitulated
after a short, sharp dose of air strikes, peace through strength
backed by force could have been maintained.
</P>
<P>
   At a stroke of Milosevic's pen, NATO would have been vindicated;
the fanfares could sound and the party begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a test of the NATO of the 21st century,'' said U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright when the war was hardly one
week old. She meant it optimistically.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with more than a million people displaced _ the very people
that alliance force was supposed to protect _ several fatal errant
strikes by NATO planes, and the stability of neighboring states in
question, celebration looks inappropriate, if not downright
perverse.
</P>
<P>
   Can NATO really feast, as its forces fight and Kosovo starves?
</P>
<P>
   The organizers are now scrambling to recast an exultant festival
of peace as a low-key council of war.
</P>
<P>
   The fly-past has been cancelled. The champagne banquet at the
White House will be a working dinner; the ``black-tie'' instruction
has been replaced by ``lounge suits.'' The commemorative stamps due
to be issued by the U.S* Post Office have been put on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Absences, though, are harder to disguise. The celebrations had
been stage-managed to ensure that Russia and its former satellites
would feel welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The watchwords were ``partnership'' and ``inclusion.'' There was
to be no hint that the Cold War had a winner, and that winner was
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland were quietly
received into the alliance in advance, at a quiet ceremony two
hours' flying time from Washington. The venue, President Harry
Truman's memorial library at Independence, in Missouri, was so
fitting, but oh so discreet.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest diplomatic achievement of Bill Clinton's
presidency _ the return of Central Europe to the West _ took place
without him.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was to be an honored guest _ perhaps the most honored
guest _ at NATO's party, its presence the embodiment of President
Clinton's oft-chanted ideal of ``One Europe, whole and free.''
</P>
<P>
   The hope that a tamed Russia would be the central symbol of a
new post-Cold War Europe, however, was dashed to smithereens when
the first bombs fell. Russia's special relationship with the Serbs
precluded it.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who was on his way to
Washington for his twice-yearly talks with Vice-President Al Gore,
turned his plane around mid-Atlantic and went back to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, Russia changed its mind about its invitation to
NATO's party. Whether Russia or NATO is the bigger loser may be
disputed, but the ``One Europe'' image so craved by Washington has
been lost.
</P>
<P>
   Stoically, the Americans insist that the show will go on. But as
refugees continue to flee and the bombs continue to fall, even a
subdued summit no longer seems such a good idea. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 825) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, however, the preparations have long gained a
momentum of their own. The White House wants to demonstrate that
Democrats, too, can put on a real show _ and, as a bonus, launch
Vice-President Gore into the global big time.
</P>
<P>
   The city's new mayor, Anthony Williams, has a Stakhanovite
program in train to spruce up civic buildings, relay pavements and
resurface roads. Booked to capacity, the city's premier hotels aze
all double-checking their security routines.
</P>
<P>
   Those with perhaps the biggest stake, though, are the commercial
rponsors. This being the United States, a dozen companies have paid
$250,000 each for a place on the ``host committee,'' with
guaranteed places at the top tables for their executives,
exhibition space for their promotions and the chance to court new
customers over cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   With the likes of Ford, General Motors, Eastman Kodak and
Nextel, not to mention the missile producer, Raytheon, holding
tickets, it would be a brave president indeed who called the whole
party off. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that nothing is being done. Behind the
scenes, this juggernaut of a multinational get-together is being
slowly cranked around.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda, that has been essentially fixed for months, is
undergoing a total rewrite. The focus could be on the German peace
plan, or the French-inspired ``stability plan'' for southeast
Europe, or just on ``How do we get out of this mess?''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, ethereal discussions of NATO's ``Strategic
Concept'' _ its much-vaunted (and much-contested) security
blueprint for global peace in the next century _ are being
relegated to the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just that the real engagement over Kosovo is so much
more urgent than doctrine and theory, it is that Kosovo has
answered two of the points most at issue inside the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Should NATO action require a U.N. mandate? Kosovo did not
receive one. Should NATO act outside its national boundaries? It
just has. Will it act in future outside the North Atlantic area? It
must hope for the time being that the question does not arise: the
alliance has its work cut out as it is.
</P>
<P>
   As representatives of 43 countries prepare to meet in Washington
this week, NATO's immediate priorities are to keep the alliance
together and prevent the century ending as it began, with war in
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   To NATO at 50: Many happy returns. &QL;

   Can NATO really feast, as its forces fight and Kosovo starves?
</P>
<P>
   The organizers are now scrambling to recast an exultant festival
of peace as a low-key council of war.
</P>
<P>
   The fly-past has been cancelled. The champagne banquet at the
White House will be a working dinner; the ``black-tie'' instruction
has been replaced by ``lounge suits.'' The commemorative stamps due
to be issued by the U.S. Post Office have been put on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Absences, though, are harder to disguise. The celebrations had
been stage-managed to ensure that Russia and its former satellites
would feel welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The watchwords were ``partnership'' and ``inclusion.'' There was
to be no hint that the Cold War had a winner, and that winner was
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland were quietly
received into the alliance in advance, at a quiet ceremony two
hours' flying time from Washington. The venue, President Harry
Truman's memorial library at Independence, in Missouri, was so
fitting, but oh so discreet.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest diplomatic achievement of Bill Clinton's
presidency _ the return of Central Europe to the West _ took place
without him.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was to be an honored guest _ perhaps the most honored
guest _ at NATO's party, its presence the embodiment of President
Clinton's oft-chanted ideal of ``One Europe, whole and free.''
</P>
<P>
   The hope that a tamed Russia would be the central symbol of a
new post-Cold War Europe, however, was dashed to smithereens when
the first bombs fell. Russia's special relationship with the Serbs
precluded it.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who was on his way to
Washington for his twice-yearly talks with Vice-President Al Gore,
turned his plane around mid-Atlantic and went back to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, Russia changed its mind about its invitation to
NATO's party. Whether Russia or NATO is the bigger loser may be
disputed, but the ``One Europe'' image so craved by Washington has
been lost.
</P>
<P>
   Stoically, the Americans insist that the show will go on. But as
refugees continue to flee and the bombs continue to fall, even a
subdued summit no longer seems such a good idea. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 825) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, however, the preparations have long gained a
momentum of their own. The White House wants to demonstrate that
Democrats, too, can put on a real show _ and, as a bonus, launch
Vice-President Gore into the global big time.
</P>
<P>
   The city's new mayor, Anthony Williams, has a Stakhanovite
program in train to spruce up civic buildings, relay pavements and
resurface roads. Booked to capacity, the city's premier hotels are
all double-checking their security routines.
</P>
<P>
   Those with perhaps the biggest stake, though, are the commercial
sponsors. This being the United States, a dozen companies have paid
$250,000 each for a place on the ``host committee,'' with
guaranteed places at the top tables for their executives,
exhibition space for their promotions and the chance to court new
customers over cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   With the likes of Ford, General Motors, Eastman Kodak and
Nextel, not to mention the missile producer, Raytheon, holding
tickets, it would be a brave president indeed who called the whole
party off. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that nothing is being done. Behind the
scenes, this juggernaut of a multinational get-together is being
slowly cranked around.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda, that has been essentially fixed for months, is
undergoing a total rewrite. The focus could be on the German peace
plan, or the French-inspired ``stability plan'' for southeast
Europe, or just on ``How do we get out of this mess?''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, ethereal discussions of NATO's ``Strategic
Concept'' _ its much-vaunted (and much-contested) security
blueprint for global peace in the next century _ are being
relegated to the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just that the real engagement over Kosovo is so much
more urgent than doctrine and theory, it is that Kosovo has
answered two of the points most at issue inside the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Should NATO action require a U.N. mandate? Kosovo did not
receive one. Should NATO act outside its national boundaries? It
just has. Will it act in future outside the North Atlantic area? It
must hope for the time being that the question does not arise: the
alliance has its work cut out as it is.
</P>
<P>
   As representatives of 43 countries prepare to meet in Washington
this week, NATO's immediate priorities are to keep the alliance
together and prevent the century ending as it began, with war in
the Balkans.

STARWOOD HOTELS PRESIDENT RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Nanula, president and chief operating officer of
Starwood Hotels and Resorts Inc., resigned Wednesday, just over a
year after he was chosen by his friend, Barry Sternlicht,
Starwood's chairman and chief executive, to help run the world's
largest hotel company.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued after the close of financial markets,
Sternlicht said Starwood's evolution since Nanula arrived at the
company _ principally, the decision to sell its gaming operations,
which Nanula has been running _ led the executives to conclude
``our interests were best served by pursuing our careers
separately.''
</P>
<P>
   However, rumors of a rift between the two men, who first met
when they were classmates at the Harvard Business School, have been
circulating for months.
</P>
<P>
   According to most accounts, the backbiting began last August,
following the publication of a profile in The New York Times that
described Nanula (pronounced na-NOO-lah) as the man who would make
Sternlicht's operations work well.
</P>
<P>
   The article appeared only weeks after Nanula had arrived at
Starwood from Walt Disney Co., where he had been a highly regarded
senior executive vice president and its chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   When Nanula was hired by Starwood last April, Sternlicht
admitted that ``for his own sanity'' his knowledge of and
friendship with Nanula ``was a plus.''
</P>
<P>
   But The Times article did not sit at all well with Sternlicht,
who is as mercurial as Nanula is unflappable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Times piece created internal problems,'' Jim Gallagher, a
Starwood spokesman, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry and Richard realized that friendship and business has
its own set of complexities,'' Gallagher said. ``They continue to
be friends, have parted amicably and Richard did make contributions
to the company.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties, which most described as a clash of egos
between the two, were severe _ and surfaced fast.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to help resolve the problems, last fall Sternlicht
brought in Michael Feiner, an organizational consultant, to work
with the two men. According to an article in the May 10 issue of
Fortune magazine that details the problems, Starwood employees
nicknamed Feiner ``the marriage counselor.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Sternlicht nor Nanula, who are both 38, were available
for comment Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the Starwood statement, Nanula called Starwood ``a truly
great company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have all the confidence in the world that it will continue
to thrive under Barry's leadership with the support of his talented
management team,'' Nanula added.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Nanula, who asked not to be identified, said he
decided to resign about a week or 10 days ago. That is about the
same time that Starwood said it intended to put its Caesars casino
unit up for sale. It was not clear Wednesday if the Fortune article
also played a role in the timing of the resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard thinks Barry is a brilliant guy, but it became
apparent they were both strong-willed individuals, and that it was
impossible to have two captains running one ship,'' said one person
close to Nanula, who asked not to be identified. ``It was a noble
experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   Securities analysts said Nanula's resignation was not likely to
have a material effect on Starwood's operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hire was extremely unique,'' said Jonathan Litt, an
analyst at Paine Webber. ``I am not saying that Sternlicht is easy
to work with, but the saving grace here is that Starwood has a very
deep bench. I don't think this is going to be a big issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Starwood said it had no immediate plans to seek a replacement
for Nanula. Juergen Bartels and Peter Boynton, chief executives of
Starwood's Hotel Group and Gaming Group, respectively, will now
report directly to Sternlicht. Previously, they had reported to
Nanula.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher declined to discuss the terms of Nanula's severance
package. But when Nanula signed up, his compensation agreement
included 3 million Starwood options. At least some of those options
recently vested at $24 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Like many hotel companies, for much of the last year Starwood's
stock has fared poorly. When Nanula's appointment was announced on
April 15, 1998, Starwood's stock traded at an intraday high of $53.
The stock closed at $32 Wednesday, down $2 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Nanula, who last month moved into a $6 million house he bought
in Greenwich, Conn., last September but spent months renovating, is
not likely to be out of work for long.
</P>
<P>
   But while he was highly regarded at Disney and reportedly
reluctantly left his native California, people close to him said it
was unlikely he would return to the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he is going to close any doors, but I think he
views that as something that is in the past,'' the source close to
Nanula said.
</P>
<P>
   Since neither Sternlicht nor Nanula were available to discuss
the resignation, it is not known how their final, corporate
conversation went.
</P>
<P>
   But the topic has come up in the past, albeit in a different
context.
</P>
<P>
   For years Nanula has offered advice to Sternlicht on a wide
variety of issues, including the dismissal of executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not good at firing people,'' Sternlicht told The Times
last August. ``When I had to let somebody go, Richard and I would
rehearse what I was going to say.''

CLEMENS SILENCES BOOS AS HE EXTENDS HIS WIN STREAK 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Roger Clemens heard the boos in the first inning and
again in the fourth Wednesday night. They were scattered and lasted
only a few seconds, but the fans berated Clemens because he was not
throwing strikes consistently and because he allowed a home run to
Todd Zeile. Clemens expects a lot from himself, and New York fans
obviously expect a lot from him.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Clemens was repeatedly serenaded by the fans as well.
Especially after the right-hander helped the New York Yankees quiet
the Texas Rangers, 4-2, and inflate his two-season streak to 17
straight victories, matching the American League record shared by
Baltimore's Dave McNally (1968-69) and Cleveland's Johnny Allen
(1936-37).
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I've been fortunate to win that many games and
have that type of record,'' Clemens said. ``I don't bask in it.
I'll look back on it over the winter when I see all the hard work
is worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens was more bullish than dominant Wednesday night, but it
was enough because he limited the Rangers to no hits in 14 at-bats
with runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the end, Clemens gave the fickle fans and the revived
Yankees exactly what they wanted: another businesslike victory.
Clemens stretched himself into the eighth inning, permitting just
one earned run and four hits.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter's two-run homer, which sneaked inside the
right-field pole, keyed a pivotal three-run fifth inning off Rick
Helling that framed the Yankees' seventh victory in eight home
games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Clemens has given up as many homers in his last two
starts as he allowed in the last three months of last season, he
has kept his record unblemished and is seven consecutive victories
from Carl Hubbell's major league mark of 24, set with the New York
Giants in 1936-37. Clemens' streak seemed difficult to fathom even
for the Yankees' interim manager, Don Zimmer, who has been in
baseball for 51 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say,'' Zimmer said slowly, ``it's one heck of a
streak.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens has not lost since Cleveland beat him by 7-3 last May
29, and while he has endured nine no-decisions since then, he has
allowed more than four earned runs in a game only once, in his last
start against Baltimore (seven runs and 11 hits).
</P>
<P>
   He actually has a 4.47 earned run average in his no-decisions,
which is rather high for the five-time Cy Young award winner, but
it is not brutal.
</P>
<P>
   With Clemens and the Yankees trailing, 2-1, in the fifth, Chuck
Knoblauch looped a one-out single to center off Helling and scooted
to second on a wild pitch. Helling tried to place a 2-1 fastball on
the outside corner, and Jeter smacked the ball into the right-field
corner for his fifth homer of the season. It drifted toward the
foul pole, but was fair by about 10 feet to put the Yanks in front,
3-2. A walk, a single and Tino Martinez's forceout fetched the
fourth run.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had base runners in seven of the eight innings that
Clemens pitched, but he stifled them on no hits with men on base.
He struck out Mark McLemore with a runner on second to finish the
seventh and whiffed Juan Gonzalez with a man on first in the eighth
to complete his night in style.
</P>
<P>
   A weary Clemens, who had his hands on his knees, was replaced by
Mike Stanton and was treated like a rock star by the fans as he
ambled to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   When Zeile blasted Clemens' 1-1 fastball over the right-field
fence to give the Rangers a 2-1 lead in the fourth, the fans booed
as Clemens asked for a new baseball. It was the fourth homer
Clemens had allowed in his last seven innings; he gave up just four
homers in his final 123 innings of 1998, spanning three months.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Clemens had difficulty during a 25-pitch first
inning in which he walked three of the first five batters. The
leadoff man, Tom Goodwin, walked, stole second and then third as
Joe Girardi's hurried throw went about six feet to the right of the
bag at third. Luis Sojo dived for it, but it bounced past him for a
throwing error and Goodwin glided home with Texas' first run in 23
innings against the Yankees, including the playoffs last year.
</P>
<P>
   Chili Davis slapped Helling's first pitch into the right-field
bleachers in the second to tie the score, 1-1, to give him four
homers and 11 runs batted in. That is more than the three homers
and the nine RBI he mustered in 35 games during an injury-scarred
1998.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a new year, even if it appears to be old hat for
Clemens, who refuses to lose.

CLEMENS TIES AL RECORD, DEFEATS RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Texas Rangers owner Tom Hicks suggested fear as the
Yankees' motivation for acquiring five-time Cy Young Award
recipient Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Yankees made a sideways move,'' Hicks said in
February, ``because they're scared of the Texas Rangers.''
</P>
<P>
   Why would the defending World Series champions fear the Rangers?
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' 4-2 defeat Wednesday night marked their fourth
consecutive loss and seventh during their past eight games against
the Yankees since Aug. 16. That includes the Yankees' three-game
sweep during the 1998 American League Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a broken record,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates
said. ``Our ballclub plays well, but it seems like we're always one
pitch or one hit away from winning a lot of these ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   The clutch hit eluded the Rangers Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, whom the Yankees acquired two months ago from Toronto
for left-handers David Wells and Graeme Lloyd and second baseman
Homer Bush, stranded three runners in scoring position during the
first three innings and went on to match an American League record.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens (2-0) surrendered only two runs (one earned) on four
hits and four walks and recorded six strikeouts in 7 1/3 innings.
That gave Clemens his 17th consecutive victory, which matched the
record shared by Baltimore's Dave McNally and Cleveland's Johnny
Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens will attempt to break the record next week against the
Rangers in his next scheduled start. Carl Hubbell of the New York
Giants set the major-league record of 24 in 1936-37.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers attacked Clemens' only apparent weakness _ his
inability to hold base runners well _ from the start. Opponents
stole 28 bases during 37 attempts against Clemens during 1998, and
the Rangers gambled with success on four occasions with center
fielder Tom Goodwin and second baseman Mark McLemore aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin drew a first-inning, leadoff walk _ one of three Clemens
issued during the first inning _ and stole second and third base
with left fielder Rusty Greer at the plate. Yankees catcher Joe
Girardi unleashed an errant throw on the steal of third, which
allowed Goodwin to score with the game's first run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger struggled with his command early, and we ran ourselves
into a run there,'' Oates said, ``but we couldn't get that one hit
to get us started.''
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Todd Zeile produced the Rangers' other run with a
fourth-inning home run that gave the Rangers a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Rick Helling, though, could not protect it.
</P>
<P>
   Helling, who allowed only one run on two hits through 4 1/3
innings, surrendered a one-out single to second baseman Chuck
Knoblauch. The Rangers trailed for the first time after shortstop
Derek Jeter's two-run, opposite-field home run during the next
at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Helling (0-3) did not retire another batter. Right fielder Paul
O'Neill walked and advanced to third on the ensuing single by
center fielder Bernie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   That brought up first baseman Tino Martinez, who entered the
game 3-for-9 with two walks and two home runs during his career
against Helling.
</P>
<P>
   Oates summoned left-hander Mike Munoz from the bullpen for
Martinez, a left-handed hitter who entered the at-bat 0-for-5
during his career against the Rangers' left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the move to make there,'' Oates said. ``You've got a
left-hander to face the left-hander. (Rick) had four consecutive
hitters reach, and he's thrown 100 pitches. It's time to make the
move, and our bullpen did a super job again tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Munoz induced the desired ground ball, but Martinez did not hit
the ball hard enough for the Rangers to turn an inning-ending,
4-6-3 double play. Williams' slide into second base also prevented
shortstop Royce Clayton from making a strong throw to first base,
and O'Neill scored from third with the game's final run on a
fielder's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Helling, though, did not appear pleased by being removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't happy with what happened, but Johnny makes those
decisions,'' Helling said. ``I don't ever question those decisions.
That's his job. I don't know what to say, but I don't think I
pitched that poorly tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Was Helling surprised to see Oates emerge from the dugout?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing surprises me anymore,'' Helling said. ``We haven't
pitched well as a rotation, and I'm sure he's losing his patience
with some of us.'' nn

U.S. TO KEEP SMALLPOX SAMPLE, CLINTON AIDES SAY
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By JUDITH MILLER and WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Defying international pleas, President Clinton has decided to
retain America's sample of smallpox virus, administration officials
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which is to be announced Thursday, is certain to
be fiercely debated within the scientific community and criticized
by the scores of nations that recommended in 1996 at a World Health
Organization meeting that the world's remaining smallpox stocks be
destroyed now that the disease has been eradicated around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The issue deeply divided the administration, which debated it
for months, seeking outside scientific guidance from numerous
sources. Initially, arms control advocates and some senior health
officials within the administration argued that the virus should be
destroyed this year as planned. But Defense and State Department
officials argued for retaining the stocks on grounds that there may
already be clandestine supplies of the virus around the world, in
North Korea, for instance, that could be used against America in
war or terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, the only other nation known to retain smallpox stocks,
has opposed their destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The president acted after an independent scientific panel
created by the Institute of Medicine, a branch of the National
Academy of Sciences, concluded in March that preserving the last
known samples in Russia and the United States could provide
important scientific and medical opportunities that would be lost
if the virus were destroyed. While the panel's 100-page report did
not express an opinion on whether the stocks should be destroyed,
its conclusion that retention had important scientific and medical
potential affected Clinton's thinking about the issue,
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Informed of the decision, some leading experts promptly
condemned it as dangerously short-sighted. ``I find it very
regrettable,'' said Donald Henderson, a former White House science
adviser who led the campaign to destroy the virus sample. ``Of all
the potential organisms that might be used in bioterrorism, this is
probably the most formidable, and I think we should do everything
we possibly can to mitigate against the risk of that virus being
released at any time in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, who is dean emeritus of the Johns Hopkins School of
Public Health, warned that the United States would become a
``pariah'' when the World Health Assembly, the governing body of
the World Health Organization, meets in May to take up the issue of
the virus' destruction.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll within the organization, he added, 74 of 79 countries
said the virus should be destroyed. Four, including the United
States, were uncertain, and at the time only Russia favored its
preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in January that this was an exceptionally difficult
issue, laden with foreign policy and scientific implications. ``We
said in 1996 that we would destroy it,'' the president said of the
virus stocks. But, he added, he wanted to be sure that destroying
the virus would not make it more difficult for the United States to
develop antidotes and new vaccines that would protect Americans and
``frankly the rest of the world,'' if there were a recurrence of
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would rely heavily on guidance provided by the
Institute of Medicine in formulating his administration's position.
He said his major concern was that the United States should have
``whatever it takes to buy us a response'' to fight a potential
outbreak of smallpox, which was responsible for the deaths of
millions of people over centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the sole known collections of live virus are kept by
the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta
and the State Research of Virology and Biotechnology, known as
VECTOR, a leading Russian research institute in Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   But many American experts fear that rogue states or terrorist
groups may have secured samples. There have been intelligence
reports, for example, that North Korea may have a stockpile of the
virus, possibly for use in biological warfare. Some experts have
speculated that a North Korean long-range missile fired in war
would more likely carry germs than nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Germs such as smallpox can be far more deadly than a nuclear
weapon, these experts say, because most people are no longer
vaccinated and hence have lost their immunity to the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Smallpox is highly contagious and there is very little vaccine
stockpiled either in the United States or globally.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said that the president had
decided to retain the virus stocks ``in order to allow time to look
at antiviral agents and vaccines.'' Asked whether the White House
was concerned about objections to the decision, the official said:
``We need to prepare for weapons of mass destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of retaining the stocks also pointed out that the
vaccine available today could not be administered to people with
HIV and others with immune deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of all this, he made the right decision,'' said
another administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity
about the president's choice. ``To do anything else would have been
irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview late last year in Moscow, the VECTOR director,
Lev Sandakhchiev, denied that Russia had given samples to nations
like North Korea, as some conservatives have charged.
</P>
<P>
   But he passionately argued against destroying the virus,
stating, as he has in scientific papers, that infectious diseases
like smallpox cannot ever be considered completely eradicated.

CARBONNEAU HITS NET WHEN IT'S NEEDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAULA CABALLERO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Dallas Stars center Guy Carbonneau always expects he
could be the man in a tight playoff game. That's what keeps his
39-year-old bones energized at this time of season.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, he was the game breaker _ as he has been in six
previous playoff games _ when he scored the game-winner as the
Stars defeated Edmonton, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   With his goal, a forehand wrister off a drop pass from winger
Dave Reid, Carbonneau stands atop the Stars' list of playoff
difference makers, with seven game-winning goals.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the fan with the ``What a Guy'' sign said it best.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got guys like (Mike) Modano and (Joe) Nieuwendyk, and
they've got guys like (Doug) Weight and (Ryan) Smyth, and they're
expected to score,'' Carbonneau said. ``But those guys get checked
so tightly that someone else has to do the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, it was me. Next game, hopefully it will be someone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars needed Carbonneau's veteran leadership Wednesday
night. The Stars outshot the Oilers, 31-13. Nieuwendyk and Brett
Hull had four shots each on Edmonton goalie Tommy Salo, but the
puck wouldn't cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Modano even skated behind Salo through the crease with the puck
and was unable to bury it.
</P>
<P>
   It was the old-timer who solved Salo when it meant the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's proven that he's a winner,'' Edmonton captain Kelly
Buchberger said of Carbonneau. ``I don't know exactly how many
rings he has, but he's proven he can deliver in pressure
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau has two Stanley Cup rings, and if he continues to
make the opposition look bad this year, he might make it three.

YOSHII BLOWS 4-0 LEAD AS METS LOSE TO REDS, 7-4 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ The New York Mets were so convinced that Masato
Yoshii was the weak link in their pitching staff during spring
training that they were desperately trying to trade him.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii's performance Wednesday night might persuade the Mets to
resume their efforts. Staked to an early 4-0 lead the day after his
34th birthday, Yoshii did not survive the fourth inning, allowing
six runs on six hits in three-and-two-thirds innings in a 7-4 loss
to the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Through his first three starts this season, Yoshii (1-2) has
allowed 13 runs and 19 hits in 15 2/3 innings. Wednesday night, the
Japanese right-hander seemed unnerved by a two-run home run by Greg
Vaughn. Yoshii walked the next three batters, and all three runners
came around to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those three walks were fatal,'' Yoshii said after the game
through his interpreter. So was Mike Cameron's two-run, two-out
ground-rule double to right. Bobby Bonilla, hobbled by the brace on
his right knee, could not run it down, and it gave the Reds a 5-4
edge.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii's earned run average is now a jumbo 7.47 and the Mets
(9-6) have now dropped four of their last six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a few good innings,'' manager Bobby Valentine said of
his starter, adding that Yoshii will take his next scheduled turn.
``He just lost the strike zone there for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   And it cost the Mets a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla _ who felt a twinge in his knee making a tumbling catch
in the ninth _ had drilled his second home run in two days, a
two-run shot in the first, and Todd Pratt belted a solo shot in the
second. Roger Cedeno doubled to lead off the third before scoring
on a groundout, as Denny Neagle lasted just four innings in his
first Cincinnati start.
</P>
<P>
   But those were the only three hits the Mets could muster, and
Yoshii could not hold down the struggling Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was batting just .186 before the game, which might have
been one reason he was talking to a pair of bats in front of his
locker Wednesday afternoon as he attempted to decide which one to
use against Yoshii.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just an adjustment period anytime you go somewhere
new,'' said Vaughn, who struggled when he was traded from Milwaukee
to San Diego in 1996. ``But I'm not going to have that type of year
this year, I'll tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn hit just .216 for the Padres with 18 homers in 1997, his
first full season with the team. Then last season, Vaughn hit .272
and belted 50 home runs. Through his first 12 games with the Reds
this season, however, Vaughn had just two homers.
</P>
<P>
   But Vaughn _ who has been hampered since spring training by a
strawberry-size blister on the palm of his left hand _ was also
aware that Yoshii has a penchant for allowing home runs. Yoshii
surrendered 22 in 29 starts last season, and two in his first two
starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   And Vaughn said he had hit his share of homers here when he was
with the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have some this year, too,'' Vaughn said before
the game. ``I might even have some tonight if he gets the ball
up.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what Yoshii did with Sean Casey standing on first
base in the fourth inning after Casey's second single of the game.
Vaughn made contact with an inside sinker that did not sink.
</P>
<P>
   And when the ball soared over the left-field fence for Vaughn's
third homer of the year, the four-run lead was 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   But afterward Vaughn was still upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should be happy,'' said Vaughn, who had keyed the winning
rally. ``But I'm still battling on every at-bat. It shouldn't be
that tough.''
</P>
<P>
   At least, it was pointed out, he had picked out the right bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I think I used Dmitri Young's bat,'' Vaughn said.
``My bats weren't listening too good.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ On days when the sun looks kindly on it,
People's Park can seem like a quaint little town.
</P>
<P>
   The people who live nowhere in particular picnic on the east
end, on benches in a grove. A smattering of bodies flop on the
uncombed lawn. Community gardeners tend their patches on the west
end, and the few nearby drug addicts are camouflaged by shrubs,
easily overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   So it was the other day, when the sky was as bright as July,
blurring the park's rough edges.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers rebuilding the Free Speech stage near the
free-clothes box and others painting the finishing touches on a
banner for the park's 30th anniversary celebration, to be held this
Sunday, simply could not believe that anyone would want to change a
thing about this vestige of the '60s protest movement, possibly the
most famous 2.8 acres of scruffy grass in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``One man was killed defending this park, and another was
blinded,'' said Terri Compost, a member of the People's Park
Community Advisory Board, as she watched the progress on the
anniversary banner. ``People have been defending the park from
development as a haven, a kind of paradise for all kinds of people,
for 30 years. It's amazing what some people are saying about it
now. None of it is true.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is that a great many people avoid People's Park. In
a sure sign of the widespread distaste for the place, even in a
city that proudly retains its liberal reputation, a local columnist
recently suggested that the park would make a better strip mall or
parking garage. And on an afternoon made for worshiping the sun,
University of California students, on a campus of 31,000 two blocks
away, were strangely absent. So, too, were parents pushing
strollers, school children on bikes and old people out for air.
</P>
<P>
   No one denies the park's symbolic power. Born when a diverse
group of residents and students decided in April 1969 to plant sod,
flowers and playground equipment on an unused lot owned by the
university, People's Park received its bloody christening a month
later, when the university decided to take back its land in one of
the most infamous domestic clashes of the Vietnam era.
</P>
<P>
   So many different types of people protested the official
over-reaction to the park _ 30,000 people (in a city of 100,000)
marched to protest Gov. Ronald Reagan's order to send in 2,000
National Guard troops with rifles, hoses and tear gas _ that
People's Park became a worldwide symbol of the power of community.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1972, when activists tore down the chain-link fence the
university had erected around it, People's Park has become the
refuge for a cadre of fringe characters. Drug dealers and users,
has-been hippies and would-be hippies, panhandlers on break and
several societies of homeless people dug in their heels. Just about
everyone else scattered to a more congenial park two blocks away,
or to the cafes around the corner, or the campus plazas. In short,
anywhere but here.
</P>
<P>
   The city's mayor, Shirley Dean, has heard the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``The official policy of the city,'' Mayor Dean said, ``is that
People's Park should be like any other park in the city _ that is,
it should be a park where everyone can go and feel comfortable in
and around it. And right now I don't think we have met that because
there is a substantial number of people in the neighborhood who
don't feel comfortable in and around the park. Some neighbors have
formed a group called Safe Streets Now, and they have threatened to
sue the university.''
</P>
<P>
   The university still owns the land, but leases it to the city.
Each time it has tried asserting a new plan for the space, it
clashes with those who want the park to remain as is.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the issue was volleyball courts. A protest against the
courts turned violent when the police fired tear gas and wooden
bullets at demonstrators, and merchants on nearby Telegraph Avenue
had their windows smashed. (The volleyball courts came down in
1997, after constant vandalism.)
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the university issued a quick denial to reports
that its chancellor was considering converting the park to student
housing, the very plan for the site 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But to many here, housing on the site is an idea whose time has
come.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Coleman, a journalist who helped tear down the fence to
take over the park in 1972, said the community had become tired of
the park as a haven for the criminal element.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go there now,'' Ms. Coleman said, ``you're getting a
sanitized view because the police have been sweeping it. I walked
through last night and there was a basketball game going on and the
gardeners were out gardening and I thought, `This is nice.' But the
question becomes, Are you going to have the police occupying the
park all the time? There is this nasty underbelly out there when
the police are not there.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Two students bent with the weight of their knapsacks were asked,
as they walked around the park, why they would not walk across it.
Both women, who refused to give their full names because they were
worried about ``repercussions'' from park denizens, said they
simply did not like the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear about people getting hassled,'' one of the women
said.
</P>
<P>
   The park's defenders say it is better than it has been in years.
The police chased out the crack dealers, they say, and a lively
group of cliques, from chess players to amateur basketball players
to charities giving out free food to the indigent, make the park a
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a little paradise,'' said Arthur Fonseca, who was
helping to build the park's new stage and who said he moved to
Berkeley from Portland, Ore., four years ago to be a part of the
People's Park volunteers. ``Right now, we're building a stage to
last. It's going to be a beautiful place for all kinds of events.''
</P>
<P>
   The park promoters handed out hot-pink fliers that announced a
long list of festivities for the anniversary celebration, including
Wavy Gravy of Woodstock fame as one of the masters of ceremonies.
Later they proudly hung their banner over the giant People's Park
mural on the side of a nearby building. Along the busy avenue, some
people stopped to watch, but others ignored them.

BONE SPUR'S RETURN PUTS OSUNA BACK ON DL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In two days, Los Angeles Dodgers right-hander
Antonio Osuna went from having a blister to needing surgery to
remove a bone spur from his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers put Osuna back on the 15-day disabled list,
retroactive to Sunday, and recalled left-hander Jeff Kubenka from
Triple-A Albuquerque on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   An MRI revealed Osuna has a bone spur in the same location as
the one removed in September. Dodgers team physician Dr. Frank Jobe
was scheduled to perform surgery today at 8 a.m., but Wednesday
afternoon Osuna decided to put it off for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna, who played long toss afterward, said he would like to
throw on the side Friday before he elects to have surgery. If he
feels even a slight twinge in the elbow, Osuna said he'll opt for
the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, manager Davey Johnson said the 26-year-old
could miss 6-8 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am worried because I already had an operation and it's
almost the same thing I had last year,'' Osuna said. ``I'm also
worried because even though I pitched in San Bernardino and San
Diego, I never felt 100 percent. It was not like any other year
when I threw all of my pitches and didn't have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Osuna began the season on the disabled list with soreness in his
right elbow. He was activated Friday and pitched a scoreless inning
Saturday in San Diego, but was unavailable the next few days
because of a blister.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna's disability puts the Dodgers' bullpen in a precarious
situation with a sore-armed Alan Mills (he's expected to be
available Friday), closer Jeff Shaw, lefties Pedro Borbon,
21-year-old Onan Masaoka and Kubenka and right-handers Robinson
Checo and Jamie Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold, Checo, Kubenka and Masaoka entered Wednesday's game
against Atlanta with a combined 22 major-league appearances on
their resume.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers' decision makers said Arnold's two innings of
scoreless relief Tuesday eased their minds. Kubenka was 1-0 with a
0.96 ERA in six appearances with Los Angeles last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kubenka pitched well here last year and Arnold took away a lot
of concerns last night,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone
said. ``In comparison to what other clubs are going through, I feel
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Kubenka, who was 0-1 with a 4.50 ERA with
Albuquerque, gives the Dodgers 2{ lefties in the bullpen. Though
he's a left-hander, the movement on his pitches resembles that of a
right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the stuff we did in spring training is here right
now,'' Dodgers pitching coach Charlie Hough said. ``Davey had a
good plan. You don't go with five or six men in the bullpen, you go
with 10 or 11 so you see what you have.''
</P>
<P>
   Kubenka and Arnold accompanied the Dodgers to Los Angeles for
the exhibition games prior to the season.
</P>
<P>
   Skippin' Perez: As expected, Hough said right-hander Darren
Dreifort would start Sunday against the St. Louis Cardinals while
the Dodgers skip left-hander Carlos Perez's spot in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Hough said the Dodgers, who are off today and Monday, would
think of using Perez in relief between starts. But he wants Perez
to use the time to work on his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just throw his fastball, locating his fastball,'' Hough said.
``All eight of the Braves' hits came on offspeed pitches. He just
throws too many offspeed pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Extra bases: Jose Vizcaino made his second straight start at
shortstop for the Dodgers.... The Dodgers entered the finale of the
three-game series with Atlanta leading the league with 26 stolen
bases.

HOW TO SEE WARNING SIGNS IN TODAY'S KIDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- There has to be a way to spot them.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the school carnage in Littleton, Colo., terrified
students, parents, teachers and administrators are repeating it
like a mantra: There must be a way to spot them, the students who
can turn violent. There just has to be.
</P>
<P>
   Who's harmless. Who's dangerous?
</P>
<P>
   How can you tell the difference between the gloomy student with
a penchant for unusual clothing and the one with the shotgun hidden
under his cape?
</P>
<P>
   Is there a difference between kids who hate and kids who will
kill?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are warning signs, but it's always easier to identify
these things in retrospect,'' said Dr. Allen Chroman, assistant
clinical professor of psychiatry at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   The glaring warning signs that students -- almost always boys --
may be capable of violence include cruelty to animals,
fire-setting, bed-wetting and a lack of remorse for actions that
harm others, said Richard Lieberman, a psychologist for the Los
Angeles Unified School District, and a member of the National
Association for School Psychologists emergency-response team.
</P>
<P>
   Any of these behavioral patterns alone may not mean much, but
taken together with other characteristics -- chronic depression,
aggression, etc. -- can indicate a child is heading over the edge.
Experts said early intervention by school counselors or other
responsible adults can help dangerously troubled children.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's shooters fit the profile of kids who kill. So did
those who opened fire in the past two years on classmates in
Arkansas, Mississippi, Oregon, Idaho and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't just your average sullen teens, struggling to find
a way to rebel against their parents or peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had all the warning signs, and they had a history of
bullying and aggression,'' Leiberman said. ``This is not a normal
kid. These kids were way, way, way on the fringe.''
</P>
<P>
   Chroman and Leiberman said most youths -- some even into their
late teens -- have a skewed view of death, and they imagine it as
temporary, magical and reversible. The danger is magnified when
parents are neglectful or violent toward each other or the kids.
</P>
<P>
   So children learn violence as a way of resolving problems. And
music, movies and video games reinforce that view, Chroman and
Leiberman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response is: The other people are no good. If I kill the
jocks, I have no more problems,'' Chroman said.
</P>
<P>
   While some might dismiss connections between violence in the
media and violence in practice, Chroman compared youths playing
shoot'em-up video games with fighter pilots training in flight
simulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do that because it works well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, he said, the virtual reality desensitizes the user
to anxiety when the situation arises in real life. The emotional
immaturity of some teens keeps them from fully recognizing that the
classmates falling around them are flesh and blood, not renewable
characters in some scenario.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths of others, and even themselves, are viewed as no
great loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all part of the game,'' Chroman said. ``It's all pieces
of the puzzle, the devaluation of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Boys who are depressed or chronically aggressive need to be
identified in the elementary grades, when they can still be turned
around, according to James Garbarino, professor of human
development at Cornell University and author of a new book, ``Lost
Boys: Why Our Sons Turn Violent and How We Can Save Them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time to intervene,'' agreed Chroman. ``Not all
these kids become mass murderers, but most mass murderers begin
this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Royer of Pasadena, Calif., a licensed clinical social
worker for 18 years, said the key is helping students make good
choices -- not to listen to Marilyn Manson, flash gang signs or
wear clothes that are all black or absurdly baggy.
</P>
<P>
   He recommends dress codes and other restrictions on appearance,
including hairstyles. He said if children have fewer choices, they
have a better chance of making the right ones.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Tuesday's shootings, Columbine High students
talked about their classmates' fascination with death, Nazism,
violent music and pipe bombs.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman warned against jumping to conclusions from one or
a few indicators. Students shouldn't be pounced upon just because
they listen to shock rock, or espouse distasteful political
beliefs, or wear unusual clothing or have a fascination with
militarism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every principal is going to say all students who wear long
coats are potential killers; tomorrow, no long coats allowed on
campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's simplifying it. That's what happens in the aftermath,''
he said. ``But there are no simple answers. You have to be careful
not to knee-jerk. You'll just alienate the kids even more.''
</P>
<P>
   But the experts agreed on one thing: Anyone who spots
threatening or frightening behavior should notify a responsible
adult -- a teacher, a counselor, a school psychologist or a school
nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Teens especially may be reluctant to tell adults about strange
students, and they may prefer just to ignore their creepier
classmates. But Garbarino said they have a responsibility to report
any concerns they have.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks ago in Butler, Pa., three students overheard a
15-year-old classmate talk about hurting others, and they told
authorities, Garbarino said.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning school officials detained the boy, Garbarino
said, and they found his gun hidden in the bushes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a Littleton averted because kids had a different
approach of taking care of their friends,'' Garbarino said.
</P>
<P>
   But some students in Littleton, Colo., chose not to report the
threats and actions of the two shooters, Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold, in the ``Trench Coat Mafia.'' Some did, and authorities
remained heedless of the warning signs.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Trench Coat Mafia'' even had its own World Wide Web site,
featuring nihilistic lyrics from the German dance band KFMDM, known
for its relentless, aggressive, percussive music:
</P>
<P>
   ``Chaos, panic, no resistance. Detonations in a distance.
Apocalypse now, walls of flame, billowing smoke, who's to blame?''

VALLEY STUDENTS EXPRESS SORROW OVER KILLINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apollo High School senior Julie Tadano wept softly Wednesday as
she penned a sympathy note to a stranger in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   She had no ties to Columbine High School, where 15 died Tuesday
in one of the worst shooting rampages in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was some kinship: In another act of random
violence, two classmates at Apollo had been shot to death last year
while walking to a pizza parlor. Suddenly, a shooting hundreds of
miles away seemed all too close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really over it,'' Tadano said, ``and I don't think I
will ever be.''
</P>
<P>
   She was joined Wednesday by 1,200 other Apollo students who
wanted to send words of encouragement to the grieving students and
families at Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put ourselves in the situation and thought of how we might
help, such as doing a blood drive or raising money,'' said Fred
Weaver, Apollo student body president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought that writing notes that we care about them would be
best,'' he said. ``We realize how a tragedy can affect kids on
campus, and we want them to know how we came together as a
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the Valley on Wednesday, students had vastly different
reactions to the deadly attack in Littleton. Some sought to show
support by giving blood, donating money or sending cards.
</P>
<P>
   Some came to school confident they were safe; others expressed
fear that their campuses could be next.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scary thing about teenage life today is you don't know,''
said D.J. Mahoney, 17, a senior at Brophy College Preparatory in
Phoenix. ``It's not about a fistfight anymore. It's about a kid who
has a gun and it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Still others empathized with the shooters, saying they too had
been taunted.
</P>
<P>
   Said Saguaro High School sophomore Mary Dalsin, ``I think
everyone has been tormented at school, but the fact they went
through with it was pretty wild.''
</P>
<P>
   The shooting spree had other effects as well: ``I told my mom I
wasn't going to pick on anyone anymore,'' said Danielle Honeybone,
a 17-year-old Mesa High School junior.
</P>
<P>
   School officials and counselors, meanwhile, worked throughout
the day to address safety concerns and help students and parents
make sense of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   In the Peoria Unified School District, for instance, elementary
school students were given brochures on gun safety.
</P>
<P>
   There were also simpler gestures: The staff at Tempe High School
lowered its flag to half-staff to honor the shooting victims.
</P>
<P>
   A statewide effort to promote safe schools also began to take
shape Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny Hemphill, spokeswoman for the Arizona School Boards
Association, said a coalition of educators, employees of Tosco
Corp. and others are taking the first step with a sticker campaign
that promotes safety.
</P>
<P>
   They want to distribute stickers shaped like red school houses
that read ``I support safe schools and safe communities'' to the
800,000 schoolkids around the state. They hope to have them
available early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull may also call for a statewide moment of silence,
or some other show of support, in the next few days, her
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   For some students, Wednesday began with a moment of silence.
</P>
<P>
   Paradise Valley High School Principal Gary Damore also made a
plea to students to report anything suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although incidents like this are extremely rare, we want you
to feel safe in reporting anything that may interfere with the
safety and well-being of anyone on campus,'' Damore told the
students in an early-morning announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Apollo students, led by Weaver, quickly organized their
note-writing campaign to Columbine students. Some said the deaths
of their own classmates, honor students Renelyn Simmons and Andre
Bradley, were still fresh in their minds even after 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   Tadano offered students in Colorado a religious message. ``I
told them to watch for the answers and to pray; God promises that
he will heal the brokenhearted.''
</P>
<P>
   Student Jill Dumbauld, who also took part in the effort, said,
``It's so heartbreaking for students when someone you know is the
victim of violence. We understand what the students in Colorado are
going through.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Peoria school officials hustled to get letters out to
parents explaining officials' efforts to cut down on violent
behavior in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the safest places children can be in today's day and
age is in a school. . . . What happened was a random act of
violence,'' said Peoria district spokeswoman Sandi Hicks. ``It's a
one in a million chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Sandoval, 16, a sophomore at South Mountain High School,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe what happened (in Littleton) could happen anywhere, but
this is a pretty safe campus,'' she said of the south Phoenix
school.
</P>
<P>
   Schoolmate Danielle Gill, 16, said the campus is a world apart
from Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have stuff going on at our school, but it's nothing here
compared to what's going on at that Littleton school,'' she said.
``It just doesn't compare to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Peoria High School junior Jason Allis was sure nothing like the
incident in Colorado would happen at his school. How do he and his
friends get beyond the tragedy that took the lives of kids their
age?
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't here,'' Allis said and shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   But some students and parents weren't so secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible tragedy,'' said Michael Schwimmer, as he was
dropping his son at Saguaro High School. ``As a parent, I have
fears it could happen anywhere. But part of me wants to naively
believe it won't happen here.''

<P>
   At Mesa High School, Brittaney Malone walked to campus as she
does every day. She waved to friends in passing cars and exchanged
quips with friend Melissa Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   But all the while, she was thinking about Colorado and a friend
who lives there.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friend may have been shot,'' said Malone, a 16-year-old
junior. ``I called her house and couldn't get through. I'm just
hoping nothing happened to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to come to school today.''
</P>
<P>
   Student after student at Mesa High repeated the mantra of the
day: ``If it could happen there, it could happen anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a ripple effect,'' said Jermaine Henson, a 16-year-old
junior. ``It could happen to anyone anywhere any time.''
</P>
<P>
   The shooters in Columbine have been called members of a ``Trench
Coat Mafia'' clique _ a group many students in the Valley said they
had never heard of. But groups of students on their campuses do
favor a ``Gothic'' look, dressing in all black, with dyed black
hair and painted black nails.
</P>
<P>
   Honeybone, the junior at Mesa High, said some athletes and other
students at her school often pick on the Goth crowd, a small clique
that mostly keeps to itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call them `freaks,' '' Honeybone said.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney, the Brophy senior, said a similar Goth group also is
ridiculed at his campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though you don't know, based on their dress, I think it's
a typical high school's reaction to have some negativity toward
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few kids at Marcos de Niza High School in Tempe, who say they
are part of the Goth crowd, say they've been unfairly taunted and
stereotyped.
</P>
<P>
   Said Sara Nelson, 16, ``Just because you are Gothic doesn't mean
you don't know right from wrong, it doesn't mean you don't have
morals.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Eric Gray, 18, ``I wear black and I'm probably the biggest
pacifist.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the shootings prompted some students to make a mental
list of whom they've crossed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of scary because you don't know if someone is going
to bring a gun,'' said Tom Thurmond, a freshman at Saguaro High
School. ``I don't know how many people I made mad.'' &QL;

SALO, OILERS SERVE STARS A SWEATY TEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Sweaty, yet perfect. But very sweaty, not to mention
physical and bloody, at least for Guy Carbonneau.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that, however, just what the Dallas Stars needed Wednesday
night _ blood, sweat and a good scare?
</P>
<P>
   The answer would seem to be yes, as long, of course, as the
evening was finally topped off with a Game 1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton did not want to go easy. Then again, when has Edmonton
done a timid fade when hooked up against the heavily favored Stars
in a playoff series?
</P>
<P>
   Any chance of ho-hum overconfidence creeping in for the Stars,
and that was certainly a possibility, was washed away in the stream
of blood that flowed down Carbonneau's face in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   It was no way to treat the night's hero, but Carbonneau's
game-winning goal with just less than seven minutes to play secured
a 2-1 victory. But it took a while to secure anything.
</P>
<P>
   Down 1-0 going into the final 20 minutes, the Stars were shoved
into survival mode by the give-me-your-best-shot goaltending of one
Tommy Salo.
</P>
<P>
   Who does this Salo think he is _ Cujo?
</P>
<P>
   With Curtis Joseph finally a distant memory, or nightmare, when
it came to playing the Oilers in the postseason, here comes Salo,
making the first playoff start of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while, I was thinking flashback,'' said Carbonneau, and
no one around here had to ask flashback to what?
</P>
<P>
   Salo? Cujo? There wasn't any difference in the first two
periods, or really for the game. With the Stars putting 31 shots on
the Swede, it was a fluke Jere Lehtinen goal that tied it seconds
into the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau finally cracked Salo, beating him on a wrister that
found five-hole. To perform so well all night, then give up the
game winner on a puck between his legs, put only a small dent in
Salo's Grade A effort.
</P>
<P>
   But the small dent was enough for the scared Stars to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, this was a game where we would have become
frustrated,'' Hitchcock said, recalling that still hard to swallow
playoff ousting by Cujo and the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Salo was causing frustration of his own. To a certain
degree so did the referee duo of Don Koharski and Mick McGeough,
who called a loose game, allowing the muscle to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't necessarily make Koharski and McGeough bad people,
but it played right into Edmonton's body slams. With top scorers
Bill Guerin and Josef Beranek missing with injuries, the Oilers'
best chance to steal a victory was with muscle and Salo. It almost
worked, too.
</P>
<P>
   In a brutal game overall, the lads became overhyper in the final
minutes, and as the rough stuff prevailed, Doug Weight boarded
Carbonneau, opening up a nasty gash under his left eye. That led to
more roughness, and although the final buzzer ended it, it may have
only given us the theme for Game 2 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was fitting that the opener be decided by the play
of the Stars' checking line. Old-timers Carbonneau and Dave Reid,
along with the youngster, Blake Sloan, were excellent on every
shift.
</P>
<P>
   But late in the third period, with the score tied, that
threesome took the puck off the end boards and passed it around
like the Showtime Lakers of old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Carbo creeping in, and slid it to him,'' Reid said. ``We
finally had a guy who was open in the zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on everything else Salo had stopped all night, it was
stunning when Carbonneau's hammer sailed through the legs.
</P>
<P>
   But Reid made a key point. The Oilers were effective in keeping
traffic clear in front of Salo. And when there was an Edmonton
breakdown, Salo either had the answer or the Stars couldn't bury
the puck. The Stars not finishing off good chances became a nagging
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, nothing came easy for the Stars, which was an
instant reminder that the Presidents' Trophy is now stored away in
Tom Hicks' closet. In other words, no one cares.
</P>
<P>
   And the history lesson attached to this Game 1 is also
significant. In the past two years, the Stars have lost Game 2's in
the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friday night will define our team in this series,'' Hitchcock
said.
</P>
<P>
   But so maybe did Game 1. nn

STARS' CARBONNEAU SCORES WINNER IN TIGHT OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Guy Carbonneau stood with blood covering his face and a
mix of French-English expletives spewing from his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead and freeze that picture of the 39-year-old center; it's
a symbol of what the Stars might have to become to capture their
first-round playoff series with the Edmonton Oilers, and eventually
what they might have to become to win the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau pumped in the game-winning goal with 6:53 remaining
in Game 1 to complete a third-period comeback in a 2-1 Stars
victory over the Oilers Wednesday night before a frenetic crowd of
17,001 at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to getting a key victory in their best-of-seven
Western Conference quarterfinals with the Oilers, the Stars also
established themselves as a team that won't back down from a
physical challenge. In a game that contained an astounding 110 hits
and ended with five players receiving misconduct penalties, the
Stars showed they can flex plenty of muscle even with suspended
captain Derian Hatcher out of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where people got this idea that we're not a tough
team or that they can push us around,'' defenseman Craig Ludwig
said. ``We've played tough against (the Oilers) before; we played
tough against Phoenix. We'll play whatever game they want to put
out on the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars did just that, getting a team-leading seven hits from
Carbonneau and spreading their venom throughout the lineup. When a
decidedly larger Oilers team came out hitting in the first period,
the Stars didn't back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was rough,'' defenseman Richard Matvichuk said. ``When you
see (Stars center) Mike Modano and (Oilers center) Doug Weight
throwing it around, you know it's a physical game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers almost used that physical strategy to perfection,
surviving a tight-checking game and taking a 1-0 lead into the
third period, thanks to an acrobatic game by goalie Tommy Salo, who
faced 31 shots while his teammates took 13.
</P>
<P>
   But just when Salo seemed impenetrable, the Stars came up with
two third-period goals and avoided what could have been a huge
upset. The Stars entered the series with the best record in the NHL
during the regular season and were 34 points better than the
Oilers, who came in as the eighth seed in the West.
</P>
<P>
   But with Salo looking the part of former Oilers goalie and Stars
killer Curtis Joseph, the Stars turned to their most unlikely
scoring line. With the score tied 1-1, the line of Carbonneau, Dave
Reid and Blake Sloan _ which had accounted for a total of 10 goals
during the regular season _ worked the shift of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan and Reid continuously pounded against the physical Oilers
to win possession of the puck behind the net, then Sloan circled
into the slot on his backhand. Sloan flicked the puck forward to
Reid, who dropped a pass across the slot to the right circle. From
there, Carbonneau snapped in a 25-footer for the game winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew if we kept working, we could get a chance, and we just
happened to find someone open,'' Reid said. ``And Carbo buried
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The two teams meet again Friday night at Reunion Arena in Game
2, and it promises to be a physical affair. Weight received a
five-minute major penalty and a game misconduct for boarding
Carbonneau with 4.6 seconds remaining _ the hit that bloodied his
face. A scrum ensued, and four more misconduct penalties were
handed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more physical the better,'' Oilers coach Ron Low said.
``If you think this series is going to go more than four games, and
some people don't, then physical is the way we have to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers came out flailing and established that the game would
be a physical affair, and referees Don Koharski and Mick McGeough
went along with that plan. With each Oilers hit, though, the Stars
decided to hit back until the first period became a shoving match
in which neither team was able to establish much in the department
of offensive chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers scored on their eighth shot of the game with 1:06
remaining in the second period. Rem Murray chipped a puck past Ed
Belfour after a strong forecheck by Oilers linemate Alex Selivanov,
and the Oilers were looking like Spoilers once again.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton upset the second seed in the first round the past two
years _ including over the Stars two seasons ago _ and appeared
ready to go for the hat trick.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stars gathered themselves after the second intermission,
and Jere Lehtinen scored 13 seconds into the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars then kept hammering Salo until Carbonneau finally came
through with a statement goal in a statement game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to play physical, we can play physical,'' Ludwig
said. ``We're going to miss Derian, but we're through talking about
that right now. We're just playing games right now, and we'll do
whatever we need to do to win games.''

MAJOR IMPLICATIONS SEEN IN GERMAN-ITALIAN COMMUNICATIONS MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TELECOM and EUROPE-CHANGES) 
(mk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some details of the deal between Deutsche Telekom and Telecom
Italia may remain uncertain, but many executives close to the
Global One partnership of Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and
Sprint agree that at least three things with important implications
for the future structure of the global communications industry have
become clear.
</P>
<P>
   First, a merger between the German and Italian companies would
spell the end of Deutsche Telekom's seven-year partnership with
France Telecom. Even if a Deutsche Telekom-Telecom Italia merger
never happens, the relationship between the German and French
companies may have already been shattered by the German carrier's
ambition.
</P>
<P>
   Second, a dissolution of the France Telecom-Deutsche Telekom
partnership spells the end for Global One, at least in its current
form. It became clear last month that long-troubled Global One was
on the verge of collapse; a merger between Deutsche Telekom and
Telecom Italia would turn Global One's likely demise into a virtual
certainty. It is almost inconceivable that Sprint, France Telecom,
Deutsche Telekom and the former Telecom Italia could remain in a
four-way partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Third, Sprint, the No. 3 U.S. long-distance carrier, may soon be
faced with the opportunity to redefine its international strategy.
For Sprint, that redefinition will probably mean deciding whether
to link with France Telecom, a merged German-Italian behemoth, or
with another international carrier.
</P>
<P>
   The other major U.S. long-distance companies, AT&AMP;T and MCI
Worldcom, are also trying to build their international businesses,
AT&AMP;T in partnership with British Telecom and MCI Worldcom in tandem
with Telefonica de Espana. But the impact of a Deutsche
Telekom-Telecom Italia merger would be smaller on them than on
Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom each agreed to
acquire 10 percent of Sprint and in 1996 the three companies formed
Global One, a venture aimed at serving the communications needs of
multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
   But the German and French companies already had their own
partnership, formed in 1992 and code-named Atlas.
</P>
<P>
   Atlas is in trouble. France Telecom is extremely upset at
Deutsche Telekom not only for pursuing Telecom Italia in the first
place but for reportedly denying such aspirations up until the very
day news of the negotiations broke last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This project is contrary to the agreements between France
Telecom and Deutsche Telekom,'' Michel Bon, the chairman and chief
executive of France Telecom, said Wednesday in reaction to the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some executives close to Global One are convinced that
the European antitrust regulators will oppose an alliance among the
dominant phone companies in France, Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The split between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom is
important for Sprint because Global One is technically a joint
venture between Sprint and Atlas, and if Atlas collapses, the basic
structure of Global One is thrown into doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to Global One said that from France Telecom's
perspective, Deutsche Telekom had moved to withdraw itself from
Global One, leaving France Telecom together with Sprint for now.
But it may not be that simple.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the discord among the European carriers, France
Telecom and Deutsche Telekom each have told Sprint they want to
continue working with Sprint in order to keep a foothold in the
lucrative U.S. market, according to executives close to Global One.
</P>
<P>
   That could leave Sprint in something of the catbird seat, with
the ability to choose its partner for the future. Global One
foundered largely because of differences among its three partners.
For Sprint, the chance to link with one overseas carrier with whom
it shares a common vision might compensate for the loss of the
third partner.
</P>
<P>
   One rumor is that Deutsche Telekom would actually like to
acquire Sprint. But that could prove difficult because under its
agreement with Sprint, France Telecom has the right to match any
additional equity investment made in Sprint by Deutsche Telekom.

SALO FALLS SHORT OF FILLING BIG SHOES LEFT BY `CUJO'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ His first NHL playoff game, and all Edmonton goalie
Tommy Salo had to do was play the team with the best record in the
league and replace former Oilers goalie Curtis Joseph, who always
had his best game going in time for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   So, any sign of nerves from Mr. Salo?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just when he started puking before he got on the ice,'' Oilers
forward Doug Weight deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   Salo blamed his upset tummy on Tuesday's dinner. He said he took
some of ``that pink stuff,'' and felt well.
</P>
<P>
   He played well, too, and was a bright spot in the Oilers' 2-1
loss against the Stars in Game 1 of a Western Conference
first-round series last night at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' Salo said when asked if he felt confident coming
in. ``With a performance like this, and if we continue to play like
this, we can continue to cause them some trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   For 53 minutes and 7 seconds last night, Salo looked like the
guy he replaced. Joseph bolted last summer for a bigger contract
with Toronto. Salo came to Edmonton in a trade at the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   He made save after save after solid save last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while, I was thinking flashback,'' said Guy Carbonneau,
a Star in 1997 when Joseph almost single-handedly upset Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Flashback looked to be an understatement until Carbonneau
slipped a puck, and eventual game-winning goal, between Salo's
seemingly impenetrable pads with 6:53 remaining to erase a 1-all
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   Chants of ``Salo, Salo'' began in earnst from Stars fans then.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave us a chance to win the hockey game,'' Oilers coach Ron
Low said. ``I thought he was outstanding, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for him, his Oilers needed better than
outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Shots were sporadic at best for Edmonton, 13 in all. Kelly
Buchberger registered Edmonton's first shot midway through
first-period action.
</P>
<P>
   Salo kept them in the game. He couldn't win it.
</P>
<P>
   He had been kind of an unknown coming in, so unknown that Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock called a couple of Eastern Conference coaches
for a scouting report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing they told us is if he sees it he'll stop it, and
that's what he did tonight,'' Hitchcock said. ``He's a world-class
goalie.''
</P>
<P>
   Salo faced 31 shots, stopping all of them but two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe for the people in Dallas and people wondering about
Tommy's first playoff game, he answered it,'' Weight said. ``He
answered it for us a long time ago.''

ELIZABETH TILBERIS, 51, EDITOR OF HARPER'S BAZAAR, DIES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Elizabeth Tilberis, the editor in chief of Harper's
Bazaar, who transformed it from a tired magazine into a viable
voice in fashion while she battled ovarian cancer and raised
awareness of the disease, died Wednesday morning at Mount Sinai
Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 51 and had homes in Manhattan
and East Hampton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tilberis was highly respected for her ability as an editor,
her warmth and her good humor in the face of debilitating
treatments to halt the spread of the cancer that ultimately took
her life. While hospitalized in December 1993 and again in the
summer of 1995, she oversaw each issue of the monthly magazine,
which she had taken over in February 1992. Until just a few days
before her death, she was working on the June issue.
</P>
<P>
   When Hearst Magazines, which publishes the 132-year-old Harper's
Bazaar, hired Ms. Tilberis away from her job as editor in chief of
British Vogue, it created a sensation in fashion magazine circles.
</P>
<P>
   She became the third reigning British editor of an important New
York magazine, following Anna Wintour, editor in chief of Vogue,
and Tina Brown, who was then the editor in chief of Vanity Fair and
later became the editor of The New Yorker and is now developing
Talk magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion world was abuzz with gossip on two topics:
speculation that Hearst was paying Ms. Tilberis an annual salary of
$1.25 million (never confirmed or denied) and anticipation of a
rivalry between Ms. Tilberis and Ms. Wintour, her predecessor at
British Vogue, who had recommended Ms. Tilberis as her replacement
there. (No outward signs of either hostility or warmth were seen in
the years they competed in New York.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tilberis' aim when she took over Harper's Bazaar, she said,
was to make it ``the most beautiful fashion magazine in the
world.'' She hired talented stylists and famous photographers and
brought in Fabien Baron to redesign the look of the magazine. Under
his art direction, it developed a strong graphics style, which was
widely copied.
</P>
<P>
   The first issue under Ms. Tilberis' direction, September 1992,
had a stunning cover shot by Patrick Demarchelier of model Linda
Evangelista in a stark black dress against a white background with
no other headline on the cover than ``Enter the Era of Elegance.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a startling contrast to the usual fashion magazine cover
with multiple headlines in different colors. Subsequent issues
added text lines and color and eventually looked more like other
fashion publications. An exception was this year's February cover
of Madonna, also photographed by Demarchelier, in striking black
and red.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Industry reaction to the first change in the magazine was mixed.
Some saw it as coolly elegant. Others thought it boring and
lifeless. But it won awards, including two National Magazine Awards
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Ms. Tilberis was named editor of the year by
Advertising Age and received an award from the Council of Fashion
Designers of America, which was presented to her by Diana, the
Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   The two women became friends in London, where the Princess of
Wales often dropped by the offices of British Vogue and also
appeared on its cover twice while Ms. Tilberis was editor. The
princess was also twice on the cover of Harper's Bazaar under Ms.
Tilberis' editorship, once during her lifetime and once
posthumously.
</P>
<P>
   The September 1994 issue of Harper's Bazaar contained an
informative article by Aimee Lee Ball, ``Ovarian Cancer: One
Woman's Fight,'' in which Ms. Tilberis linked her use of fertility
drugs in the late 1970s to the ovarian cancer that was diagnosed in
December 1993. The fertility treatments were unsuccessful. The
article described the disease and its treatment, which included
nine weeks of chemotherapy, which caused Ms. Tilberis to lose 30
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   In another article in the magazine, in May 1996, Ms. Tilberis
described in diary form a bone-marrow transplant she underwent the
previous summer to eradicate vestiges of the cancer. In both
articles, she chose to find something positive to say about her
illness: she had gone from a size 14 to a fashionable size 6 and
was pleased that her silver hair was as flattering in its new short
length as it had been as a chin-length bob.
</P>
<P>
   She also discussed her battle with the disease in ``No Time to
Die,'' a memoir written with Ms. Ball and published last year by
Little, Brown. In 1997, Ms. Tilberis became president of the
Ovarian Cancer Research Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Kelly Tilberis was born Sept. 7, 1947 in Alderley
Edge, a village outside of Manchester, England, to Jane and Thomas
Stuart-Black Kelly. Her father was an eye surgeon, who was a
pioneer in laser retinal detachment surgery and in developing soft
contact lenses in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   She received a Bachelor of Arts degree in fashion design from
Leicester Polytechnic, a British school comparable to New York's
Fashion Institute of Technology. It was there that she met her
future husband, Andrew Tilberis, an artist, who was her tutor. She
and her husband later adopted two children, Robert, now 17, and
Christopher, 14.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her husband and sons, she is survived by her
relatives in England: her mother, of Bath; her sister, Lois
Stuart-Black of London, and her brother, Dr. Grant Kelly of West
Sussex. Following her graduation in 1970, Ms. Tilberis went to
British Vogue as a fashion assistant and worked her way to the top,
becoming editor in chief in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tilberis was active on the New York charity social scene,
serving as chairwoman of benefits for causes like pediatric AIDS,
the New York City Ballet and the Costume Institute of the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   She was scheduled to receive a Humanitarian Award in June from
the Council of Fashion Designers of America, which will now be
given posthumously, said Fern Mallis, the council's executive
director. ``We are pleased that the award was announced earlier and
not something added after her death,'' Ms. Mallis said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ms. Tilberis' personal popularity and the publicity her
tenure brought to the magazine, Harper's Bazaar never ousted Vogue
from its pinnacle as the fashion publication with the largest
circulation and the most advertising pages. As time went by under
her editorship, the magazine lost some of its specialness and began
to look more like other fashion publications. It also lost some
high-profile editors and photographers to other magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed, Ms. Tilberis pronounced herself pleased with the
magazine in an interview in 1995. ``I think we made the niche we
wanted to make, and I think we are the elegant fashion magazine I
wanted to create,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published last year in The Times, Ms. Tilberis
discussed the stark contrast between her glamorous job and her
illness: ``You can live in the fashion world and go to fashion
shows and have your picture taken, et cetera, et cetera. But
there's an important balance with what really goes on in life,
which is sickness and suffering and people dying. Prior to having
cancer, I didn't realize there was this whole different world. It's
a great wake-up call.''

NETS BEAT UNIMPRESSIVE BULLS, 99-87 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Needless to say, these were not Michael
Jordan's Chicago Bulls who visited Continental Arena Wednesday
night. But to the dismay of the 15,874 fans, they were not even
Toni Kukoc's Bulls, or Ron Harper's, or Brent Barry's.
</P>
<P>
   While the presence of Chicago's talent-challenged,
injury-depleted club enabled the fans to witness a New Jersey Nets
victory, it also made for an uncompetitive game that was filled
with poor play and devoid of suspense. Without approaching their
``A game,'' the Nets never trailed, led by as many as 25 points and
won by 99-87.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the Nets' first over Chicago since Jordan missed
a 13-footer at the buzzer in March 1997, giving New Jersey a 99-98
victory at the Meadowlands and ending the Bulls' seven-game winning
streak over the Nets. Wednesday night's outcome also served as
payback for the two embarrassing losses the Nets endured this
season in Chicago. But there was little celebration in the Nets'
locker room afterward. As hungry as they were for victories, they
realized that this was nothing to party about.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were without Kukoc and Harper and, to be honest, they're
not a very good team without those guys,'' said Kendall Gill, who
coasted through a lethargic 6-point, 4-rebound, 1-steal effort.
</P>
<P>
   As a Chicago native, Gill usually gets psyched for the Bulls
(12-31). But he admitted there was no adrenaline rush Wednesday
night. ``I wasn't so pumped up to play against them this time,''
Gill said, laughing. ``I was running down the court, thinking about
what I was going to do and where I was going to go eat after the
game. I'm serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc, the Bulls' leading scorer in this wretched season with an
18.7 point average, was out with a minor separation of the left
shoulder. Barry, their second-leading scorer (11.4), missed the
game with a sprained right ankle, and Harper, third in scoring
(10.6), was sidelined by a broken nose. Those were all of the
Bulls' double-figure scorers.
</P>
<P>
   That left guys like Kornel David, Cory Carr and Keith Booth in
Chicago's starting five, and enabled the Nets (13-29) to run to a
24-14 first-quarter lead that was never challenged. Keith Van Horn
led the Nets with 28 points and made all 14 of his foul shots as
the Nets set a franchise record by making 23 of 23 free throws. The
previous New Jersey mark for perfection was 17 of 17, set on Nov.
27, 1989, at Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Feick continued his game-by-game improvement by grabbing a
career-high 17 rebounds to push the Nets to a 9-rebound advantage
on the backboards. Feick's 8 first-quarter rebounds were 1 more
than the Bulls' entire team managed.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Feick was no more excited than the rest of his
teammates. When asked if these were the real Bulls, he looked up
with a sheepish grin and said, ``No.''

MANY FACES, 1 EXPRESSION
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ They had started arriving by the time
daylight began to fil ter through the tree's naked limbs. They came
to Clement Park with hand-scripted posters, rosary beads and newly
bought bouquets in their arms, and with their eyes drizzling tears.
They came to that thin sapling within sight of Colum bine High
School all Wednesday long.
</P>
<P>
   To a man, to a woman, to a child, each arrival shared the same
face.
</P>
<P>
   It was an expression simulta neously intense and flat, numb and
full of hurt, a stare that bored into the tree like the bit of a
drill. The man fingering his rosary wore it. So did the football
player trying to hide his face behind scabbed fingers. So did the
teenage girl whose lips moved as she silently recited the sign on
the ground at her feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is our future? To all my peers who lost their lives and
inno cence.''
</P>
<P>
   She added her three white carna tions to the pile. Her footsteps
tracked through the wet grass. Her face never changed.
</P>
<P>
   Kind of like the day.
</P>
<P>
   They wore that same look all across Littleton on Wednesday, in
the aftermath of Columbine High School, as the 15 bodies left
behind began to come out one by one, and the story of Eric Harris
and Dylan Klebold, the killers, began to come out one mouthful at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Baumgart, a Columbine senior, stood not 10 yards from the
tree, staring past it. He went to grade school with Klebold, he
said, was friends with him in the Boy Scouts during middle school.
By Columbine, though, by the time Nick, Harris and Klebold shared a
video production class junior year, everyone could sense the
separation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really wasn't the students se cluding them. It was kind of
mu tual,'' he said. ``They pushed themselves away, and in turn the
student body kind of pushed them away. But there was nothing to
clue you in that something like this could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Not until gunfire and explosions ripped holes in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   And five holes in 17-year-old Richard Castaldo.
</P>
<P>
   The junior's father, Rick, flew to Colorado from Virginia within
hours of flipping on CNN. As his son lay upstairs in critical
condition in the Swedish Medical Center's ICU _ spleen gone, two
ribs bro ken and a bullet left embedded in his back _ Rick stepped
outside wearing the Littleton look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard has a breathing tube, but he looks pretty good to
me,'' he said. ``What the nurses have done is, they put a pen in
his right hand. He has both arms bandaged, but they hold a
clipboard up and every time he writes, he writes, `When does the
breathing tube come out?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Out comes the father's wallet and a picture of his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fortunate,'' he explains. ``Even though my son still has a
bullet in him and he's in critical, I feel fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Dr. Phil Mallory, though his downcast eyes worked like a
sur gical mask.
</P>
<P>
   His patient, Anne Marie Hochal ter, 17, was among the first to
arrive Tuesday, in deep shock, shot through her chest and liver.
Mallory served in the Army Medical Corps during Desert Storm. The
condition of the teens and the doctoring re minded him of battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We literally went to the operat ing room with our fingers in
the dike as far as her liver injury was concerned,'' he said. ``My
thought . . . was `My God, if I don't do something quick, this
pretty little girl is going to die.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Marie did not, will not, though 15 others have. This kept
men, women and children coming to that bare tree a few hundred
yards from the school all day long. The flower pile grew until it
seemed feet deep, and a pinwheel fluttered lightly when the wind
picked up. Each new arrival wore that same face.
</P>
<P>
   From dawn to dusk, they prayed, wept, laid gifts and stared with
a vengeance at that sapling.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of eyes looked for hours, face after face, and no one
saw a thing. &QL;

POLICE REMOVE 15 BODIES FROM SCHOOL SHOOTING SCENE 
 
By ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
and LISA TEACHEY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ After a gut-wrenching room-by-room search by
bomb experts and crime investigators, the bodies of 14 teens and
one adult finally were removed from blood-spattered Columbine High
School late Wednesday, scene of one of the worst school shootings
in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 15 dead were the two gunmen, identified as students,
who attacked faculty and fellow students Tuesday with bombs and
gunfire before killing themselves in a second-floor library.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was devastating. I've been a cop for 27 years and a SWAT
officer for 11 years, and this was clearly the most devastating and
traumatic scene I have ever seen,'' said Sgt. George Hinkle of the
Lakeside Police SWAT team, among 100 officers who were called to
the school.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were a computer teacher who coached the girls'
basketball team, 10 male students and four female students. Family
members had endured a nearly 24-hour wait before they were told
whose bodies were lying inside. Authorities withheld names
Wednesday, although families confirmed some victims.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen, who began the rampage at about 11:30 a.m., killed
two students in the parking lot. The two, wearing black trench
coats and masks, detonated handmade bombs and shot students at
point-blank range with shotguns and semiautomatic rifles as they
roamed the school for several hours. Many students were trapped
inside as the ordeal unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen were identified Wednesday as Eric David Harris, 18,
and Dylan Bennet Klebold, 17, seniors who belonged to a social
group calling themselves the ``Trenchcoat Mafia.'' Other students
said the two collected guns, disliked athletes and minorities, and
appeared infatuated with Nazi lore. Officials said Wednesday they
had no evidence minorities were specifically targeted.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of the two gunmen, in statements issued by their
lawyers, expressed regret to the victims' families and the
community and said they were struggling as well to understand what
happened.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen kept SWAT officers at bay until almost 4 p.m. while
many of the school's 1,870 students hid under desks, in closets and
in classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Wednesday that 16 of 23 injured remained in seven
area hospitals, 11 in critical or serious condition with gunshot or
shrapnel wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Although investigators believe Harris and Klebold acted alone
inside the school, investigators were questioning eight to 10
fellow members of the ``Trenchcoat Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was some evidence to suggest that there were
some other people that were aware. I think we have to pursue
vigorously, at least for the time being, that there were other
people involved in the planning,'' said District Attorney David J.
Thomas of the 1st Judicial District.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the school and in automobiles in the parking lot,
authorities found 30 homemade explosive devices, including Molotov
cocktail-type bombs with matches as fuses and 2-foot-long propane
tanks wrapped with nails and attached to pipe bombs. More
bomb-making materials were found in searches of the gunmen's homes.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County Sheriff John P. Stone said some of the bombs
were built with timers and were designed to spray nails and
shrapnel. He said investigators had not determined whether some of
the bombs had been hidden in the school before Tuesday's rampage or
how the two carried their arsenal into the school without being
detected. Witnesses said the two carried duffel bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not something that was done overnight,'' Stone said.
``There was a lot of time planning this sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also seized a sawed-off shotgun and a computer
from the home of one of the gunmen. Stone would not describe the
material found to make the bombs but said the items were commonly
available.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said eight or nine semiautomatic magazines were found in
the school, along with numerous spent shotgun shells. The bodies of
Harris and Klebold were found within a few feet of each other with
undetonated bombs nearby. A 9 mm semiautomatic rifle, two shotguns
with their stocks sawed off and a semiautomatic pistol were at
their sides.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13 victims killed, including Dave Sanders, 47, the coach,
10 were in the library. The body of the coach was found in a closet
near the library.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Davis, Jefferson County sheriff's spokesman, said the
investigators were unable to begin the grisly task of examining the
crime scene until after explosives experts swept through the school
and surrounding area searching for undetonated bombs. One problem
was the hundreds of backpacks left behind as students fled the
school.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said SWAT officers from various police departments were
inside the school within 20 minutes of a report of the shooting,
but were hampered by a lack of information about the assailants or
their numbers. About 15 minutes before the shooting began, he said,
a bomb was exploded away from the campus as a diversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 2,000 students in there and no way to identify who the
suspects were,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said three deputies exchanged gunfire with the suspects,
including deputy Neil Gardner, assigned as security at the school,
who remained inside during the ordeal. The other two deputies,
Deputy Paul Smoker and Lt. Terry Manwaring, exchanged gunfire with
one of the suspects when he appeared on the school's roof.
</P>
<P>
   Hinkle said his officers had little information to act on by the
time they reached the scene. Upon arriving, he said, his officers
first spotted a sign in a window that read, ``Help, I'm bleeding to
death.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a student was holding his arms out of the window of the
second-story library and that the boy was rescued when an armored
car pulled under the window and two SWAT officers grabbed the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Hinckle said he was unprepared for what he saw when he came upon
the crime scene. He said students and teachers were coming out of
closets and from under desks as officers made their way through the
school's halls. Officers found students calling for help on
cellular phones or using computers.
</P>
<P>
   Hinkle said he found two areas where propane bombs had been
detonated and the cafeteria floor was under 4 inches of water from
the school's indoor fire sprinkler system.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we train, we train for EDPs (emotionally disturbed
people), and it is so rare to have multiple EDP suspects,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of students and supporters gathered Wednesday at a
media staging area at a nearby park to leave flowers and notes for
the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Other students held a vigil at a car belonging to Rachel Scott,
a junior and one of the victims in the rampage, crying as they
leaned on the car hood draped with flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Jessica Cave, a 16-year-old sophomore who hid in
a small science storage room with 25 to 30 other students for three
hours. The room was at the end of a stairway leading to the
cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was right on the other side of the wall,'' she said of the
gunfire erupting in the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   She said the students, standing shoulder to shoulder, remained
quiet with a teacher standing at the door using her body as a
barricade until they heard SWAT officers in the hall.
</P>
<P>
   School officials said all schools in the Jefferson County Public
School system would reopen today, except Columbine. School
spokesman Rick Kaufman said all the schools were swept for
explosives and that security will be beefed up at the entrances of
schools in the district, the largest in Colorado with 140 schools
and 89,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle DiManna, a math teacher and a 1989 graduate of
Columbine, said returning will be difficult. ``I just can't imagine
going into my classroom and seeing the missing seats,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unnerving in some ways. I really want to go back there,
but in some ways, emotionally I don't want to go back there. The
innocence of Columbine High School is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she remembers the prom assembly last Friday when
Principal Frank DeAngelis reminded students to be careful on prom
night and talked about the students killed in accidents in previous
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want to put another memorial on the wall at
Columbine,'' she said. &QL;

   COLO-SCHOOL-COLUMBINE (Littleton) _ Columbine High School is

shooting in Jonesboro, Ark., to help them understand the real
world, because nothing like that could ever happen here. And, like
a lot of suburban high schools, it is divided into a dozen groups

some time at the dominance and arrogance of the jocks. By Sara

TRANSITION FROM OUTCAST TO MURDERER CAN BE QUICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY PEARCE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For as long as there have been high schools, there have been
``outsiders'' _ students who don't quite fit in.
</P>
<P>
   Although several decades ago it was often considered romantic to
be a rebel, today it can mean bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   School counselors across the Valley, charged with everything
from guiding students down career paths to helping them cope,
watched in horror as the massacre in Littleton, Colo., unfolded
Tuesday. In an instant, they realized it could have been their
school, their students.
</P>
<P>
   One after another, worried students came to them a day later,
saddened for teenagers they had never met.
</P>
<P>
   Like never before, anticipating the actions of troubled
teenagers is as complicated as an intricate spider's web,
counselors said Wednesday. No longer is it just the rowdies and
aggressive kids who have the potential to turn their schools into a
war zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the silent menace,'' said Linda Somo, a Mountain
View High counselor who views her school population as a mirror
image of that at Columbine High School. ``Where do you draw the
line? Where do you go from being an outsider to being a murderer?''
</P>
<P>
   And, why is the school no longer a safe refuge from violence?
</P>
<P>
   According to some psychology experts, it's because our world is
increasingly fragmented, that it's too easy for children to get
their hands on weapons, that the young harbor too many prejudices
and that families continue to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   Although school counselors are adept at spotting suicidal
students or those with drug problems, predicting who will become
violent is a shade of gray.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a student writes an essay about death. Maybe another wears
black clothing, black nail polish and black lipstick. Maybe a third
is a fan of Dungeons and Dragons or Marilyn Manson.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, teachers refer these students to school counselors
like Somo, who oversees about 450 students. Ninety-nine times out
of a 100 their actions are harmless.
</P>
<P>
   But one is too many.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to address this,'' said Somo, who has 28 years of
experience in the education field. ``Maybe there needs to be more
training.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Zello, Mesa Public Schools' lead psychologist, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is on the lookout for troubled students,'' he said.
``We want to help them get through adolescence, which is difficult
at best.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in the school needs to be more observant, said Alan
Brown, director of planning and research at Arizona State
University's Arizona Prevention Center. He has isolated 15
programs, from early childhood intervention to anti-bullying
classes, that might deter youth from violent paths.
</P>
<P>
   Being observant means looking for warning signals, including
changes in friends, behavior, family situations, attire and grades,
said Donna Pisciotta, a social worker in the Tempe Union High
School District.
</P>
<P>
   Counselors call parents, sometimes asking them to pursue outside
therapy for their children. They also interview the student's
friends to get at the heart of the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Fabes, a professor of child development at Arizona State
University, said intervention also should include compassion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you feel empathy, nurturing and caring toward others, it's
unlikely that you are going to engage in violent acts that harm
others,'' he said. ``Parents who take the time to point out the
consequences of the child's negative behavior on others promote
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with all this effort, however, tragedies still can strike.
</P>
<P>
   Pisciotta knows the students in Littleton will never forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be traumatized for years,'' she said. ``You don't
forget someone putting a gun to your head.'' &QL;

PUGET SOUND REGION IN DANGER OF VIOLATING EPA POLLUTION LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HEATH FOSTER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Smog is threatening Seattle's reputation as one of the
nation's most livable metropolises.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years of avoiding violations of federal clean air
standards, growing levels of ozone are likely to put the
Seattle-Tacoma-Everett area in violation of the EPA's new standards
this summer or next, according to the Puget Sound Air Pollution
Control Agency.
</P>
<P>
   At risk is the region's eligibility for federal highway funds
and the health of its residents, particularly children, whose rates
of asthma have been rising in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   And the villain this time around is not factory smoke stacks
belching pollutants into the air. On Thursday, Earth Day 1999,
about 60 percent of the region's air pollution can be blamed on its
drivers, on the road and off.
</P>
<P>
   A soaring number of motor vehicles daily travel 63 million miles
in the Puget Sound area, emitting pollutants as they go, said
Dennis McLerran, the region's Air Pollution Control Officer. Power
boats, gas-powered lawn mowers and construction equipment also
contribute to pollution in King, Snohomish and Pierce counties.
</P>
<P>
   During the hottest days of summer, ozone is formed in the open
air when oxides of nitrogen mix with volatile organic chemicals
released from car exhausts and other sources. A prevailing
southeasterly breeze carries the smog to the foothills of the
Cascade Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   At a monitoring station two miles east of Enumclaw, Wash., ozone
levels have consistently climbed over new federal limits set in
1997 over the past few years, said the pollution control agency. In
July 1998 ozone levels also exceeded the standards at Lake
Sammamish State Park and in La Grande, near Mount Rainier.
</P>
<P>
   Research has shown the ozone is stunting needle growth on pine
and fir trees in what scientists have dubbed the region's
``photochemical belt,'' said Jane Koenig, a University of
Washington professor of environmental health. Koenig is designing a
study to examine whether towns in the Cascade foothills are also
seeing an increase in children's emergency room visits, as Atlanta
did when its smog exceed federal limits.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA won't determine whether the Puget Sound region is
officially in violation until it has three years of data showing
ozone levels have consistently exceeded standards, said Mahbubul
Islam, an EPA environmental scientists.
</P>
<P>
   But McLerran said ``after four more days of temperatures at or
above 90-degree levels this summer,'' the region could be in
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Once in violation, the region must document steps it's taking to
reduce ozone levels to healthful levels within 18 months. If it
fails, it could lose federal highway funding, Islam said.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, for instance, more than 60 road building projects
have been put on hold since the city ran afoul of the Clean Air Act
last year.
</P>
<P>
   An even greater motivator for reducing ozone levels may be the
ill effects of air pollution. In King County, the rate of children
being hospitalized with asthma has increased 34 percent since the
late 1980s, jumping from 350 per 100,000 children to 470 per
100,000 children in 1996, according to the Seattle-King County
Department of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   Koenig, the UW environmental health professor, said air
pollution alone can't be blamed for the increase, but is
unquestionably a contributor. She said laboratory studies have
shown children have increased inflammation and fluid in their lungs
after being exposed to ozone.
</P>
<P>
   And a recent study of 130 freshman at the University of
California at Berkeley found those with higher lifetime exposures
to ozone had smaller lung capacities, suggesting air pollution
actually ``blunts lung growth,'' said Koenig.
</P>
<P>
   ``People with asthma, especially children, are being considered
the canaries in the coal mine,'' she said. ``They are telling us
that the air we breathe even at the present EPA standards can cause
adverse health effects.''
</P>
<P>
   At a forum next week sponsored by the Economic Development
Council of Seattle and King County, business and government leaders
will discuss what steps can be taken to tackle the ozone problem.
McLerran said possible solutions include:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Ramping up the campaign to encourage people not to drive,
mow laws, refuel gas tanks, or cruise in motorboats on hot summer
days. Gasoline and diesel-powered cars produce more than 500,000
pounds of smog-forming pollutants on the average summer day.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Better growth management. According to the Puget Sound
Regional Council, the growth in total vehicle miles traveled each
day has far outpaced the region's population growth over the last
two decades.
</P>
<P>
   From 1981 to 1997, the population of King, Pierce, Snohomish and
Kitsap counties increased from 2.3 million to 3.1 million, a 35
percent increase. But the number of vehicle miles traveled
increased 107 percent. Planners attribute the growth to women
joining the work force in increasing numbers, and people choosing
to live in suburban communities far from employment centers.
</P>
<P>
   Mary McCumber, executive director of the regional council, said
urban villages that encourage people to live, work and shop in
relatively compact areas have been slow to develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to stop driving our cars, but we can encourage
people to drive them a little less,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Toughening emission standards for pickup trucks and sport
utility vehicles, which tend to emit several times as much
pollution as cars.

BATSHEVA DE ROTHSCHILD, 84, DANCE PATRON, DIES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baroness Batsheva de Rothschild, a patron of Martha Graham and
of modern dance in Israel, died on Tuesday at her home in Tel Aviv.
She was 84.
</P>
<P>
   The granddaughter of Baron James de Rothschild, the founder of
the French branch of the Rothschild banking family, de Rothschild
became a supporter of Graham after seeing performances by her and
her company in New York in the early 1940s. She bought the house on
East 63d Street in Manhattan that was the company's headquarters
for many years and supported the Graham school and its activities.
</P>
<P>
   De Rothschild began her professional life as a research
biologist at a laboratory in Paris. She came to the United States
at the start of World War II, studied chemistry and biology at
Columbia University and worked in an industrial laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   During the war she worked for the Free French movement in New
York and London. She enlisted in the French Army and landed in
Normandy after the Allied invasion. She was a liaison between the
French and U.S. forces in Paris, returning to New York at the end
of the war.
</P>
<P>
   In her quiet way, de Rothschild intrigued the Graham dancers,
who knew her as Bethsabee, the French version of her first name.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all I know, the tour being my first, wardrobe mistresses
are always baronesses,'' Paul Taylor wrote in his autobiography,
``Private Domain.'' ``Bethsabee supervises the laundering and
packing of our costumes with quiet efficiency, almost as if born to
it, and by looking at her own outfits, you can't tell she's an
heiress _ that is, if you don't know that expensive dresses are
sometimes the dumpiest.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides supervising the wardrobe, de Rothschild was involved in
a wide range of company activities, including taking a few dance
classes with Graham and buying the dancers jewelry one Christmas at
a lavish party she gave for the troupe.
</P>
<P>
   De Rothschild founded the Batsheva de Rothschild Foundation for
Arts and Sciences in the early 1950s in New York. The foundation's
first project, in 1953, was to sponsor a two-week festival of
American modern dance on Broadway. In addition to underwriting
Graham tours, the foundation also helped establish the Juilliard
Dance Theater, directed by Doris Humphrey, and sponsored a second
three-week festival of modern dance on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   One of the baroness' greatest contributions to modern dance was
the founding of the Graham-based Batsheva Dance Co. in 1964 in Tel
Aviv. De Rothschild, who had moved to Israel two years earlier,
believed the country needed a professional modern dance company
with full-scale sets and costumes and thorough training. She sent
several dancers to New York to work with Graham, who agreed to be
Batsheva's artistic adviser, and Graham sent dancers to Israel to
work with the new company.
</P>
<P>
   Internationally known choreographers like Jerome Robbins and
Jose Limon went to work with Batsheva, and the troupe toured
extensively in the United States, Europe and Asia. De Rothschild
went on to form a second, more balletically based group, the
Bat-Dor Dance Co., in 1967. She withdrew her support from Batsheva
in 1974 after the company refused to hire as its director Jeannette
Ordman, her protegee and the head of Bat-Dor.
</P>
<P>
   Though she never became an Israeli citizen, she remained
immensely loyal to the nation, working as a driver after her car
was mobilized during the 1973 war. She supported many Israeli
causes through her foundation, giving money to hundreds of emigre
scientists and providing housing for new arrivals and loans to the
poor in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   She supported the establishment of the Center for Dance
Medicine, the Chamber Music Association, the Chamber Ensemble and
the Batsheva Crafts Corp. She also established the Batsheva
Foundation for the Advancement of Science in Israel, an endowed
fund of the Israel Academy for Science and Humanities. She was the
author of a French book on modern dance, ``La Danse Artistique aux
USA.''
</P>
<P>
   De Rothschild is survived by a brother, Guy, of Paris, and a
sister, Jacqueline Piatigorsky of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   She received the Israel Prize in 1989 and was honored in 1997 at
a celebration of the 30th anniversary of the Bat-Dor Dance Co. at
the new Tel Aviv House. Those paying tribute included Roni Milo,
the mayor of Tel Aviv, and choreographers Merce Cunningham and Paul
Taylor.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Throughout her life the baroness fascinated people by her
innocent grandeur. Graham long remembered an exchange she had with
the baroness after they visited the august Rothschild Bank in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unlike any bank I had ever seen,'' Graham wrote in her
autobiography ``Blood Memory.'' ``No real tellers, no depositors
that I could see.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Bethsabee, where are the depositors?'
</P>
<P>
   `` `Depositors?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Bethsabee had evidently never been asked that question before.
</P>
<P>
   `` `We don't really encourage depositors, but yes, we do have
one now ... the Pope.''' &QL;

MURDERS IN ARIZONA, COLORADO STIR FEELINGS OF VULNERABILITY
</HEADLINE>
   By KELLY ETTENBOROUGH  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of us didn't know the Chandler policeman who was buried
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't know the families of the teenagers murdered at the
Little ton, Colo., high school on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, we find ourselves numbed by the violence, and united in
grief.
</P>
<P>
   A human trait is the ability to empathize with other people's
expe riences, said Dr. James MacKenzie, a psychologist with Good
Samaritan Hospital. More intense events trig ger more intense
emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it's not close to us, there is a part of us stirred by
it,'' MacKenzie said. ``We think our kids could have been in that
school. If you are an intensely spiritual person, you might stop
and pray.''
</P>
<P>
   People are reminded how vulner able they really are. They want
to do something, he said. They need to understand.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Alan Nelson has been called upon to make sense of the
senseless before. In Oklahoma City at the time of the Federal
Building bombing, he was part of the team that broke the news to
those who had lost family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't pin it on God,'' said Nelson, an author and now
pastor of Scottsdale Family Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as people are alive on Earth because of our nature,
we're always going to have murders, crimes and hatred. It shouldn't
surprise us. God is as much hurt and angered by this as anybody,
probably more than anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   God doesn't give neat solutions to tragedy, he said, but God
does offer hope.
</P>
<P>
   He said people react to grief in two ways: ``They will hate God
and they will hate life and they will become angry. There will also
be people who now more than ever will be so in love with their
families and so in tune with God, they will just be better people.
This is the lesson we can all learn, because we all go through
traumas in our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Nelson stood with others at Bank One Ballpark
for a moment of silence for the Colorado victims. The Rev. Paul
Eppinger, executive director of the Arizona Ecumenical Council,
called his counterpart in Denver to tell him Arizonans were praying
for his community.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, members of the Valley's religious community
gathered in Phoenix for a prayer service for the high school
victims and their families, hastily called by the Interfaith Action
Coalition of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   These are the kinds of things that will help Valley residents
cope with the tragedy and that will help Littleton survive its
grief, said Rabbi David Rebibo, spiritual leader of Beth Joseph
Congregation in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``You help people who have incurred a loss by genuinely sharing
and carrying that burden,'' Rebibo said. ``If somebody is carrying
100 pounds, two people share it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Talmud, Rebibo said, a person who visits
someone who is ill takes away 1/60th of his sickness. The person
feels better just because someone cared enough to come, he said.
Society can do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times people will say `Where is God?' I think God is
present through our presence, when we as friends, relatives and
society identify and share. That's the begin ning of healing,''
Rebibo said.
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie, who describes him self as an unconventional Catholic,
calls spirituality an important part of the healing process for
people who are close to or far from tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a world where these things happen,'' he said. ``We
need to be as true to our own beliefs as we can and try to live in
a way in which we are kind, loving and respectful to other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Maher's belief that this life isn't the end comforts her
when the evil in the world seems over whelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly does not quell the trauma or the misery, but I
think it gives you hope for the future,'' said the American convert
to Islam and a Phoenix mother of two. ``Muslims, Christians, Jews,
I think we all share a common belief that God is there and God is
good. We need to try and stay close to that.''
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy already has encour aged people to look for solutions
and work together to prevent future tragedies, said the Rev. Dwight
W. Cumbee, pastor of Rio Verde Com munity Church and a pastoral psy
chotherapist at the Center for Pastoral Psychotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   This creates meaning and purpose out of something without
meaning and purpose, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tragedy after tragedy after trag edy, it just goes on, whether
it's the Holocaust or Kosovo or a police officer getting killed or
15 children getting killed,'' Cumbee said. ``But we also know that
somehow, even in the darkest of the times, we get through, and we
move on. It takes time and it takes community and it takes the love
of God being acted out in the love of people.'' &QL;

FAMILY CRISIS PUTS SUSPENSION INTO PERSPECTIVE FOR HATCHER
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA AND JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Maybe Derian Hatcher needs his days off _ he has been
through an emotional wringer for the past week.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to feeling frustration about the seven-game
suspension he received for breaking Phoenix center Jeremy Roenick's
jaw, Hatcher has had to deal with the fear, relief and finally joy
after the complicated birth of his third child.
</P>
<P>
   Kelton Eric Hatcher was delivered by emergency C-section late
Monday night after his heart rate started dropping.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was scary there for a while, but he's OK now,'' said
Hatcher, who added that the birth put the suspension in
perspective. ``I'll tell you what: I forgot about the playoffs for
a while there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher, the Stars' captain, practiced with the team yesterday
morning and said he would be in and around the locker room during
the five playoff games he will miss. CAPTAIN JOE
</P>
<P>
   Center Joe Nieuwendyk will wear the Captain's ``C'' on his
uniform while Hatcher serves his suspension. The selection by coach
Ken Hitchcock was a nice touch because Nieuwendyk missed almost all
of the playoffs last season with an injured knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice honor, but I think we have a lot of leaders on
this team,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``I'm just holding it for Derian.''
NEW SEATS
</P>
<P>
   The Stars added 73 seats on a shelf extending over the Zamboni
tunnel to bring the hockey capacity at Reunion Arena to 17,001. The
move made Wednesday night's 38th consecutive sellout a Reunion
Arena-record crowd. INJURY UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were without Pat Verbeek, who has a sprained left
knee. Verbeek is expected to skate this weekend but isn't expected
to play for another 10 to 17 days. Healthy scratches for the Stars
were forwards Brian Skrudland, Tony Hrkac and Brent Severyn and
defenseman Brad Lukowich. FULL OF CONFIDENCE
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Blake Sloan was inserted into the lineup, despite playing
most of the season in the International Hockey League and having
switched from defenseman to forward this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been an NHL player,'' Hitchcock said of the scrappy
forward. ``All I know is just about every time he's on the ice, the
other team is yelling at him about something or another.''
</P>
<P>
   So, did Hitchcock try to ease the pressure on his rookie?
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me I needed to bury my chances,'' Sloan said.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan started the play that led to Guy Carbonneau's game-winning
goal in the third period. MAYBE, MAYBE NOT
</P>
<P>
   Oilers injured wingers Josef Beranek and Bill Guerin skated
yesterday morning but were scratched from Wednesday night's game.
Both could return as early as Game 2 but might not return at all.
</P>
<P>
   Guerin sprained the medial collateral ligament in his left knee
at the end of the season, and the Oilers are afraid he could do
more damage if he comes back. Beranek underwent surgery on his left
knee. LET'S GET PHYSICAL
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the Oilers said they felt they had to hit the
Stars, and hit them hard, to win.
</P>
<P>
   In the first period, Edmonton had 21 hits with defenseman Jason
Smith leading the way with four.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, hitting begets hitting, and the Stars answered with
19 of their own. Carbonneau had a team-leading three. BEEN THERE,
DONE THAT
</P>
<P>
   This is the 16th season in which the Oilers have qualified for
the Stanley Cup playoffs. They have a 12-3 record in the previous
15 first-round series.
</P>
<P>
   The three first-round losses came against Philadelphia in 1980
and Los Angeles in 1982 and '85.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one of the Oilers' 12 first-round victories was in
1997 against the second-seeded Stars. nn

SIMPLY MAV-NESS: ROCKETS LATEST TO FALL

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Too bad the Mavericks only have eight games remaining
in the regular season. It appears the fun is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Beaten down and talked about at water coolers nationwide for
their inept performance this decade, the Mavericks are quietly
disrupting the Western Conference playoff race while suddenly
becoming the talk of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Last night before a sellout crowd of 16,285 at the Compaq
Center, the Mavericks whacked another NBA West powerhouse, as they
controlled the Houston Rockets throughout and won going away,
109-95.
</P>
<P>
   The game was so one-sided that Mavericks rookie Bruno Sundov,
who barely knows any of the team's plays, played in the final two
minutes. At 19 years, 2 months, Sundov became the youngest
Mavericks player ever.
</P>
<P>
   Within an eight-day span, the Mavericks have beaten San Antonio,
Minnesota, Phoenix and Houston. That's half of the field that will
likely represent the Western Conference in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Finley, who converted 11 of 20 shots, said it was the
most complete game the Mavericks have played all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played consistent for 48 minutes,'' said Finley, who poured
in 13 of his 27 points in the third quarter. ``Defensively, we were
doing things that we needed to do; offensively, our shots were
falling, and as a result we had fun out there tonight and we had a
win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks made a season-high 46 field goals, scored a
season-high 61 points in the first half, and shot a season-high
52.9 percent from the field. Had the Mavericks played this
efficient all season, they would be in the thick of the playoff
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just so happened that guys hit their shots early,'' said
Gary Trent, who returned from a one-game absence after a right
hamstring injury to score 24 points and grab 10 rebounds. ``I'm
just hoping we can get the eighth seed so I won't have to watch the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   On this night, the Mavericks snapped an 11-game road losing
streak, broke an 11-game losing streak to the Rockets, and probably
made Charles Barkley have second thoughts about that nasty comment
he made last year about the Mavericks not being good enough to win
the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Big Three were no match for the Mavericks. Hakeem
Olajwuon (27 points, 11 rebounds), Barkley (16 points, 14 rebounds)
and Scottie Pippen (2-of-8, four points) could not stop the
onslaught from the Mavericks. Dallas built a 107-81 lead and
cruised to the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Dirk Nowitzki, playing against Pippen _ his boyhood idol
_ used the basket for target practice. Nowitzki nailed 10 of 13
shots and finished with 22 points, including some incredible
long-range shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Break up the Mavericks,'' said Mavericks coach/general manager
Don Nelson in jest. ``I just think we were deserving of some wins
early that we didn't get, so maybe it's that time of the year now
where we're getting some.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets were very hospitable. They played weak on defense
and were completely outhustled by the visitors. The Rockets'
nickname is ``Clutch City,'' but the Mavericks made all of the
clutch plays.
</P>
<P>
   Boos even cascaded from the crowd when John ``Hot Rod'' Williams
snaked behind the Rockets' defense for a stick-back basket and an
88-68 Mavericks lead early in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Hubert Davis added 14 points and Shawn Bradley contributed six
points, 10 rebounds and four blocks.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second consecutive game the Mavericks shot better
than 50 percent from the field. After beating Phoenix (104-100)
Tuesday night, they seem to be kicking their offense in gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two really have surprised me the way we are
playing,'' Nelson said. ``They were both unexpected. I was hoping
to play well and to be around at the end and maybe win it there.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to play with a lead the whole game says that the team is
maturing a little bit and that we're playing with patience. And
that's not easy against a veteran team.'' Nash out Point guard
Steve Nash is out indefinitely with a lower back strain.
</P>
<P>
   Nash got the news after he visited a back specialist yesterday.
Nelson said he wasn't sure when Nash would be able to play again,
but that he definitely wouldn't play tonight against San Antonio or
in Saturday's game in Sacramento. Numbers game
</P>
<P>
   2: First-half points scored by Dirk Nowitzki's childhood idol,
Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   6: Biggest lead by the Rockets in the first half.

TCU SPRINTER RICARDO WILLIAMS' NICKNAME CAME IN A `FLASH'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ ``Flash,'' TCU coach Monte Stratton says, pausing a
second to smile.
</P>
<P>
   He's obviously tickled by that sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that a perfect name for a sprinter or what?'' Stratton
says, finally finishing his thought.
</P>
<P>
   His nickname, like his running, came naturally for Ricardo
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   His running led to his nickname.
</P>
<P>
   Williams remembers fragmented details from that day in 1992 when
he became ``Flash.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembers being surrounded, his classmates gathering to watch
him race another classmate, Omar Bailey. Bailey had developed a
reputation in Jamaica as being St. Jago High School's fastest
sprinter.
</P>
<P>
   Williams simply had decided to try his luck against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I beat him in the 100, 200, everything,'' Williams said. ``So
they started calling me `Flash.' I like that. I've been hearing
that so long.''
</P>
<P>
   His running has taken him from schoolyards in Kingston, Jamaica,
six years ago to TCU this season to Philadelphia and the
prestigious Penn Relays this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   He has remained ``Flash,'' his times now endorsing his nickname.
</P>
<P>
   He has traveled 100 meters in 10.5 seconds this season, going as
low as 10.21 seconds wind-aided. He has traveled 200 meters in
21.52 seconds, going as low as 21.18 with wind help.
</P>
<P>
   He has been instrumental in turning a Horned Frogs' 4x100 relay
team into a good bet to earn back-to-back national championships.
</P>
<P>
   TCU lost Syan Williams and Percy Spencer from 1998's national
championship-winning relay. Ricardo Williams, along with fellow
newcomer Lindel Frater, has stepped in seamlessly and meshed
perfectly with returnees Bryan Howard and Jarmiene Holloway.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Spencer, Syan Williams, Howard and Holloway etched
themselves in collegiate 4x100 relay record books with a time of
38.04. Just a couple of races into this season, Howard, Holloway,
Frater and ``Flash'' have already gone 38.64.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of potential to get better,'' Stratton said,
``and probably Flash most of all. He has had the least preparation
in terms of base and competition over the last two, two and a half
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams transferred from TCU from Southwestern Christian, a
tiny junior college in Terrell where training proved to be a little
less vigorous.
</P>
<P>
   He adapted, though.
</P>
<P>
   His times are dropping week after week after week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, each week I have improved my times,'' Williams
said. ``Coach was surprised that every week I cut down so rapidly.
I'm not real surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   He says this without any hint of ego. If he has any, he has hid
all traces rather well.
</P>
<P>
   For a guy nicknamed ``Flash,'' Williams talks rather slowly,
almost deliberate in manner. His hobbies, books and music, seem
very un-Flash-like.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's quiet, very much a gentleman,'' Stratton said. ``And he's
very, very, very talented.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just keeps getting better with each passing day and with
each degree warmer. He was just ready to really blossom when the
cramp hit him.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has been battling hamstring troubles since he cramped
in an event in Tempe, Ariz., two weeks ago. He'll likely run in
Philadelphia, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   He has been looking forward to the Penn Relays for too long to
miss it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ``the'' meet for the Jamaicans,'' Stratton said. ``All of
the Jamaican high school elite are at the Penn Relays running in
the high school division. So these guys were there as high
schoolers, and they want to show the high schoolers coming up
behind them what they've done and where they are and perform well
in front of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams raced at Penn twice while at St. Jago. He has a 4x100
trophy from 1995 and a 4x400 trophy from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a good meet,'' Williams said. ``There are
several high schools there that have kids who were there when I was
a senior.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams isn't sure if there is anyone around from the old days
who would remember the day he became ``Flash.''
</P>
<P>
   You didn't have to be there, though, to understand. The nickname
sticks not because of how he got it but because of how he runs.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the minority are the people who know him by anything
other than `Flash.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who don't know me call me Ricardo. Most people,''
Williams said, pausing, ``call me Flash.''
</P>
<P>
   What a perfect name for a sprinter.

THERE'S NO SECRET TO FORCE'S `UNFAIR ADVANTAGE'
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From rear spoiler to front air dam to the quarter-panels in
between, NASCAR's ``aerodynamic wars'' have taken on a life of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, teams in the respective Chevrolet, Ford and Pontiac
camps believe that the playing field NASCAR Winston Cup officials
are constantly trying to level is forever tilted in favor of the
other guys.
</P>
<P>
   It's a healthy paranoia, one that has been packing brand-loyal
fans into oval-track grandstands for 51 years.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, a nice aero war is simmering in the NHRA's
Funny Car ranks heading into Texas Motorplex this weekend. At the
epicenter of the debate is _ surprise! _ Team Castrol, better known
as reigning Funny Car champion John Force and teammate Tony
Pedregon.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with their $500,000, Roush-built, replica Ford
Mustang-bodied hot rods, ``Brute Force'' and Tony P. have combined
to win all four National Hot Rod Association national events run
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Force, the eight-time champion and current points leader, has
bagged the past three consecutive races. Force not only hammered
the field at the O'Reilly Nationals at Houston Raceway Park on
April 11, he also reset the national elapsed-time record _ twice.
</P>
<P>
   The magic number for Funny Car ET is 4.788 seconds, and
apparently it's falling heading into the third annual Castrol
Nationals in Ennis. Force also has the national Funny Car speed
record at 324.05 mph, set in March at Gainesville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the domination exhibited by Force and Pedregon
has begun grating on teams running replica Chevrolet Camaro Z/28
and Pontiac Firebird Funny Cars. The new ``swoopy'' Mustang mold
Force successfully lobbied past NHRA officials and onto the
quarter-mile has forced the GM teams to retool in hopes of catching
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Same old stuff,'' Force said after bagging his 73rd career
victory at Baytown. ``Truth is, they're just two real good race
cars and they don't like us. And I'm getting to where I don't care
to argue anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, Force speculated that the first 330 mph pass in a
Funny Car could be run down the all-concrete Motorplex at this
meet. If it happens at the right foot of Force and his Castrol GTX
Ford or Pedregon's Syntec Mustang, expect the whining from the pits
to drown out the nitro engines. That's loud.
</P>
<P>
   Should Force be criticized for having the money, manpower and
moxie to design and develop a better race car body, one he said
produces 17 percent more downforce than its predecessor?
</P>
<P>
   Not at all. This is the ``unfair advantage'' every racing team
dreams of squeezing out of the rulebook. Force, in fact, has spoken
openly about the ingredients that have given him the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with crew chiefs Austin Coil and Bernie Fedderly,
Force's arsenal also features oodles of money supplied by Castrol
and associate sponsors; quality time in the wind tunnel as Ford's
sole Funny Car team; and a recently realized 30 to 40 horsepower
wallop supplied by engine guru Alan Johnson's cylinder heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also don't take vacations. That's another thing,'' Force
said. ``I love all my competitors, and they're mad right now, a
number of 'em. It's not that we're smarter; we're focused and we
have the money to back me up. Go get more money. I don't know what
else to tell 'em.''
BOAT SEES RAY REMATCH IN RUN TO GAIN INDY POLE
</P>
<P>
   A hot lap at 227.072 mph during open testing has installed Greg
Ray of Plano as chalk favorite to win the pole position for the
83rd Indianapolis 500 next month.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean, however, that 1998 pole-winner Billy Boat is
conceding a tenth of a second to his rival when qualifying begins
May 22 at the 2.5-mile Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, two things you've got to remember about open testing,''
said Boat, who drives for four-time Indy 500 champion A.J. Foyt of
Houston. ``Nobody goes through inspection. And when there's
multiple cars on the racetrack, there are times when you can get
behind other cars and get a `tow.' That will give you a mile an
hour, two miles an hour worth of extra speed. So it's hard to say
about that (227) lap.''
</P>
<P>
   We can say that Ray owns the fastest unofficial speed recorded
in a new-formula Pep Boys Indy Racing League car at IMS. The
previous record was 223.797 mph, set by Tony Stewart in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Boat won the pole at Indy last May with a four-lap average of
223.503 mph. Ray, who has replaced Stewart at Team Menard,
qualified No. 2 at IMS at 221.125 mph last year for former team
owner/current team manager Thomas Knapp.
</P>
<P>
   Team Menard has ``shown they can be fast,'' said Boat, who wound
up third on the open test speed chart at 224.456 mph. ``When we go
back there, I think we're going to see a faster pole speed than
last year. I think it's going to take at least a 225 mph average to
win the pole.''
</P>
<P>
   Boat was among a group testing Goodyear tires at Texas Motor
Speedway in Fort Worth this week.
</P>
<P>
   Boat and Ray are running Dallara chassis powered by Indy
Oldsmobile Aurora V-8s. But there are significant differences in
their programs.
</P>
<P>
   Foyt has Roush Racing assembling the Olds engines used by Boat
and teammate Kenny Brack, the reigning IRL champion. Last year,
when Boat won a series-leading six poles and Brack won three races,
their engines were built by Katech.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's engine program at Menard is in-house, and his team is
committed to Firestone Firehawk tires.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ray carries the traditional multicolored splash of
Glidden/Menards, Boat's formerly green Conseco car is devoid of
major sponsorship markings. Conseco and Harrah's are featured as
associates on Boat's otherwise unadorned chassis, which is painted
a very bright red.
</P>
<P>
   Call it Clydesdale Red, perhaps in anticipation of an impending
major sponsorship announcement?
TMS SALES WERE BRISK
</P>
<P>
   Here's another round of statistical ammunition that Eddie
Gossage, executive vice president and general manager of Texas
Motor Speedway, can trot out in his search for additional NASCAR
race dates in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR fans brought voracious appetites for driver collectibles
to race weekend last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sold as much merchandise ($2 million) in four days at Texas
as we did in 11 days at the Daytona 500,'' said Fred Wagenhals,
chairman, president and CEO of Action Performance Companies Inc.
PETTY PANS `WALLBANGERS'
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Petty did the Hot Wheels Pontiac proud at Martinsville
(Va.) Speedway, where he qualified 10th and finished in the same
position after 500 rowdy, short-track laps.
</P>
<P>
   Petty, who led a lap for the first time since the 1997 season
finale, has three top 10s in eight races. But he has also failed to
qualify for two events.
</P>
<P>
   Along with seven-time Cup champion Dale Earnhardt and three-time
champion Darrell Waltrip, Petty has been lumped into an expanding
group of veteran drivers who struggle to qualify in the top 25,
maybe because they have whacked one concrete wall too many?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's the fact we're shy because we've taken some
hard hits,'' said Petty, anticipating the DieHard 500 at the
Talladega (Ala.) Superspeedway on Sunday. ``Our experience on
running fast and how we started to drive was in a different kind of
car with a different kind of tire and different kind of engine and
a different type of horsepower and different type of torque.
</P>
<P>
   ``You went through stages where you were Jack the Bear, where
you could qualify. Then you get to a stage where you're junk again.
I don't think it has anything to do with hitting walls.'' MEET TEAM
FRUSTRATION
</P>
<P>
   If you have any of these drivers on your NASCAR Winston Cup
Fantasy League team, you know what it feels like to write the
checks at Sabco Racing. Consider that:
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt has posted one victory in the past 100 races
(1998 Daytona 500), and has not led a lap in 1999. He last led a
race at Rockingham, N.C., in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Craven has posted four DNFs in eight races this season.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Benson, Jimmy Spencer and Bill Elliott are without a
top-10 finish this season.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Rudd is seeking his first top-15 finish of 1999. LAST
WORDS

LITTLETON COMES TOGETHER IN SORROW 
</HEADLINE>
 SHOOT-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ It remained in the high school parking lot, a
haunting reminder of an evil too enormous to comprehend.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Scott's car. Students said she was missing. The mourning
had begun.
</P>
<P>
   The teenagers sat in a prayer circle next to the dented red
Acura. They decorated it with flowers. They waited for their
friend's fate to be confirmed. And they cursed those responsible
for the hell that had visited Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys who did this, they're going to get theirs. They're
going to rot in infernal damnation,'' said Antwan Rodriguez, a high
school graduate from Arvada, who brought flowers and a teddy bear
to Columbine to honor the victims of the attack. He said his
emotions ran the gamut _ anger, sympathy, love and hate.
</P>
<P>
   On a grassy hill just north of Columbine, other students and
parents stood and waited. There was nothing else to do. Inside the
school, their friends and teachers could be dead, killed in
Tuesday's murderous rampage of bullets and bombs. They didn't know
for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really don't know where to go or what to do,'' said Donna
Krier, whose daughter survived the rampage. ``They're looking for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some brought flowers to put on makeshift memorials, located
under several small trees in the city park. Others huddled in small
groups, hugging and crying and shooing away television cameramen
who got too close.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in this community seemed to be touched by death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a horrible day, as I watched the fear and terror on
the parents' faces who didn't know where their children were,''
Bill Oudemolen, senior pastor at Foothills Bible Church in
Littleton, told his congregation. ``Sadly I have to inform you that
one of our Foothills families is living with the hellish nightmare
of having a son unaccounted for.''
</P>
<P>
   Though few names had been released by late Wednesday afternoon,
many already knew. They had scoured the hospitals, quizzed their
friends, seen the cars still parked forlornly in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, people were missing. About thirteen of them. Already
confirmed dead were the two gunmen, who committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Kayley Boyle, 16, was convinced that one of her teachers, Dave
Sanders, was among the dead. Boyle lives across the street from
Sanders, and had talked to his wife. He never emerged from the
school.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, authorities confirmed that Sanders, 42, was
among the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle said Sanders died a hero, saving students from the gunmen.
Another witness, interviewed by an area TV station, reported that
Sanders had lain wounded for three hours, while students tried to
keep him alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard that he pushed a girl out of the door and got shot
twice in the back,'' said Boyle, choking back tears. ``He was so
nice. He didn't deserve to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders taught business and coached girls basketball. Breanna
Cook, 17, said she was angry with the gunmen, who apparently shot
themselves after the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through a lot of anger, a lot of hurt,'' she said.
``I don't think I'll be able to go back to that high school for a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The names of several students _ rumored to be among the dead _
floated through the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel helpless, that's the thing,'' said Joe Marino, 17. ``My
friends were in there and I couldn't do anything to help them. They
were just at the wrong place at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino called the gunmen, Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold,
17, ``dorks'' and said they always looked angry.
</P>
<P>
   He said the name ``Trench Coat Mafia'' _ a moniker adopted by
the two teens and others who ran with them _ was originally given
to them by other students, as a way to ridicule them.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believed the teens always planned to commit suicide,
as a final satisfaction over their victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just not fair . . . they went out the way they wanted
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Autumn Hettinger, 18, said she saw Harris right before he
entered the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was supposed to go to the library, but something told me not
to go in there,'' she said. ``So I went out to my car, and as I was
driving out, I saw Eric. He had on this black trench coat, and had
this huge bulge around his waist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stood in front of my car and stared at me with this
piercing glare,'' she said. ``I looked at him, like, `Move, Eric,'
and he just walked away.''
</P>
<P>
   Hettinger said Harris and Klebold were good students. She said
she knew Harris, and had even worked on a project for philosophy
class with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw him in the hall he would wave at me and I would
wave back,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Barnes, 15, could not stop crying as she recounted the
horrific events of the past day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this big bang, like somebody hit a locker,'' she
said. ``The teacher went out to see, and said all she could see was
people running everywhere . . . then someone said, you've got to
get out of here, somebody's got a gun. Then I heard the bullets.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said everyone had to pull together to get through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to cry on me and I'm going to cry on you and
we'll cry together,'' he said. ``It can happen anywhere, and that's
what (Littleton) is _ anywhere.''

MANY FACES, 1 EXPRESSION
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID LEIBOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ They had started arriving by the time
daylight began to fil ter through the tree's naked limbs. They came
to Clement Park with hand-scripted posters, rosary beads and newly
bought bouquets in their arms, and with their eyes drizzling tears.
They came to that thin sapling within sight of Colum bine High
School all Wednesday long.
</P>
<P>
   To a man, to a woman, to a child, each arrival shared the same
face.
</P>
<P>
   It was an expression simulta neously intense and flat, numb and
full of hurt, a stare that bored into the tree like the bit of a
drill. The man fingering his rosary wore it. So did the football
player trying to hide his face behind scabbed fingers. So did the
teenage girl whose lips moved as she silently recited the sign on
the ground at her feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is our future? To all my peers who lost their lives and
inno cence.''
</P>
<P>
   She added her three white carna tions to the pile. Her footsteps
tracked through the wet grass. Her face never changed.
</P>
<P>
   Kind of like the day.
</P>
<P>
   They wore that same look all across Littleton on Wednesday, in
the aftermath of Columbine High School, as the 15 bodies left
behind began to come out one by one, and the story of Eric Harris
and Dylan Klebold, the killers, began to come out one mouthful at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Baumgart, a Columbine senior, stood not 10 yards from the
tree, staring past it. He went to grade school with Klebold, he
said, was friends with him in the Boy Scouts during middle school.
By Columbine, though, by the time Nick, Harris and Klebold shared a
video production class junior year, everyone could sense the
separation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really wasn't the students se cluding them. It was kind of
mu tual,'' he said. ``They pushed themselves away, and in turn the
student body kind of pushed them away. But there was nothing to
clue you in that something like this could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Not until gunfire and explosions ripped holes in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   And five holes in 17-year-old Richard Castaldo.
</P>
<P>
   The junior's father, Rick, flew to Colorado from Virginia within
hours of flipping on CNN. As his son lay upstairs in critical
condition in the Swedish Medical Center's ICU _ spleen gone, two
ribs bro ken and a bullet left embedded in his back _ Rick stepped
outside wearing the Littleton look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard has a breathing tube, but he looks pretty good to
me,'' he said. ``What the nurses have done is, they put a pen in
his right hand. He has both arms bandaged, but they hold a
clipboard up and every time he writes, he writes, `When does the
breathing tube come out?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Out comes the father's wallet and a picture of his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fortunate,'' he explains. ``Even though my son still has a
bullet in him and he's in critical, I feel fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Dr. Phil Mallory, though his downcast eyes worked like a
sur gical mask.
</P>
<P>
   His patient, Anne Marie Hochal ter, 17, was among the first to
arrive Tuesday, in deep shock, shot through her chest and liver.
Mallory served in the Army Medical Corps during Desert Storm. The
condition of the teens and the doctoring re minded him of battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We literally went to the operat ing room with our fingers in
the dike as far as her liver injury was concerned,'' he said. ``My
thought . . . was `My God, if I don't do something quick, this
pretty little girl is going to die.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Marie did not, will not, though 15 others have. This kept
men, women and children coming to that bare tree a few hundred
yards from the school all day long. The flower pile grew until it
seemed feet deep, and a pinwheel fluttered lightly when the wind
picked up. Each new arrival wore that same face.
</P>
<P>
   From dawn to dusk, they prayed, wept, laid gifts and stared with
a vengeance at that sapling.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of eyes looked for hours, face after face, and no one
saw a thing. &QL;

VIEWING WORKERS AS INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Perhaps in the past few weeks you've leafed
through one or more corporate annual reports. Perhaps you've run
across the phrase ``our people are our most important asset.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's the cliche of the decade. Some companies actually mean it
and treat their workers that way. Others put it in the annual
report because it's a ``best practices'' thing to say; they really
count their people as expenses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Overuse and misuse bequeaths ``our people are our most important
asset'' a place in the social conscience right next to ``I'm from
the government and I'm here to help you.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thus, I'm grateful to Kevin McCarthy, a business professor at
Baker University in Baldwin City, Kan., who directed me to an essay
by Kevin Wheeler, president of Global Learning Resources and a
corporate education and recruiting consultant. Wheeler says he
winces twice every time he sees ``our people are our most important
asset.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I wince the first time because I know that most executives
really believe that labor is a cost, just like steel or
semiconductors, and want to get it as cheaply as they can,''
Wheeler wrote. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I wince a second time because an asset is by definition a
possession or something we can own and control, and we can do
neither (legally) to people.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, if employees aren't assets or expenses, what are they? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Investors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler's reasoning: Employees choose to invest their talents,
skills, time and energy _ instead of dollars _ in the organization,
and they expect a return on that investment, just as financial
investors do. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the continued tight labor market, qualified workers are in
demand. Those who have the expertise sought by employers can, and
do, change jobs quickly and often if they don't think they're
rewarded for their contributions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Investor/workers will pull their investments when they can get
higher returns elsewhere, just as individuals pull their accounts
from one bank and move them to another where the interest rate is
higher or fees are lower. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The notion of employees as investors is in sync with the trend
of performance-based pay, incentives and bonuses. Straight salaries
are long since dead for competitively sought executives; now
they're fading for some of the rank and file, too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's not that today's workers are coddled babies born in or to
the Me Generation. It's not that they need constant stroking. It's
that they want a fair return on their investment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I've seen several employee surveys recently that sound similar
themes: About one-third of all full-time U.S. workers are changing
or seriously considering changing their jobs at any given time.
When they change, they usually jump for more money. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pay isn't the only return on worker investment, but it's a huge
indicator of how a company rates employee contributions.
Financially and emotionally, money talks. So do opportunities for
professional development, job security and better benefits such as
health insurance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Good places to work provide those. Plus, they care as much about
recruiting and retaining their investor/workers as they do their
financial investors. &QL;

COLORADO SCHOOL'S PAIN PROVIDES POWERFUL REMINDER FOR KANSAS CITY
AREA SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY SANCHEZ  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The question for local schools now is, ``Can
what happened in Littleton occur here?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The security chief for what is perhaps the area's most heavily
guarded district posed a concise answer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``People have walked into some of the most heavily secured
businesses, like banks, and still do these type of things,'' said
John L. Coleman, director of safety and security for the Kansas
City, Mo., School District. ``I doubt seriously if it could have
been prevented.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't to say that Kansas City and other area districts
don't use a variety of measures to ensure the safety of students.
Many efforts involve reaching troubled youth before they act out
violently. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But several area school officials said that if students are
heavily armed and determined _ as the Colorado shooters were _ even
metal detectors and armed police in schools might not be able to
stop such mass killings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to try to achieve a balance between keeping an
atmosphere conducive to teaching and learning but also provide
enough protective measures to ensure the safety of the students and
staff,'' Coleman said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, students at Hickman Mills High School were
checked with hand-held metal detectors as they entered the
building. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The detectors are used randomly at the schools and at school
events. But Wednesday's check came partly because of the shootings
in Colorado, said Gary Martasin, director of public relations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just trying to reinforce the message that we are
serious and concerned about school safety,'' Martasin said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The district requires its faculty to wear photo identification
badges. Work crews and other visitors to the schools are also
required to wear badges. Martasin predicted some districts might
eventually require students to wear identification. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mike Thomas, manager of risk and safety for the Blue Valley
School District in Johnson County, Kan., said the district's most
recent safety measure _ a $66,942 surveillance camera system at
Blue Valley Northwest High School _ wouldn't have prevented a
tragedy like Littleton. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect the cameras would not have fazed them,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Uniformed police officers are assigned full time to Shawnee
Mission district high schools in Johnson County, and the district's
campus police provide extra security, said Shelley Bartkoski,
communications director. Students are encouraged to call hot lines
at each school where they can anonymously report problems. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent David Smith said Excelsior Springs High School in
Excelsior Springs, Mo., will have an intruder-alert rehearsal today
Thursday, as part of its crisis plan. The high school added video
cameras this year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Middle School in Libery, Mo., by coincidence, had its
first planned practice lockdown _ in which all school doors are
locked and students aren't allowed to leave _ on Tuesday morning as
part of its crisis plan, said Mary Pat Shelledy, the school's
principal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a crisis drill; they had a crisis,'' Shelledy said of
Columbine High School. &QL;

<P>
   Isolated and resentful of popular classmates, the self-described
outcasts hatched a plot to gun down classmates and teachers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They developed elaborate plans to cut phone lines, lock down the
school and meticulously execute those on a hit list. Authorities
called it a suicide mission. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the bloodbath never happened. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Burlington, Wis., learned of the plan days before
it was scheduled to take place last fall, when a student informed
police. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After shootings in other states, Burlington officials were part
of a growing move to intervene aggressively to prevent violence.
Tuesday's massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.,
provided a stark reminder of the potential dangers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a situation that could have turned out the same way,''
Superintendent Ron Jandura said Wednesday.`` ... But we were
fortunate that someone was brave enough to step forward, that the
administration took the threat seriously and that police didn't
look the other way.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Littleton slayings cannot be attributed to a single
cause, experts in education, sociology and law enforcement say
there is no single method for preventing such carnage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they see a larger societal challenge that must be
addressed with positive influences of parents and peer groups,
intervention with mediation and counseling programs like those used
in the Park Hill School District in Platte County, Mo., and
preparation by school officials and law enforcement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And, experts said, students need to help ensure their own safety
by refusing to look the other way when classmates exhibit aberrant
behavior. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That is a key, said Joanne McDaniel, research director at the
Center for the Prevention of School Violence in Raleigh, N.C. After
school shootings across the country last year, it became apparent
that students knew a lot more than the adults did about the
destructive behaviors of the shooters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Communities need to cultivate a climate where children's
opinions are valued, she said: ``Then when you do have kids who are
outcasts and potentially destructive, the other kids will let the
adults know about this.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Geenens, a child psychiatrist in private practice in
Overland Park, Kan., who is on the staff of the Crittenton Center,
cited the need for society to intervene earlier. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Just in my practice alone, there are dozens of kids who have
the potential to do something like this,'' Geenens said. ``What
this is for us is a cold slap in the face, because this can happen
here and it probably will ... because we are not giving these kids
what they need.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As children approach adolescence, parents must make sure they
have a positive peer group, whether it centers on athletics, music,
4-H, chess or church, Geenens said. That's because once they reach
adolescence, peer groups, not parents, become primary influences in
a child's life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones who aren't accepted in these will find each other,
and bad things can happen,'' Geenens said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Failing in school, making few friends and having little in
common with peers are some of the signs of children at risk,
Geenens said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Society cannot ignore these problems, said Elaine Johannes, a
community mental-health specialist at Kansas State University in
Manhattan, because children have the means to arm themselves. So
adults must be tuned in to what's happening in a child's life, she
said, and the earlier the better. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so much easier to work on this when they're 6 than when
they're 16, and they're big, and they have friends, and they don't
communicate the way they used to,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Troubled students get lots of help at Park Hill High School in
Parkville, Mo., said Assistant Principal Janet Nease. Preventive
efforts there are enormously time-consuming, Nease said, but she
believes the investment has paid off by creating an atmosphere
within the 1,500-student school where students feel supported
through their difficulties. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Support groups that meet during the school day, for example.
Often, when students who feel isolated join those groups, they
realize they're not alone, Nease said. Since those groups formed,
Nease has noticed a drop in discipline referrals to her office. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Schools also need a climate of trust so students who notice
changes in their peers or hear rumors of violence will feel
comfortable telling someone about potential danger, she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Park Hill uses two student groups to help defuse dangerous
situations. Peer mediators can arbitrate disputes between students,
and a group called ``Natural Helpers'' offers peer counseling for
students who request it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said even elementary-school students must be
encouraged to report talk of violence. Students might be willing if
they viewed it as protecting friends, rather than tattling. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Officials and teachers in the Blue Valley School District in
Johnson County, Kan., are advised to take seriously every threat
students make about harming themselves or others, said Bruce
Passman, executive director for student services. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, everyone loses when something like that happens in
one school,'' Passman said. ``It rocks us all. You can only ask,
`Can it happen here?' The answer is, `Yes, it can.' '' &QL;

SCHOOLS DEAL WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT COLORADO SHOOTINGS 
</HEADLINE>

 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Wednesday was a hectic day at Heart of
America Family Services. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   School administrators called to see whether the agency's
counselors could talk to students about the massacre at Columbine
High School in Littleton, Colo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some callers talked about threats they had heard. Students
called to talk about school safety, and parents shared concerns
about their own children, who they feared might be capable of
violence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens when you have a national crisis like this is that
it's not far away anymore,'' said Betsy VanderVelde, president of
the agency. ``It could happen to us.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For students in the Hickman Mills High School in Jackson County,
Mo., winter drum line and winter guard, the tragedy hit close to
home. The 40 band members were at Columbine High a month ago for a
band competition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hickman Mills band director Michael Wright said some of the
Kansas City, Mo., students made friends at Columbine. They plan to
send cards, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact we were there ... it kind of spooked them quite a
bit,'' Wright said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VanderVelde stressed that everyone needs to talk about what
happened in Colorado. Discussion has prevented crises from
happening here, she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Recently, she said, counselors learned of a 16-student suicide
pact at an area high school. Agency counselors talked to the
students and defused the situation, she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Students at schools throughout the area devoted a lot of time
Wednesday to talking about the killings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Lindbergh Elementary School in Kansas City, Kan.,
fourth-grader Lenora Hyche critically examined the condolence card
she was making for parents of the students killed in the massacre. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Lenora decorated her card with stickers, green grass and
purple-red flowers, she discussed the tragedy with classmates
hunched over their own cards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty sad about it. Now the parents lost their kids,''
she said. ``For those kids to just burst in there and say, `I'm
going to kill you.' That's terrible.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh teacher Michelle Wilson thought the conversation and
card-making exercise would help her 15 fourth- and fifth-graders
cope with the news _ and possibly prevent similar tragedies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My main goal is to make the kids aware that death is
permanent. It is not something to joke about. It is real,'' Wilson
said. ``I thought by sending the cards to the family, they'd think
about that more. That these are real people.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most schools told students that counselors were available to
talk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to comprehend the magnitude of it all, but I'm not
shocked something happened again,'' said Jim Andra, a counselor at
Shawnee Mission Northwest High School in Johnson County, Kan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Andra pointed out that school shootings have happened in Pearl,
Miss.; Paducah, Ky.; Jonesboro, Ark.; Edinboro, Pa.; Fayetteville,
Tenn.; and Springfield, Ore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of students out there who are troubled,'' he
said. ``I think it's a reflection of our society. There's a lot of
problems with families these days.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No students came to speak to Andra on Wednesday, but an office
worker said at least 30 parents had called. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shawnee Mission Northwest's unofficial Web site contained
several student responses to the tragedy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching the news about the school shooting in Colorado
and this is the only school shooting that has made me stop and
think if SMNW is a safe place to be,'' one student wrote. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Shawnee Mission West in Johnson County, Principal John Laurie
said some students appeared numb and teary-eyed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw kids hugging,'' Laurie said. ``There's a lot to talk
about.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Blue Springs High School in Blue Springs, Mo., where teachers
and students have been evacuated five of the past six school days
because of bomb threats, no special arrangements were made to offer
counseling or organized discussions about the shootings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If a student needs us, we are here for them, but we feel like
if you tell students they need counseling, suddenly everyone
does,'' said Yvonne Evans, spokeswoman for Blue Springs schools. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Students at Lee's Summit High School in Lee's Summit, Mo., were
called into a morning assembly where the entire school observed a
moment of silence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Raytown School District in Raytown, Mo., sent out a memo
outlining security measures at the schools and informing the media
and parents about the district's dress code, which prohibits
students from wearing long coats to school. The killers in Colorado
reportedly wore black trench coats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Southwick, superintendent of schools in Belton, Mo., said
the district held a staff meeting Wednesday morning to discuss the
killings as well as the bomb threats at Blue Springs and two arsons
this week at Ruskin High School. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don Schempp, vice president of clinical and community services
for Heart of America Family Services, said people need to identify
troubled students so they can be helped right away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very fine line between being homicidal and suicidal
for some individuals,'' Schempp said. ``I sympathize with schools:
They're trying to run an institution of 800 or 900 kids, but find
themselves busy with kids who have problems because parents
sometimes won't deal with these stressed-out kids.'' &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The Dallas Mavericks _ for whom success is landing a lucky pingpong
ball in the draft lottery _ did not stop with whipping the Rockets
on Wednesday night. They mocked them.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They didn't just outwork them, care more, play harder, score
more easily. They didn't just go up by 26 points, inspiring the
fans at Compaq Center to either boo or just get up and leave as if
they had dropped garbage at the side of the curb.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks laughed in the Rockets' faces, knowing on this
night the Rockets had no legitimate retort in a 109-95 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was jaw-jacking them all night,'' Mavericks forward Gary
Trent said before laughing openly. ``I told Scottie Pippen there's
only one No. 33 that was going to show up tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   On defense, Pippen was toasted by 20-year-old German rookie Dirk
Nowitzki, who idolizes him, and Michael Finley. Pippen did less on
the other end, making two of eight shots for four points.
</P>
<P>
   But just about every Rockets player could fall into the no-show
category. Even Charles Barkley and Hakeem Olajuwon, though putting
up respectable numbers, never seemed sharp or could jostle their
team from its obvious grogginess.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (ticks) me off,'' Rockets center Antoine Carr said. ``We
didn't come out to play. I'll put it on all 12 of us. If we're
going to win a championship, we've got to come and play every
night. Either come to play, or sit your (butt) at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played with no emotion, no intensity. Either come to play,
or go home and go to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets did not have to get their winks at home.
Instead, they sleepwalked through most of Wednesday's game,
jump-starting Finley, Trent and Nowitzki to a combined 73 points.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the second quarter, the Mavericks were pushing 70
percent shooting. Midway through the second half, they were clearly
on their way to their first road win since Feb. 20. And that was
against the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets began the night just a game ahead of the Lakers for
the fourth seed in the Western Conference playoffs. But with LA
losing at Portland, the Rockets couldn't capitalize and boost their
edge for home-court advantage in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't figure that out,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich
said. ``There's no way, with everything so obvious _ the goals, the
situation we're in _ to get that kind of performance. I'm baffled.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got their confidence going. They made good shots. They
made easy shots. We never got it going, ever. I'm baffled. I can't
give you an explanation. We just showed up. Our guys have got to
understand it's a big deal (for teams) to play us. We're a
high-profile team. They came to play; we didn't. I can't understand
it with everything at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rockets guard/forward Sam Mack of the damage such losses
can cause: ``We had a talk about that. We can't throw away the
season like this. We came out and plain (stunk).''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley offered an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give the Mavericks credit,'' he said again and again. ``They
just played terrific tonight. Give them credit. Give them credit.
Michael Finley was unbelievable. We had no answer for him. Trent
played well. Nowitzki played well.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets gave Finley and Nowitzki unobstructed target
practice outside and Trent a running start into the lane to get his
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the outset, when the Rockets rushed to a 16-8 lead
within five minutes, the teams were flying up and down the court to
easy baskets. And as much as that was a portent of things to come,
it also revisited Monday's second half, when injury-depleted
Seattle rolled to 68 points.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, talent- and injury-depleted Dallas (point guard
Steve Nash was out with back spasms) scored nearly as easily,
rolling up a 61-49 halftime lead, the most prolific first half
against the Rockets this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks answered the Rockets' quick start with a 15-2 run,
completed when Tomjanovich marched onto the court to protest an
illegal defense and drew a technical foul. That run took all of 3{
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Rockets closed within 31-30 early in the second
quarter, they never picked up their defense. This time when the
Mavs put together a 15-2 run, they needed just over two minutes,
pulling ahead 46-32 four minutes into the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the moment the ball was tossed, we never could establish
ourselves,'' Pippen said. ``We were on our heels all night. We
never stopped them. Even when we played well offensively, we didn't
stop them from scoring. It does bother us. No matter what your
offensive game is doing, you have to establish your defense. If
you're not going to play any defense, you're not going to beat
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Down to their last realistic chance of mounting an attack on the
Mavericks' lead _ the sort of comeback that has become routine for
Rockets opponents _ the Rockets began the fourth quarter down 18.
They immediately increased the deficit to 23.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich cleared his bench with 4:31 left, and the Mavericks
slapped around the subs for a few minutes, pushing the margin to 26
before Dallas coach Don Nelson had mercy on a beaten opponent.
</P>
<P>
   But even when the Mavericks stopped pushing them around, the
Rockets beat themselves up nearly as thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no justification for this,'' Olajuwon said. ``You
can't take any team lightly in this league. There is just no
excuse. Every game is just as important as the last. This was a big
setback, no question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Big enough for even the Mavericks to find it amusing.

U.S. IS PRESSED TO CONSIDER GROUND TROOPS FOR KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs first four grafs for updating and rewriting)  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON and CRAIG WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ On the eve of the NATO summit meeting in
Washington, Britain and France are pressing the United States to
start thinking seriously about sending ground forces into Kosovo
without a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   With the meeting, commemorating NATO's 50th anniversary, opening
on Friday, there is still no consensus about using a powerful
ground force to drive Serbian troops and paramilitary police units
out of Kosovo. The differences are so pronounced that the issue has
been left off the formal agenda.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Clinton administration has been wary of any
suggestions involving ground troops in a combat role, and American
officials have generally tried to avoid public discussion of the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday night, Washington signaled some flexibility,
agreeing to a broad review of the options that NATO developed last
summer on the use of ground troops in Kosovo. That review will now
proceed, Javier Solana, the NATO Secretary General, said on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The behind-the-scenes debate broke out into the open this week
in a coordinated series of statements by Britain's prime minister,
defense minister and foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   With four weeks of bombing attacks already behind them, they
argued that weeks, if not months, of sustained bombing might
sufficiently weaken the Serb military so that NATO ground forces
could move into Kosovo and establish order with limited casualties.
The scenario has been discussed so much in the corridors of NATO
headquarters here that it even has a name: ``a semi-permissive
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The British proposal would be a major shift from the NATO's
current plan, which is to send in a peacekeeping force of 28,000
troops, but only if President Slobodan Milosevic withdraws his
forces from Kosovo and accepts a peace settlement that allows the
hundreds of thousands of exiled ethnic Albanians to return to their
shattered homes.
</P>
<P>
   As Robin Cook, Britain's foreign minister put it Tuesday in an
address to Parliament, it is possible to ``conceive of
circumstances in which it may be feasible to commit ground
troops.''
</P>
<P>
   The main condition would be the assurance that NATO's force were
not facing ``organized armed resistance.'' As British officials
tell it, Milosevic would not be given a ``veto'' over the
introduction of allied ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   The British are not alone in pressing for the possible
introduction of ground forces. President Jacques Chirac of France
said in a televised speech Wednesday night that the alliance should
apply ``additional means'' besides escalating the air war to stop
``massacres, rapes, burned villages, families separated and thrown
onto the roads.''
</P>
<P>
   French officials said Chirac's statement was an allusion to
ground forces, and that France's plan was to seek a U.N. Security
Council resolution mandating such a force, though such a request
would almost certainly face a Russian veto. President Boris Yeltsin
has objected strenuously to any thought of the West sending in
ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the entire question of ground forces going into
potential combat in Kosovo has been highly sensitive. American
officials have sought to avoid public discussion of the matter.
Defense Secretary William Cohen suggested on Wednesday that the
matter of ground troops did not need to be decided because Gen.
Wesley K. Clark, the NATO commander, had not officially requested
authority to plan a military operation using combat forces.
</P>
<P>
   Left unstated was the fact that NATO's military commander was
not about to propose a major escalation in the fighting unless the
United States, the leader of the alliance, was behind it and was
ready to use its political influence to build support for a
decision to send in ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   But after saying for weeks that no such planning was necessary,
the White House said on Wednesday that it was time to study the
size and composition of the forces that would be needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. would certainly support as a prudent measure any
updating of the assessments of the use of ground troops in a
permissive and non-permissive environment,'' the White House
official said on Wednesday evening. ``It would be irresponsible for
us not to periodically update our plans.''
</P>
<P>
   The allies were not the only ones the Clinton administration
appeared to have in mind. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is seeking
the Republican presidential nomination, has lambasted the Clinton
administration for starting an air campaign against Yugoslavia
without a backup plan for combat troops.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, all the allies agree the bombing needs to go on for a
long time. Clark has repeatedly argued that the bombing campaign
has to have time to do its work and that it is too early to say if
it will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the 29th day of bombing, allied planes hit
the headquarters of Milosevic's party in Belgrade, a
glass-and-steel 23-story building that also housed three local
television and radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister George Robertson of Britain described the
building as ``one of the nerve centers of the machine which plans
the killing in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Western diplomats say Clark has told allied leaders
that he cannot guarantee that bombing attacks alone will compel
Milosevic to withdraw Serbian troops from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, NATO nations have yet to ask him to draw up a new
plan to send in combat troops, nor has he asked for the authority
to begin planning.
</P>
<P>
   The review of military options, which the Clinton administration
says it now supports, stops considerably short of that.
</P>
<P>
   Even if there was a plan, lengthy preparations would be needed
to assemble the force. Even then, no ground attack could be carried
out without the approval of the entire 19-member alliance.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of an agreement, diplomats here initially sought
to paper over their differences. But lately, the British have
insisted that ground troops might be needed to bring the war to an
end.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, Prime Minister Tony Blair met with Clinton in
Washington Wednesday night in an apparent effort to persuade him to
do more to actively prepare in case land forces were needed.
</P>
<P>
   Blair made the case for this after meeting at NATO headquarters
with l Clark on Tuesday. He drew a distinction between sending in
ground troops against tough Serb resistance and sending them in
after punishing NATO bombing had taken the fight out of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always made clear the difficulties of putting in
ground forces as a land force invasion against undegraded organized
Serb resistance,'' Blair said. ``We have also equally made it clear
that the international military force is there to allow people to
go back to their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Going in on the ground would mark a huge departure for NATO,
which has been as preoccupied with maintaining public support at
home for the military campaign as in taking the war to Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany would probably be in
favor of sending ground troops to Kosovo, but one European official
speculated that Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer's Greens Party
might break apart over the issue, collapsing the government.
</P>
<P>
   Canada would not oppose an alliance consensus, Prime Minister
Jean Chretien said in Montreal on Tuesday. ``If everyone is in
agreement, I will not be the only one disagreeing,'' Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
   The French position is less bold than it seems. French officials
say that France would be prepared to send in troops but only with a
mandate for such a force from the U.N. Security Council, which
would require persuading Russia not to use its veto power there.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a tall order since Moscow is adamantly opposed to
any force that does not have Milosevic's approval.
</P>
<P>
   NATO members will have ample opportunity to debate the issue at
the summit. Their foreign ministers and defense ministers will also
have separate meetings of their own on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of ground troops is not on the agenda in Washington,
but the leaders are certainly going to be talking about it, in
bilateral meetings, over dinner, informally,'' a high European
official of the alliance said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British, the French and the Turks might all be willing to
go in with ground troops,'' he added. ``Others are more reticent.
But what do the Americans want?''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been reluctant to take the lead
in thinking about a land operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an American-led organization,'' the senior European
official said. ``If the Americans said we can't let Milosevic get
away with this, we've got to go in with ground troops, then each
country would have to consider the issue and make a decision. And
we could agree that only the countries that wanted to would
contribute.''

TIGERS BEAT RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ If he were a pitcher, John Valentin said, he'd take
one look at the Red Sox lineup and decide he wasn't going to let
Nomar Garciaparra beat him, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have other guys beat me than him,'' Valentin said
after the Red Sox lost, 9-2, Wednesday night to the Detroit Tigers.
``That's just the way ballgames are played. It's a chess match.
He's going to have to be more patient to get a good pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the Red Sox these days, of course, is not
patience but production. While the Tigers unloaded a four-home run
barrage on Tim Wakefield and Mark Guthrie, with third baseman Dean
Palmer going deep twice and adding a two-run double on a five-RBI
night, the Sox offense remained more rumor than reality Wednesday
night, even as manager Jimy Williams shuffled the names on his
lineup card for the 12th time in 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   Of their eight hits, only Reggie Jefferson's double went for
extra bases. Both of the Sox' runs were the product of infield
hits, and for the sixth time in their last seven games, they
managed just two runs or fewer. Their record in that stretch, not
surprisingly, is 2-5.
</P>
<P>
   For some Sox players, like Mike Stanley, who is now 0 for his
last 16 _ a hitless funk exceeded only by the 0 for 21 of benched
rookie Trot Nixon _ bats have fallen silent. For Garciaparra, it's
more a matter of his bat being taken out of his hands.
</P>
<P>
   In the five games since the Red Sox shortstop returned to the
lineup after straining his left hamstring, Garciaparra has five
hits, all but one a single. So far this season, he has as many
walks (seven) as he has hits _ remember, this is a guy who last
season walked just 33 times in 645 plate appearances _ and has as
many RBIs (one) as his buddy Lou Merloni.
</P>
<P>
   So while Garciaparra might wish to singlehandedly rejuvenate the
offense, the way his mere presence seemed to ignite the team upon
his return last Saturday at Fenway Park, it's not that simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm not going to go out there and force things,''
said Garciaparra, who beat out an infield hit in the fourth and
scored the Sox' first run, which came after Palmer already had
cuffed Wakefield for a two-run home run in the second and a
bases-loaded double in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to go out there and be forced to swing at
pitches that the pitchers want me to swing at,'' said Garciaparra,
who these days sees a fastball about as often as Dan Duquette hears
a good word on talk radio. ``I have to stay within myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have confidence in everybody on my team. I can't change from
game to game. I don't care who's hitting behind me, if I walk, I
have confidence that they'll have the chance to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Garciaparra's confidence has gone unrewarded, though
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night's cleanup hitter, Jefferson, had two hits,
including his two-out double in the eighth. By that time, however,
the Sox were in hopeless mode, as the Tigers scored four times in
the seventh on doubles by Brian Hunter and Bobby Higginson off
newcomer Tim Harikkala and back-to-back home runs by Tony Clark and
Palmer off Guthrie.
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie, who already had arrived at the mound, had to wait out a
13-minute rain delay before throwing a pitch to Clark. Asked if the
delay might have impacted his offerings, Guthrie scoffed. ``Not at
all,'' he said. For emphasis, he described himself with a
hair-curling expression.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield, who now hasn't made it out of the fourth inning in
either of his last two starts, was similarly unsparing in assessing
his effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stink, basically,'' said the knuckleballer, whacked for
eight hits, four for extra bases, in just 3 2/3 innings. ``The
ball's not doing what it's supposed to be doing, and they're
hitting (the stuffing) out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield's night might not have turned as sour if Darren Lewis,
playing right field in place of Nixon, had been able to find
Higginson's liner with two on and one out in the third. Lewis lost
the ball in the lights and at the last moment turned away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lights here are big, real big,'' Lewis said. ``The light
poles are real big, with a lot of lights. I lost it just as it got
to me. I was hoping I could catch it without seeing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball fell for a single, loading the bases, and after
Wakefield struck out Clark, Palmer drove a ball off the right-field
wall that just missed being a grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   Two runs scored, and it would have been three except for a
scorching relay by Garciaparra to catcher Jason Varitek, who
blocked Higginson's advance to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sox can't score runs, with or without obstacles at home
plate. Five times Wednesday night, they went down in order against
Tigers starter Brian Moehler and two relievers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing we can do about it,'' Lewis said, ``but to
keep going out there scrapping, finding some way to get it done.
That's all you can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relax, and things will get better. But right now, everybody's
struggling a little bit. Maybe we're not as relaxed as we should
be, which is what happens when things aren't going well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just got to try and keep a positive frame of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   And hope one of these days, someone makes a mistake to Nomar.

EXPERTS THEORIZE ABOUT WHAT FUELED KILLERS' ANGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DEBERA CARLTON HARRELL AND VANESSA HO  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Why would two teenage boys plant bombs, open fire on
classmates, kill themselves and time a bomb to explode after they
had died?
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the killers likely were time bombs themselves who
blew after not being heard and who felt alienated from both peers
and their community.
</P>
<P>
   While nobody knows exactly what provoked Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold to carry out an apparently carefully planned massacre of
peers at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., experts say a
sense of alienation and not belonging may have played a major role.
</P>
<P>
   That same alienation also appears to have played a role in
previous school shootings across the nation, according to
Seattle-area psychologists, counselors and family therapists who
deal with angry and violent at-risk kids.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say it's unlikely the two Columbine High School youths
liked being outcasts. Some speculate that the massacre might have
been the killers' odious way of communicating their own ``inner
woundedness'' and pain at feeling disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think there is a level of rage among young
people, especially young people who think they are disconnected
from mainstream society and mainstream opportunities,'' said Jim
Theofelis, a mental health therapist who specializes in at-risk
youth and works both in private practice and as a consultant to the
King County Department of Youth Services.
</P>
<P>
   He and others said the shooters in Littleton might have given
the impression they wanted to be different as a defense mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's playground psychology: You reject me, I reject you,''
Theofelis said. ``Making all kids feel included, and getting kids
the emotional support they need instead of leaving them to their
own devices _ where they hook up with other kids who feel
disassociated and support each other in their anger and rage _ is
something we as a society have to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Trupin, professor and vice chairman of the Department of
Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the University of Washington
in Seattle, said ``alienation, a sense of not belonging, is
absolutely a running theme'' in numerous school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feeling like an outcast can be a powerful force for violence,
particularly if you're in a situation where you don't have any
reality testing from others who can challenge your viewpoint,''
Trupin said. ``The temperament a lot of these kids appear to have _
the sense of alienation and being on the outside _ is definitely a
factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Trupin said kids who see themselves as outsiders often feel
deprived by ``not going out with the prettiest girl, having the
nicest clothes, getting the best grades or making the team.'' And
they often tend to blame others for their deprivation _ perceived
or real _ rather than taking responsibility and trying to improve
themselves, Trupin and others said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to open this up as a dialogue, and try to find more
ways to coach parents, teachers, students, counselors, ministers,
primary care health providers and others about helping kids feel
more included,'' Trupin said.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Williams, a program manager for counseling and
psychological services for Seattle Public Schools, said a core
issue of the Colorado shooting was how isolated the suspects
appeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``All students go through some of that. What moved these
students over the edge? It's hard to know what additional factors
contributed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the Seattle district has many programs in place to
reach out to loner students, including peer counseling, an
elementary social skills program and intervention teams that
identify and help at-risk students.
</P>
<P>
   At Garfield High School in Seattle yesterday, students said the
descriptions of the Colorado suspects sound like loners and
outcasts they know.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got people who are exactly like that. When I heard about
them, I thought, we have a trench coat mafia here,'' said junior
Andrew Spieth, 17. ``But that's just their appearance. I've never
seen them do anything outright mean or cold-hearted.''
</P>
<P>
   Students knew kids who listened to Marilyn Manson and wore black
``Gothic'' clothing, but didn't fear them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think kids who do this stuff don't have any self-esteem.
They don't have anyone to talk to except each other,'' said David
Main, 18.
</P>
<P>
   Students said Garfield has its cliques but is generally an
accepting environment because of its large diversity. Still, they
all knew a few people who were often shunned, and they re-evaluated
their behavior in light of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gun legislation only touches the surface. In high school,
there's always the issue of acceptance. I mean, we don't feel
accepted all the time,'' said Melissa Slaker, 17. ``Maybe all it
takes is taking the time to say `Hi' to someone, or smiling at
someone, or saying, `Why don't you have lunch with me?'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like that Michael Jackson song _ you have to look at the
man in the mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   Lou Willner, an assistant principal at Garfield, said the
``dynamics of kids getting picked on has always been around.... But
if you're dealing with deranged people, it's hard to predict how
they will react.''
</P>
<P>
   What should teachers look for? Signs of depression, aggression,
withdrawal and extreme behavioral changes, according to the Seattle
School District's Williams. She said counselors also try to
understand family dynamics and examine physical and mental health.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to alienation, experts say other factors behind
violence include availability of guns, prevalence of violence in
the media and social tolerance of it.
</P>
<P>
   William Singer, a family counselor in Redmond, Wash., who
specializes in high-risk and difficult kids and families, believes
there are always ``red flags'' signaling impending trouble and that
society needs to learn to recognize this ``early warning system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, kids headed for violence and anger are easy to
spot,'' Singer said. ``There will always be exceptions, but many
times there are flags that either have not been recognized, or
dismissed or ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer and others say those flags can range from argumentative
or defiant behavior early on to lack of empathy for other kids and
animals. Trouble signs include kids who have an obsession with
violent, graphic movies or video games as well as kids who are
angry and bullying, physically violent and who are destructive
toward others or property.

 SHELL-SHOCKED LITTLETON SEARCHES FOR WORDS  &HT;     By C.W. NEVIUS 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Rachel Scott did not get a great parking
place Tuesday morning. The Columbine high school junior had to pull
her red Legend into a place far in the back of the parking lot,
hundreds of yards from school.
</P>
<P>
   By late Wednesday afternoon, Scott's car still hadn't moved.
There was a schoolbook in the back window and an ``E'' parking
sticker on the window. On the hood, the roof, and in front of the
bumper were sprays of flowers, slips of paper, and candles.
</P>
<P>
   And sitting silently on the grass in front of the car were a
group of Rachel Scott's friends. One of them reached out and
touched the hood with her fingers, then broke into racking sobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening?'' she wailed. ``What is going on?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a cruel delay of over 24 hours, but officials were
finally able to confirm for the parents of 12 Columbine High School
students that their children were dead, gunned down by two seniors
with a grudge. One of them was Rachel Scott.
</P>
<P>
   In all, as many as 35 students and faculty members were shot
during an explosive rampage by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold,
leaving the students of this preppy, upscale school gasping in
disbelief. They wanted to talk about it Wednesday in this Denver
suburb, but no one could quite find the words.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was nothing officially planned, people began to
gather at Clement Park, the sprawling, lush swath of athletic
fields that surrounds Columbine High, and by midafternoon there
were hundreds of students, parents, friends and neighbors, all of
them wearing the same dazed look of hurt and confusion.
</P>
<P>
   They formed random circles for group hugs, they held hands and
prayed, and they created informal memorials, piling flowers under
trees. And eventually almost all of them broke down and wept.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last place in the world this should happen, said
Jarrad Tomicich, a Columbine senior. ``There has never been a drug
problem, never a gang problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the students are clean-cut and MTV-chic, the girls with
straight blond hair and the boys sporting baseball caps with
carefully curled brims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jocks,'' said Tomicich, ``dress with Abercrombie, and the
(in-line) skaters dress with JNCO (clothing).''
</P>
<P>
   And the Trenchcoat Mafia, which Harris and Klebold belonged to,
wore black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down here in the suburbs,'' said Eric Veik, who says he knew
Harris and Klebold well, ``it is a little quieter. There are not
many people who want to stand out. They did. They wanted to be
their own class, and they were continually being made fun of
because of the way they dressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Can that really be the reason for murder? Teasing because they
did not fit into the carefully structured high school culture?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to say, I would say that it is,'' says Ian Nelson, a
senior who played violent video games like ``Duke Nukem'' and
``Doom'' with Harris and Klebold. ``Kids are cruel nowadays. They
would come up and say, `Why do you dress like that, you freak?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he had seen and heard that kind of taunting, but he
could not imagine why the two seniors would snap now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a hard time believing that they dealt with it for four
years,'' Nelson said, ``and they couldn't deal with it for 18 more
days.''
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, the grief was giving over to anger. There was a
report of a sympathy card to ``Eric and Dylan'' in one of the
memorials, and a group of the jocks said one of their friends had
``yanked it out and burned it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you know the shooters?'' 15-year-old Jason McLaughlin was
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said, ``but I am glad they are dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Veik, a slight 16-year-old wearing a T-shirt with a tattooed
alien, said he came to Clement Park because ``I wanted to tell
everybody about Eric and Dylan, and tell the truth about how they
were,'' but he couldn't figure out why this happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would joke about it,'' Veik said. ``They would say it is
time to plan the senior prank for 1999. They would say, Hitler's
birthday is coming up, maybe we should get in one last bang to let
people remember us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Veik says, ``I have no explanation for what they did. I am
shocked. It was not in the normal range for them. All I can think
is that they decided they weren't going to take any more crap. They
were going to give these guys some of their own medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Veik paused, then found himself unable to go on. He stood in a
cluster of reporters, shoulders shaking as he wept. Finally, he
excused himself and rushed away.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps the anger was best shown when 17-year-old Michael
Staver spoke up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all said it,'' Staver said. ``When the Jonesboro (shooting)
happened, we all said, `If something like that happens, it will be
the Trenchcoat Mafia that will do it.' They would come down the
hall, almost marching, with these dark sunglasses on. They'd bump
you, and if you'd turn around they'd try to start something with
you.''
</P>
<P>
   It was like that all day in Littleton. Everyone had an opinion
or an idea. Talk show hosts wanted to require uniforms for all
students, and religious leaders sang hymns and shouted out prayers.
</P>
<P>
   At a service at Christ the Light Church, just up the street from
Columbine High, a student got up to speak. She was running out of
the school Tuesday, she said, when explosions began to go off
behind her.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said to myself, `Don't look back,''' she told nearly
2,000 people, a crowd that included some of the victims' families.
`` `Don't look back and give yourself all those bad memories.' And
that's what I advise all of you to do. Move ahead. Don't look
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a better sentiment came from a preschool class at the
church that made a giant sympathy card. On it, in a child's scrawl
were the words of someone named Grant Ordenheide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want you not to feel bad,'' it said.

SIXERS BEAT CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't an ache, break, pull, strain, sprain, or spasm that
hurt the Celtics most Wednesday night. You know what really pained
them at the FleetCenter? Two airballs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's not to say the Celtics weren't affected by their
growing number of injured players. A few guys on their bench could
still be coverboys for the New England Journal of Medicine. But not
many of the 18,287 people at the FleetCenter left the building
talking about Antoine Walker's ankle, Ron Mercer's back, or Kenny
Anderson's leg. They were talking about four 3-pointers and two
airballs that were major factors in the 76ers' 80-78 win.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was Allen Iverson's airball with 11 seconds left.
It was the airball that led to the winning basket. That's because
the attempt was about a foot short, and Theo Ratliff just happened
to be alone under the hoop to make sure the shot went the
additional 12 inches. His layup went in with 7.4 seconds left, and
the game was no longer tied at 78.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't mean the Celtics' 26th loss of the season was
solidified. That's because Paul Pierce took many Kansas fans back
to those nights in the Big 12 when he easily flicked in 3-pointers.
Roy Williams, who attended the game, remembers those evenings. The
rest of the NBA is just getting used to them. Pierce made five
shots from Faraway Land Wednesday night, four of them in the game's
last five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was feeling it tonight in the fourth quarter,'' the rookie
said. ``I told Dana (Barros) to kick it out to me whenever he had a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   So with the Sixers ahead by 2 and those 7.4 seconds left, there
was no doubt who was going to get the ball for the final shot.
Everyone knew the ball was going to Pierce. The man who had his
lower back vigorously massaged on the bench was being asked to win
or tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really hurting,'' Celtics coach Rick Pitino said. ``He
couldn't move, so that's the only thing he could do: stick a
three.''
</P>
<P>
   Or attempt a three. He dribbled the ball upcourt and tried to
pull up from the top of the key. It was an airball. Some fans and
players screamed for a foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't fouled,'' said Pierce, who finished with a team-high
20 points. ``I took too many dribbles and waited a second too late.
It's a tough call to make at that point in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least one man thought the game still wasn't over. When
Pierce's shot fell short, it went into the hands of guard Damon
Jones. The free agent, angling for another 10-day contract, thought
he had tied the game when he put the miss in the hoop at the
buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so loud out there that I didn't hear anything,'' he
said. ``I put my hands up in the air because I thought we were
going to overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   They weren't. The officials waved off the hoop, saying it was
well after the buzzer. Instead of going to overtime, the Celtics
headed to their locker room to talk about another strong effort.
And another loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers were pleased with the win. They are trying to make
the playoffs for the first time since the 1990-91 season. They are
trying to survive despite the major shooting slump of Iverson _ he
was 8 of 28 Wednesday night _ and an injury to starting forward
George Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a game we would have lost last year,'' head coach
Larry Brown said of the win. His team trailed, 44-39, at the half
and was locked in a tie (59-all) after three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   As Brown talked about last year, Pitino talked about the 1999-00
season. He said if his team plays with as much passion and heart as
it did Wednesday night, the playoffs will be a reality. But now
there are eight games left in a season in which every Celtic near
you is either aching, limping, or rehabbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the fans come out for the remainder of the home
basketball games and applaud this effort,'' Pitino said.
</P>
<P>
   They applauded Wednesday night, even if the Celtics didn't make
their first field goal of the final quarter until 6:39 remained.
They applauded the rebounding of Tony Battie (12), the defense of
Iverson (an ugly 25 points), and the 3-point shooting of Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   But as Brown observed, the attention to Iverson may have cost
the Celtics. Ratliff was free because everyone leaned toward the
scorer. There were a few other near-misses and could-haves for the
Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a game we could have won,'' Pitino said. Pierce added,
``We were one or two seconds away from winning this one.''
</P>
<P>
   They could have been in overtime if one more second had been
added at the end. Or if one of those airballs had gone a different
way.

PIERCE GAVE IT COLLEGE TRY

<P>
   Ten rows above center court, a man wearing a white turtleneck,
gray sportscoat, and wire-rimmed glasses glanced anxiously from the
parquet floor to the overhead scoreboard and back to the floor. He
held a rolled game program in his hands. Shifting his weight from
right foot to left, he waited for the Celtics' final play.
</P>
<P>
   This is what he and 18,287 fans saw in the final seconds of
Wednesday night's contest between the Celtics and the 76ers:
</P>
<P>
   With the Celtics behind, 80-78, and 7.4 seconds left, Paul
Pierce took the ball downcourt as planned. The rookie with the
aching back pulled up behind the 3-point line. But he recognized
the double team too late. He couldn't kick the ball out to a
teammate on the wing. So Pierce desperately dribbled to his right
and his left, hoping for a semi-decent look at the basket. No luck.
He had no choice but to shoot, letting loose an airball as the
buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   The man wearing the white turtleneck, gray sportscoat, and
wire-rimmed glasses did not flinch or grimace or shake his head.
Kansas coach Roy Williams understands the learning process. And
from his vantage point, he saw a terrific performance from a former
student, even if it did not have a storybook ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was sensational,'' said Williams of Pierce, his
protege. ``He made four 3-pointers in a row, but I'm sure he would
have liked to make that last one, too. His back was bothering him
quite a bit, but he's a warrior. He'll try to play when he's hurt.
I just told him I didn't want to look in the paper two days from
now and see `DNP-sore back.' He better be ready to go tomorrow
night, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce injured his back in the second quarter after falling hard
to the floor. The soreness limited his ability to get low on
defense and box out. Players from Philadelphia managed to aggravate
the injury with constant elbows to the forward's lower back. After
gingerly walking around the locker room and struggling to bend
over, Pierce acknowledged that the injury affected his play. He was
clearly hurting during the second and third quarters, managing just
2 points and committing four turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   He more than made amends in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   With the game hanging in the balance, Pierce found his range
from behind the 3-point line. He drilled threes on four consecutive
Celtic possessions, keeping the game within reach for the home team
until the final seconds. His fourth 3-pointer brought the crowd to
its feet and the Celtics a brief 2-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was feeling it tonight in the fourth quarter,'' Pierce said.
``I told Dana (Barros) to kick out whenever he had a chance, to me
. . . It always feels good to have the crowd into it. It picks up
everybody's play even more.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce scored 12 of his team-high 20 points in the fourth
quarter. And the Kansas product's performance in the fourth made it
clear the ball would be in his hands on the final possession. It
didn't end the way Pierce and his cohorts had hoped. But a young
player can always learn a new lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it can help me grow and develop as a player,'' said
Pierce. ``So much is asked of me now. It's time for me to grow up a
lot faster than expected. Coach (Pitino) is expecting a lot and I
feel like I'm ready to step up and perform.''
</P>
<P>
   The mentor couldn't agree more.

LAKERS FALL TO BLAZERS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ For the Los Angeles Lakers, every day brings a
new learning experience, and this week they're back in drama class.
</P>
<P>
   They finally put the blockbuster trades and coaching changes and
other assorted wackiness behind them, but now the Lakers are
improvising their own form of drama _ the fourth-quarter comeback.
</P>
<P>
   It worked Tuesday in Oakland. It failed Wednesday against the
division-leading Portland Trail Blazers, and the Lakers lost their
second game in eight days at the Rose Garden, 88-82.
</P>
<P>
   A night after bouncing back from a 28-point deficit against
Golden State, the Lakers again took a double-digit deficit into the
final quarter of play, but climbed within two points with less than
four minutes to go.
</P>
<P>
   Old habits crept back in, though, from ill-advised 3-pointers to
poor rebounding, and the Blazers held on for the win.
</P>
<P>
   For the Lakers, playing their third game in three nights, it was
at least an improvement over the 27-point blowout suffered here a
week ago. Small consolation though it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're improving,'' Shaquille O'Neal said after a 25-point,
13-rebound performance. ``We just gotta be smart down the stretch.
You know, a couple of bad shots there at the end. We've gotta work
it, move the ball until we get a good, high-percentage shot. We
can't be shooting with two guys in our face, shooting 3s and all
that stuff. That's what I mean by playing smart.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not much of an assumption to say O'Neal's ire was directed
at Kobe Bryant, who scored 22 points but made some questionable
decisions in the waning moments _ the worst a 27-foot airball when
the Lakers were trailing by four with more than a minute to go.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Kurt Rambis also was frustrated by the lack of precision
in the offense down the stretch. In his own defense, Bryant pled
guilty, and said he'll learn from the mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just comes with experience,'' he said of taking the
errant 3-point try. ``To tell you the truth, I feel very fortunate,
because I tend to learn in clumps. It's not one game or one thing
that I learn, it tends to come all at once. Just (have to) learn
how to use the clock. I should have gone to the (hoop), drawn a
foul or something like that, but you learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing since the opening tip and by 13 early in the fourth,
the Lakers went on a 14-3 run, paced by a pair of 3-pointers from
Derek Fisher and a pair of buckets from Shaquille O'Neal, cutting
the lead to 78-76 with about three minutes to go.
</P>
<P>
   But the Blazers held off the charge.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers arrived here late Tuesday night, still buzzing over
their amazing comeback victory over Golden State, and hoping the
emotional lift would provide a confidence boost and some momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of excitement with the guys, especially how we
won,'' coach Kurt Rambis said. ``It wasn't pretty. A lot of
turnover dug a big hole for us, Shaq going out (ejected), a lot of
guys had to step up and play, guys were tired, you could see they
were tired. Down at the half, down more in the third and an
absolute flukey play gets you back in the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   But the drama of victory masked what was mostly a flawed,
turnover-marred performance, one that saw the Lakers trail by 28
points to a sub-.500 team. Rambis said no one was deluded by the
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody realizes we won that game with our heart and
effort and will. We didn't win it because we performed pretty
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kobe Bryant said, ``it could'' help turn the team around
for the stretch run of the regular season, if not against the
Blazers as the Lakers played their third game in three nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming off an emotional win, it's a big challenge for us, let
alone that it's three back to back-to-back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Blazers, turnovers again stunted the Lakers' start,
as they coughed up possession five times in the first quarter to
fall behind by double digits. The Blazers held a one-point lead
before mounting a turnover-assisted 16-2 run, with seven points
from Rasheed Wallace, to make it 27-12 late in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   A Robert Horry 3-pointer capped a Laker run that pulled them
within five points midway through the second quarter, but the
Blazers responded immediately with a 9-0 run that made it 46-32
with 3:30 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers defense responded, holding Portland to just a
pair of Wallace free throws the rest of the way as O'Neal and Rice
scored seven straight to cut the deficit to 48-42 before
halftime. &UR; !end! &QL;

ANGELS LOSE ANOTHER ONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Mo Vaughn is due back in the Anaheim Angels lineup
today, and if his teammates had any common sense they'd pay for his
limo ride to the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   They should offer to polish his shoes, oil his mitt and even
tape his sprained left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Vaughn couldn't afford to pay someone to do those
things himself, it's just that the Angels need Vaughn in the lineup
now more than ever. Especially after they lost their fourth in a
row Wednesday night to the Toronto Blue Jays 3-2 before 23,749 at
SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   For the second game in a row, the Angels had plenty of scoring
opportunities but failed to come up with clutch hits. Wednesday,
they were 0 for 10 with runners in scoring position and stranded 13
baserunners.
</P>
<P>
   Garret Anderson drove in both Angels runs _ with a solo homer in
the fourth inning (No. 2) and a bases-loaded walk in the fifth. But
that was all the offense could muster against Blue Jays starter
Chris Carpenter (2-1) and three relievers. Robert Person pitched
the final 11/3 innings for his second save and the Blue Jays won
their seventh game in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like every time we hit the ball hard it was right at
somebody,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``Sometimes
placement is more important than how hard you hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not getting the job done,'' said Darin Erstad, who went
0 for 3 with two walks, despite hitting the ball hard. ``No matter
how hard you hit the ball or where it goes, we're not getting the
job done. Bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn is expected to serve as the designated hitter and bat
third in the lineup tonight. He won't be 100 percent, but a
fraction of Vaughn and his name on the lineup card might be what
the team needs right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't get any worse than it's going right now,'' Erstad
said. ``So I'm sure it's going to be positive.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll be a welcomed addition to a struggling offense, but the
Angels won't ask him to be their savior.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could help, certainly,'' catcher Matt Walbeck said. ``But
we can't expect him to carry the team on his shoulders. He's not
going to be 100 percent but that could motivate guys too, knowing
he's in there not 100 percent grinding it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The offense, off to such a good start, has come to a sudden halt
scoring just three runs total in the past two games. But if there
were any answers as to why it's happening, the Angels would make
the necessary adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certainly a dull feeling right now,'' Walbeck said.
``Say what you want, but chemistry means a lot in this game.
There's no spark. There's no real explanation for it. I don't know
what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is for sure _ it wasn't the pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Omar Olivares (2-1) wasn't bad (six innings,
three runs, eight hits), but wasn't nearly as good as in his first
two starts, when he allowed only one run in 141/3 innings in two
victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should win a lot of games when we only give up three
runs,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a respectable night by Olivares, it was a struggle for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have much tonight, he really had nothing,'' Walbeck
said. ``He basically got away with high pitches. To do as well as
he did shows a lot. He kept us in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays scored on a fielder's choice in the third inning,
then got what turned out to be the game-winning hit by Willie
Greene in the fourth when Greene hit a two-run homer to right
field.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels, despite having baserunners in every inning and
runners in scoring position in six of the nine innings, couldn't
come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't one moment today when I didn't think we had a
chance to win the game,'' Collins said. ``Even late in the game I
said if we get some guys on we can get a base hit to win the
game.''

GREENE FINED, SUSPENDED FOR PART IN BRAWL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Todd Greene was suspended three games and fined $500
for charging the mound to fight Mariners pitcher Brett Hinchliffe
last Sunday after Hinchliffe hit him with a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Make that $510.
</P>
<P>
   The American League imposed the three-game suspension and $500
fine. The extra $10 goes to Greene's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in Little League my dad said if I ever get kicked
out of a game I owe him $10,'' said Greene, who is appealing the
suspension. ``I never had been ejected from a game until Sunday. I
never even argue. I decided years ago if I was ever blatantly hit
on purpose I was going to go. But when it happened I didn't think,
it was just instinct. I just went.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like doing it. I hope I never have to do it again, but
I will if I have to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim Angels were hit by pitches five times in the
three-game series against the Mariners last weekend. Greene was
victim No.4, and it came one pitch after Troy Glaus homered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt all four guys were hit on purpose,'' Greene said.
``Charlie Hayes (of the Giants) got four days and said he was
trying to hurt the guy (Diamondbacks pitcher Todd Stottlemyre). I
wasn't trying to hurt the guy, I was defending myself. Hinchliffe
even said he'd do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hinchliffe, a former Lancaster JetHawks pitcher, also received a
three-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking Mo-mentum: Mo Vaughn (sprained left ankle) is expected
to be removed from the disabled list today and serve as the club's
designated hitter, though manager Terry Collins said he'd wait
until game time today to make a final decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Word is this guy can handle discomfort and he does heal
fast,'' Collins said. ``There's no question in my mind he's ready
to get out there if nothing happens today to hinder that. But he's
probably going to play with some pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Vaughn is playing at less than 100 percent, Angels
players are happy to have him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Vaughn's return) had better do something because right now we
(stink),'' said Darin Erstad, who will move back to left field from
first base when Vaughn is ready to play defense. ``We can't play
with any less intensity. Hopefully guys will feed off him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just that he's hurt and he wants to be in the lineup shows you
what kind of character he has,'' catcher Matt Walbeck said. ``And
that stuff rubs off of players.''
</P>
<P>
   Who's buying?: Ex-Angel Dave Hollins, who has a broken bone in
his left hand and is on the disabled list with the Blue Jays, had
dinner with Craig Grebeck (ex-Angel now with the Blue Jays), Gary
DiSarcina and Erstad on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hollins has no hard feelings for the trade that sent him away
and cleared the way for Glaus to play every day at third base.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's tearing it up, I knew he was going to have a good year,''
Hollins said. ``He's a good player, but I didn't know he'd get off
to that great a start. That's why the trade was good. It got me out
of there and you don't have me looking over his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to miss a couple guys I played with over there.
That's the hard part. But it's a much better scenario for me. I got
tired of being 3,000 miles away from my kids (who live about an
hour away in the Buffalo area).''

SONIC ROMP SOOTHES SOME OF THE STING FROM BAKER LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It began as another one of those paltry days.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing the stain of a three-game losing streak, the Sonics
learned of yet another affliction to this season.
</P>
<P>
   However, no one wondered what else could go wrong after the
Sonics throttled the Minnesota Timberwolves 119-105 Wednesday night
at KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics could do no wrong.
</P>
<P>
   They shook off the news that forward Vin Baker will be lost for
2 to 4 weeks with a deep bone bruise in his right knee. In the
process, the Sonics snapped a two-game losing streak at KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   The victory provided much-needed relief for the Sonics as they
remained in the thick of a race for the final Western Conference
playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics (20-22) are tied with Sacramento, which beat Golden
State Wednesday, dropping the Warriors two games back from
postseason contention. But the Sonics also are just 1{ games back
from moving into the sixth or seventh seed after Phoenix beat Utah
Wednesday to pull even with Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Confused?
</P>
<P>
   This season has been a series of twists and turns for the
Sonics, who had appeared to reach their lowest point just two days
ago. Monday's loss at Houston dropped the Sonics into the tie with
Sacramento and left them three games under .500 for the first time
this season.
</P>
<P>
   However, if Wednesday night was any indication, the Sonics have
some fire left for the stretch run.
</P>
<P>
   There are eight games left in the regular season _ four of which
are at KeyArena. The New Jersey Nets blew away the Sonics by 30
points the last time they played at home.
</P>
<P>
   However, Minnesota never threatened to inflict a record
third-straight home defeat on the Sonics since KeyArena opened.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics took a double-digit lead in the first four minutes.
Their biggest lead was 95-67 with 1:09 left to play in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was focused,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal said.
``(Minnesota) missed a lot of shots early. But our defense was
good. We made them shoot jumpers instead of layups. Our thing was
to make them shoot over our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton led the rout with 27 points on 9-for-13 shooting. He
also dished out nine assists. The Sonics had four starters score in
double figures, including Hersey Hawkins' 24 points and Don
MacLean's 21.
</P>
<P>
   MacLean played in place of Baker and provided a spark in his
third consecutive start. He had seven points and six rebounds in an
explosive first quarter that ended with Sonics ahead 33-22.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shots will fall,'' MacLean said. ``I've had some big
nights in this league. ... I'm going to come out and play hard and
do some things that the teams needs to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics buried the Timberwolves by playing fast and
aggressively attacking the basket. Their defense wasn't shabby,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota missed 13 of its first 14 shots. Meanwhile, the Sonics
were relentless. They ran up court on every opportunity and scored
mostly in transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody seemed to be a step faster,'' Hawkins said. ``We got
to a lot of loose balls. Everything bounced our way. We're going to
miss (Baker) in the low post, but other players understood they
have to step it up and be more aggressive. If we play the way we
did tonight and play hard on every possession, we should be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle racked up 61 points in the first half _ the most allowed
in a half by the Timberwolves this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Vin Baker in the lineup they are much quicker,''
Minnesota coach Flip Saunders said. ``They were quicker than us to
the ball. They point-blank had guys that were faster than us.''
</P>
<P>
   A 16-5 run to start the third quarter put the game away.
Payton's three-point play with 7:41 left in the period gave the
Sonics a 77-53 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle led 110-84 with 6:12 left in the fourth, which was
mostly garbage time.
</P>
<P>
   Good news to the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   TIP-INS: Hawkins was recently named the Pacific Division winner
for the 1998-99 NBA Sportsmanship Award. Hawkins is one of four
players in the running for the award, designed to honor a player
who best represents the ideals of sportsmanship on the court. Other
divisional winners were Minnesota's Kevin Garnett (Midwest),
Philadelphia's Eric Snow (Atlantic) and Toronto's Vince Carter
(Central). ... The Sonics announced that first-round single-game
playoff tickets will go on sale Saturday through Ticketmaster. ...
Payton, through the Gary Payton Foundation, recently dedicated a
covered play area to Zion Prep Academy, a private non-profit
Seattle school. The $100,000 project took two years to complete.

LOW SEED COULD SPROUT IN NBA POSTSEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The appearance of the Minnesota Timberwolves Wednesday
night at KeyArena evoked poignant hoop memories of last spring,
back when the Sonics were full of hope and turned out to be full of
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The young T-Wolves, historically the Sonics' most favored NBA
doormat, nearly destroyed then-coach George Karl in his personal
house of horror _ the first round.
</P>
<P>
   After 61 regular-season wins, the second-seeded Sonics needed
all five games to eke past the seventh-seeded Minnesotans in Lake
Wobegon's first appearance in the NBA postseason festival.
</P>
<P>
   No one knew it at the time, but the event signaled the beginning
of the end for Western civilization _ well, at least Western
Conference civilization.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics in the next series collapsed under the weight of
Shaquille O'Neal's thunder rump, losing to the Lakers 4-1. Then the
NBA went into a self-imposed coma (from which it has yet to
recover), Minnesota elected T-Wolves mascot Jesse Ventura governor
and the world slipped its timing chain.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe it's hard to connect those dots. But having watched
Olden Polynice make 29 percent of his free throws this season, I am
fresh out of logical discourse and rational conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it help that the T-Wolves, who themselves are a fair
mess, took two of three from the Sonics in this infected blister of
a season. The Sonics routed them 119-105 Wednesday, but that
outcome was also absurd since the locals were playing their sixth
game in eight days while many prominent members of the team posed
in street clothes.
</P>
<P>
   No sense is to be made of a season wherein the Sonics can lose
at home by 30 to the New Jersey Nets shortly after beating
Portland, the Lakers and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, while reflecting upon Sonic playoff history,
it occurs that preposterousness has often been a Sonic postseason
partner.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this refreshing history lesson: The last time the
Sonics were this bad, they went to the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Sonics finished with a losing record was
1986-87, a 39-43 mark under then-coach Bernie Bickerstaff.
</P>
<P>
   The finish did bring them a No. 7 seed in the playoffs, but that
drew the Sonics against No. 2 Dallas, which owned 55 wins,
including all five games against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   In the series opener in Texas, the Sonics were obliterated
151-129 _ a single-game club playoff record for most points
surrendered. Rarely has a playoff team appeared more helpless
against an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the mystery meteor out of the athletic cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics astonished the Mavericks in Game 2 112-110, then
returned to Hec Ed, of all places (the Coliseum was booked), and
slashed up Dallas twice more, 117-107 and 124-98.
</P>
<P>
   The series remains one of the great upsets in NBA history and
among the first pieces of evidence cited by the gods of all matters
sporting:
</P>
<P>
   Never assume anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goes to show you: Anything can happen when a team comes
together,'' said Dale Ellis, primary architect of the upset. ``That
felt great.''
</P>
<P>
   A dozen years ago, Ellis was reaching his 26-year-old prime as
one of three bloodless scorers for that Sonic team. Along with Tom
Chambers and Xavier McDaniel, the Sonics had the highest scoring
trio in NBA history _ a nightly average of 71 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also had great role players,'' he said. ``Nate McMillan was
a great passer, Alton Lister was happy rebounding and blocking
shots, and Maurice Lucas would put people on their butts whenever
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   But they could do nothing with the loaded Mavericks, who with
Mark Aguirre, Rolando Blackman, Derek Harper and a couple of
versatile shooters named Sam Perkins and Detlef Schrempf, shredded
the Sonics at every meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first game, Nate couldn't get us into the offense
because Harper was so good at hand-checking in the backcourt, which
was legal back then,'' Ellis said. ``So before the second game in
Dallas, Bernie moved Xavier into the backcourt and sent Lucas to
set a pick on Harper to free up Nate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nate made sure to run Harper so that Luke blindsided him. Luke
hit him hard once, and it was all over. The rest of the series,
Harper never came up to Nate without looking over his shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how little things can make for big results in the NBA,
particularly with the five-game format of the first round. All it
takes is for the underdog to win one in the first pair of road
games, and the series is in full chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics know the drill. Last spring against Minnesota, they
blew Game 2 at home, then lost Game 3 on the road when coach Flip
Saunders came out with a tiny lineup that included minutes at
center for 6-4 guard Terry Porter. Karl was completely flummoxed
and the Sonics lost 98-90.
</P>
<P>
   Only through sheer force of will by Gary Payton did the Sonics
pull out the fourth and fifth games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're the favored team and you lose one of those first two
games, it's like you're in a coma for two or three days,'' said
James Worthy, Sonic radio analyst and a member of the Lakers' 1987
team that finally ousted the Sonics in the Western finals and went
on to beat Boston for the NBA title. ``Despite the records in a
five-game series, a lot is expected of the favorite, and if you
overlook any opponent at all, you're very vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Sonics found out in 1994 against Denver, when
they became the first and only No. 1 seed in NBA history to lose to
a No. 8.
</P>
<P>
   In '87, Worthy remembers the Lakers nearly made a similar
mistake against the Sonics. Although L.A. won a four-game sweep,
the first three games were decided by margins of five, eight and
one before a Game 4 blowout.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' he said, ``was a very dangerous team.''
</P>
<P>
   So could this year's Sonics be playoff dangerous? Unlikely.
First, they have to make the playoffs, and then they may have to do
it without Vin Baker and Billy Owens, both likely done for the year
with bad knees.
</P>
<P>
   A big difference: The '87 Sonics were coming together after a
full season. The '99 Sonics have spent most of a broken season
trying to keep from falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Wednesday night, they engage a Minnesota team that has owned
them, that was 22-20 entering the evening, and ran off a
wire-to-wire blowout.
</P>
<P>
   Remember two things:
</P>
<P>
   This is a senseless season.
</P>
<P>
   This is sports: Never assume anything.

GALAXY FIRES ZAMBRANO, HIRES UCLA'S SCHMID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Galaxy will hold a press
conference at noon today at the Rose Bowl to announce it has fired
head coach Octavio Zambrano and replaced him with UCLA head coach
Sigi Schmid, this newspaper has learned.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy has struggled this season under Zambrano, posting a
2-3 record, with both wins coming in shootouts. However, the Galaxy
has lost three straight and scored only two goals this year.
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano, who was in his second full season since taking over
for Lothar Osiander on June 10, 1997, had warned of a slow start
because of the team's youth and inexperience. He had preached
patience, claiming that the team would start to click in a month or
so.
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano and team president Tim Leiweke were unavailable for
comment. One Galaxy official who asked not to be identified said
Zambrano received the news with ``shock and disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid, reached at his home Wednesday night, confirmed the
coaching change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have new employers so there's not much I can say at this
point,'' he said. ``Coaching in the professional ranks is something
I've always considered.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid, who began coaching at UCLA in 1980, won three NCAA
titles with the Bruins (1985, 1990 and 1997) and his past and
current players have made more than 1,000 appearances for various
U.S. National teams. He said leaving UCLA was a tough decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard, very hard,'' Schmid said. ``But beyond that, I
really can't say too much at this point. I will be at the press
conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid, a 1994 U.S. national-team World Cup assistant and
current coach of the U.S. U-20 national team, will become the
Galaxy's third head coach. Zambrano replaced Osiander in a similar
situation during the 1997 season after the Galaxy started 3-7. A
year earlier, in the team's inaugural season, Osiander led the
Galaxy to the MLS championship game, where it lost to D.C. United
in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano, 41, was the winningest active coach in the MLS (39-18)
prior to his firing. Under Zambrano last season, Los Angeles
finished with Major League Soccer's best record (24-8), set an MLS
team scoring record (85 goals) and also finished tied with Chicago
for the least goals allowed (44).
</P>
<P>
   He first learned his job was in jeopardy last October after the
Galaxy was swept by the Chicago Fire in the Western Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy was subsequently sold to Denver-based billionaire
Philip F. Anschutz, who also owns a stake in the Kings and Staples
Center. Anshutz turned over control of the team to Kings and
Staples Center president Leiweke, who advised Zambrano he would
have to re-interview for his job.
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano was named the permanent coach a few weeks later,
although Schmid and a few others also interviewed for the position.

WHITE SOX STEAL WIN FROM M'S ON CARUSO'S SCRAPPY PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-SPI   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Mariners couldn't have hoped for better. With one
out, a one-run lead, the bases loaded and a slow runner hitting
Wednesday night, the M's needed a double play ball to escape the
eighth inning. The Chicago White Sox's Frank Thomas obliged.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an infielder in that situation, you're thinking, please get
the double play and get out of the inning,'' said Mariners second
baseman David Bell. ``It was exactly what we were looking for. I
got to the base, and I felt for sure I was going to be able to get
the throw off.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Caruso never gave him the chance. Thomas grounded to
shortstop Domingo Cedeno, who was nearly behind the bag when he
fielded the ball and shoveled it to Bell, who turned his back to
the runner and barehanded it for the force out. But Caruso had a
good jump off first and was on Bell instantly, upending the second
baseman.
</P>
<P>
   There was no relay, and the tying run scored. Bell knelt near
second, his hesitation more out of shock than anything, and Ray
Durham crossed the plate to give Chicago a 2-1 win, before 9,405 at
Comiskey Park. The decisive two-run inning came without benefit of
a hit; the bases had been loaded on walks.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches, players and manager Lou Piniella watched the play in
slow-motion afterward, replaying it over and over to see exactly
what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hit up the middle, and it wasn't hit very hard,'' said
infield coach Steve Smith. ``If it's hit a little harder, you turn.
It was a clean play. He got there fast; he's a gamer. There's
nothing our guys could do.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss spoiled a strong outing by Jamie Moyer, who worked into
the eighth inning and was charged with one run. Jose Paniagua
(1-2), who walked two before Thomas' ground ball, was the losing
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said he felt responsible for not getting off the ground
quicker to make a strong throw to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not many guys play the game like that,'' he said, referring to
Caruso. ``That was a great play on his part. It was just a
hard-nosed play, and it cost us the game. I was a little surprised,
but that's no excuse. I've got to be aware. I was aware of the
runner, but I've got to bounce right up. It was not a play you see
happen all the time, but you have to be ready for everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``The part of it that surprised me was how quickly he got there.
Never for a second did I think I would not have a chance to get a
throw off.''
</P>
<P>
   The play epitomized the type of team the White Sox have become
without sluggers Albert Belle and Robin Ventura. They are scrappy
and aggressive and come at you, said Moyer, who added the Sox
should have a ``very interesting year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to slide clean and stay low,'' said Caruso,
a shortstop in his second season. ``I was trying to make sure he
wouldn't be able to turn the double play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners threatened in the ninth when Jay Buhner reached on
a one-out throwing error by Caruso. But closer Bob Howry struck out
the side, getting John Mabry and Russ Davis after starting the
inning by fanning David Segui.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was called out by umpire Larry Barnett on a pitch that
looked well inside. It ended a rapidly played game that began after
a 24-minute rain delay and ended in drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 10 feet inside,'' Davis said of the last pitch.
``Brutal. That (guy) wanted to go home. It shows as plain as day on
the replay that that pitch was not even close. And then he has the
nerve to tell me he was calling that pitch all night. I never say
anything to those guys, and then to do me like that _ not even
close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm up there busting my (butt) and they just do that (stuff).
Bear down a little bit. I'm up there doing my best, and he needs to
do his job. And he didn't right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis led off the eighth inning with a double, but was stranded
at third. The Mariners again missed several offensive
opportunities, going hitless in seven at-bats with runners in
scoring position. They went 1-for-7 in that category in Tuesday's
loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' lone run came in the second, when Mabry sacrificed
home Edgar Martinez, who had singled and reached third on a double
by Segui. Segui was tagged out at home by catcher Brook Fordyce,
who gloved a quibber by Davis. Tom Lampkin popped out to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer's night ended when he walked Jeff Abbott, who was batting
.069, to lead off the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was running out of gas,'' Moyer said. ``Why, I don't know.
It was the kind of pace of a game that I like to pitch. ...
Ideally, if I could pitch every game like that _ put it on a cookie
sheet and let's go.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell, likewise, would take his chances with a ground ball like
Thomas'. But this was not a night that turned out the way the
Mariners hoped.

DUCKS LOSE AS HEBERT HURT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ As far as the Anaheim Mighty Ducks are concerned, the
Joe Louis Arena is aptly named. Every time they visit the place
they get knocked out, one way or another.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night in the first game of their Stanley Cup playoff
series against Detroit they survived a flurry of opening-minute
punches, only to eventually lose the game 5-3, along with goalie
Guy Hebert, before a crowd of 19,983.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks are now 1-11-3 in the Motor City.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert is becoming his own personal house of horrors. He was hit
in the head by Brendan Shanahan's skate after the Detroit winger
was pushed by Ducks defenseman Ruslan Salei and sent flying.
Shanahan's skate clipped Hebert on the top left of his mask and the
goalie left at 9:33 with the Red Wings ahead 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Hebert was knocked out of the playoffs here when
he suffered a groin injury in the second game of the Ducks'
second-round series with Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert was prone on the ice for three minutes. He skated off
himself but did not return, forcing the emergency use of Tom Askey,
who was called up when Dominic Roussel came down with the flu.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a pleasant sight to see your No.1 goalie _ the most
underrated goalie in the league _ go down,'' said Steve Rucchin.
``It was hard to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg insisted Hebert would be back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a little dazed,'' Hartsburg said. ``But he should be
all right for the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks can only hope so. Hebert was brilliant while he did
play. He stopped 23 of 26 shots and kept the Ducks close as Detroit
bombed away, especially when the Ducks were hemmed in their own end
the first four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Detroit was) awesome in the first period,'' said Hartsburg.
``(Hebert) was unbelievable. He kept us in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert was so good he allowed the Ducks, who were outshot 37-29,
to take a short-lived lead when Marty McInnis scored a power play
goal at 6:41.
</P>
<P>
   Less than five minutes later, Steve Yzerman began work on a hat
trick. Nicklas Lidstrom's shot sailed wide, but the puck took a big
bounce off the end boards and the Detroit captain beat Salei to the
puck and poked it home at 11:06.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert had little chance on Detroit's second goal, either.
Sergei Fedorov's harmless-looking shot hit Pavel Trnka's skate and
before the Anaheim defenseman could clear it, Wendel Clark snapped
a shot past Hebert with 2:30 remaining in the period.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings never relinquished the lead, even though the Ducks
twice pulled within one on goals by Paul Kariya at 1:45 of the
second period and Teemu Selanne at 13:03 of the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we played a good final 40 minutes,'' said Hartsburg.
``The building was really rocking and our young players learned
some things. There are things we can build on.''
</P>
<P>
   Askey, however, certainly wasn't expecting on-the-job playoff
training after arriving in Detroit at 3 p.m. Askey played the
entire 1998-99 season with Cincinnati of the American Hockey League
after playing in portions of seven games with the Ducks last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he had no thought yesterday afternoon that he'd be
playing in a Stanley Cup playoff game tonight,'' said Hartsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Askey stopped nine of 11 shots, but he was burned by Yzerman
with 1:18 left in the game when he got caught out of the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was my fault,'' said Askey, who was in no-man's
land when Selanne was knocked off the puck by Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg, however, refused to blame his young goalie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unfortunate,'' said Hartsburg, who thought Selanne was
tripped. ``He (Askey) should be proud of himself.''

BRAVES BEAT DODGERS IN 12TH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the bullpen depleted, Los Angeles Dodgers ace
Kevin Brown gave the kind of effort desperately needed to rest the
staff. He pitched eight innings. But a long, extra-inning battle
and a complete collapse by the bullpen rendered that incidental
Wednesday night at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams' one-out single broke a tie and the Atlanta
Braves scored seven times in the 12th inning to beat the Dodgers
11-4. It's the third straight series the Dodgers have lost.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Remlinger (1-0) got the win. Dodgers left-hander Jeff
Kubenka (0-1), recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque earlier in the
day, took the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Brian Hunter started the 12th with a bloop single
to right. Andruw Jones hit into a fielder's choice and Walt Weiss
reached on an infield single. Williams then delivered his single
through the left side of the infield to give the Braves a 5-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger bunted to move the runners over, but Kubenka threw to
third and all runners were safe. Bret Boone pushed the lead to 6-4
with a sacrifice fly to center, Chipper Jones added an RBI single
and Brian Jordan had a two-run double. The insult was compounded by
Javy Lopez's second homer of the game, a two-run shot off Robinson
Checo.
</P>
<P>
   Kubenka allowed five earned runs on five hits in 12/3 innings.
Checo gave up two runs on two hits.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez homered off Jeff Shaw to give the Braves a 4-3 lead in the
top of the ninth, but the Dodgers tied it in the bottom of the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield began the rally in the ninth with a one-out
double. Raul Mondesi was walked by John Rocker and reliever Kevin
McGlinchy walked Eric Karros to load the bases. Devon White then
hit a sacrifice fly to left to score Sheffield and tie the score
4-4. Adrian Beltre grounded out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Though he wasn't around for the decision, there was enormous
value in Brown's start. He needed to give the withered bullpen rest
and pitch deep into the game. He did so by allowing four hits and
striking out seven in eight innings. Brown allowed three runs, but
none were earned. He threw 118 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's will has been well-documented throughout his career and
it's been evident in his brief time with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   During a spring training outing, the right-hander reached out
with his exposed right hand and tried to snare a line drive. The
ball glanced off Brown's finger tips _ he was fine. Last week in
his return to San Diego, Dave Magadan hit a grounder back through
the middle. Brown stuck out his foot to stop the ball and threw
Magadan out at first.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Braves, Weiss hit a sharp ground ball back through
the middle. Brown stuck out his right foot, deflecting the ball
with his instep toward first baseman Eric Karros, who caught the
ball and flipped it Brown for the out.
</P>
<P>
   It's becoming routine for Brown to use every and any piece of
his body to keep an opponent from getting hit. And, no doubt, he's
going to give the folks at Fox ulcers. They've invested oodles of
cash in Brown to pitch for the next seven years. They pay him to
pitch, not play hacky-sack with a hard-hit baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Brown continued to pitch against the Braves but ran with a limp.
After he was hit _ or he hit _ Weiss' grounder with his foot, he
retired the next five hitters. Lopez broke the string with a
leadoff single to center in the seventh. A one-out walk pushed
Lopez to second, but Brown struck out Weiss and got pinch-hitter
Keith Lockhart to fly to right to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Karros' RBI single in the first gave the Dodgers a 1-0 lead. But
shortstop Jose Vizcaino committed a third-inning error that led to
three unearned runs. With one out and Weiss on first, Otis Nixon
grounded to second baseman Eric Young, who flipped the ball to
Vizcaino to try and turn a quick double play. Vizcaino dropped the
ball and both runners were safe.
</P>
<P>
   Brown caught one break when Boone flied to the left field wall
for the second out, but Chipper Jones made him pay. Jones hit a 3-0
pitch into the right field bleachers to give the Braves a 3-1 lead.
It was his fifth homer of the season.

   The ability of children to manage anger and handle conflict is a
topic of conversation in the wake of the school shootings in
Colorado. Cox News Service today is excerpting a book that
addresses the conflict issue, ``Tired of Yelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Preschoolers learn reading readiness. Elementary schoolchildren
spend hours every week on math and English. Teens go to soccer,
Scouts, or piano lessons. Yet, in many cases, no one teaches our
kids one of the most valuable lessons of life _ how to get along
with other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tired of Yelling'' is the textbook for that lesson. Dr. Lyndon
D. Waugh offers the 15-step model he developed during years of
practical application that can give parents, educators and children
the ability to manage anger and handle conflict. Dr. Waugh is
co-founder and co-director of the Atlanta Area Family Psychiatry
Clinic, where he has had a prestigious practice in child,
adolescent, and family psychiatry since 1977. The book is written
with Letitia Sweitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service is excerpting this book in five parts, all of
which are moving today. (An image of the book jacket is available
from the New York Times News Service. The excerpts also will be
available on the CoxNet weekly Science &AMP; Health page, which is
available for sale at www.nytsyn.com/pageexpress.)

   (Editor's note: This is an excerpt from ``Tired of Yelling,'' a
book by Dr. Lyndon D. Waugh that offers the 15-step model he

</P>
<P>
   Defensiveness in children can build a wall
</P>
<P>
   From ``Tired of Yelling'' by Dr. Lyndon D. Waugh, Longstreet
Press, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Reflexive defensiveness _ a conditioned, rapid, automatic
response of resistance _ is a big problem at any age because it
limits communication and shuts down learning new things about
yourself. Habitual defensiveness is so extreme in some children
that I'm often tempted to call it ``defensiveness disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   Some children are defensive even when you give them teaching,
advice, or coaching, no matter how reasonably stated. They seem to
be thinking _ and they often say _ ``What do you think I am,
stupid?'' Some children even become somewhat defensive when you
praise them. Criticism, advice, and praise reminds them that
they're constantly being evaluated. They would rather be left alone
than know their parents are thinking about their behavior and
giving them a mental grade. Take, for example, the parent who says
to her child, ``I was so proud of you today.'' The child begins to
beam. ``You didn't interrupt my conversation with Mrs. Edmunds even
once.'' The child's face sinks. Praise is sometimes just a reminder
that the child has a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Forms of defensive reaction
</P>
<P>
   Defensiveness takes many forms:
</P>
<P>
   quick denial (''Not me!'' ``You're wrong about that!'' ``I did
not!'')
</P>
<P>
   quick projection of blame on someone or something else (''Well,
he started it!'' ``The dog ate it.'' ``Sammy was the one who was
playing with it.'')
</P>
<P>
   quick arguing back about a detail (''It's not turquoise; it's
teal.'')
</P>
<P>
   quick name-calling or counter-attack (''Well, you are, too.'')
</P>
<P>
   a quick, insincere acquiescence to get the other person to stop
(''Okay, okay, I'm sorry.'')
</P>
<P>
   shutting down, blocking input, and not really listening (''Just
leave me alone.'')
</P>
<P>
   shrugging off a valid criticism (Well, it's no big deal.'')
</P>
<P>
   clowning around, making a joke out of your remarks. (''You're
right, I'm a major criminal.'')
</P>
<P>
   The Evaluative Atmosphere
</P>
<P>
   I theorize that sensitive children who are difficult in
temperament or children with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder
(ADHD) are more prone to defensiveness. They understandably get a
higher frequency of criticism and ultimately get fed up.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some parents are excessively evaluative no matter what
their child's behavior. They seem to think that the main duty of
parenting is evaluation. Almost everything the child does goes
through a perceptual filter and comes out with a grade attached.
</P>
<P>
   At one end of the spectrum, we find overt anger, direct harsh
criticism, and an overly strict authoritarian style that meets a
parent's need for control more than the child's needs. Next,
there's lecturing and preaching. Then there's coaching,
advice-giving, and teaching. At the other end of the evaluative
spectrum, there's affirmation, praise, and approval. Of course, I'm
not implying that you should accept all of your child's behavior.
What's appropriate is the middle ground between managing every
little thing and total lack of supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on their parents' behavior and their own sensitivity,
many kids feel overly monitored, evaluated, and critiqued. Their
antennae are almost always out anticipating evaluation. The longer
their antenna are, the more likely they are to overreact,
misinterpret, and display their defensiveness as they mind-read.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents do have a high frequency of intervention. Such
``eagle-eye'' parents bring a child into my office and deliver a
constant stream of directives: ``Look Dr. Waugh in the eye when
he's speaking to you.'' ``Speak up, he can hardly hear you.''
``Keep your feet off the couch.'' These usually well-meaning
parents are trying either to socialize their kids or to prevent any
problem from arising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eagle-eye'' parents who create an evaluative atmosphere often
have a child who is sensitized to criticism and quick to be
defensive. This defensiveness begets further evaluation and renewed
efforts to get through to the child. The intervention frequency and
defensiveness escalate, cycling to nonresolution.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say who ``started'' such a cycle of escalation.
It's more important to make an effort to change simultaneously in a
teamwork fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking the Defensiveness Cycle
</P>
<P>
   I don't have to tell you that it doesn't work well to tell a
child to just quit being defensive. One thing about a child's
defensiveness is that the person who triggers it has a hard time
being the one to talk to the child about it. When a child gets
defensive about being defensive, he creates an almost impenetrable
barrier. ``Well, you don't have to be so defensive about it,'' is a
remark that makes some older children (and adults) go through the
roof.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there may be a time when you think your child will
be receptive when you could talk calmly yet frankly with him about
his defensiveness. Or perhaps one parent with whom the child is
less defensive can talk to him about his defensiveness with the
other parent.
</P>
<P>
   First, explain to him the concept of defensiveness and why it
interferes with learning new ideas and maintaining good
relationships. Draw him out as to whether he agrees it's a problem.
Explain that it's a reflex he likely learned when he was very young
and trying not to feel bad about himself at difficult times.
</P>
<P>
   Then try to teach him a ``new reflex.'' Tell him that, when he
feels that first rush of defensiveness, he should try to replace it
with this new reflex: genuine curiosity. He could invite the person
who is criticizing or bossing him to tell him more about the
problem. Explain that he needs to be sincere lest he be seen as a
``wise guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing out a person who is angry at you is sometimes called a
``diffusion'' strategy. This response tends to disarm the other
person and make him express criticism more succinctly and calmly.
This strategy influences the conversation and alters a blaming,
criticizing, or angry confrontation. Doing this makes the kid feel
more mature. With practice the new response of curiosity can become
more genuine and natural.
</P>
<P>
   If your child is not mature enough to understand, there is much
you can do. Pick your battles. Try not to be an eagle-eye. Use a
calm voice that isn't bossy or hostile. And don't be defensive
yourself.

<P>
   (Editor's note: This is an excerpt from ``Tired of Yelling,'' a
book by Dr. Lyndon D. Waugh that offers the 15-step model he
developed during years of practical application that can give
parents, educators and children the ability to manage anger and

</P>
<P>
   The right words to use to teach resolving conflict
</P>
<P>
   From ``Tired of Yelling'' by Dr. Lyndon D. Waugh, Longstreet
Press, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, it's important to handle your own conflicts well
so the preteen can see disagreement without loss of respect or
inappropriate behavior and, hopefully, can observe successful
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   When in conflict with your preteen, don't let him provoke you to
your own worst style _ whether that is being haughty, sarcastic,
disrespectful, or out of control. Unwittingly, preteens may provoke
you to behave badly so they can blame you for your bad behavior _
and thereby excuse theirs. They often know how to hit your hot
buttons. Anticipate this and resolve to keep your cool and return
calmly to the real issues of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching by making casual comments during a real conflict with
your child is a good middle-ground strategy between modeling and
direct instruction. As you go along, you can point out your own
efforts, for example, to see his point of view or to repeat what
you have understood him to say. Such verbal reminders keep you
straight as well as instructs your child. Such verbal reminders
emphasize an awareness of process.
</P>
<P>
   When giving instruction, try not to ``lecture.'' Give short
comments with space in between instead of long discourses. A pause
after you say something gives the child time to take your comments
in. If you pause long enough, the child may say something in reply
that clues you into his feelings and how well your lesson is going.
(But don't expect him say anything like ``I see what you mean.''
Preteens often don't give you the satisfaction of letting you know
they learned something from you _ not until they are at least 40.)
If you don't pause, you're likely to overdo the lesson before you
even know if your child is receptive.
</P>
<P>
   Try concentrating on the most critical steps of conflict
resolution or the one the preteen does least well because a
full-scale teaching or critique session may not go over well during
a real problem or during a good show.
</P>
<P>
   How to Get Started
</P>
<P>
   Getting the preadolescent to buy into learning to resolve
conflict is often a challenge. Here are some examples of things you
can say to start the process:
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally feel we have way too many arguments about this
issue. Do you agree?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we didn't fight or argue about these things so much.
Even though I know that it's normal in many ways, it still puts us
all in bad moods and gets in the way of our relaxing around each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we fight this way, it often doesn't accomplish anything.
I'd like to try to work on doing a better job of dealing with these
things that make us mad at each other. Hopefully, you agree.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you like to see us get along better as a family? To do
that, we would all have to agree that we each had to make some
changes and work on it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's so unusual that we argue about homework
(bedtime, grades, money, clothes, friends). Lots of families do.
What bothers me is that our arguments don't seem to go anywhere.
They don't help us get anything settled so we end up arguing about
the same stuff over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you might think it seems a little hokey to sit down and
have a serious talk about this, but if we could talk this thing
through reasonably and come up with some plan, I am sure we would
be glad that we did it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found a book that outlines a pretty good way to stop
arguing and start solving. I think this method would work for us if
we tried hard to really do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's much more likely at this age that your child will resist
these overtures of yours. Instead of deferring to your suggestions,
you may get a response something like these:
</P>
<P>
   ``What does a guy who is writing a book know about us anyhow?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, right. This is just another way to get me to do what you
want.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding? We never get anywhere when we talk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't ever listen to me so it's useless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate these kinds of talks, they just make me madder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't we just forget it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you been reading that psychology stuff again?''
</P>
<P>
   When kids say these types of things, it's a good opportunity to
draw them out further by asking them what they mean, asking them to
elaborate, asking them to give examples, asking them if there's
anything else about talking things out that bothers them. In other
words, take the resistant remarks at face value. Don't retort or
snap back, but encourage your youngster to talk his resistance out.
Being allowed to do so sometimes brings kids around.
</P>
<P>
   Find something they say that you might agree with, then add:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really important for how we get along,'' or
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that will be good for all of us,'' or
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that as parents we have a right to say and
to expect you to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the elements of dealing with resistance is being
sensitive to it and aware of when it is developing. Rather than
letting resistance provoke you into getting defensive yourself,
stay calm and draw your child out with genuine curiosity. If your
child makes valid points, go ahead and admit the validity, address
the points, and deal with them. If the child's resistance is pure
avoidance of the issues, then point out the resistance and discuss
resistance or defensiveness as a direct issue in a straightforward
manner, making that one of the main problems that gets in the way
of resolving many others.
</P>
<P>
   When you get resistance to resolving a conflict or learning how
to resolve a conflict, you might offer the child a little time to
think the issue over. But be clear that you will be discussing the
issue later. Suggest a reasonable time and stick to it.

 &HT;    BOOK EXCERPT, Part 3: Content and Process
 &HT;    (An image of the book jacket is available from the New York
Times News Service.)
 &HT;    By Dr. Lyndon D. Waugh
 &HT;    c. 1999 Longstreet Press/Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Editor's note: This is an excerpt from ``Tired of Yelling,'' a
book by Dr. Lyndon D. Waugh that offers the 15-step model he
developed during years of practical application that can give
parents, educators and children the ability to manage anger and
handle conflict. )
</P>
<P>
   Separating the content of conflict from the process of resolving
it
</P>
<P>
   From ``Tired of Yelling'' by Dr. Lyndon D. Waugh, Longstreet
Press, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Every conflict has two elements: the content _ the facts of a
disagreement _ and the process _ the patterns and style of dealing
with disagreement. The content is ``what'' the argument appears to
be about. The process is ``how'' we deal with it. The content is
often easier to focus on and deal with than the process problems.
Teaching our children to resolve conflict requires that we think
about both content and process and teach them to recognize the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   A couple came to me complaining about incessant arguing between
their two children. The boy, who was younger, liked to be a
debater. He was incredibly persistent. The girl was often reacting
to him quickly and intensely. Each child told me readily what the
other does that drives him or her crazy. The girl said the boy
never gives up and always has to be right. He tells her what to do.
The boy said the girl sticks out her tongue and treats him like he
has nothing valid to say. She won't listen to him and she tells him
to shut up.
</P>
<P>
   I got the picture; the conflict was almost all process _ the way
they handled issues. I worked out a plan with this family, and,
when they came back, they said they'd had a much more peaceful
week. In the car coming to my office, however, an argument had
broken out.
</P>
<P>
   The girl had received a gift _ a picture frame _ from her
cousin. In the frame was a photo of the cousin that didn't fit very
well. The girl was going to take out the photo and put it on her
bulletin board and put another picture that she liked better in the
frame.
</P>
<P>
   The brother told her that replacing the cousin's picture
wouldn't be polite. If the cousin came to visit and saw that her
photo was not in the frame, she would be hurt. The sister, fed up
with his moralizing, yelled at the brother to be quiet and leave
her alone. He then bombarded her with multiple reasons why he was
right, and she countered every detail with an objection, then
finally held her hands over her ears while he tried to pry them
off.
</P>
<P>
   The mother was a little bit on the boy's side regarding the
content as she was telling me this story. Of course, the argument
started up again in my office. I let them go on for a while so I
could observe their process. I finally stopped them and reminded
them that they had agreed to work on not always thinking it's the
other's fault, our project for the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``What were you doing wrong in the argument,'' I asked each of
them, shifting our attention to the process.
</P>
<P>
   After I'd persisted a while, the girl admitted she had
overreacted, she had yelled, and she had been too caught up in
countering her brother's argumentative points. The boy admitted
that he was telling her what to do, judging her, and criticizing
her. Then he added, ``And I have another point to make....'' and he
started talking again about offending the cousin and changing the
picture in the frame.
</P>
<P>
   This was a great chance to point out that the frame was the
content (a fleeting, resolvable topic), and we were not trying to
resolve the content or we would have to get together every day for
every new issue. We'd agreed to work on what was really bothering
the family: the habitual dysfunctional process.
</P>
<P>
   Once the children finally began to consider what they were doing
wrong, they did a pretty good job of self-criticism. The lesson
didn't take hold right away, but over time they learned and
improved.
</P>
<P>
   Distinguishing between process and content is very similar to
determining ``what are you really angry at,'' as in step four of
the conflict resolution model. Many times what really drives a
conflict is a process issue; it becomes the real substantive
``what.''
</P>
<P>
   Time, place, and mood (yours and your child's)
</P>
<P>
   Timing is everything, as they say. You won't be as effective if
you teach when your child is tired, hungry, in a hurry to join a
friend, or obviously irritable. You will probably be inspired to
teach your child when she is extremely angry. Perhaps you could
make some brief points, but it's usually the least likely time for
a receptive attitude or solid learning. Warm your child up in
whatever way works for you. Do something like read a story, shoot a
few baskets, make cookies, or swing in the hammock together.
</P>
<P>
   As for place, make it somewhere private where the phone won't
ring and nobody will interrupt. Make it comfortable. Try the barn,
the burger restaurant, or the hammock again, whichever works.
Riding in the car has its pros and cons. A disadvantage is that you
can't look at the child to read his expression and body language or
to convey your feelings to him. On the other hand, your not being
able to watch your child may give her a feeling of extra comfort.
Choose a place and situation where the child is comfortable
physically and emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   In teaching a child, the importance of your own mood is
paramount. If you're too light, silly, tentative, nonchalant or
pleading, the kid might not take what you say very seriously. On
the other hand, if you're too stern, stubbornly authoritative,
intense, or irritable, you're not ready to teach. You're likely to
provoke more resistance and resentment than cooperation. Be upbeat
and positive. You're probably not ready to teach if what comes to
mind to say first is, ``I'm sick of this problem with your anger
and you're going to learn this way to fix it.'' You're more in the
right mood if you genuinely feel like saying, ``Wouldn't it be cool
if we learned a new way...'' Your mood leads to your tone. Your
tone largely determines whether your child is defensive or not.

   Teaching your child to put problems into perspective
</P>
<P>
   From ``Tired of Yelling'' by Dr. Lyndon D. Waugh, Longstreet
Press, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   An important step in conflict resolution is the perspective
check. Putting a problem into perspective means asking two
questions:
</P>
<P>
   1) Is your emotion out of proportion to the provocation? If so,
why?
</P>
<P>
   2) Is there ``another way'' to look at the provocation,
especially, by looking at the other person's point of view?
</P>
<P>
   Perspective takes experience and can be hastened by your
pointing out how other people look at similar situations and how
other people feel.
</P>
<P>
   One family uses the initials NOTGY (Nobody's Out To Get You) as
a reminder to eight-year-old Gene to try to replace his reflexive
thought that someone's out to get him with a new, positive, more
realistic appraisal. He has to think that the person who has made
him mad has another reason for acting as he did and it's up to Gene
to figure out what it is.
</P>

   Gina, a little girl who was angry and hurt over not being
invited to a birthday party, was asked to think of some reasons why
she wasn't invited other than the ones that made her mad, namely
that the six-year-old hostess didn't like her or wanted to be mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe she just forgot,'' Gina suggested. Her mother reminded
her also that the neighbor's mother may have set a limit on the
number of children to be invited and she may have said, ``Only
children in your class'' or ``only six-year-olds,'' or ``you have
to invite everyone in your car pool.'' Gina, inspired by her
mother's reasoning, added, ``Or maybe they were just going to play
kindergarten games, and I'm too old.'' This was a perspective
check.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some ways to talk to your elementary school age child
about perspective:
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about it and decided maybe he was just joking, so
I'll ask him what he meant before I tell him I'm upset.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The short boy in the story thought the tall boy was making fun
of him. He got angry and started planning to get back at him before
he really knew what the tall boy meant. The whole story would have
been different if he had asked the tall boy to explain first.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How bad is what Joe did?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you feel yourself getting mad even though you know what
made you mad was only a small thing, try to say something to remind
yourself that it's no big deal. You could say, 'no problem' or
'relax,' or 'chill' or 'no sweat' or 'small potatoes' or
'whatever.' What expression would you like to learn to say when
someone bugs you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you think he did it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you think of another reason he might have done it?''
</P>
<P>
   `` Can you help me understand why this makes you so mad? Is
there something else to it I'm missing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about the other guy's point of view. What was he
thinking when he did this to you? Was he just trying to make you
mad? Or did he think he had a good reason?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think he's thinking about it right now?''
</P>
<P>
   To the child who underreacts or doesn't stick up for himself,
however, you may have to encourage greater assertiveness, as in the
following example:
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were you, I'd be even madder than you are about Jason
taking your baseball glove without even asking and then losing it.
Don't be afraid to tell him you were angry. And then you two could
work out some way for him to replace your glove.''
</P>
<P>
   Your older, preteen child may also have a knee-jerk thought, a
first response that comes from childish thinking, such as, ``She
won't let me do anything by myself,'' ``He thinks he's better than
me,'' or ``Just leave me alone.'' Preteens, if anything, are in a
time of change; such automatic response thoughts are no longer
appropriate, if they ever were.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, you, the parent, may have thoughts that are no longer
valid like, ``He doesn't know how to do that. He'll get in
trouble,'' or ``Because I told you so....'' Both parent and preteen
need to look at how the child has grown up and ask, ``Is it really
so bad? `` or ``Maybe it's time I looked at things in a different
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Perspective check means not only seeing things in a different
light but seeing things through another person's eyes, a learned
skill that takes experience and practice. Here are some points you
can gently make to your preteen:
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times when you're angry you can overreact. Sometimes
you can be so caught up in your own thoughts and feelings that it
is hard to step back and look at the situation some other way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can figure out what triggered you to be angry and stop
and say, 'Wait, is there another way to look at this,' you might
find other accurate ways to see it that will help you stay cool
enough to deal with it better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to step into the other person's shoes and wonder
what they're thinking and feeling about the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Try to understand why another person did something. Try to
think of good reasons as well as bad reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk to one of your friends about this. Tell them just the
facts of the problem. Then ask, 'How would you see this and how
would you feel?' or 'How would you take that?' Often, the friend
will interpret the situation in a way that never occurred to you.
Try it.''
</P>
<P>
   If your child is overly passive, is fearful of displeasing
people, or doesn't stand up for himself:
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, when you're angry, you may underreact because you're
afraid bringing a conflict up will cause a bigger problem. It's
okay to be pretty angry at this. This would upset anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bet you were upset when that person behind you in the
line got waited on before you did. It's okay to say, 'Excuse me, I
think I was next in line.'''

 &HT;    BOOK EXCERPT, Part 5: Think, Talk/Listen, Solve
 &HT;    (An image of the book jacket is available from the New York
Times News Service.)
 &HT;    By Dr. Lyndon D. Waugh
 &HT;    c. 1999 Longstreet Press/Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Editor's note: This is an excerpt from ``Tired of Yelling,'' a
book by Dr. Lyndon D. Waugh that offers the 15-step model he
developed during years of practical application that can give
parents, educators and children the ability to manage anger and
handle conflict. )
</P>
<P>
   A 15-step approach to teaching kids conflict resolution
</P>
<P>
   From ``Tired of Yelling'' by Dr. Lyndon D. Waugh, Longstreet
Press, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest gifts you can give your child is a set of
attitudes and skills that allows him to manage his anger well and
find a solution to conflict. If your child can resolve conflict
well, he can have genuine intimacy, better overall physical and
emotional health, improved productivity, and in general a happier,
more meaningful life.
</P>
<P>
   Children need to develop a mindset that favors peace, not by
avoiding conflict or winning through intimidation, but by resolving
conflict with others.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to teach your child...
</P>
<P>
   that the important thing, for both adults and children, is to
shift from thinking that anger is about who's right, who's wrong,
or who's to blame to thinking of anger as a ``signal'' emotion--a
signal to resolve a problem.
</P>
<P>
   to recognize reflexive first thoughts when angry and to replace
them with more appropriate thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   to learn perspective by asking oneself, ``How big a deal is this
really?'' and by empathizing with the other person's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   how to ``out-mature'' the other person rather than ``out-power''
him.
</P>
<P>
   that conflict has two aspects: what the disagreement is about
(content) and how you're going to handle it (process).
</P>
<P>
   that resolution has two aspects: a practical solution to the
problem and a ``resolved feeling.'' You have resolution when you
have a plan to solve the problem that made you angry in the first
place and when both people genuinely feel better towards each
other.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you teach these concepts to your child? How do you
make them a real part of your child's life?
</P>
<P>
   For years, in my family psychiatry practice, I've used a
three-part model of conflict resolution as a teaching tool. Many
families have learned to resolve conflict better using this method.
It's my belief that you, too, can experience success using the
model.
</P>
<P>
   And what is success? If your child has a significantly better
attitude towards resolving conflict or changes even one behavior
pattern for the better, you have reason to celebrate. Better
attitudes are contagious; better behavior leads to more good will.
</P>
<P>
   Here then are the three parts to the conflict resolution model:
</P>
<P>
   Think
</P>
<P>
   Thinking appropriate thoughts before speaking or acting in anger
is so critical and so often neglected that I call Part One of the
three-part conflict resolution model ``The Thinking Steps.'' The
Thinking Steps not only help hold off the impulsive, angry behavior
that could jeopardize reconciliation but also allow the angry
person to become more open to resolving the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Talk/Listen
</P>
<P>
   In Part Two, ``The Talk/Listen Steps,'' you state the problem as
you see it, in resolvable terms. Then you really listen while the
other fellow states his perspective. Both of you listen to and
appreciate the other person's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Solve
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we have Part Three, ``The Solving Steps.'' The
participants in the conflict brainstorm solutions and reach a
workable agreement. The problem is either solved, or, if it's
unresolved, it drifts away and then circles back, coming upon the
conflict participants again and again from behind, in the same or
another guise.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, working with individuals and families, I have
developed and elaborated on this three-part model to conflict
resolution until it is admittedly complex. If Think, Talk/Listen,
Solve was all you had to learn, this would be a much shorter book.
But there's more. Each of the three big parts of the conflict
resolution model has five steps. And three times five is...
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen steps! I don't have time to teach my kid fifteen
steps! I don't have the patience!'' you may be thinking. Bear with
me. If you spent fifteen minutes for fifteen days teaching your
child these steps, how would that compare with the time you spend
fussing about clothes left on the floor, arguing whose fault the
sibling squabble is, nagging about homework, and dealing with the
``my teacher/coach/playground bully picks on me'' ordeal? These
fifteen steps will not cost you time; ultimately they will save you
time and frustration. Many families report an improvement in their
family dynamics within weeks of conscientious use of the model.
</P>
<P>
   If you need further reason to expend the effort, think of the
overall importance of conflict resolution in life.
</P>
<P>
   In relationships, conflict resolution is an important source of
intimacy. Knowing that anger and hurt can be talked about without
destructive behavior enables couples, parents, friends, and others
to bring up and get through problems that inevitably arise.
</P>
<P>
   Unresolved anger underlies a lot of heart disease, depression,
and other illnesses. Conflict resolution is important for
health--physical and mental.
</P>
<P>
   Resolving conflicts is a major factor in doing well in business
and getting along with neighbors, classmates, and co-workers as
well as family. We even use conflict resolution strategies to
promote peace among nations.
</P>
<P>
   As parents, we spend tons of time and energy trying to prepare
our kids to have an economically secure life by education and
career guidance. Your child may spend an hour a day on math, for
example. Let's do the same for their attitudes, emotional reflexes,
interpersonal habits, and conflict resolution skills. These are
areas that contribute heavily to ``emotional intelligence,'' the
set of abilities that author Daniel Goleman (Emotional
Intelligence, Bantam Books, 1995) describes as mattering more than
IQ or academic achievement in getting along successfully in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   We also provide our children with hobbies and opportunities to
socialize with groups. Isn't conflict resolution worth the same
commitment of time and attention as Scouting or Little League?
Think of conflict resolution as you do learning piano or tennis--as
a project needing formal lessons and lots of practice. Work on
reflexes toward anger as you do reflexes in tennis, encourage good
habits in conflict resolution as you encourage good habits in
piano, teach conflict resolution skills as you do soccer skills.
Make it a family project and keep momentum going with approval and
recognition.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Information campaign should have preceded air
campaign
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The smartest idea so far in all the back-and-forth and busy
second-guessing over NATO's war against Serbia comes from former
U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not surprising. Even a couple of years distant from
office, the longtime Democratic chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee is still crackling smart about military policy
and the tricky places where that blends with foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Nunn is making the point in interviews that in dicey situations
like the one in the Balkans, where civil war and ethnic hatred mix,
U.S. military and civilian planners first need to unleash, not
their bombs and missiles, but an aggressive information campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Our failure to make it clear to Serbian civilians just what
horrors Slobodan Milosevic was committing in their name in Kosovo
and the reasonable compromises NATO was pressing for has made the
NATO attack seem arbitrary and merely abusive to most Serbians. The
effect has been clear in interviews as even longtime anti-Milosevic
Serbs angrily take up with the man they were working just weeks ago
to be rid of.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's efforts to catch up now, with the bombs dropping, have
obvious credibility problems. The field has been ceded to the
manipulative, hyper-nationalist government-controlled media of
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The democracies, Nunn says, need what he calls ``a new set of
tools'' _ in effect, information warfare _ as a potential first
resort.
</P>
<P>
   The basic idea is hardly new. Allied planes dropped propaganda
leaflets in World War I. Something far more sophisticated is called
for now.
</P>
<P>
   Voice of America and other established means for getting the
word out should be targeted to specific policy purposes, Nunn says.
Even if that failed to deter an authoritarian regime like
Milosevic's, the civilian readiness to see a nasty conflict through
would be softened.
</P>
<P>
   The military, too, needs an upfront ability to press an
information campaign itself _ much of its current limited capacity
is in the reserves _ and, if hostilities start, should take out
opposition media, Nunn says. The nation's information war
``capacities are not well inserted into doctrine.'' The need is
``to get them into the minds of policy makers'' as part of any war
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Nunn sees NATO's failure first to make its case compellingly as
having a potentially disastrous side effect in U.S.-Russian
relations. Russian anti-American sentiment is running stronger now,
he says, than during the Cold War. Then, the Soviet government was
pushing the people to be anti-American; now the Russian people are
pushing their government to be anti-American.
</P>
<P>
   Unless that can be fixed _ perhaps by involving Russia in a
solution, though Nunn says that could be a ``migraine headache'' _
populist anti-Americanism could bring Communists and nationalists
to power in Russia's December elections.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and the United States, Nunn says, have ``good motives, the
instincts are humanitarian.'' Those instincts and motives will have
a harder time prevailing when they are lost on the very people for
whom they are intended.

<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-PORT &LR;  -- ``Talk has been of Venice sinking below

left-field fence. 300 words. By Keith Olbermann, senior
correspondent and anchor for Fox Sports News.
</P>
<P>

of ``The Classical Style.''
</P>
<P>

 &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-IDEA &LR;  -- It is romantic love, which in the
ancient world was virtually unknown. ``Eros'' referred to chaos,
even disaster. But to the modern sensibility, love is the very
engine of life. 1,100 words. By the prolific American author Joyce
Carol Oates.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-INVENTION &LR;  -- No doubt, the printing press is

Diamond, Pulitzer Prize-winning author and physicist.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-SERMON &LR;  -- The concept, the `Shining City on a
Hill,' came to life in the 1630 sermon by the Massachusetts Bay
Colony's Gov. Robert Winthrop. His plea for civic virtue inspired
JFK and Reagan and perhaps even Martin Luther's King Jr.'s ``I Have
a Dream'' speech. 1,200 words. By Peter J. Gomes, minister of The
Memorial Church at Harvard.

 &UR; MAPPING the MILLENNIUM: ``The Best View of the World'' &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; ''The Agnese Map'' -- Created by Battista Agnese, a Venetian
cartographer, in Venice, in the mid-16th century &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; CREDIT: Courtesy of the John Carter Brown Library at Brown
University &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; Artwork availability: 35mm color slides or electronic transmission

</P>
<P>
   This flat map of the world traced the route of Magellan's
voyages and the Spanish silver fleet. Decorated with cherubs' faces
in a cosmos of billowing clouds and turquoise skies, it is a high
mark of the Renaissance fascination with science and humanism.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-DEMOCRACY -- Every dictator's nightmare is the
idea that humans have rights. The universal principle of the
fundamental rights of man is any tyrant's ``province of terror.''
1,900 words. By Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and Nigerian
pro-democracy leader Wole Soyinka.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-TIME &LR;  -- In this panel discussion moderated by
veteran New York Times columnist Russell Baker, the talk is of the
best time to be alive. The Ming dynasty? Puritan New England?
Yale's Jonathan Spence, Harvard's Orlando Patterson and others tell
where they'd have lived, given the choice. 1,900 words.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-PRODUCT &LR;  -- Forget electricity, the microchip
and the car. Without beans we wouldn't have made it out of the Dark
Ages. If human beings are still here, descendants of the Pilgrim
Fathers or the Spanish conquistadores, it is thanks to beans. 2,400
words. By Umberto Eco, the author of ``The Name of the Rose'' and
``Foucault's Pendulum.''

 &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-BATTLE &LR;  -- The millennium would see other great
battles, like Gettysburg and D-Day, but for 1,000 years, only the
defeat of the Turks by Jan Sobieski near Vienna in 1683 has rivaled
the Battle of Saratoga. 1,200 words. R.J. Apple Jr., chief
correspondent for The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-UTOPIA &LR;  -- As utopians go, the Shakers were a
kindly, harmless bunch. They never took up with Big Brother; they
were pacifists; they didn't kill anyone; they didn't try to impose
their ideas by force. Plus they made a lasting contribution to
furniture design and music. 700 words. By Margaret Atwood, author
of ``A Handmaid's Tail'' and ``Alias Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-GAME &LR;  -- Soccer is a perfect substitute for war,
by assuaging national rivalries. Case in point: Last summer more
than 1 million people gathered on the Champs-Elysees to celebrate
France's victory in the World Cup. Just a sports coup? 800 words.
By Paul Auster, the author, most recently, of ``Timbuktu.''
</P>
<P>

music director of the American Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-REVOLUTION &LR;  -- Thanks to Gandhi, the peacemaker,
India won its freedom without firing a shot. ``Of the many
revolutions ... the human-rights revolution seems to be the most
morally appealing to the world of our time.'' 700 words. By Alan
Brinkley, a Columbia history professor and author of ``Liberalism
and Its Discontents.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-STORY &LR;  -- ``Scheherazade'' has everything a tale

surprise, a gorgeous heroine and a happy ending. 2,000 words. By
the noted storyteller A.S. Byatt.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-DEAL &LR;  -- The purchase of the Suez Canal Co. gave
bankers more power than they had yet known or would ever know
again. 600 words. By Ron Chernow, the author of ``Titan,'' a
biography of John D. Rockefeller Sr.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-LEADER &LR;  -- ``Just look how well she governs,''
the once-reluctant subjects of Elizabeth I, the Virgin Queen, later
would remark. For the ravishing ruler exceeded all expectations,
and by now she is namesake to an era. 500 words. By New York Times
editorial board member Gail Collins.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-FIRST &LR;  -- Among first millennium notables, the

and Ethiopians. 1,500 words. By Felipe Fernandez-Armesto, author of
``Millennium,'' being made into a TV series for CNN.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-NUISANCE &LR;  -- Octavia Hill, queen of open spaces,
loved the English countryside, its green fields and fresh air. And
the tiny, stout, badly dressed Hill was obstinate, a downright
bully, about preserving the land she loved. 350 words. By Penelope
Fitzgerald, author of ``The Blue Flower.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-ESCAPE &LR;  -- Just as the lords of evil were about
to make the world part slave colony and part death camp ... the
democracies seized their chance, and mankind made its narrow escape
from global darkness. In short, the Axis self-destructed. 400
words. By David Fromkin, author of ``The Way of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-MEDICINE &LR;  -- In 1796 Edward Jenner tried the
first smallpox vaccine. Its success signaled the first step in
medicine's control over the microbial world _ one that led to the
discovery of safe, inexpensive and effective vaccines. 400 words.
By Harvard medical school physician and professor Jerome Groopman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-SCANDAL &LR;  -- When it comes to failed romance,

Anne Boleyn. 450 words. By Josephine Hart, author of ``Damage,''
``Sin'' and ``Oblivion.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-ART &LR;  -- Florentine architect Brunelleschi's

beautiful lady's string of pearls would look closer than the map on
the wall. 500 words. By New York Times chief art critic Michael
Kimmelman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-BREED &LR;  -- Keep your AKC pedigree and ``give me a

   This flat map of the world traced the route of Magellan's
voyages and the Spanish silver fleet. Decorated with cherubs' faces
in a cosmos of billowing clouds and turquoise skies, it is a high
mark of the Renaissance fascination with science and humanism.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-DEMOCRACY -- Every dictator's nightmare is the
idea that humans have rights. The universal principle of the
fundamental rights of man is any tyrant's ``province of terror.''
1,900 words. By Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and Nigerian
pro-democracy leader Wole Soyinka.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-TIME &LR;  -- In this panel discussion moderated by
veteran New York Times columnist Russell Baker, the talk is of the
best time to be alive. The Ming dynasty? Puritan New England?

where they'd have lived, given the choice. 1,900 words.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-PRODUCT &LR;  -- Forget electricity, the microchip

 &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-BATTLE &LR;  -- The millennium would see other great
battles, like Gettysburg and D-Day, but for 1,000 years, only the

the Battle of Saratoga. 1,200 words. R.J. Apple Jr., chief
correspondent for The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-UTOPIA &LR;  -- As utopians go, the Shakers were a
kindly, harmless bunch. They never took up with Big Brother; they
were pacifists; they didn't kill anyone; they didn't try to impose
their ideas by force. Plus they made a lasting contribution to
furniture design and music. 700 words. By Margaret Atwood, author
of ``A Handmaid's Tail'' and ``Alias Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-GAME &LR;  -- Soccer is a perfect substitute for war,

France's victory in the World Cup. Just a sports coup? 800 words.
By Paul Auster, the author, most recently, of ``Timbuktu.''

and Its Discontents.''
</P>
<P>

biography of John D. Rockefeller Sr.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-LEADER &LR;  -- ``Just look how well she governs,''

editorial board member Gail Collins.

<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-NUISANCE &LR;  -- Octavia Hill, queen of open spaces,

bully, about preserving the land she loved. 350 words. By Penelope
Fitzgerald, author of ``The Blue Flower.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-ESCAPE &LR;  -- Just as the lords of evil were about
to make the world part slave colony and part death camp ... the
democracies seized their chance, and mankind made its narrow escape
from global darkness. In short, the Axis self-destructed. 400
words. By David Fromkin, author of ``The Way of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-MEDICINE &LR;  -- In 1796 Edward Jenner tried the
first smallpox vaccine. Its success signaled the first step in

By Harvard medical school physician and professor Jerome Groopman.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-ART &LR;  -- Florentine architect Brunelleschi's

Kimmelman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-BREED &LR;  -- Keep your AKC pedigree and ``give me a

Bond Between People and Dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-COMEDY &LR;  -- There was Shakespeare, there was

Importance of Being Ernest.' 500 words. By David Lodge, author of
``Therapy: A Novel'' and ``The Practice of Writing.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-FASHION &LR;  -- The zipper is probably the only

Language of Clothes.''

devours.'' 500 words. A gem by Alberto Manguel, author of ``A
History of Reading.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-SHOT &LR;  -- A nameless bowman in the forests of

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-LOVESONG &LR;  -- Not ``You're a Hard Dog to Keep

Love You.'' The prize for finest love song goes to Richard Strauss,

Lorrie Moore, author of ``Birds of America.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-PORT &LR;  -- ``Talk has been of Venice sinking below

years.'' 750 poetic words. By Jan Morris, author of ``The World of

history of the Byzantine Empire.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-VICTORY &LR;  -- It was a come-from-behind triumph:

</P>
<P>

about the universe that our major millennial anxiety is the
desperate wish to sort it out. So we hunger to rank almost
everything as The Best. 1,500 words. By op-ed columnist and senior
writer for The New York Times Magazine, Frank Rich.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-PIANO &LR;  -- The keyboard music of Johann Sebastian
Bach cannot be called piano music, but there is one magnificent
exception: the six-voice ``ricercare'' from ``The Musical
Offering.'' 400 words. By Charles Rosen, concert pianist and author
of ``The Classical Style.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-TOOL &LR;  -- ``It is not an exaggeration to say that

</P>
<P>

 &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-IDEA &LR;  -- It is romantic love, which in the
ancient world was virtually unknown. ``Eros'' referred to chaos,
even disaster. But to the modern sensibility, love is the very
engine of life. 1,100 words. By the prolific American author Joyce
Carol Oates.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-INVENTION &LR;  -- No doubt, the printing press is

Diamond, Pulitzer Prize-winning author and physicist.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-SERMON &LR;  -- The concept, the `Shining City on a
Hill,' came to life in the 1630 sermon by the Massachusetts Bay
Colony's Gov. Robert Winthrop. His plea for civic virtue inspired
JFK and Reagan and perhaps even Martin Luther's King Jr.'s ``I Have
a Dream'' speech. 1,200 words. By Peter J. Gomes, minister of The
Memorial Church at Harvard.

 &UR; MAPPING the MILLENNIUM: ``The Best View of the World'' &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; ''The Agnese Map'' -- Created by Battista Agnese, a Venetian
cartographer, in Venice, in the mid-16th century &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; CREDIT: Courtesy of the John Carter Brown Library at Brown
University &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; Artwork availability: 35mm color slides or electronic transmission
(via E-MAIL, NEWSCOM or WIECK photo database) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This flat map of the world traced the route of Magellan's
voyages and the Spanish silver fleet. Decorated with cherubs' faces
in a cosmos of billowing clouds and turquoise skies, it is a high
mark of the Renaissance fascination with science and humanism.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-DEMOCRACY -- Every dictator's nightmare is the
idea that humans have rights. The universal principle of the
fundamental rights of man is any tyrant's ``province of terror.''
1,900 words. By Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and Nigerian
pro-democracy leader Wole Soyinka.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-TIME &LR;  -- In this panel discussion moderated by
veteran New York Times columnist Russell Baker, the talk is of the
best time to be alive. The Ming dynasty? Puritan New England?
Yale's Jonathan Spence, Harvard's Orlando Patterson and others tell
where they'd have lived, given the choice. 1,900 words.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-PRODUCT &LR;  -- Forget electricity, the microchip
and the car. Without beans we wouldn't have made it out of the Dark
Ages. If human beings are still here, descendants of the Pilgrim
Fathers or the Spanish conquistadores, it is thanks to beans. 2,400
words. By Umberto Eco, the author of ``The Name of the Rose'' and
``Foucault's Pendulum.''

   ---
 &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-BATTLE &LR;  -- The millennium would see other great
battles, like Gettysburg and D-Day, but for 1,000 years, only the
defeat of the Turks by Jan Sobieski near Vienna in 1683 has rivaled
the Battle of Saratoga. 1,200 words. R.J. Apple Jr., chief
correspondent for The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-UTOPIA &LR;  -- As utopians go, the Shakers were a
kindly, harmless bunch. They never took up with Big Brother; they
were pacifists; they didn't kill anyone; they didn't try to impose
their ideas by force. Plus they made a lasting contribution to
furniture design and music. 700 words. By Margaret Atwood, author
of ``A Handmaid's Tail'' and ``Alias Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-GAME &LR;  -- Soccer is a perfect substitute for war,
by assuaging national rivalries. Case in point: Last summer more
than 1 million people gathered on the Champs-Elysees to celebrate
France's victory in the World Cup. Just a sports coup? 800 words.
By Paul Auster, the author, most recently, of ``Timbuktu.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-INSTRUMENT &LR;  -- The human voice is a blessed
gift, whether alone, as part of a chorus, chanting in prayer or in
wild outbursts of percussive sound. 300 words. By Leon Botstein,
music director of the American Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-REVOLUTION &LR;  -- Thanks to Gandhi, the peacemaker,
India won its freedom without firing a shot. ``Of the many
revolutions ... the human-rights revolution seems to be the most
morally appealing to the world of our time.'' 700 words. By Alan
Brinkley, a Columbia history professor and author of ``Liberalism
and Its Discontents.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-STORY &LR;  -- ``Scheherazade'' has everything a tale
should have: sex, death, treachery, vengeance, magic, humor, wit,
surprise, a gorgeous heroine and a happy ending. 2,000 words. By
the noted storyteller A.S. Byatt.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-DEAL &LR;  -- The purchase of the Suez Canal Co. gave
bankers more power than they had yet known or would ever know
again. 600 words. By Ron Chernow, the author of ``Titan,'' a
biography of John D. Rockefeller Sr.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-LEADER &LR;  -- ``Just look how well she governs,''
the once-reluctant subjects of Elizabeth I, the Virgin Queen, later
would remark. For the ravishing ruler exceeded all expectations,
and by now she is namesake to an era. 500 words. By New York Times
editorial board member Gail Collins.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-FIRST &LR;  -- Among first millennium notables, the
Chinese dared to dream _ and outlasted the Romans, Persians, Maya
and Ethiopians. 1,500 words. By Felipe Fernandez-Armesto, author of
``Millennium,'' being made into a TV series for CNN.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-NUISANCE &LR;  -- Octavia Hill, queen of open spaces,
loved the English countryside, its green fields and fresh air. And
the tiny, stout, badly dressed Hill was obstinate, a downright
bully, about preserving the land she loved. 350 words. By Penelope
Fitzgerald, author of ``The Blue Flower.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-ESCAPE &LR;  -- Just as the lords of evil were about
to make the world part slave colony and part death camp ... the
democracies seized their chance, and mankind made its narrow escape
from global darkness. In short, the Axis self-destructed. 400
words. By David Fromkin, author of ``The Way of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-MEDICINE &LR;  -- In 1796 Edward Jenner tried the
first smallpox vaccine. Its success signaled the first step in
medicine's control over the microbial world _ one that led to the
discovery of safe, inexpensive and effective vaccines. 400 words.
By Harvard medical school physician and professor Jerome Groopman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-SCANDAL &LR;  -- When it comes to failed romance,
nothing beats the British royals. Case in point: Henry VIII and
Anne Boleyn. 450 words. By Josephine Hart, author of ``Damage,''
``Sin'' and ``Oblivion.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-ART &LR;  -- Florentine architect Brunelleschi's
invention of perspective, a system for representing three
dimensions in two, made it so that, in a painting or drawing, a
beautiful lady's string of pearls would look closer than the map on
the wall. 500 words. By New York Times chief art critic Michael
Kimmelman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-BREED &LR;  -- Keep your AKC pedigree and ``give me a

Knapp, author of ``Drinking, A Love Story'' and ``The Intricate
Bond Between People and Dogs.''
</P>

Importance of Being Ernest.' 500 words. By David Lodge, author of
``Therapy: A Novel'' and ``The Practice of Writing.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-FASHION &LR;  -- The zipper is probably the only
clothes fastener to have been the star of a Broadway song. And yes,
there's nothing sexier than a zipper, a ``perfect set of teeth.''
500 words. By Alison Lurie, author (appropriately), of ``The
Language of Clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-PUNCTUATION &LR;  -- Natch, it's the period.
``Diminutive as a mote of dust, a mere peck of the pen, a crumb on
the keyboard, the full stop _ the period _ is the unsung legislator
of our writing systems ... the irreplaceable ``dot that death
devours.'' 500 words. A gem by Alberto Manguel, author of ``A
History of Reading.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-SHOT &LR;  -- A nameless bowman in the forests of

Review editor Charles McGrath.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-LOVESONG &LR;  -- Not ``You're a Hard Dog to Keep
Under the Porch.'' Not even Dolly Parton's sublime ``I Will Always
Love You.'' The prize for finest love song goes to Richard Strauss,
who knew that love triangles make the best music, and proved it in
the ravishing final trio of ``Die Rosenkavalier.'' 600 words. By
Lorrie Moore, author of ``Birds of America.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-PORT &LR;  -- ``Talk has been of Venice sinking below
the flood. But it has not been so. So rich is the port, so
incomparably hemmed around by beauty, that it will remain a prodigy
among the havens, a true bride of the sea, a port of a thousand
years.'' 750 poetic words. By Jan Morris, author of ``The World of
Venice.''
</P>

BLACK MOTORISTS SAY PREJUDICE RULES THE ROAD

   WASHINGTON _ On highways and in neighborhood streets, many
minority citizens say they are stopped for no apparent reason by
law enforcement officials, a practice they find humiliating.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned by what some lawmakers describe as racial profiling,
some House members and senators are pressing the Justice Department
to begin collecting police and highway data to determine whether
there is any disparity among the races and ethnic groups when it
comes to traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman conceded Tuesday that some New
Jersey state troopers singled out black and Hispanic drivers on the
highway. On Monday, New Jersey officials had announced the
indictment of two state troopers on charges of trying to hide the
fact that they were pulling over black motorists. Those two
troopers were already suspended from the force and are under
investigation in a racially charged shooting on the New Jersey
Turnpike last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``All citizens regardless of their race should be free to travel
America's highways without undue harassment,'' said Rep. John
Conyers, D-Mich., who introduced a bill calling for a study of
traffic stops. A similar bill passed the House last year, but
stalled in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno endorsed the idea of collecting
data, saying there is at least a problem in how minorities feel
they are treated by law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we have only anecdotes and allegations,'' Reno said
Thursday in a speech before the National Press Club. ``We need
more.''
</P>
<P>
   In her speech, Reno talked at length about tensions between
minority communities and law enforcement agencies, an issue that
seems to be gathering some steam among Democrats on Capitol Hill,
fueled in part by a high-profile police shooting of an unarmed
immigrant in New York and the collective frustration of many
African-American lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Justice Department has no statistics on traffic
stops and race, although some independent studies have pointed to a
disproportionate number of black motorists being stopped.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a 1996 court-ordered study found that black
motorists accounted for 71 percent of stops and searches on
Interstate 95 in Maryland by state troopers who were part of a
drug-interdiction team. African Americans, meanwhile, made up just
10 percent of the driving population in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said that if no reason is given to explain the stop, the
motorist is often left to feel that race was the primary factor.
</P>
<P>
   That was the impression left with Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C.,
chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. Clyburn, 58, said he
has experienced several unexplained traffic stops over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The latest, he said, was three years ago when a young black
staff member was driving Clyburn through the state in the
congressman's new Lincoln Continental. A police officer, Clyburn
said, pulled them over.
</P>
<P>
   No reason, Clyburn said, was ever given for the stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were stopped and the driver of the car was asked whose car
is this,'' Clyburn recalled. ``My staffer told him it's the
congressman's car. And then the officer asked, `Who's the
congressman?'''
</P>
<P>
   Recounting the incident, Clyburn exclaimed, ``I'm sitting right
there! But I don't fit the profile of a congressman.''
</P>
<P>
   Several police advocates were skeptical of the proposal to
collect racial data on traffic stops, saying that numbers alone
would be too easy to misinterpret and could be used for political
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``To assume that stops are made on a racial basis is
misleading,'' said Jim Pasco, executive director of the National
Fraternal Order of Police. Pasco said that in looking for drug
traffickers, police consider many factors, including the type of
car, the driver's age, the neighborhood, the time of day and how
the driver is handling the car.
</P>
<P>
   Like Reno, Pasco rejected the idea of racial profiling, saying
that police should focus on behavior, not race. An exception, he
said, would be if officers were looking for a specific suspect and
race was part of the description.
</P>
<P>
   But another law enforcement expert suggested that since
minorities are disproportionately represented in the criminal
justice system, it stands to reason that more would be pulled over
if law enforcement officials were looking for suspected criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll obviously find that some people violate the laws more
than others,'' said Donald Baldwin, executive director of the
National Law Enforcement Council in Washington. ``That's a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin declined to elaborate, but according to Justice
Department statistics, black suspects accounted for 30 percent of
all arrests in 1996. Blacks make up 13 percent of the general
population. The black inmate population is far higher, accounting
for roughly 39 percent of the federal prison population in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Clyburn said that those numbers don't mean that blacks are more
prone to crime. Instead, he said, they point to biases throughout
the criminal justice system, where minorities are arrested at
greater rates and treated more harshly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other ways of looking at those numbers,'' Clyburn
said. ``I do not think the Justice Department has developed a sense
of urgency yet about many of these issues.''

CONCEPTUAL ART: OVER AND YET EVERYWHERE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Is it going too far to say that Conceptual Art has
been to the second half of the 20th century what Cubism was to the
first half _ that is, a great divide, a demarcation after which
nothing was quite the same? Maybe, but not by much.
</P>
<P>
   Conceptual Art produced far fewer masterpieces than Cubism,
having disavowed the very term, and overall it probably did not
turn out as many art objects, dematerialization of art being one of
its goals. But in some weird, insidious way, it may have had a
greater impact on art, our view of art and its relationship to
life. Conceptual Art announced a recess from conventional
art-making; when class resumed, it was conducted according to a
different set of rules.
</P>
<P>
   It is now about 30 years since the phrase Conceptual Art gained
wide usage. (Coined by Edward Keinholz in the 1950s, it was put
into active play by Joseph Kosuth and Sol LeWitt in the late 60s.)
Its adherents dispensed with or radically redefined art objects,
material and technique and began questioning the very being and
usage of art.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, charts, graphs, maps and especially texts and
photographs _ and most especially the image-text combination _
emerged as the movement's stylistic traits. The era of reading
while standing up in art galleries was under way. So was a period
of unusual purity and idealism; the Conceptualists made few
concessions to the practicalities of galleries, collectors or
sales. They had almost ``no stuff,'' in the words of an artist I
know; that is, stuff to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Barry projected words onto walls; Kosuth exhibited photo
enlargements of dictionary definitions of common objects beside the
objects themselves as well as photographs of them; Vito Acconci had
himself photographed furtively following strangers in the street,
and he famously masturbated under a slanting floor at Sonnabend
Gallery in SoHo; Gilbert and George sent out cards announcing that
they were ``Living Sculpture''; and a California art student named
Chris Burden began a run of notorious acts and events by spending
five days in a locker at art school.
</P>
<P>
   It is now more than 20 years since the movement was seen as
petering out. Its ``classic period,'' in fact, seems to have been
barely a decade long. In the main essay to ``Reconsidering the
Object of Art: 1965-1975,'' an exhibition at the Los Angeles Museum
of Contemporary Art in 1995, Lucy R. Lippard, the movement's
presiding critic, wrote about it in the past tense.
</P>
<P>
   But Conceptualism never really faded away, and it certainly
didn't die; it simply rose, fell and rose again by infiltrating
other art forms. By now it seems virtually radioactive in its
staying power and ubiquity; it is the shifting terra infirma on
which nearly all contemporary art is built _ and a crucial factor
in the increasingly globalized art world.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, several exhibitions in the New York area are
deliberately or inadvertently noting the anniversary. ``Museum as
Muse: Artists Reflect,'' organized by Kynaston McShine at the
Museum of Modern Art, contains a skeletal outline of Conceptualism,
tracing its effects through the work of younger artists of the 80s
and 90s.
</P>
<P>
   It includes Hans Haacke's documentation of the progress of
Seurat's ``Poseuses'' through 14 collections between 1888-1975;
Fred Wilson's commentary on the Modern's elitism, a telling
arrangement of photographs drawn entirely from the museum's
archive, and Andrea Fraser's video tour of the Wadsworth Atheneum
in Hartford, which concentrates exclusively on the businesses,
marriages and collecting tastes of the museum's patrons and never
gets inside the front door.
</P>
<P>
   And at the Thread Waxing Space on lower Broadway, ``Conceptual
Art as Neurobiological Praxis'' mixes contemporary work with
Conceptual Art documentation and publications from the late 1960s
and 70s. (The latter, arranged by the artist Warren Neidich, the
show's organizer, itself presumably qualifies as a work of
Conceptual Art.) There have been unexpected retrievals, like the
little-known word paintings from the 60s by Gene Berry, recently
shown at Mitchell Algus in SoHo. Berry once lived in the same Lower
East Side loft building as LeWitt.
</P>
<P>
   But the real departure should be ``Global Conceptualism: Points
of Origin, 1950s-1980s,'' which opens at the Queens Museum of Art
this week. Overseen by Jane Farver, the exhibition is to include
more than 240 works by 135 artists from more than two dozen
countries, much of it being shown in this country for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   The works will range from the tiny ``Postcard Paintings'' by the
Japanese artist Yutaka Matsuzawa, made in 1967, to an untitled work
from 1993-94 by the South African artist Kendell Geers, which
documents his joining all his country's political parties at once.
That the actual selections have been made by 11 curators from
different parts of the world suggests that Conceptualism and its
aftereffects are too big and diffuse for a single mind to
encompass.
</P>
<P>
   Conceptual Art was forged in the cauldron of political unrest
(civil rights, anti-war, feminist) of the late 1960s and early 70s
and in the mathematical tendencies of Minimalism and the
philosophizing ironies of Jasper Johns and various European
forefathers (Piero Manzoni, Yves Klein). It brought into focus, and
into the artistic mainstream, subversive ideas that had been
hovering on modernism's edges for much of the 20th &UR;  &LR; century, in
Dada, Fluxus, Happenings, Concrete Poetry and Situationism.
</P>
<P>
   Marcel Duchamp's readymades, which had established as early as
1913 that anything (and by extension any activity) could be art,
were the movement's ground zero, its ``Demoiselles d'Avignon.'' The
movement's crucial non-Western influence _ as African art was to
Cubism _ was Eastern thought, which entered the postwar art world
by way of John Cage and reinforced the Conceptual interest in the
quotidian, the modest, the random and the immaterial.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Conceptual Art seems to have been populous from the start. It
either spread like wildfire, or, as Ms. Farver's exhibition seems
likely to confirm, it combusted spontaneously at several points
around the world in reaction to local strands of modernism and
specific political and social crises.
</P>
<P>
   By 1970, when McShine organized ``Information'' at the Museum of
Modern Art _ the first large survey of Conceptual Art in this
country _ he was able to bring together nearly 100 artists from
more than a dozen countries.
</P>
<P>
   What made it so universal? It certainly didn't hurt that it was
virtually formless, devoid of style and without national identity;
that it could be manifest in any material or no material; that the
written text and the photograph, its staples, were familiar and
available worldwide, and that it required very little traditional
art training.
</P>
<P>
   Its rise happened to coincide with the widespread availability
of video, which opened the way for other marginal activities _
film, for example _ to become more central, and it allowed artists
to make performance and moving images integral to their work.
</P>
<P>
   The Conceptualists were like little Davids approaching Goliath
art subjects. The paucity of their means enabled them to tackle
grandiose themes that artists working in traditional materials
could not touch. Their projects did not necessarily have to be
completed, or even possible, for them to put the viewer in touch
with the pulse of the universe, or to see the artist as
quixotically dedicated to a calling higher than producing
traditional, and saleable, art objects.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Huebler announced that he intended to photograph
everyone in the world. The career of the artist On Kawara has been
an extended exercise in marking and making visible the passage of
time, whether in his date paintings (recently seen in an exhibition
at the David Zwirner Gallery in SoHo) or his daily telegrams
announcing his waking time each day (``I got up'').
</P>
<P>
   When Conceptual Art seemed to wane, in the late 1970s, there was
a sigh of relief about the return of the art object. Some of the
Conceptualists themselves came in from the cold and started making
paintings and sculpture _ much as Picasso took up Neo-Classicism
after the rigors of Cubism. Burden and Acconci, exemplars of
endurance art, turned to sculpture; Mel Bochner and Dorothea
Rockburne gradually worked their way to paint on canvas. Perhaps
Conceptualism was a young artist's work, best pursued when the body
was strong and the mind fresher.
</P>
<P>
   But Conceptualism remained a force. By nullifying the art
object, it created a clean slate, reintroduing possibilities that
Minimalism and Pop, worldly as they were, had held at bay. Mainly,
it resurrected subjects largely expunged by abstraction _ the body,
psychology, society, for example. It declared not only that subject
matter was permissible in mainstream art, but that (italics)any(end
italics) subject matter was permissible.
</P>
<P>
   In this manner, Conceptualism encouraged two contradictory
tendencies: a new self-consciousness and critical attitude on the
one hand, and a new sense of anything goes on the other. Both
tendencies were visible in the resurgence of art objects _ whether
they were by the photo-based Pictures artists, the
Neo-Expressionists, the commodity-oriented Neo-Geoists or the
political-is-personal artists of the 90s.
</P>
<P>
   The Neo-Expressionists in particular were widely denounced as
regressive, but to some extent they were simply taking advantage of
the range and liberties exemplified by Conceptual Art. In fact,
several painters of the 1980s, including David Salle, Eric Fischl
and Sigmar Polke, passed through Conceptual Art on their way to
painting.
</P>
<P>
   Hewing more closely to the original style, the Pictures artists
breathed new life into its image-text combination. Barbara Kruger,
for example, made her exhortative captions part of the image, while
Cindy Sherman's early ``Film Stills'' plugged into each viewer's
memory bank of movies.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, having mastered reading while standing up, the art world
now learned to read images for their cultural meanings, their
suggestions of multiple, fragmented narratives and ambiguous
meanings. And throughout the paint-laden 80s, certain members of
the original generation _ Lawrence Weiner, John Baldessari and
Kosuth _ achieved eminence gris status, remaining fixtures in big
international shows.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it's hard to think of a supposedly past art movement that
feels more present. Conceptual Art's influence and that of its
conceptually oriented siblings _ Performance, Process and
Installation Art _ is visible wherever contemporary art is on view,
in surveys around the world, in galleries around the corner. Stroll
around SoHo and Chelsea in Manhattan and Williamsburg in Brooklyn
and you will repeatedly be confronted with echoes, homages and
reprises, both intentional and not.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, its influence is apparent in the multimedia
fluidity that today's younger artists take for granted, moving
effortlessly from painting to video to photography to drawing at
will. It is visible in conventions that we all accept without
question _ the wall drawings and wall paintings whose point of
origin was primarily Sol LeWitt, but also Ms. Rockburne and
Bochner.
</P>
<P>
   A recent manifestation is the brightly colored wall painting
that LeWitt just completed for Christie's new American headquarters
at Rockefeller Center.
</P>
<P>
   Conceptualism's influence is apparent in the corrosive presence
of photography, in the relentless emphasis on narrative, in the
implication of performance in work in all media and in the constant
use in art writing of words like ``post,'' ``neo'' and ``late''
Conceptual to refer to work by artists who were still in diapers in
the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Conceptual Art's most visible effect is the widespread use of
language, the written word in art or as art. The written word has
progressed from Acconci's semilegible scrawls to the aphorisms of
Jenny Holzer, first printed on paper, then carved into granite
benches and translated into vibrant LED signs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the English artist Fiona Banner made a large
black-on-white painting that simply reiterated the entire dialogue
and action of ``Lawrence of Arabia.'' But some recent
manifestations have returned to the rudimentary approaches of the
early 70s: In ``Signs That Say What You Want Them to Say, and Not
Signs That Say What Someone Else Wants You to Say'' of 1992-93, the
English artist Gillian Wearing asked passersby to write anything
they wanted on a piece of posterboard and then pose for her camera.
</P>
<P>
   A new wrinkle is the latest work of Sean Landers, known since
the early 1990s for large canvases covered with embarrassingly
confessional monologues. In his new paintings, on view at the
Andrea Rosen Gallery in Chelsea, Landers's writing is as
self-obsessed as ever, but it now fills the space _ like enormous,
borderless thought balloons _ around clownish portraits. The
teeming words form a wavering, cosseting net while permanently
capturing on canvas some of the anxiety once cultivated, in
performance, by artists like Acconci, Adrian Piper, or the
monologuist Spalding Gray.
</P>
<P>
   Certain tactics circulate and recirculate. Kawara's accumulation
of daily data has a strong echo in the work of Danica Phelps, whose
drawings and charts keep meticulous track of her expenses and the
money earned from her art.
</P>
<P>
   Conceptualism's questioning of the art object has not affected
only contemporary work and the growth of new media. Conceptualism
was among the first of many breakdowns and transgressed borders
that have continued to occur across the entire field of art,
greatly expanding its scope.
</P>
<P>
   These days art history is a bigger, more complicated subject
than ever before; it has been opened up to include previously
neglected areas of craft and design, folk art and outsider art and
to art from other cultures.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, this stealthy, multifarious art movement has had
effects beyond the art world. The catchier side of Conceptual Art _
the legacy of William Wegman's Weimaraners, of Ms. Kruger's
red-on-black-and-white graphic signature _ is apparent every day in
television commercials and print advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Many aspects of the displays in the Holocaust Museum in
Washington are also indebted to Conceptual and Installation Art.
There, glass walls etched with names are reminiscent of Jenny
Holzer; a gallery lined with photographs of victims brings to mind
the work of Christian Boltanski, and its pile of shoes from
concentration camps is a descendant of countless works of
installation art that impress by presenting a familiar object or
material in quantity.
</P>
<P>
   More profoundly, and at times negatively, the way art is
experienced has changed. Conceptual Art has encouraged the
assumption that every object, every picture, even every abstract
painting tells a story _ that it carries within it some kind of
narrative, meaning or ``subtext.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally ingrained is the more limiting expectation that all this
meaning is primarily intellectual and easily reduced to language,
that art as an entity is completely explainable. We owe to
Conceptualism years of one-liner artworks in all media _ the ``I
get it'' school of esthetic experience. This condition has caused a
permanent confusion of content with subject matter, to the
continuing detriment of both content and form. Too often, art that
lacks an explicit subject is thought to be without content and
dismissed (this happens especially to abstract art).
</P>
<P>
   By diminishing the role of form, Conceptual Art made all art
easier to grasp, less threatening and less mysterious. This may be
a strange fate for a movement that has often seemed so arcane and
opaque, and that was initially viewed as a reductivist dead end for
artists. But it's not so surprising. By expanding the definition of
what art can be, Conceptual Art released art into the culture at
large. It has become the paradigm, but also the caricature of
radical art.
</P>
<P>
   Where does that leave us? Partly in recovery from Conceptual
Art, and partly in its debt. It could be argued that the
rematerialization of the art object has been a preoccupation of
artists of the last 20 years. The challenge is to embed concepts,
ideas and critique in material and form. This, along with the rise
in numerous realist styles, has contributed to a return of
traditional skills, techniques and to some extent standards.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Conceptual Art has played a major role in the
dramatic opening out of the art world _ to women, minorities and
artists from different cultures _ that has also transpired during
the same 20 years. It is no longer possible for art to be dominated
by one country, one style or one medium. For a dematerialized art
movement, this is a tangible accomplishment.

SEEING A CENTURY OUT VENTURING INTO THE NEXT ONE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 William Harris writes frequently on art, dance and theater in
Manhattan.  
 By WILLIAM HARRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Any big art opening is crammed with fabulous people
gossiping about everyone and carping about what's on view. Last
Tuesday, when the first half of the Whitney Museum of American
Art's ``American Century,'' a behemoth exhibition featuring 1,200
works of art, was to be unveiled, the opening proved bittersweet
for Lisa Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Phillips had been organizing exhibitions at the Whitney
since 1977 and was one of four people who pulled together this
show. But that evening she was to be a guest rather than a host,
for earlier that day she was scheduled to begin her new job as
director at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Phillips is only the second director at the 22-year-old New
Museum, a not-for-profit institution devoted to art by living
artists. She follows Marcia Tucker (also a former Whitney curator),
who created the place in 1977, in part as an alternative to what
she perceived as a stale, male-dominated museum world.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tucker's goal was not to build a permanent collection _ the
New Museum does not have one _ but to provide a showcase for
challenging conceptual and political art that other museums were
ignoring. Ms. Tucker resigned as director last March to pursue
other interests. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Phillips, 45, a slender woman with an elongated face that
Modigliani might have painted, is not nearly as flamboyant as her
predecessor. Understatement is her M.O. But she is known within the
art world for her intelligence, her passion for contemporary art in
all its manifestations _ she curated more than 25 shows at the
Whitney _ and her keen eye for spotting emerging talent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She is also incredibly discreet. During a recent interview, she
declined to discuss her resignation from the Whitney last December,
after 22 years. Ms. Phillips was more forthcoming about her plans
for the New Museum, where her curatorial touch will first be felt
in mid-2000 (museums plan far ahead).
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants the next chapter in the museum's life to be
different,'' she said. ``That is actually built into its mandate.
Part of what the New Museum is about is change. I would like to see
it do more with film, architecture, design and other media that
haven't been a prominent part of the programming. I also hope to
collaborate on projects with other institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; As an example of such collaboration, the New Museum, in the
spring of 2001, will house a Tom Friedman exhibition, put together
by the Southeast Center for Contemporary Art in Winston-Salem, N.C.
Friedman is a whimsical Conceptualist who has made delicate
sculptures out of Play-Doh or boxes of spaghetti. That same year,
Ms. Phillips will collaborate with the Museum of Contemporary Art
in Chicago on a show of works by William Kentridge, a white South
African who explores issues of racial bias through drawings and
video.
</P>
<P>
   Before these, in the fall of 2000, the New Museum will mount a
show by Paul McCarthy, the Los Angeles-based sculptor and
performance artist, who has inspired a whole new generation of
artists but has never had a major show in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Phillips does not lack ambition. ``One of my first
priorities is to make sure everyone knows of the museum's
existence, its location and its programming,'' she said. ``I've
frequently been asked, `What is the New Museum?' People in the art
world know it, but I want to broaden its base of support, not just
to New Yorkers but around the country and the world. I want to make
sure the New Museum is a must-see stop on anyone's itinerary when
in New York.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The New Museum, with an annual operating budget of $2.7 million,
occupies 33,000 square feet on three floors in a residential loft
condominium at 583 Broadway. There are three distinct exhibition
spaces, plus a bookstore. Under Ms. Tucker, the museum made its
mark by mounting group shows, often overstuffed with socially
engaged art.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, with the hiring in 1995 of Dan Cameron, a critic
and independent curator, as senior curator, the museum has been
staging more one-person exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   The New Museum remains committed to work that is edgy and often
unfashionable, as well as to non-United States-based artists. In
November, for example, there will be a show by Cildo Meireles, a
Brazilian Conceptual sculptor. Through June 20, there is a
retrospective honoring David Wojnarowicz, a
writer-photographer-painter-performance artist who died of
AIDS-related illnesses in 1992. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As director, Ms. Phillips will spend much of her time with
administrative chores, including raising money. But she will also
continue to organize exhibitions with the help of Cameron, a
longtime friend and colleague. Ms. Phillips has often relied on his
advice, particularly when working on the Whitney Biennial, that
museum's signature and always controversial survey of new trends in
art.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Phillips was curator of the 1997 Biennial and served on the
curatorial team for every Biennial between 1985 and 1993. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Will it be awkward being Cameron's boss? ``It's a team,'' Ms.
Phillips says. ``Dan is one of the New Museum's strengths. He
consistently gets out and sees work around the world, more than
practically anyone else I know.'' For his part, Cameron isn't
worried about titles. ``The New Museum is nonhierarchical,'' he
said. ``Besides, I like having a peer as a boss and a sense of
direction in place.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tucker said of her successor: ``I couldn't be happier. Lisa
has contacts, she has ideas and she's really respected and loved by
artists. That makes an enormous difference.'' Ms. Tucker was not
consulted in the selection of her replacement. That was handled by
the board of directors' search committee, led by the board
president, Saul Dennison, with the help of a head-hunting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Phillips was initially interviewed last May, then didn't
hear a peep until November, when she was interviewed a second time
and subsequently offered the position. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to Dennison, the New Museum considered four candidates
seriously. What tipped the scale in Ms. Phillips's favor, Dennison
said, was that ``she's extremely focused and has great credibility
in the art world.'' He continued: ``She had been working for a
mainstream museum and was willing to leave. Plus, our senior
curator highly endorsed her.'' Still, it took months for the search
committee to make a decision. Perhaps Ms. Phillips low-key manner
had been disarming. ``The first interview didn't go as well as the
second,'' Dennison said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Phillips grew up in Brooklyn. Today, she lives in lower
Manhattan with her husband, Leon Falk, an independent film
producer. (She was previously married to the Venezuelan artist
Meyer Vaisman.) Her father, Warren H. Phillips, worked for The Wall
Street Journal and eventually became the chief executive at Dow
Jones, the parent company. But journalism was never a career
option.
</P>
<P>
   ``When everything you write as a child is edited,'' Ms. Phillips
said, ``that dissuades you.'' Ms. Phillips discovered a love of art
while at Middlebury College in Vermont, and during her junior year
abroad in Vienna, she started thinking seriously about a museum
career. It was also there that she discovered the uncomfortable
truth about a painting in the living room of her parents' home: It
was just a reproduction of the Velazquez original. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Phillips did graduate work in art history at City University
Graduate Center and was selected for the Whitney Independent Study
program, a course for curators, critics and artists. Immediately
after, she joined the Whitney curatorial staff as manager of the
now defunct downtown branch in Manhattan. Last November, after
Maxwell L. Anderson succeeded David A. Ross as director of the
museum, she was given the title curator of painting and sculpture. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, she is about to embark on only her second job in her adult
life. ``A lot of thought and a lot of agony went into `The American
Century,' said Ms. Phillips of her Whitney swan song. ``There are
many deserving artists who are not included. But you try to tell a
story that will reach a lot of people. It's only one story; there
are hundreds of others to tell. That's what I hope to be doing at
the New Museum. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Separating from the Whitney is a little difficult. But I was
really ready to move into a director's job. The New Museum was the
perfect fit because of its size and because of its mandate, which
coincides with my own interests so closely. Plus, I can walk to
work.''

REV. LUIS PALAU SEEKS SOULS, GRAHAM'S MANTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ Luis Palau doesn't give up easily.
</P>
<P>
   His 40-minute sermon about the transcendent power of Jesus's
resurrection draws four-dozen people out of their seats and up to
the stage of the Dartmouth arena, where they proclaim Jesus their
savior.
</P>
<P>
   Palau wants more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be afraid to say yes to eternal life,'' Palau exhorts
the crowd of 1,300. ``Don't close your hearts to Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   A few more people, some crying, haltingly make their way up
front. On stage, Palau beams.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he prays, thanking God for using him, once again, to
bring more people to Jesus in a rugged, cold corner of the country
dominated by Catholics and mainline Protestants. It's rough terrain
for Gospel evangelists, more often associated with tent revivals in
the rural South.
</P>
<P>
   But Palau _ an Argentine-born evangelist so revered in
Spanish-speaking countries that he is referred to as the Billy
Graham of Latin America _ welcomes the challenge of unexplored
territory.
</P>
<P>
   He has spoken before 13 million people in 67 nations from Chile
to Romania, an audience second in size only to Graham's. Some
believe that if anyone can succeed Graham as unofficial pastor to
America, it is Palau.
</P>
<P>
   And while he may not be a household name in New England, the
preacher has come to the region on his Mission Maine tour to change
that.
</P>
<P>
   Palau, who decided he wanted to be an evangelist when he was 18
and heard Graham's fiery preaching on a shortwave radio, is
spending a month in Maine and a couple of days here and in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   His mission is simple: Convince as many people as possible to
accept Jesus as their personal lord and savior. So far, the crusade
has exceeded Palau's expectations. In the first week, 15,000 people
have come to hear him in Maine and New Hampshire. One thousand of
them have made public commitments to Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Palau's colleagues were skeptical when they heard about
the crusade.
</P>
<P>
   After all, New England is not exactly a hotbed of evangelical
fervor. Only about 6 to 8 percent of the region is evangelical,
according to Vision New England, a Christian organization based in
Acton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   And the perception among evangelicals is that New Englanders, by
and large, are indifferent and even somewhat cynical when it comes
to the kind of passionate, emotional preaching Palau brings to mass
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Many evangelicals believe New Englanders also are less likely to
accept evangelical Christianity's core message, that the Bible is
the word of God and eternal life is only possible for Christians
who embrace Jesus as their savior.
</P>
<P>
   Palau is one of a number of evangelicals trying to plant their
charismatic, soul-saving, and uncompromising brand of evangelical
Christianity in the tough New England soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``People told me that New England was too hard and people were
so unholy,'' Palau said in an interview inside a locker room at
Leede Arena in Hanover, where he preached on consecutive nights
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Still, New England does have deep evangelical roots.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Awakening of the mid-1700s was born in New England,
and the region was the home territory of some of America's greatest
evangelists, including George Whitefield and Dwight Moody.
</P>
<P>
   So Palau, accompanied by a small army of assistants, younger
preachers, and nationally acclaimed Christian musicians, was
hopeful when he arrived in Maine earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Palau added: ``I love a challenge. When people say,
`You can't break through here,' I say, `Oh, yeah. Maybe I can't,
but God can.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been decades since citizens of this region have been
confronted by the claims of Christ, and we thought it's about time
it happened,'' he said. ``All of Maine is going to have to hear the
voice of God. They may reject his message, but they are going to
hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, Christian pastors and activists are calling Palau's
holy crusade a religious milestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proclamation of the Gospel on such a large scale is
something this state has not seen in a very long time,'' said the
Rev. David McBride, chairman of Mission Maine.
</P>
<P>
   McBride, senior associate pastor of First Baptist Church in
Portland, Maine, noted that more than 10,000 people have
volunteered for Palau's crusade, an extraordinary number, given
Maine's relatively small evangelical population.
</P>
<P>
   Palau's ability to mobilize evangelicals is nothing new. Since
1966, when he first began staging revivals in stadiums and arenas,
Palau has drawn huge crowds: 106,000 in Mexico City in 1970,
518,000 in London in 1984, and 127,000 in Hong Kong two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars and evangelical activists say Palau's appeal lies in
his sincerity, integrity, and enthusiasm. He's not a
fire-and-brimstone preacher. He's more of a storyteller, weaving
together personal anecdotes with quotes from Scripture.
</P>
<P>
   At Dartmouth, Palau's message was simple, straightforward, and
sometimes humorous, gradually building the case for why his
listeners should ``open their hearts to Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``God's plan for the human race is that we know happiness,''
Palau told an audience that began arriving two hours before the
evangelist took the stage. ``He doesn't want us to walk around with
long faces. God has a plan, but his plan is that you trust him and
let him come into your life. I'm here to tell you tonight that a
loving God wants you.''
</P>
<P>
   Palau said Graham taught him the finer points of staging a
massive crusade. Graham also gave Palau $100,000 to help the Luis
Palau Evangelistic Association in Portland, Ore., 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   About a decade ago, Palau decided he needed to ask Graham's
blessing before holding his first crusades in the United States.
America, Palau says, was Billy Graham's territory, and he did not
want to look like he was stepping on his toes.
</P>
<P>
   According to Palau, Graham told him: ``You don't need (my
blessing), but if you want it, you've got it. We've got to get on
with evangelism.''
</P>
<P>
   As Graham, now 80, becomes increasingly frail, many Christians
wonder who, if anyone, will replace him as the de facto spokesman
for evangelicals.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout American history, almost every era has had one
preacher who came to be regarded as the nation's own, from
Whitefield to Charles Finney, Dwight Moody, Billy Sunday, and
Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Palau is cited frequently as Graham's potential heir. But there
are other contenders, including Franklin Graham, Billy's son;
Bishop T. D. Jakes Sr., a Pentecostal African-American and senior
pastor of Potter's House in Dallas; Bill Hybels, senior pastor of
Willow Creek Community Church outside Chicago; and Anne Graham
Lotz, one of Billy Graham's daughters and founder of Angel
Ministries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Billy Graham is going to be off the scene fairly soon, I
think Palau would likely rise to a similar stature in the public
mind,'' said Keith J. Hardman, professor of philosophy and religion
at Ursinus College in Collegeville, Penn., and author of ``The
History of Evangelical Christianity in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Others aren't so sure anyone can come close to having as large
an influence as Graham did in his heyday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evangelical Chrsitianity has moved beyond stadium crusades and
television as its major thrust,'' said William Martin, professor of
sociology at Rice University in Houston and the author of a
biography of Billy Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hundreds of parachurch organizations, megachurches,
and many other competitors for public attention that these other
evangelists in American history really didn't have,'' Martin said.
``It would be difficult for one person to stand above the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Lon Allison, director of the Billy Graham Center, a training and
research center for evangelism housed at Wheaton College in Wheaton
Ill., agreed: ``Can anyone replace Billy Graham? No, unless God
wants to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Palau said it's flattering simply to be mentioned in the same
breath as Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also gives me credibility,'' he added. ``People might say,
`Well I don't know who that guy Palau is, but if he's compared to
Graham he must be OK.' ''

JON VOIGHT STEERS A NOT-SO-SERIOUS ARK 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's Hollywood Stars
entertainment column) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Jon Voight in
``Noah's Ark.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    In the beginning there was the Bible and there was Cecil B.
DeMille. And DeMille saw the Bible, and it was good screenplay
material.
 &HT;    Hollywood may not be the most religious town on earth, but it
does seem to have an affinity for the Bible. No need to option the
book, and the leading characters are all so long dead that no one
can sue if you get anything wrong.
 &HT;    DeMille scored big with his silent version of ``The Ten
Commandments'' (1923), and repeated the exercise _ this time with
sound _ in 1956, with Charlton Heston parting the Red Sea and
ensuring himself a long career in righteousness. DeMille's ``Samson
and Delilah'' (1950) was another Bible story that had everything,
including sex, violence and a really bad hair day.
 &HT;    More biblical or quasi-biblical epics followed, including ``Quo
Vadis'' (1951), ``The Robe'' (1953), Heston again in ``Ben Hur''
(l959) and ``The Greatest Story Ever Told'' (l965). By 1966
Hollywood was ready to tackle the entire book with ``The Bible,''
most notable for casting John Huston as the voice of God _
naturally, a director got the part.
 &HT;    In our more secular age, however, the Bible has fared less well
on screen. There was ``King David'' (l985), but Richard Gere was
nobody's idea of the King of Israel, and the movie bombed. Martin
Scorsese's controversial ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' (l988)
spurred hostile demonstrations outside Universal Studios' gates,
and the good book pretty much forsook the big screen until last
year's animated epic, ``The Prince of Egypt.''
 &HT;    Recently. however, the Bible has been resurrected on the home
screen by cable evangelist Ted Turner, whose network has so far
given us ``Joseph,'' ``Moses,'' ``Samson and Delilah'' and ``King
David'' in miniseries form.
 &HT;    The latest Biblical saga comes to us from a major network,
however, as NBC launches ``Noah's Ark,'' a special-effects-laden,
four-hour miniseries airing May 2 and 3, and starring Jon Voight.
Bearded and sporting an elaborate, 1960s-style silver ponytail,
this God-fearing arkbuilder has Mary Steenburgen as his peppy,
no-hausfrau-she wife, Naamah.
 &HT;    But something strange has happened to Noah, Naamah and their
sons Ham, Shem and Japheth. They've become comedians _ all of them,
that is, except for Noah, whom Voight plays straight down the
waterway.
 &HT;    But for the rest, this is the Bible gone bananas. Even God comes
off like a cross between Henny Youngman and George Burns.
 &HT;    He instructs Noah to make the ark 500 feet long, 83 feet wide
and 50 feet high.
 &HT;    ``Why so big?'' Noah asks.
 &HT;    ``I think big,'' He says. ``I made the world in six days.''
 &HT;    Later, disgusted with mankind, God considers wiping out the
whole human race, Noah and family included.
 &HT;    ``It's an option,'' the Deity says. ``Don't call me, I'll call
you.''
 &HT;    By the time Lot (F. Murray Abraham) refers to his wife (Carol
Kane) as ``the salt of the earth,'' you've gotten the picture.
 &HT;    There's lots of sex talk, too, particularly on the ark, where
Noah has forbidden his sons and their three girlfriends to
procreate until they're off the boat. Not to mention the fine old
orgy going on in Sodom and Gomorrah.
 &HT;    And, yes, you're right _ Sodom and Gomorrah came after the
flood. But this is television.
 &HT;    ``I think if God created the world, He must have had a sense of
humor,'' director John Irvin says. ``It's an irreverent story _ not
blasphemous or disrespectful. It's respectful without being overly
pious, too solemn or heavy. It's ebullient, it's light, it's full
of life.''
 &HT;    There's a subplot of sorts involving the archvillain of the
piece _ Lot, who in this version leads a convoy of pirates on a
flotilla of rafts and attempts to board the ark. Think Dennis
Hopper's character in ``Waterworld.''
 &HT;    In the midst of this floating funny farm, only Voight as Noah
retains his dignity.
 &HT;    ``Our approach has a lot of humor in it,'' the actor admits
during an interview at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Pasadena, Calif.
``That's the style of the piece.
 &HT;    ``But the story itself is quite disturbing,'' he adds. ``There's
been so much destruction on the planet perpetrated by the human
race. The good news is that more and more people are becoming aware
of that destruction, and of the urgent need to reverse the
process.''
 &HT;    One of the nicest, most unassuming actors in Hollywood, even
after almost 40 years acting, Voight still loves what he does and
takes the work, though not himself, very seriously indeed.
 &HT;    ``I think all the Bible stories are packed with meaning,'' he
says earnestly. ``No question about it. I take these stories quite
literally _ I don't treat them as metaphors. It seems to me there
are no deeper stories than these. They're powerful.''
 &HT;    It's vintage Voight _ serious, philosophical and downright
upright, with the kind of sincerity that has made him believable
even when wrestling with a giant, animatronic snake in the 1997
epic ``Anaconda.''
 &HT;    His career has been a fascinating one ever since he first caught
our attention as Joe Buck, the dumb but likeable street hustler in
``Midnight Cowboy'' (l969). In the years since he's built a
formidable resume in films such as ``Catch 22'' (l970),
``Deliverance'' (l972), ``The Odessa File'' (l974) and ``Coming
Home'' (l978), for which he won an Oscar as a paraplegic Vietnam
vet.
 &HT;    Not all of his roles have been equally meaty, however, and of
late the 60-year-old has metamorphosed from leading man to
character actor, often playing villains such as the go-between
crook in ``Heat'' (l986), the oily corporate lawyer in ``The
Rainmaker,'' (l987) the corrupt national-security chief in ``Enemy
of The State'' (l998) and the fanatically driven police inspector
in ``The General,'' John Boorman's upcoming Irish gangster film.
 &HT;    And now, Noah. Voight says that he enjoyed the romp, and adds
that he sees a message in the film, comic or not, for
turn-of-the-century America.
 &HT;    ``If you want to be simply entertained for a few hours over a
few nights, you can approach `Noah' at that level,'' the actor
says. ``After all, it's stunning visually, filmed in beautiful
places, full of special effects and epic scenes. But this film
invites the audience to use its brain, to reflect on where as a
species we've been _ and where we're going.
 &HT;    ``Here we are just a few months away from a new millennium _
this just may be the right picture in the right country at the
right time.''

VIOLISTS ARE THE TWIN STARS OF AN ORCHESTRAL GALAXY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Comparisons are especially odious in the arts. To try
to prove that the New York Philharmonic has, in Cynthia Phelps, the
``best'' principal violist of any orchestra would be futile and
unsatisfying in the extreme. Still, it is tempting simply to
declare that the Philharmonic has the best (italics)pair(end
italics) of violists of any orchestra in the United States, if not
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Phelps, at 38, has amply displayed her sterling qualities,
not only in her excellent leadership of what has in recent years
become, perhaps, the Philharmonic's plum section, but also in solo
appearances with the orchestra and in chamber performances around
the city.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she arrived here from the Minnesota Orchestra to
become principal violist, in 1992, Rebecca Young had been elevated
to associate principal violist: a close No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Young, who entered the Philharmonic as its youngest player
in 1986, at 20, would by now, at 33, be the principal violist in
almost any other orchestra. In fact, she took that position with
the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1993, but she returned to New York
the next year to be close to her husband and young son.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Masur, the Philharmonic's music director, has repeatedly
voiced his admiration for the two violists. And now Masur's wife,
Tomoko, has shown hers in tangible fashion: by commissioning from
Sofia Gubaidulina a concerto for two violas, ``Two Paths,'' to be
given its premiere in a series of concerts conducted by Masur
beginning on Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Also in that series, without Masur's guiding hand, Ms. Phelps
and Ms. Young will anchor performances of Bach's Sixth
``Brandenburg'' Concerto, in which violas carry the upper lines.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra's original plan to commission a solo concerto for
Ms. Phelps stalled several years ago. ``But Tomoko didn't want to
let it go,'' Ms. Phelps said recently of Ms. Masur, who was herself
a violist before she turned to singing professionally. ``She sits
up there in her box at concerts and watches us play together and
knows we are really good friends. And she came up with the idea for
a concerto for both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The players learned of the commission at the intermission of a
concert, when they were summoned to Masur's dressing room. They
were doubly gratified to hear the reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we were in for it,'' Ms. Phelps said. ``It was the
end of a week, and things had gotten a little out of hand in the
first half of the concert. We play off each other a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   In repartee as well as in performance, to judge from their
conversation during a break between rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   MS. PHELPS: I'm a complete nerd. I'm totally single-minded about
making as much music as I can.
</P>
<P>
   MS. YOUNG: I don't know how you do it. I would rather be home in
my back yard digging up weeds. I'm not as ambitious. Whatever has
come to me has come to me, and I'm having a lot of fun now. Maybe
if I had been trained differently__
</P>
<P>
   MS. PHELPS: I came up through a very competitive environment. I
just did it. I've always wanted to play with people who are better
than me.
</P>
<P>
   MS. YOUNG: That's why I like sitting next to you.
</P>
<P>
   This last might have have been utterly sincere or mildly
facetious. It is sometimes hard to tell with the freewheeling Ms.
Young, who, when asked whether her husband was also a musician,
replied in perfect deadpan, ``No, he's a bass trombonist.'' And
this to a reporter who was determined, in such exalted company, not
even to mention viola jokes, let alone trombone jokes. (Ms. Young's
husband is Jack Schatz, a bass trombonist and a musician. Ms.
Phelps's second husband is the cellist Ronald Thomas; no joke.)
</P>
<P>
   But what was obvious beneath the banter was a warm friendship
founded on mutual respect. ``We were friends before we were even
colleagues,'' Ms. Phelps said, recounting how, when she moved east,
Ms. Young immediately initiated contact. They met and brought their
children together before they began performing together.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are embarked on their most unusual collaboration. Ms.
Phelps, with her mania for performing, has at least played
concertos with some frequency, though she has never given the
premiere of one. Ms. Young has played few concertos at all.
</P>
<P>
   They got the parts for this one in mid-February and found them
of limited use in judging the piece as a whole. ``I didn't really
know what to expect from my part,'' Ms. Phelps said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Young showed admirable initiative, recording Ms. Phelps's
part and playing her own against it. ``The parts are abstract, and
they sometimes extend way up into nosebleed territory,'' she said,
``but if you put them together, they make a lot of sense.''
</P>
<P>
   In mid-March, they gave a command performance of the work with
piano for Masur. ``Gubaidulina gets definite ideas of color and
emotion, and she doesn't care whether it's difficult to play,'' Ms.
Phelps said. Masur helped the players work through certain
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Both violists reciprocate Masur's expressions of admiration and
seem uneasy at the prospect of a successor on the podium, as yet
unknown. ``We don't have a lot to choose from, and we will have to
choose very carefully,'' Ms. Phelps said. ``The orchestra is really
at its strongest now. It won't settle for a pretty-boy conductor
now that we have had Masur's raw integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Two Paths,'' meanwhile, may well escape the typical fate of
new works, which tend to drop out of sight after their premieres.
For one thing, the Philharmonic plans to keep it alive, playing it
in June in Washington and next year in Carnegie Hall and on tour in
Europe. What's more, the work stands as a challenge to any
orchestra that thinks it has a pair of violists as good and well
balanced as these two. One can only wish that orchestra well.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Creating separate Balkan states is a surrender
 &HT;    (For release Sunday, April 25, 1999.)
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOMOGENEOUS: I've seen the word too much in recent months. It
means, in its strictest dictionary interpretation: ``1. the same in
structure, quality, etc.; similar or identical. 2. composed of
similar or identical elements or parts; uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   In practice, however, it is a political term that has as its
goal the separation of peoples who are not alike. It also could be
called apartheid or segregation, except in the way ``homogeneous''
is used today, it is not so much of a segregation within the
borders of a nation but redefining borders so as to segregate
people; people who do not get along, who hate each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethnic cleansing'' and ``homogeneous'' are cousins, perhaps
more closely related than that. What Slobodan Milosevic has been
trying to do within the political entity of Yugoslavia is to
homogenize Kosovo of people whose heritage and daily practices are
Albanian and not Serbian.
</P>
<P>
   This was the thinking of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis: It was
Germany (and Austria) for Aryans and no one else.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about the Balkans is about homogeny, and always has
been.
</P>
<P>
   It recently was proposed by two political scientists in an
article written for The New York Times that all the fighting would
go away if only that which was and is Yugoslavia was redefined and
space apportioned ethnically, with the Kosovars getting that part
of Kosovar which was ethnic Albanian while the northeast quadrant,
being ethnically Serbian, being another place _ a Serbian place.
They proposed other divisions of the land so as to isolate alike
peoples and ostracize those who are not.
</P>
<P>
   Keep the Croats, the Serbs, Kosovars and whomever else apart by
adhering to a homogeneous formula is what their solution appears to
be. It sounds to me more like surrendering to ethnic provincialism.
</P>
<P>
   It might appear inviting until you recognize the precedent it is
setting. While the world at one time must have been ethnically
divided by natural means, it is not now.
</P>
<P>
   We are mixed together, for better or for worse. Even the Asiatic
nations of China, Japan and South Korea, once bastions of
homogeneous existence, have lowered their ethnic barriers in the
face of the modernization of their previously ancient
civilizations; foreigners now fit in, however precariously.
</P>
<P>
   When the Soviet Union broke into essentially separate ethnic
states, the hatred that was within them all those years under
communism emerged.
</P>
<P>
   There is something in the human spirit that says we want to be
with alike peoples, but the world cannot work that way anymore.
</P>
<P>
   A capitulation to ethnically driven borders within the Balkan
states would be a message to the world that agrees with the same
kind of horror that is manifest in Africa, in Northern Ireland, in
the Middle East and even in less precipitous situations such as
prevails between Scotland and England, between Quebec and the
remainder of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Divide up Yugoslavia with harsh ethnically drawn lines and the
precedence will have been established in these most modern of times
for a retreat to medieval days, when walls were constructed to
separate people and cities. Our history books show us that did not
create a peace at all. Someone always seemed to want the other
group's place as well.
</P>
<P>
   We, as a civilization, are faced with the arduous task of
demanding of people that they learn to live together and as equals.
No longer can we return to apartheid, or to segregation. And
recreating homogeneous nations devoid of other people will do
little to ease the world's tensions.
</P>
<P>
   It will just put us back into an ancient city-state mentality.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: ENTERING AN ERA OF CHEAP DIGITAL EATS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, April 25.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO -- You can sense that a seismic shift is uprooting the
computing world when fully loaded machines are being sold on the
World Wide Web for $599. Each of these units is more powerful than
the $80 million behemoth that ran the North American Air Defense
Command a few decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Those $599 computers ship with Windows 98. But Seattle-based
Microworkz Computer could perhaps knock another $50 or so off its
price if its customers chose to load Linux, which is in the public
domain.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the spring Comdex trade show in Chicago snapped up
tens of thousands of free CDs that were imprinted with a new
release of the Linux operating system. This version can be dressed
up to have the look and feel of Microsoft Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, an IBM subsidiary is shipping Star Office, a full
suite of applications, including a neat integrated Internet
browser. Star Office holds its own against Microsoft Office, which
sells for hundreds of dollars. A single-copy Linux version of Star
Office is available for free for non-commercial use.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Microsoft just reported record fiscal third-quarter
earnings, and its short-term prospects look bright. After all, even
a bare-bones $299 computer, the Webzter Jr., another Microworkz
Computer offering, requires a suite of applications to do serious
work. And, for most folks, Microsoft remains still best suited to
fill their needs.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, a $599 package based on Linux and Star Office would
appeal mainly to the kind of savvy insiders that frequent Comdex.
But how long before Microworkz Computer or another bargain-priced
supplier starts to sell machines with Linux-based Windows-like
systems? (Dell Computer, which is to Microworkz Computer as
Microsoft is to Linux, has began to ship powerful units installed
with Linux, which has 15 million users.)
</P>
<P>
   Some computer gurus who came to Comdex see computer usage
reaching saturation levels in the workplace early in the new
millennium. But, they say, hard-core home non-users will remain
unplugged forever.
</P>
<P>
   This anti-rodent minority will never know what it's like to roll
a computer mouse through the Internet, even if computers come to be
available for free. (A few marketeers have begun to give them away,
seeking to recapture their costs through pricey Internet sign-ups.)
</P>
<P>
   But you don't need a computer to compute. Bright programmers at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have written a
conversational interface for online weather information. For
example, a user can call up and ask, ``What's the forecast for
today in Dayton?'' or ``Will it rain tomorrow in London?'' (During
the MIT test period, you can try it by a toll-free call to
1-888-573-8255.) (CQ)
</P>
<P>
   Many of MIT's networking computers run on Linux. That makes
Linus Torvalds, Linux's 29-year-old creator, quite happy at a time
that Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates is giving the university $20
million to build a new computer lab, to be named after Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Torvalds came to Comdex to taunt Goliath by predicting his
fledgling operating system will crush Microsoft. Some people who
heard Torvalds speak thought he was joking. But Gates, who was at
Comdex while the taunt was hurled, did not. Even on a digital
battlefield, paranoids can have real enemies.

 &HT;    Plumbing and mowers are my downfall
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ Some days it doesn't pay to get out of bed.
At least it would be cheaper if I just stayed buried under the
covers. A recent Saturday was such a day.
</P>
<P>
   First the riding lawn mower died in the midst of mowing. Just
died, with no warning. I stopped to get a glass of water, came back
out and it wouldn't turn over. I figured out that it likely was a
malfunctioning safety switch under the seat.
</P>
<P>
   Lawn mowers are as regulated as automobiles these days. They
have safety switches so that the mower dies if you get off it,
presumably to keep you from doing something dumb like sticking your
hand under the deck while it's running. That's all well and good,
but the switches inevitably are made of plastic. I call this the
Lawn Mower Service Association Profit Assurance Switch. It is bound
to break, sooner or later, and you have little choice but to call a
repair person or take it somewhere _ at least if you have my
limited mechanical ability.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible to hot wire around these switches, but it takes
someone who knows more about electricity to do that, so I left well
enough alone and finished mowing by hand with the push mower. It
too has a safety feature _ a bar that must be pulled toward you to
start and run the mower. The bar has a spring so if you let loose,
the mower dies.
</P>
<P>
   I have gotten around this safety feature with duct tape because
my hands get tired of holding the bar. Duct tape, not a dog, is
man's best friend. I wrap a few revolutions around the real handle
and leave a few extra inches. When I get ready to start the mower,
I pull the safety handle back and wrap the tape around it. It's
easy to unwrap and kill the engine, and generally my duct tape
anti-safety device lasts about three months before the sticky stuff
wears out.
</P>
<P>
   When I bought this mower a few months back, I ended up calling
the folks who sold it to me. It had no throttle switch. Looked like
it had a place for one, and I figured they just forgot to put it
on. I called the store, a bit peeved. The mower would run, but it
wasn't at a high enough rpm to suit me.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out new push mowers don't have throttles anymore. The EPA,
worried about air emissions, has banned them, and mowers just have
a set speed. You can adjust the carburetor to rev it up, but that
requires fiddling with screws, which makes me nervous, given my
past history with mechanical devices.
</P>
<P>
   I was cutting some high, wet grass, and the mower died
constantly. Eventually I hit a spot of mud and the blade dug into
the ground and bent. I had to buy a new blade and install it. Time
I was finished, a two-hour mowing chore had stretched out nearly
all day.
</P>
<P>
   I took a shower and remembered the faucet in the kitchen was
leaking. It's been leaking for about a month, not from the spout
but from the base. For reasons that still escape me, I decided to
see if I could tighten this down and save a plumber's bill.
</P>
<P>
   Long-time readers know that I am the Darth Vader of plumbing. I
have a long history of plumbing disasters. Now it's a tad longer. I
took the spout off and started fiddling with some screws, hoping to
tighten it down.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing I know, a geyser of water is bouncing off the
ceiling. Luckily, there was a cutoff under the sink, so the water
only ran about 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   An exploding faucet puts out a lot of water in 20 seconds.
Luckily, nobody was home. I calculated I had about 15 minutes to
clean up the mess without anybody being the wiser. It took about a
dozen towels. I cleaned knick-knacks, emptied glasses on the shelf
half-filled with water, sopped water off the kitchen floors and the
cabinets, wiped water off the wooden blind on the window behind the
sink. I got it all cleaned up with about three minutes to spare.
</P>
<P>
   I probably could have gotten away with it except that the faucet
really didn't work now, and I had a dozen wet towels. I told my
wife I had decided to clean the cabinets, but she didn't buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tried to fix the faucet yourself, didn't you,?'' she said
with a semi-accusing stare. I 'fessed up.
</P>
<P>
   We had no water in the kitchen for two days, this being on a
Saturday. I paid penance by buying a lot of meals out for those two
days. The faucet is fixed now, and the service person came out and
fixed the lawn mower. Sure enough, it was the safety switch.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, I borrowed a chain saw to cut down a small dead
tree. Rather than witness another potential disaster, my wife left
and went shopping. Some things are just too painful to watch.

 &HT;    Answering an age-old question
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Adulthood is a funny thing. It's not like you
roll out of bed one day and announce, ``Today I am an adult.'' It
creeps up on you and before you know it, you're saying things like,
``Back in my day, we didn't have MTV and personal computers and
VCRs, and we liked it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Becoming an adult doesn't necessarily happen when you graduate
from school, or when you start a job, or start a family. And it
sure doesn't have anything to do with age. Some people become
adults when they're 16, some (like 73-year-old Hugh Hefner) never
get there.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who wonder, here's a list sent to be by a friend
of ways to know if you may be an adult:
</P>
<P>
   You start drinking V8.
</P>
<P>
   You make ``oof'' sounds when you sit down.
</P>
<P>
   Going out at night starts feeling like something you ``should''
do.
</P>
<P>
   You don't know who those new bands are, and you don't
particularly care.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a full night's sleep makes you so much more productive.
</P>
<P>
   Your potted plants stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   Sleeping in a twin-sized bed seems absurd.
</P>
<P>
   You keep more food than beer in the 'fridge.
</P>
<P>
   You have to pay your own credit card bill.
</P>
<P>
   Mac &AMP; Cheese no longer counts as a well-balanced meal.
</P>
<P>
   8 a.m. is not early.
</P>
<P>
   You hear your favorite song on an elevator.
</P>
<P>
   You're not carded anymore.
</P>
<P>
   You carry an umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   You learn that ``bachelor'' is a nicer term for a jerk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-something'' means overqualified, underpaid and not
married.
</P>
<P>
   You start watching the Weather Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Jeans and baseball caps aren't staples in your wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   You can no longer drink shots, and smoking gives you a sinus
attack.
</P>
<P>
   You go from 130 days of vacation time to seven.
</P>
<P>
   You go to parties that the police don't raid.
</P>
<P>
   You don't know what time the fast food chains close anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Your car insurance goes down.
</P>
<P>
   You refer to college students as kids.
</P>
<P>
   You feed your dog Science Diet instead of Taco Bell.
</P>
<P>
   One not mentioned, but certainly an indicator is: You find your
favorite recording artist in the easy listening section of the
music store.

 &HT;    Buchanan glides easily through revolving door
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ This is a nutty business. Civilians shake their
heads whenever one of us is driven to hand-wringing angst over an
invitation to lunch.
</P>
<P>
   People in this business are likely to cluck their tongues loudly
if they see one of their number socializing with ``them'' _ a
politician or (gasp!) a lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   We adhere to a constantly evolving code of ethics that is
rigidly elastic depending on your status, standing and profile in
the business.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, if you will, that professional blowhard Pat Buchanan,
who was in Texas last week campaigning yet again for president.
</P>
<P>
   While some kid reporter working for a small-town daily or a
mid-market television station might get yelled at for accepting a
39-cent ballpoint pen or taking a part-time job that might
constitute ``a conflict of interest,'' Buchanan is a television
commentator one day and presidential candidate the next. No
conflict of interest there, boss.
</P>
<P>
   All this against a backdrop of endless industry seminars on
ethics with the obligatory colon in the middle (as in Ethics:
Keystone of Journalistic Credibility).
</P>
<P>
   Some may argue that Buchanan and his brethren are not
``journalists.'' My definition of journalist, however, is pretty
simple: one who presents or comments on the news.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, I don't think that viewers, readers or listeners
pay attention to the artificial distinctions the way we do.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is certainly not the first politician/journalist to use
the revolving door. Jack Kennedy tried his hand at reporting before
launching his political career. Then, there's George
Stephanopoulos, the White House aide turned Newsweek columnist and
television personality. There are many others who wandered through
the revolving door between politics and journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, we have a couple of former reporters, Daryl Slusher,
the council member, and Karen Sonleitner, the county commissioner,
holding elected office.
</P>
<P>
   So Buchanan isn't the only one to go through the revolving door,
he just makes it spin louder and faster than most.
</P>
<P>
   What really cracks me up is that very few people in the business
even want to discuss the glaring double standard: There's one set
of rules for the stars and another for working stiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Once Buchanan loses his quest for the Republican presidential
nomination, he will undoubtedly be welcomed back to the commentator
fold where he will have another four years to chop on potential
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   No conflict of interest there, boss.
</P>
<P>
   Ethics, schmethics. People apparently love to watch people
yelling and Buchanan is good at that, so he gets hired. And the
rest of us get to grin and bear it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, readers and viewers are becoming increasingly cynical
about ``the news product'' and people who deliver it. In turn, we
hold seminars to try to figure out why. Somebody at one of those
seminars may even remember to turn the volume down on the show
featuring a bunch of former speech writers and political operatives
yelling at each other during our interminable soul searches.
</P>
<P>
   What a racket. All this brings to mind the line delivered by Lee
Strasberg in ``Godfather II'': ``I didn't ask any questions ...
this is the business we've chosen ...'' It's like no business I
know.

 &HT;    Voinovich view has been tried
 &HT;    WITH an editorial offering opposing views by Ohio Sen. George
Voinovich slugged KOSOVO-VOINOVICH.
 &HT;    By Martin Gottlieb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Sometimes it seems as though what a person thinks
about the bombing of Yugoslavia depends upon where that person came
in.
</P>
<P>
   For many people who have been following events in the Balkans
through this decade, the bombing seems a natural progression, a
necessity brought by process of elimination. Here, after all, we
had this war-mongering, war criminal of a dictator whose
society-destroying instincts and intentions were beyond dispute.
Negotiations and economic sanctions had been tried ad nauseam, and
land troops were politically out of the question. That leaves a
bombing assault.
</P>
<P>
   Some people now paint that assault as the work of a hapless and
directionless Clinton administration. That's absurdly wrong.
Foreign-policy experts in droves have been looking toward military
action against Slobodan
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic for a long time. And NATO is not exactly an arm of
President Clinton. Across Europe a near consensus had developed
that the time for bombing had come.
</P>
<P>
   When Washington and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization first
considered making the threat to bomb Yugoslavia if Milosevic didn't
come to terms over Kosovo, few voices were raised in opposition.
That was the time for the people in Congress and the media who are
now second-guessing to speak up; that was the point of no return.
</P>
<P>
   What about people who have not been focused on the Balkans
through this decade _ who have not gone through the phases of
dealing with Milosevic? Some are understandably mystified and
skeptical. One caller to a talk show said he gets worried any time
Washington and the media start ``demonizing'' somebody (Milosevic).
</P>
<P>
   There is a third group: People who were focused on the Balkans
even before the 1990s. Ohio Sen. George Voinovich is one of those.
His Serbo-Slovenian ethnicity _ similar to that of many people
around Cleveland _ is the reason.
</P>
<P>
   He argues that Washington underestimates the power of Serb
nationalism, which he says the NATO bombing has now unleashed, to
the detriment of any hopes for surrender by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich's voice comes off as an antidote _ an instruction _ to
the prevailing notions of the NATO policymakers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, however, people like Voinovich dominated the foreign
policy of the West through the early 1990s, when the various Balkan
wars broke out. They said the Balkans are a cauldron, not of good
guys and bad guys, but of competing nationalisms, of ancient feuds
waiting to burst into flames at the strike of a match. They said
the West's approach should be neutrality. As evidence of Serb
atrocities in Bosnia mounted, the United Nations remained
even-handed, partly because it did not want to fan the flames of
Serb nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Only slowly and reluctantly _ as war raged on and on and reports
of atrocities became common _ did the West come to side with the
Muslims against their better-armed foes; eventually NATO bombed
Serb sites.
</P>
<P>
   The successful Dayton peace talks followed shortly thereafter.
Then the old detachment _ the old fears of awakening Serb
nationalism _ became unfashionable. After all, acting against the
Serb side had worked.
</P>
<P>
   Now NATO has gone back to that well. And, for all anybody knows,
this may be once too often.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, however, with Voinovich's general antipathy to
NATO's posture is that it leaves the West with nothing to do about
Milosevic as he planned the expected ``ethnic cleansing'' of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich's response to that charge would be that, although
negotiations were tried, they were tried badly. He says NATO
shouldn't have given Milosevic the ultimatum to accept autonomy for
Kosovo (enforced by NATO
</P>
<P>
   troops) or face bombing. In fact, however, that ultimatum was a
last-ditch effort to save the whole idea of negotiations; nothing
else had worked. And Milosevic had not rejected the idea of
autonomy, only the enforcement mechanism (NATO troops). So the NATO
position can't be called extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Given Voinovich's emphasis upon the importance of Kosovo to
Serbia, it should be explicitly noted that NATO was not asking
Milosevic to give up Kosovo. NATO never even wanted independence
for Kosovo. It wanted the kind of autonomy within Yugoslavia that
Kosovo had had for years before Milosevic removed it in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   If NATO hadn't insisted upon that, it's hard to see what its
position could have been, short of reversion to its former
passivity.
</P>
<P>
   How many times must that approach be discredited?

Daily News.

 &HT;    Invasion would bring long costly war
 &HT;    WITH an editorial offering opposing views slugged
KOSOVO-OP-VOINOVICH.
 &HT;    By Sen. George Voinovich
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Editor's note: These remarks are excerpted from a speech Sen.
George Voinovich (R-Ohio) made April 13 on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Mr. President, I rise today to vehemently oppose
sending American ground forces into Kosovo and to demand that if
the president contemplates sending in ground troops, that decision
be deliberated and authorized by the Congress of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   I am an American of Serbian-Slovenian ancestry. My father's
family is from southern Croatia, which is known as Krijna, and my
mother's family is from Ljubljana and Stranje in Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
   I want to make it clear _ I don't oppose sending ground troops
into Kosovo because I am Serbian. I oppose it because it is bad
policy. However, my ethnic heritage does give me a special insight
into the situation that someone else might not have.
</P>
<P>
   I have always opposed the leadership of Slobodan Milosevic. Like
most Americans, I consider him a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   However, Mr. President, I was one of 41 senators who voted
against the bombing because I was concerned that this bombing would
not achieve our end of bringing Milosevic to the negotiating table,
as contemplated by the
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration and NATO.
</P>
<P>
   I also feared that the bombing would only solidify Milosevic's
leadership with the Serbian people and ruin any chance of
cultivating alternative leadership within Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   I have to say that our problem has not been with the Serbian
people but with their ruthless leader.
</P>
<P>
   The main thing this bombing campaign has managed to do is fan
the flames of centuries-old Serbian nationalism. Individuals who,
until the bombing campaign, had little support for Milosevic and
his activities in Kosovo, now firmly believe their national pride
is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   It is extremely important to remember that Kosovo is to the
Serbian people what Jerusalem is to Jews, Christians and Muslims.
To the Serbians, it is a holy place. It is the scene of the most
important event in Serbian history _ the battle of Kosovo in 1389
between the Turks and the Serbs, led by Tsar Lazar.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Serbian children sing songs and read epic poems
celebrating this event.
</P>
<P>
   The interesting thing about the battle of Kosovo is how
outnumbered the Serbian people were _ and they knew it. To quote
from the epic poem The Battle of Kosovo:
</P>
<P>
   Then the Turks overwhelmed Lazar,
</P>
<P>
   And the Tsar, Lazar, was destroyed,
</P>
<P>
   With him was destroyed his army of seven and seventy thousand
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   All was holy, all was honorable and the goodness of God was
fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   It is significant that Milosevic started his rise to political
power in Kosovo, and probably the most important event in his
political career was when he spoke to 1 million citizens on the
600th anniversary of the Battle
</P>
<P>
   of Kosovo at the very site of the battle. I want you to also
know, Mr. President, that the most sacred Serbian Orthodox
monasteries are located in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   American and NATO leaders should have known Milosevic couldn't
give in without losing face. Especially when he was told, ``Either
sign this or we'll bomb you.'' Our bombing campaign has given
Milosevic cover to move forward expeditiously with his policy of
ethnic cleansing _ precisely what we were trying to avoid in the
first place! Now, because he and his forces are not being tightly
monitored _ and that's because all the observers were kicked out as
soon as the bombing started _ they can do as they wish.
</P>
<P>
   To me there is no question that the decision to bomb Kosovo and
Serbia was a terrible mistake in the first place, but now we face
three bad choices: Stop the bombing, continue the bombing or go in
with bombing and ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   I believe the least objectionable is to continue the bombing
campaign in hopes of securing the very negotiated settlement that
has eluded us so far. I support the goal of restoring peace and
stability to the region, returning
</P>
<P>
   to Kosovo those refugees that want to go back, negotiating a new
agreement that will guarantee their safety and self-determination
and establishing a multinational force to monitor the negotiated
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   I oppose using American troops not because I don't think they
can get the job done. Far from it. I believe our armed forces have
performed magnificently, and I wholeheartedly admire the effort
each of them has been
</P>
<P>
   giving during the campaign in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   However, I see a situation developing in the Balkans that could
be just as brutal as that which developed in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller and less well-armed force could have the ability to
use (the mountainous Balkan) terrain to impede the progress and
mobility of a NATO invasion force for an extended period of time
while racking up vast numbers of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that in World War II, more than 500,000 Nazi soldiers
thought they could just roll through Yugoslavia. They did not, due
in large part to the determination of the Serbian people.
</P>
<P>
   It has been reported that it will take six to eight weeks to
even prepare for a ground invasion. I believe it will probably take
even more than that because we don't even have the troops in the
region, we haven't even mobilized and we haven't established a
staging area.
</P>
<P>
   This will give the Serbs ample time to disperse, fortify
defensive works, stockpile their arms and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing I think the American people should
know: If we put ground forces in Kosovo, we will go to war with
Serbia. Period.
</P>
<P>
   We will have to take out Milosevic. That means a long, extended
war with loss of life and a total destruction of the infrastructure
in Serbia, Kosovo and what about Montenegro?
</P>
<P>
   And another thing: We have to be seriously concerned about
igniting the entire southeastern European region with our actions.
</P>
<P>
   And what happens after we win that war? And it will be won,
although at a high cost in terms of lives and infrastructure. What
will happen? What will be the disposition of the Kosovar Albanians,
hundreds of thousands of whom are now refugees? Are we going to
have a greater Albania?
</P>
<P>
   Let me just say that while I disagreed with the policy pursued
to stop the humanitarian abuses in Kosovo, those abuses cannot be
overlooked by the international community. You just can't turn your
head and forget about it. Our status as a world power gives us a
moral responsibility to defend human rights. I call upon my
colleagues and all Americans to work toward a consensus on how we
as a nation respond to acts of genocide internationally.
</P>
<P>
   We would be well-served to have a coherent policy to guide us in
the future as to when we go in and when we do not go in.

 &HT;    Left to ponder how such terrible things can happen in a place as
idyllic as this
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Immersed in the anguished looks, the bloodied children, the
armored police chop-stepping into position, we were at another
horror scene Tuesday. We are on-call emergency gawkers, never to
miss. And the satellite always delivers.
</P>
<P>
   Our children went to bed so immersed. We owe them a walk in the
park, and a dose of reality. No, not ``RealTV.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the odd things about such on-screen terror is the
striking realization, upon wrenching one's self away from the
screen, that the world is more peaceful than one's converter box
will relay. People coexist. They say ``excuse me'' and ``after
you.'' Except maybe in their automobiles, most are decent and
deferential. They play by the rules.
</P>
<P>
   That goes for Columbine High School, scene of the most gruesome
school incident ever. It is beautiful, inside and out. Its students
have all the attributes we value, the vitality, the camaraderie.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Columbine seems idyllic by any standards, a getaway
school in a getaway district at the feet of Colorado's Front Range.
The dateline ``Littleton'' is a subtle misnomer. This is Greater
Denver, with suburban neighborhoods defined as much by outstanding
schools as any other thing.
</P>
<P>
   A place like Columbine, a place like Littleton, is where parents
of means can take their children so as not to be in among all the
problems associated with the city.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado Gov. Bill Owens, asked on TV Tuesday night if the
school had metal detectors at the doors, wasn't sure but assumed
not, and safely so. After all, he said, it's ``not an urban
school.'' It's away from all that urban danger, just like the kids
in rural Paducah, Ky., and Jonesboro, Ark., and those at
Springfield, Ore., or any place now labeled, ``Couldn't Happen
Here.''
</P>
<P>
   Guns in their hands
</P>
<P>
   Metal detectors would have saved no lives at Columbine High. The
gunmen _ gunboys _ decided it was a good day to die and to take
classmates with them.
</P>
<P>
   A Colorado National Rifle Association official asked for equal
time amid all the concerns about the armaments of these
executioners. The equal-time response: Guns aren't the problem.
Sure they aren't. Teens on boil are the problem. But teens on boil
with ready access to firearms are a problem that will send shock
waves around the world.
</P>
<P>
   From petty to calamitous
</P>
<P>
   What we must acknowledge about what happened at Columbine,
however, was the excruciating universality of it. Disenfranchised
teens, outcasts, the brunts of jokes, hating those who are exalted
as special.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in the boys' racism and the search for a shocking cultural
hook _ Hitler in this case, Teutonic techno-rock. Outcasts of every
era have found ways to distance themselves even further from the
pack. These boys found a doozy.
</P>
<P>
   What a fever the teen years can be _ the focus on what happens
any day as the end of the world, the amplification of a petty
dispute into life-or-death fodder. It's common enough to see young
people take their own lives without fully explaining. In this case
we see two who did it and invited company.
</P>
<P>
   They were the bad guys, and they killed good guys. But one
wishes that in their frantic quest to be different, to offend, they
wouldn't have been given any more fuel for their explosion, that no
one had made fun of them and accentuated their differences.
</P>
<P>
   We hurt each other in so many ways. Even good people do. We
cause divisions. Indeed, we crave them. Generally, away from the
TV, these divisions never cause physical harm, only drift. But on
every street corner, in every classroom, the conditions are there.
One day at another crime scene we'll be left gawking.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: ENTERING AN ERA OF CHEAP DIGITAL EATS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, April 25.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO -- You can sense that a seismic shift is uprooting the
computing world when fully loaded machines are being sold on the
World Wide Web for $599. Each of these units is more powerful than
the $80 million behemoth that ran the North American Air Defense
Command a few decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Those $599 computers ship with Windows 98. But Seattle-based
Microworkz Computer could perhaps knock another $50 or so off its
price if its customers chose to load Linux, which is in the public
domain.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the spring Comdex trade show in Chicago snapped up
tens of thousands of free CDs that were imprinted with a new
release of the Linux operating system. This version can be dressed
up to have the look and feel of Microsoft Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, an IBM subsidiary is shipping Star Office, a full
suite of applications, including a neat integrated Internet
browser. Star Office holds its own against Microsoft Office, which
sells for hundreds of dollars. A single-copy Linux version of Star
Office is available for free for non-commercial use.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Microsoft just reported record fiscal third-quarter
earnings, and its short-term prospects look bright. After all, even
a bare-bones $299 computer, the Webzter Jr., another Microworkz
Computer offering, requires a suite of applications to do serious
work. And, for most folks, Microsoft remains still best suited to
fill their needs.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, a $599 package based on Linux and Star Office would
appeal mainly to the kind of savvy insiders that frequent Comdex.
But how long before Microworkz Computer or another bargain-priced
supplier starts to sell machines with Linux-based Windows-like
systems? (Dell Computer, which is to Microworkz Computer as
Microsoft is to Linux, has began to ship powerful units installed
with Linux, which has 15 million users.)
</P>
<P>
   Some computer gurus who came to Comdex see computer usage
reaching saturation levels in the workplace early in the new
millennium. But, they say, hard-core home non-users will remain
unplugged forever.
</P>
<P>
   This anti-rodent minority will never know what it's like to roll
a computer mouse through the Internet, even if computers come to be
available for free. (A few marketeers have begun to give them away,
seeking to recapture their costs through pricey Internet sign-ups.)
</P>
<P>
   But you don't need a computer to compute. Bright programmers at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have written a
conversational interface for online weather information. For
example, a user can call up and ask, ``What's the forecast for
today in Dayton?'' or ``Will it rain tomorrow in London?'' (During
the MIT test period, you can try it by a toll-free call to
1-888-573-8255.) (CQ)
</P>
<P>
   Many of MIT's networking computers run on Linux. That makes
Linus Torvalds, Linux's 29-year-old creator, quite happy at a time
that Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates is giving the university $20
million to build a new computer lab, to be named after Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Torvalds came to Comdex to taunt Goliath by predicting his
fledgling operating system will crush Microsoft. Some people who
heard Torvalds speak thought he was joking. But Gates, who was at
Comdex while the taunt was hurled, did not. Even on a digital
battlefield, paranoids can have real enemies.

 &HT;    School voucher bill likely to fade
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Rep. Barry Telford (D-DeKalb) says using money
from public schools for vouchers to private schools ``hurts them
both.'' The private schools have to submit to state controls and
testing, and the public schools lose badly needed cash.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, Telford told an anti-voucher rally in front of the
Capitol last week that he strongly opposes them.
</P>
<P>
   Telford's comments have added weight because he is chairman of
the House Calendars Committee, which sets bills for House floor
debate.
</P>
<P>
   There is a saying in lawmaking circles about ``an idea whose
time has come.'' But in Texas, school vouchers may be an idea whose
time never quite came, and now may be receding.
</P>
<P>
   Voucher proponents, led by the likes of San Antonio
multimillionaire James Leininger, have tried to change the minds of
legislators _ or beat those who oppose vouchers. Leininger and Co.
pumped millions of dollars into state representative and other
races _ including an attempt to beat House Speaker Pete Laney and
legislators who support him for speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Laney won anyway. He hasn't forgotten that voucher supporters
provided much of the opposition to his re-election. This year, the
usually noncommittal Laney has been outspoken against vouchers,
including a recent speech before the Texas Daily Newspaper
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The money that Leininger and others laid down included a
guarantee on a $1.1 million bank loan to Republican Lt. Gov. Rick
Perry in the final days of the campaign to help cement his victory.
Perry repaid the loan before taking office.
</P>
<P>
   Perry recently has made it clear to some members of the Senate,
over which he presides, that he has a strong interest in seeing a
voucher bill reaching the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to teachers and public-school administrators,
voucher opponents include some private schools, which don't want
the state controls and testing proposed to go with them.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Sen. David Bernsen (D-Beaumont) said he's against
vouchers despite legislation that would limit eligibility to
low-performing students in low-performing schools in major urban
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's explained to me how you take money from public
education and make it better,'' Bernsen said.
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, the voucher project's Senate sponsor, Education
Committee Chairman Sen. Teel Bivins (R-Amarillo) acknowledged he
still was short of the two-thirds vote of the Senate necessary to
bring up the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 15 Democrats in the 31-member Senate, voucher opponents
have claimed 12 firm votes against bringing the measure up _ though
Sen. Mike Moncrief (D-Fort Worth) backed off the list late last
week. Even so, 11 senators can block the two-thirds present and
voting that's necessary to get a matter to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The lieutenant governor could wait until one or more of those
votes are absent and bring the bill up then. And one voucher
opponent, Sen. Greg Luna (D-San Antonio), has missed several Senate
sessions because of health problems. But even then, at least one
Republican senator, John Carona of Dallas, is openly against
vouchers
</P>
<P>
   Perry said vouchers will come up _ one way or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll have a debate on it in the Senate _ and a
vote,'' Perry said. If he can't bring up the Senate bill, the
debate will happen ``in some more unique fashion,'' Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   That means by approving an amendment to another bill from the
House _ which would require only a Senate majority, rather than
two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   House voucher proponent Rep. Ron Wilson (D-Houston) tried to
amend a bill two years ago to add vouchers. It narrowly failed. Is
he looking for another bill to amend this year?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir,'' Wilson responded, smiling. ``Going to find one,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators don't want a vote because however they vote is
bound to anger some of their constituents. And an anti-voucher vote
puts a target on their backs for Leininger and friends to spend
money against their re-election.
</P>
<P>
   But Louis Bacarisse, a lobbyist who added the anti-voucher
effort to his client list this year, says he'd welcome a vote, in
both the House and Senate, because he thinks vouchers would be
voted down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Bacarisse said. ``The sooner the better. I've
got other stuff to do.''

   YELLING-EXCERPTS _ The ability of children to manage anger and
handle conflict is a topic of conversation in the wake of the
school shootings in Colorado. Cox News Service is excerpting a new
Longstreet Press book that addresses the conflict issue, ``Tired of
Yelling.'' Preschoolers learn reading readiness. Elementary
schoolchildren spend hours every week on math and English. Teens go
to soccer, Scouts, or piano lessons. Yet, in many cases, no one
teaches our kids one of the most valuable lessons of life _ how to
get along with other people. ``Tired of Yelling'' is the textbook
for that lesson. Dr. Lyndon D. Waugh offers the 15-step model he
developed during years of practical application that can give
parents, educators and children the ability to manage anger and
handle conflict. Dr. Waugh is co-founder and co-director of the
Atlanta Area Family Psychiatry Clinic, where he has had a
prestigious practice in child, adolescent, and family psychiatry
since 1977. The book is written with Letitia Sweitzer. Cox News
Service is excerpting this book in five parts, all of which are
moving today. (An image of the book jacket is available. The
excerpts also will be featured on the CoxNet weekly Science &AMP;
Health page for the next five weeks.)

Consumers League shows one easy way people can save money and help

of boxes). Waste reduction promises to hit home even harder, as
cities go to various pay-as-you-throw schemes, which charge
homeowners based on the amount of garbage they produce. (Atlanta

   TRAVEL-ICELAND _ REYKJAVIK, Iceland _ ``Why Iceland?'' people
said when they heard I was headed to this unlikely destination. So
I'll tell you. At two in the morning, as the Northern Lights
performed the world's most fantastic light show in the Icelandic
heavens, I forgot the lateness of the hour and the Arctic cold. The
night before, I had watched the world's most fantastically
beautiful people madly dancing with delicious abandon in one of
Reykjavik's hottest nightclubs. In three nights I got a total of 11
hours of sleep, and you know something? I didn't care, because it
was wonderful, glorious, entrancing, and I'd go back _ I will go
back _ to this island of savage, unearthly beauty with savagely
beautiful inhabitants who can at will shed their exquisite civility
for the bacchanal. Kim, w/Ivansco pix.(Kim, Atlanta

   TRAVEL-ICELAND-NIGHTCLUBS _ REYKJAVIK, Iceland _I hate to
interrupt couples while they're doing mouth to mouth and exchanging
some major saliva. But I really wanted to talk to this particular
Icelandic couple, and they hadn't come up for air in about five
minutes, so I figured they could use an oxygen break. ``What are
your names?'' I asked, and the girl looked at the guy and shrugged,
and said, ``What's your name?'' That was pretty much par for the
course on a Saturday night in Reykjavik. In truth, Reykjavik's
clubs vary little from those of Miami or New York _ or Atlanta. But
clubbing in Iceland does have a certain exotic aura. Maybe it's the
unusually steep proportion of beautiful people, maybe it's that
they dress and dance better than Americans. Or maybe it's that
these people are descended from Vikings, not Puritans. (Kim,

Northern Lights when seen from the globe's northern latitudes, and
it was the grand finale to a marvelous day of sightseeing in the
Icelandic countryside around Reykjavik. Iceland has an uncanny
ability to mesmerize. Called the land of fire and ice, Iceland
possesses awesome, almost surreal landscapes of soul-penetrating
desolation and stirring beauty. (Kim, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   YELLING-EXCERPTS _ The ability of children to manage anger and
handle conflict is a topic of conversation in the wake of the
school shootings in Colorado. Cox News Service is excerpting a new
Longstreet Press book that addresses the conflict issue, ``Tired of
Yelling.'' Preschoolers learn reading readiness. Elementary
schoolchildren spend hours every week on math and English. Teens go
to soccer, Scouts, or piano lessons. Yet, in many cases, no one
teaches our kids one of the most valuable lessons of life _ how to
get along with other people. ``Tired of Yelling'' is the textbook
for that lesson. Dr. Lyndon D. Waugh offers the 15-step model he
developed during years of practical application that can give
parents, educators and children the ability to manage anger and
handle conflict. Dr. Waugh is co-founder and co-director of the
Atlanta Area Family Psychiatry Clinic, where he has had a
prestigious practice in child, adolescent, and family psychiatry
since 1977. The book is written with Letitia Sweitzer. Cox News
Service is excerpting this book in five parts, all of which are
moving today. (An image of the book jacket is available. The
excerpts also will be featured on the CoxNet weekly Science &AMP;
Health page for the next five weeks.)

   EARTHDAY _ Study from Use Less Stuff/Michigan State/National

pasta, in the least massive containers (i.e. cereal in bags instead
of boxes). Waste reduction promises to hit home even harder, as
cities go to various pay-as-you-throw schemes, which charge
homeowners based on the amount of garbage they produce. (Atlanta

   TRAVEL-ICELAND _ REYKJAVIK, Iceland _ ``Why Iceland?'' people
said when they heard I was headed to this unlikely destination. So
I'll tell you. At two in the morning, as the Northern Lights
performed the world's most fantastic light show in the Icelandic
heavens, I forgot the lateness of the hour and the Arctic cold. The
night before, I had watched the world's most fantastically
beautiful people madly dancing with delicious abandon in one of
Reykjavik's hottest nightclubs. In three nights I got a total of 11
hours of sleep, and you know something? I didn't care, because it
was wonderful, glorious, entrancing, and I'd go back _ I will go
back _ to this island of savage, unearthly beauty with savagely
beautiful inhabitants who can at will shed their exquisite civility
for the bacchanal. Kim, w/Ivansco pix.(Kim, Atlanta

   TRAVEL-ICELAND-NIGHTCLUBS _ REYKJAVIK, Iceland _I hate to
interrupt couples while they're doing mouth to mouth and exchanging
some major saliva. But I really wanted to talk to this particular
Icelandic couple, and they hadn't come up for air in about five
minutes, so I figured they could use an oxygen break. ``What are
your names?'' I asked, and the girl looked at the guy and shrugged,
and said, ``What's your name?'' That was pretty much par for the
course on a Saturday night in Reykjavik. In truth, Reykjavik's
clubs vary little from those of Miami or New York _ or Atlanta. But
clubbing in Iceland does have a certain exotic aura. Maybe it's the
unusually steep proportion of beautiful people, maybe it's that
they dress and dance better than Americans. Or maybe it's that
these people are descended from Vikings, not Puritans. (Kim,

   TRAVEL-ICELAND-TOPOGRAPHY _ Twenty minutes, we had been told,
but in less than ten my eyes had adjusted sufficiently to the
darkness to register wisps of green luminescence gently wafting
across the night sky. It was the aurora borealis, known as the
Northern Lights when seen from the globe's northern latitudes, and
it was the grand finale to a marvelous day of sightseeing in the
Icelandic countryside around Reykjavik. Iceland has an uncanny
ability to mesmerize. Called the land of fire and ice, Iceland
possesses awesome, almost surreal landscapes of soul-penetrating
desolation and stirring beauty. (Kim, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

the ``Spring Break in Reykjavik,'' which cost about $500 per
person, and provided just enough time for us to develop a taste for
Reykjavik and the lovely surrounding countryside. (Kim, Atlanta

   COXNET BOOKS 0422: LITERAY TITANS _ Ernest Hemingway and
Vladimir Nabokov could not have been more different. To mark the
100th anniversary of their births, there is a flurry of new and
re-issued books. Art includes one 3-column color illustration of
Hemingway and Nabokov.
</P>
<P>
   HEMINGWAY _ Ernest Hemingway once said he wanted no biography of
himself written while he was alive and preferably not for a hundred
years after he died. He was granted the first wish, but not the
second. (O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) Art includes
1-column color illustration of Hemingway.

<P>
   HEMINGWAY LIST _ A list of forthcoming books about Hemingway.

<P>
   NABOKOV -- On the centenary of his birth, Vladimir Nabokov has
never thrown off the criticism that his novels and stories were
those of a dilettante. (Skube, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) Art
includes 1-column color illustration of Nabokov.

   BOOKTAB-HEMINGWAY _ Larger than life when alive, Hemingway
became a giant when dead. On the 100th anniversary of his birth
this summer _ June 21 _ Hemingway fans can enjoy a feeding frenzy
on new books about the man whose goal in life was to write one true
sentence. (O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   BOOKTAB-ELLISON _ Writing a first novel that becomes a classic
can be a blessing and a curse. There's instant acclaim, but intense
pressure to write an even better second book. Margaret Mitchell and
Harper Lee didn't even attempt to top their spectacular debuts.
Ralph Ellison died trying. Forty-two years after ``Invisible Man''
was published, Ellison was still reshaping and rewriting his
sprawling manuscript when he died in 1994. Sidebar at bottom of
file. (O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

about smacks of the familiar. Where so many authors create worlds
that are instantly recognizable, Proulx goes where few others
would. (Vejnoska, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   BOOKTAB-NABOKOV _ On the centenary of his birth, Vladimir
Nabokov has never thrown off the criticism that his novels and
stories were those of a dilettante _ intricate, interesting in the
way chess puzzles are interesting. Critics expected an emigre from
the Soviet Union to write tracts about tyranny in the form of
fiction. Nabokov was utterly resistant. ``I write for the sake of
the pleasure, for the sake of the difficulty,'' he told an
interviewer. (Skube, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   BOOKS-SKUBE _ A first-time author on tour is anxious about
reviews, anxious about sales, anxious about making a good
impression. In Michael Isikoff's case, there was anxiety of another
kind as well. At Chapter 11, while he was signing copies of
``Uncovering Clinton,'' a display case promoting George
Stephanopoulos' ``All Too Human'' flanked him, and one could hardly
notice Isikoff's book without noticing the other. (Skube, Atlanta

   BOOKNOTES _ If Bridget Jones is the voice of the modern British

Fidelity'' and ``About a Boy'' have become best sellers and are
headed for the big screen. John Cusack is starring in ``High
Fidelity'' and Robert DeNiro has bought rights to ``About a Boy.''
We talk to Hornby on the eve of his Atlanta visit on Friday; Also,
``Cold Sassy Tree,'' the novel by the late Atlanta author Olive Ann
Burns, is scheduled to be done as an opera by Carlisle Floyd for
the Houston Grand Opera Co. (O'Briant, Atlanta

 &HT;    PORK BARREL POLITICS IN ISRAEL: SOVIET IMMIGRANTS PIVOTAL IN
ELECTIONS
 &HT;    700&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHKELON, Israel _ As a middle-aged deli worker who's skeptical
of politics, Tatiana Vilansky seems like an unlikely king maker.
</P>
<P>
   She lives in a land of Hebrew speakers, but talks politics in
her native Russian. On the job, she serves up pork salami in a
country where pork is shunned by religious customs and, in some
cases, official law.
</P>
<P>
   But the 45-year-old immigrant from Belarus is in demand because
she has not decided who she prefers in Israel's upcoming elections.
Political activists have called on her about five times, as hungry
for her vote as her customers are for her sliced ham.
</P>
<P>
   That is because, as their numbers swell, Vilansky and other
immigrants from the former Soviet Union might decide the future of
Israel's leadership. Most favor Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
but candidates see a large slice of the immigrant vote is still up
for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Now the candidates are shaping their messages to the immigrants'
tastes on everything from the peace process to the question of just
how Jewish Israel should be.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, for parliament and prime minister, is May 17. A June 1
runoff is likely in the prime minister's race. The so-called
Russian voters (they come from Russia and other former Soviet
republics) are key.
</P>
<P>
   ``By all means, the Russians are important for the elections,''
said Vilansky's boss, Riva Kalichman, 50, an immigrant from
Moldavia. ``There are many of us and we have power.''
</P>
<P>
   After just eight years of heavy immigration, people from the
former Soviet Union now number more than 1 million of Israel's 6
million population. They are still arriving at a rate of more than
4,000 a month and they make up more than 15 percent of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   They have already changed Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky, now Minister of Trade
and leader of a political party for immigrants, says that the
influx doubled the number of engineers, teachers and scientists in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Many delight in Russian treats like pork chops and vodka. They
read more than 15 local Russian newspapers and watch television
beamed directly from Russia. They have formed four of their own
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   They backed Yitzhak Rabin when he won in 1992 and Netanyahu when
he won in 1996. Polls show over 50 percent of them still favoring
Netanyahu, known by his nickname ``Bibi.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ashkelon and Ashdod, neighboring coastal cities with more
than 80,000 immigrants from the former Soviet Union, voters
announce their choice in Russian -- ``Dah (yes) Bibi'' -- and wear
ball caps with Russian letters stating, ``Vote for Benjamin
Netanyahu.'' Most like him for his reluctance to hand land over to
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But polls also show 20 percent of the immigrants undecided,
double the rate among other sectors of Israel. The more than
100,000 votes at stake is triple Netanyahu's victory in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last elections we knew how to vote, but this year we
are in a dilemma,'' said Marina Solodkin, one of six Soviet
immigrants in the Israeli parliament.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the immigrant community is changing. Of the more
than 820,000 arrived since 1990, more than 150,000 are new since
the last elections in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In general, both groups have had trouble finding jobs to match
their skills and have been disappointed with Israel's schools.
</P>
<P>
   They are also angry at government policies that require rigorous
documentation of their Judaism in order to qualify for legal
marriages and burials in Israel. They complain of discrimination by
police.
</P>
<P>
   But, their political desires are still enigmatic. Solodkin says
her party polls weekly to find out what its voters want.
</P>
<P>
   They seem to be savvy and open-minded, but still view Israel's
mainstream Labor Party, headed by candidate Ehud Barak, as
reminiscent of the detested socialists from their homelands. They
don't like Israel's religious hardliners, but support a Netanyahu
government that gives the ultra-Orthodox great influence.
</P>
<P>
   The common denominator seems to be land. Tiny Israel is barely
as large as the Moscow region alone and immigrants don't want it to
get smaller, as it likely will under the Oslo peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are real hawks. They are against the peace process,''
said Mina Tsemach, an Israeli pollster. ``For the first time in
their lives the have their own territory. It belongs to them and
they don't want to return it.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add begins.)
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky said the Russians will vote for their own immigrant
parties for parliament, hoping to address their domestic concerns.
Then, they will vote for security and the right-wing for prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   But, Sharansky's own party has stayed neutral on the prime
minister's race, refusing to endorse his boss, Netanyahu. He says
there is opportunity for Barak or Center Party candidate Yitzhak
Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to seize on that, Barak earlier this week hinted that
he would appoint a Soviet immigrant to run the country's interior
ministry, the ministry that carries out the controversial policies
on immigration and religious identification.
</P>
<P>
   In his comments, Barak noted that he recently shared Passover
dinner with a Jewish immigrant soldier from Russia whose mother was
expelled from the country apparently because she was not Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Netanyahu has courted Russian voters via their
homeland, Russia. Though he has long urged the United States to
sanction Russia on suspicion that it aids weapons programs in Iran
and Iraq, Netanyahu recently traveled to Moscow seeking to mend
fences.
</P>
<P>
   The about-face irked American officials, but not as much as
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon's comments questioning the wisdom of
the U.S.-led NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, a position apparently
aimed at Russians in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In a home for immigrant senior citizens in Ashdod, the move did
not impress Eliana Kurnina, a 66-year-old from Moscow. She called
Sharon's statements a ``pre-election trick,'' adding, ``He needs
the Russian voters.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said she will still vote for Netanyahu.

marine-based quest of biologist William Fenical may be critical to
the future of medicine. Since the 1980s, Fenical has been plunging
into the ocean to find what could be the richest sources for all
manner of drugs. Will the next wave of killer drugs come from the

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Outside the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla,
Calif., the sights, sounds and smells are all of a seaside
paradise. Inside, in biologist William Fenical's lab, it's good-bye
to the sea's charms and hello to the disgusting and fascinating
world of creatures scooped from that ocean outside, ground up and
thrown at every frightening disease Fenical can think of.
</P>
<P>
   This is the medicine chest of the next millennium _ agar-filled
dishes, flasks full of brown nutrient broth and beakers bubbling
like omelets in hell's kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   What's brewing in these potent pots? Stews of fungi and bacteria
that once lived in ocean sediments, rotting driftwood, weeds,
coral, sponges and grasses. Any one of these containers might
harbor a brand-new cancer drug or a compound to wipe out some of
the scariest viruses known to humankind.
</P>
<P>
   With the glory days of antibiotics over, Fenical's quest may be
critical to the future of medicine. Bacterium after bacterium is
gaining resistance to our arsenal. Doctors are desperate for
compounds to attack cancer, Alzheimer's, AIDS and a long list of
other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Since that momentous day in 1928 when Alexander Fleming
discovered penicillin, researchers have been looking in
increasingly exotic locations for the next strain of antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Fenical's answer is surprisingly simple: Search the sea. Since
the 1980s he has been plunging into the ocean to find the next wave
of medicines. Already he and his colleagues have dredged up some
promising candidates: chemicals that soothe swelling, a compound
from a yellow soft coral that disrupts cell division in cancer
cells and virus-killing proteins from ocean molds that live in sea
grasses.
</P>
<P>
   Fenical is not alone in this effort. Today the list of novel
potential anticancer drugs at the National Cancer Institute's
Natural Products Branch includes more candidates from the ocean
than from the land. Several promising drugs from the sea that might
be used to treat leukemia _ including one from a creature called
Bugula, which clings to the bottoms of boats _ are involved in
human trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ocean is by far the major habitat on the planet _ it's 70
percent of Earth's surface,'' Fenical explains. ``It's teeming with
unique organisms. More than half the organisms in the ocean don't
even occur on land.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news. The bad news is that it's difficult to
know just where to look. When it comes to marine life, the rich
history of ethnomedicine provides hardly any clues. Still, Fenical
and his colleagues have come up with strategies to narrow their
search.
</P>
<P>
   The first strategy is to go to a place where life is diverse and
concentrated, such as a reef in the Caribbean. An environment rich
in sea life is more likely to yield varied specimens.
</P>
<P>
   Fenical suspects that creatures loaded with biologically active
molecules _ the kind that they'd need to defend themselves
chemically _ could be the richest sources for all manner of drugs.
Take the strange case of a glorious feathery sea fan called
Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put a bit of tuna out on the reef, fish come from
everywhere, and it's gone,'' Fenical says. ``But if I grind up this
animal and mix in some extract with the tuna, the fish will come
up, take one bite and go `Yuck!' No way will they eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the sea fan's chemical arsenal is a family of molecules
called pseudopterosins which do more than make fish want to barf.
In people, they soothe swelling caused by sunburn or chemical
irritants. They do so by reining in a key enzyme involved in
inflammation, and they do it with more clout than does
hydrocortisone.
</P>
<P>
   Psoriasis, sunburn and arthritis all involve inflammation, and
one or more of the pseudopterosins might one day be the drug of
choice to treat these afflictions.
</P>
<P>
   Fenical reckons that a sea fan extract might also be great as an
additive to toothpaste or for soothing inflamed gums. The extract
is already being added to cosmetics like face creams. Of course,
the hope is to hit the jackpot with far stronger drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a potential cancer killer, the trick is to ferret
out drugs that kill a range of cancer cells but leave healthy cells
unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the compound must be purified, its molecular structure
determined and either a drug company or the National Cancer
Institute has to decide to fund testing on animals. Finally, the
drug must be tested on people.
</P>
<P>
   At any stage, testing may be dropped _ for reasons as simple as
the drug's being either too toxic or too weak.
</P>
<P>
   Although that outcome is common in the drug development
business, Fenical is excited about a substance he discovered
several years ago, called eleutherobin, in a remote shallow sea off
the coast of Australia. It comes from a mottled yellow
pickle-shaped soft coral.
</P>
<P>
   Eleutherobin stops malignant tumors from growing in much the
same way taxol does, by binding to a protein called tubulin and
disrupting cell division.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing nemesis of experimenting with sea drugs is supply
_ getting enough material to test, let alone produce, a drug. In
many cases, it's simply too hard to make a drug from scratch. The
chemistry is too complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Microbes can be grown in vats if researchers can figure out what
to feed them, but other substances can prove more daunting to
reproduce. When researchers became interested in halichondrin B, a
promising anticancer chemical from a sponge fondly known as
``yellow slimy,'' they had to collect a whole metric ton of sponges
to derive 300 milligrams of drug _ the amount needed to begin
preliminary trials.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, The National Cancer Institute put out a call to
marine biologists and word came back that the sponge thrives off
the coast of New Zealand. Now researchers are trying to farm the
sponge in Wellington Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent progress, no marine drug has reached the
pharmacy shelf. But Fenical is not discouraged. In fact, he is
passionate about the possibilities: ``If we need new drugs, where
are we going to go? Space? No.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses and waves his hand expansively out the window toward
the wide blue Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sitting right there. It's diverse as hell. And it's
waiting for us.''

<P>
   Fenical suspects that creatures loaded with biologically active
molecules _ the kind that they'd need to defend themselves
chemically _ could be the richest sources for all manner of drugs.
Take the strange case of a glorious feathery sea fan called
Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put a bit of tuna out on the reef, fish come from
everywhere, and it's gone,'' Fenical says. ``But if I grind up this
animal and mix in some extract with the tuna, the fish will come
up, take one bite and go `Yuck!' No way will they eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the sea fan's chemical arsenal is a family of molecules
called pseudopterosins which do more than make fish want to barf.
In people, they soothe swelling caused by sunburn or chemical
irritants. They do so by reining in a key enzyme involved in
inflammation, and they do it with more clout than does
hydrocortisone.
</P>
<P>
   Psoriasis, sunburn and arthritis all involve inflammation, and
one or more of the pseudopterosins might one day be the drug of
choice to treat these afflictions.
</P>
<P>
   Fenical reckons that a sea fan extract might also be great as an
additive to toothpaste or for soothing inflamed gums. The extract
is already being added to cosmetics like face creams. Of course,
the hope is to hit the jackpot with far stronger drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a potential cancer killer, the trick is to ferret
out drugs that kill a range of cancer cells but leave healthy cells
unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the compound must be purified, its molecular structure
determined and either a drug company or the National Cancer
Institute has to decide to fund testing on animals. Finally, the
drug must be tested on people.
</P>
<P>
   At any stage, testing may be dropped _ for reasons as simple as
the drug's being either too toxic or too weak.
</P>
<P>
   Although that outcome is common in the drug development
business, Fenical is excited about a substance he discovered
several years ago, called eleutherobin, in a remote shallow sea off
the coast of Australia. It comes from a mottled yellow
pickle-shaped soft coral.
</P>
<P>
   Eleutherobin stops malignant tumors from growing in much the
same way taxol does, by binding to a protein called tubulin and
disrupting cell division.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing nemesis of experimenting with sea drugs is supply
_ getting enough material to test, let alone produce, a drug. In
many cases, it's simply too hard to make a drug from scratch. The
chemistry is too complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Microbes can be grown in vats if researchers can figure out what
to feed them, but other substances can prove more daunting to
reproduce. When researchers became interested in halichondrin B, a
promising anticancer chemical from a sponge fondly known as
``yellow slimy,'' they had to collect a whole metric ton of sponges
to derive 300 milligrams of drug _ the amount needed to begin
preliminary trials.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, The National Cancer Institute put out a call to
marine biologists and word came back that the sponge thrives off
the coast of New Zealand. Now researchers are trying to farm the
sponge in Wellington Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent progress, no marine drug has reached the
pharmacy shelf. But Fenical is not discouraged. In fact, he is
passionate about the possibilities: ``If we need new drugs, where
are we going to go? Space? No.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses and waves his hand expansively out the window toward
the wide blue Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sitting right there. It's diverse as hell. And it's
waiting for us.''

   &UR; THE DRACULA SYNDROME &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neurologist Juan Gomez-Alonso has formulated an unusual medical
hypothesis, an explanation for the origin of vampire legends.
Stories of lusty, bloodthirsty vampires, says Gomez-Alonso, who
works at Xeral Hospital in Vigo, Spain, may have been inspired by
people suffering from rabies.
</P>
<P>
   He traces the connection to a rabies outbreak in central Europe
in the early 18th century, not long before stories of vampires
began circulating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the symptoms, such as aggressiveness and
hypersexuality, would not have been seen as manifestations of a
disease,'' he says. ``Uneducated people could have thought all this
was the work of a malign being. Moreover, the bizarre rejection of
some stimuli _ odors, light, water and mirrors _ shown by rabid
humans must have been quite puzzling.''
</P>
<P>
   What's next for Gomez-Alonso, werewolves? As it happens, yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A connection between rabies and the development of the
werewolf legend could be hypothesized.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEXT: ROCKETS AT O'HARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The space shuttle and its rockets are huge _ some 4.5 million
pounds at liftoff. About 85 percent of that weight is fuel.
Designed to work in a vacuum, the shuttle must carry not only fuel
but the oxygen to burn it. Because this is an inefficient way to
go, NASA engineers have recently tested an engine that gets some of
its oxygen on the run. Uwe Hueter of the Marshall Space Flight
Center in Huntsville, Ala., says the engine could cut takeoff
weights in half.
</P>
<P>
   A spacecraft equipped with this engine would take off like a
rocket, Hueter says. But within minutes, incoming air would begin
to supplement liquid oxygen. Once the space craft hit 1,500 miles
per hour _ twice the speed of sound _ the liquid oxygen would shut
off completely and the engine would burn fuel mixed with air.
Operating like a ramjet, the craft would accelerate to about 10
times the speed of sound. When the air got too thin for the engine
to breathe, the ship would shift back to rocket mode to punch its
way into space.
</P>
<P>
   Recent wind-tunnel tests of the idea were a smashing success,
says Hunter, who plans flight tests in about four years. In the
long run _ about 15 years hence _ Hunter hopes the engine will be
matched with advanced materials under development at NASA to create
a vehicle nearly as inexpensive as a jetliner.
</P>
<P>
   ``My vision is that this would be a horizontal takeoff and
horizontal lander,'' he says. ``If we can keep the weight below a
million pounds, which is about what a 747 weighs, we could even use
existing airports.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HAWKING'S VISION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His body may be confined to a wheelchair, but the mind of
Stephen Hawking soars, grappling with the most profound mysteries
of the universe, from the birth and death of black holes to the
fate of the cosmos itself.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy A. Svitil, an editor for Discover magazine, recently
interviewed Hawking after he talked to a packed auditorium in San
Jose, Calif., about the future of science. The theoretical
physicist predicted the development of intelligent, self-aware
computers that could match the human brain, not to mention space
travel well beyond this solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Svitil asked: What are the biggest unsolved problems in physics
today?
</P>
<P>
   ``The theory of everything,'' Hawking said _ the name physicists
give to the undiscovered laws that would unite all theories about
the universe, from quantum mechanics to Einstein's general theory
of relativity. ``We feel that we are near, but we never get there.
It always seems just over the rainbow's edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulties scientists face in tackling the
all-in-one theory, Hawking is certain the answer will come soon:
``My money is on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another enigma, he said, is ``understanding the origin of the
universe and why it produced the universe that we see.'' Too many
theories, he suggests, explain some of the things we see in nature,
but they can't be applied to all conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cosmology is not science if it does not produce theories with
predictions that agree with what we observe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Svitil asked what Hawking thought of John Horgan's
recent book, ``The End of Science,'' in which the author argues
that all the fundamental problems of science have been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Hawking likes to give succinct answers because he is disabled by
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis _ Lou Gehrig's disease _ and must
communicate by spelling out his words on a computer. His reply?
</P>
<P>
   ``Garbage.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Outside the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla,
Calif., the sights, sounds and smells are all of a seaside
paradise. Inside, in biologist William Fenical's lab, it's good-bye
to the sea's charms and hello to the disgusting and fascinating
world of creatures scooped from that ocean outside, ground up and
thrown at every frightening disease Fenical can think of.
</P>
<P>
   This is the medicine chest of the next millennium _ agar-filled
dishes, flasks full of brown nutrient broth and beakers bubbling
like omelets in hell's kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   What's brewing in these potent pots? Stews of fungi and bacteria
that once lived in ocean sediments, rotting driftwood, weeds,
coral, sponges and grasses. Any one of these containers might
harbor a brand-new cancer drug or a compound to wipe out some of
the scariest viruses known to humankind.
</P>
<P>
   With the glory days of antibiotics over, Fenical's quest may be
critical to the future of medicine. Bacterium after bacterium is
gaining resistance to our arsenal. Doctors are desperate for
compounds to attack cancer, Alzheimer's, AIDS and a long list of
other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Since that momentous day in 1928 when Alexander Fleming
discovered penicillin, researchers have been looking in
increasingly exotic locations for the next strain of antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Fenical's answer is surprisingly simple: Search the sea. Since
the 1980s he has been plunging into the ocean to find the next wave
of medicines. Already he and his colleagues have dredged up some
promising candidates: chemicals that soothe swelling, a compound
from a yellow soft coral that disrupts cell division in cancer
cells and virus-killing proteins from ocean molds that live in sea
grasses.
</P>
<P>
   Fenical is not alone in this effort. Today the list of novel
potential anticancer drugs at the National Cancer Institute's
Natural Products Branch includes more candidates from the ocean
than from the land. Several promising drugs from the sea that might
be used to treat leukemia _ including one from a creature called
Bugula, which clings to the bottoms of boats _ are involved in
human trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ocean is by far the major habitat on the planet _ it's 70
percent of Earth's surface,'' Fenical explains. ``It's teeming with
unique organisms. More than half the organisms in the ocean don't
even occur on land.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news. The bad news is that it's difficult to
know just where to look. When it comes to marine life, the rich
history of ethnomedicine provides hardly any clues. Still, Fenical
and his colleagues have come up with strategies to narrow their
search.
</P>
<P>
   The first strategy is to go to a place where life is diverse and
concentrated, such as a reef in the Caribbean. An environment rich
in sea life is more likely to yield varied specimens.
</P>
<P>
   Fenical suspects that creatures loaded with biologically active
molecules _ the kind that they'd need to defend themselves
chemically _ could be the richest sources for all manner of drugs.
Take the strange case of a glorious feathery sea fan called
Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put a bit of tuna out on the reef, fish come from
everywhere, and it's gone,'' Fenical says. ``But if I grind up this
animal and mix in some extract with the tuna, the fish will come

additive to toothpaste or for soothing inflamed gums. The extract
is already being added to cosmetics like face creams. Of course,
the hope is to hit the jackpot with far stronger drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a potential cancer killer, the trick is to ferret

unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the compound must be purified, its molecular structure

drug must be tested on people.

</P>
<P>
   With the glory days of antibiotics over, Fenical's quest may be
critical to the future of medicine. Bacterium after bacterium is
gaining resistance to our arsenal. Doctors are desperate for
compounds to attack cancer, Alzheimer's, AIDS and a long list of
other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Since that momentous day in 1928 when Alexander Fleming
discovered penicillin, researchers have been looking in
increasingly exotic locations for the next strain of antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Fenical's answer is surprisingly simple: Search the sea. Since
the 1980s he has been plunging into the ocean to find the next wave
of medicines. Already he and his colleagues have dredged up some
promising candidates: chemicals that soothe swelling, a compound
from a yellow soft coral that disrupts cell division in cancer
cells and virus-killing proteins from ocean molds that live in sea
grasses.
</P>
<P>
   Fenical is not alone in this effort. Today the list of novel
potential anticancer drugs at the National Cancer Institute's
Natural Products Branch includes more candidates from the ocean
than from the land. Several promising drugs from the sea that might
be used to treat leukemia _ including one from a creature called
Bugula, which clings to the bottoms of boats _ are involved in
human trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ocean is by far the major habitat on the planet _ it's 70
percent of Earth's surface,'' Fenical explains. ``It's teeming with
unique organisms. More than half the organisms in the ocean don't
even occur on land.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news. The bad news is that it's difficult to
know just where to look. When it comes to marine life, the rich
history of ethnomedicine provides hardly any clues. Still, Fenical
and his colleagues have come up with strategies to narrow their
search.
</P>
<P>
   The first strategy is to go to a place where life is diverse and
concentrated, such as a reef in the Caribbean. An environment rich
in sea life is more likely to yield varied specimens.
</P>
<P>
   Fenical suspects that creatures loaded with biologically active
molecules _ the kind that they'd need to defend themselves
chemically _ could be the richest sources for all manner of drugs.
Take the strange case of a glorious feathery sea fan called
Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put a bit of tuna out on the reef, fish come from
everywhere, and it's gone,'' Fenical says. ``But if I grind up this
animal and mix in some extract with the tuna, the fish will come
up, take one bite and go `Yuck!' No way will they eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the sea fan's chemical arsenal is a family of molecules
called pseudopterosins which do more than make fish want to barf.
In people, they soothe swelling caused by sunburn or chemical
irritants. They do so by reining in a key enzyme involved in
inflammation, and they do it with more clout than does
hydrocortisone.
</P>
<P>
   Psoriasis, sunburn and arthritis all involve inflammation, and
one or more of the pseudopterosins might one day be the drug of
choice to treat these afflictions.
</P>
<P>
   Fenical reckons that a sea fan extract might also be great as an
additive to toothpaste or for soothing inflamed gums. The extract
is already being added to cosmetics like face creams. Of course,
the hope is to hit the jackpot with far stronger drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a potential cancer killer, the trick is to ferret
out drugs that kill a range of cancer cells but leave healthy cells
unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the compound must be purified, its molecular structure
determined and either a drug company or the National Cancer
Institute has to decide to fund testing on animals. Finally, the
drug must be tested on people.
</P>
<P>
   At any stage, testing may be dropped _ for reasons as simple as
the drug's being either too toxic or too weak.
</P>
<P>
   Although that outcome is common in the drug development
business, Fenical is excited about a substance he discovered
several years ago, called eleutherobin, in a remote shallow sea off
the coast of Australia. It comes from a mottled yellow
pickle-shaped soft coral.
</P>
<P>
   Eleutherobin stops malignant tumors from growing in much the
same way taxol does, by binding to a protein called tubulin and
disrupting cell division.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing nemesis of experimenting with sea drugs is supply
_ getting enough material to test, let alone produce, a drug. In
many cases, it's simply too hard to make a drug from scratch. The
chemistry is too complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Microbes can be grown in vats if researchers can figure out what
to feed them, but other substances can prove more daunting to
reproduce. When researchers became interested in halichondrin B, a
promising anticancer chemical from a sponge fondly known as
``yellow slimy,'' they had to collect a whole metric ton of sponges
to derive 300 milligrams of drug _ the amount needed to begin
preliminary trials.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, The National Cancer Institute put out a call to
marine biologists and word came back that the sponge thrives off
the coast of New Zealand. Now researchers are trying to farm the
sponge in Wellington Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent progress, no marine drug has reached the
pharmacy shelf. But Fenical is not discouraged. In fact, he is
passionate about the possibilities: ``If we need new drugs, where
are we going to go? Space? No.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses and waves his hand expansively out the window toward
the wide blue Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sitting right there. It's diverse as hell. And it's
waiting for us.''

   &UR; THE DRACULA SYNDROME &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neurologist Juan Gomez-Alonso has formulated an unusual medical
hypothesis, an explanation for the origin of vampire legends.
Stories of lusty, bloodthirsty vampires, says Gomez-Alonso, who
works at Xeral Hospital in Vigo, Spain, may have been inspired by
people suffering from rabies.
</P>
<P>
   He traces the connection to a rabies outbreak in central Europe
in the early 18th century, not long before stories of vampires
began circulating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the symptoms, such as aggressiveness and
hypersexuality, would not have been seen as manifestations of a
disease,'' he says. ``Uneducated people could have thought all this
was the work of a malign being. Moreover, the bizarre rejection of
some stimuli _ odors, light, water and mirrors _ shown by rabid
humans must have been quite puzzling.''
</P>
<P>
   What's next for Gomez-Alonso, werewolves? As it happens, yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A connection between rabies and the development of the
werewolf legend could be hypothesized.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEXT: ROCKETS AT O'HARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The space shuttle and its rockets are huge _ some 4.5 million
pounds at liftoff. About 85 percent of that weight is fuel.
Designed to work in a vacuum, the shuttle must carry not only fuel
but the oxygen to burn it. Because this is an inefficient way to
go, NASA engineers have recently tested an engine that gets some of
its oxygen on the run. Uwe Hueter of the Marshall Space Flight
Center in Huntsville, Ala., says the engine could cut takeoff
weights in half.
</P>
<P>
   A spacecraft equipped with this engine would take off like a
rocket, Hueter says. But within minutes, incoming air would begin
to supplement liquid oxygen. Once the space craft hit 1,500 miles
per hour _ twice the speed of sound _ the liquid oxygen would shut
off completely and the engine would burn fuel mixed with air.
Operating like a ramjet, the craft would accelerate to about 10
times the speed of sound. When the air got too thin for the engine
to breathe, the ship would shift back to rocket mode to punch its
way into space.
</P>
<P>
   Recent wind-tunnel tests of the idea were a smashing success,
says Hunter, who plans flight tests in about four years. In the
long run _ about 15 years hence _ Hunter hopes the engine will be
matched with advanced materials under development at NASA to create
a vehicle nearly as inexpensive as a jetliner.
</P>
<P>
   ``My vision is that this would be a horizontal takeoff and
horizontal lander,'' he says. ``If we can keep the weight below a
million pounds, which is about what a 747 weighs, we could even use
existing airports.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HAWKING'S VISION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His body may be confined to a wheelchair, but the mind of
Stephen Hawking soars, grappling with the most profound mysteries
of the universe, from the birth and death of black holes to the
fate of the cosmos itself.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy A. Svitil, an editor for Discover magazine, recently
interviewed Hawking after he talked to a packed auditorium in San
Jose, Calif., about the future of science. The theoretical
physicist predicted the development of intelligent, self-aware
computers that could match the human brain, not to mention space
travel well beyond this solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Svitil asked: What are the biggest unsolved problems in physics
today?
</P>
<P>
   ``The theory of everything,'' Hawking said _ the name physicists
give to the undiscovered laws that would unite all theories about
the universe, from quantum mechanics to Einstein's general theory
of relativity. ``We feel that we are near, but we never get there.
It always seems just over the rainbow's edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulties scientists face in tackling the
all-in-one theory, Hawking is certain the answer will come soon:
``My money is on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another enigma, he said, is ``understanding the origin of the
universe and why it produced the universe that we see.'' Too many
theories, he suggests, explain some of the things we see in nature,
but they can't be applied to all conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cosmology is not science if it does not produce theories with
predictions that agree with what we observe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Svitil asked what Hawking thought of John Horgan's
recent book, ``The End of Science,'' in which the author argues
that all the fundamental problems of science have been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Hawking likes to give succinct answers because he is disabled by
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis _ Lou Gehrig's disease _ and must
communicate by spelling out his words on a computer. His reply?
</P>
<P>
   ``Garbage.''

Review: `The Swindle'  
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Like his idol Alfred Hitchcock, French director
Claude Chabrol can run the gamut from in-depth psychological
inquiry (``Violette,'' ``This Man Must Die'') to breezy,
sophisticated caper films. But even Chabrol's deceptively ``fun''
suspensers usually boast odd, intricate relationships that elevate
them above their tricky plots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Swindle'' is a generally delightful, slightly too light
example of the Chabrol entertainment formula at work. It teases us
_ without really fooling us for long _ about the professional but
strangely intimate bond between two con artists who appear to have
reached a parting of ways. But even though it's easy to guess
what's really going on between them, that very transparency
enhances the story's enjoyment. We keep second guessing the duo's
real motives; their interpersonal power plays are often more
intriguing than their criminal designs.
</P>
<P>
   Betty (Isabelle Huppert) and Victor (Michel Serrault) make a
decent living drugging and rolling conventioneers in Monte Carlo.
During the off-season, they travel around France in a motor home or
stop over at their posh Paris apartment. But even though they get
along like the oldest of amis, Betty nurses an independent itch.
She wants to vacation by herself _ and, secretly, try to run a few
deals on her own.
</P>
<P>
   Victor, who is decades older, indulges his partner's desire _ to
a point. When she doesn't come back from one fling in a timely
fashion, he follows her to an Alpine ski resort, where he almost
blows her scheme to purloin a cache of hot cash.
</P>
<P>
   As interested in scenic locales as he is in the film's loosely
wound plot, Chabrol moves everybody to a Caribbean isle for a
climactic confrontation, complete with oddball gangsters,
music-loving assassins and other colorful types. But by that time,
Betty and Victor are more put out by one another's untrustworthy
behavior than potential threats to life and limb.
</P>
<P>
   Old pros that they are, Serrault (``La Cage aux Folles,''
``Nelly and Monsieur Arnaud'') and Chabrol favorite Huppert
(``Story of Women,'' ``The Ceremony'') play the thing with such
assured, light-footed charisma, you almost wish they were hustling
you.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's Chabrol who's working us over. ``The Swindle'' is
scam moviemaking at its least substantial and most effervescent.
There are much worse ways to be conned out of eight bucks.

SEEMINGLY SECURE COMMUNITY STRUGGLES WITH SHOCK OF KILLINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LAURA VOZZELLA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Mike Collins was shuttling his son between
the orthodontist and middle school, a routine errand for parents in
this affluent community, when a tide of fleeing students abruptly
swept away such suburban sureties as straight teeth and safe
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stopped in the middle of the street and asked a kid what
was going on,'' said Collins' wife, Kristie. ``He said, `Somebody's
shooting everybody at the school.' And then it got worse from
there.''
</P>
<P>
   More terrible than the sight of terrified Columbine High School
students was the final result of the rampage that set them running:
more than a dozen dead, including the two gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   The worst school shooting in U.S. history, the attack would have
been shocking anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But residents here say they cannot fathom how such a tragedy
unfolded in their quiet community on the Front Range of the Rocky
Mountains, an area with strong schools and such family-oriented
public policies as extensive open-space initiatives and
hike-and-bike trails.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-five percent of Columbine High School graduates attend
college, and their mean SAT scores break 1,000, according to the
school's Web site. Located outside the city of Littleton, in view
of snow-capped Rocky Mountain peaks, the school serves students
from a rapidly growing, unincorporated area of southern Jefferson
County, on the southwestern fringe of metropolitan Denver.
</P>
<P>
   About 90,000 people live in the area known as ``South JeffCo,''
where the population has nearly doubled since 1980. Houses worth
$200,000 and $300,000 are the norm, and median household income is
$70,000 to $75,000, said Nick Morgan, a long-range planner with the
county.
</P>
<P>
   ``People move here because of the open-space programs and
schools,'' Morgan said. ``It's the last place people would think a
tragedy like this would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   As a classroom volunteer in area elementary schools, Mary
Mattison said, she knows firsthand that even children from affluent
homes can be neglected or troubled. ``It doesn't matter what the
demographics are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, she thought the rampage was particularly shocking
because it tore through such a seemingly secure community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here,'' she said, ``it's stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   South Jeffco residents are struggling with their grief and shock
in ways as predictable as lowered flags, as poignant as a
seventh-grade girl clinging to her mother's hand on a shopping
trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``My 17-year-old son has let me hug him, even this morning, and
it wasn't like, `Get away from me,''' said Karen Baird, whose son,
Tavis, hid in a science room for two hours before escaping.
</P>
<P>
   At a grocery store a few miles from the high school, a woman
sobbed as she loaded sacks into her car. Two normally garrulous
rock radio disc jockeys spent the morning urging parents to talk to
their children and vice versa. A local TV reporter broke down on
the air.
</P>
<P>
   A 13-year-old athlete vowed that he will never again wear a
baseball cap, one of the criteria police say the assailants may
have used to choose victims. A 16-year-old junior said she will
never return to the high school, which a few of her friends had
fortuitously ``ditched'' Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'd throw up,'' said Amanda Lamontagne, 16.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Gibbs, a retiree from nearby Englewood, felt compelled to
call his son after hearing about the attack, even though he could
not have been in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 29 years old and lives in San Francisco,'' Gibbs said.
``It was just that feeling of security. My wife teaches first grade
and she was just bawling all night.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the tragedy itself, people here are unsettled to find
their community suddenly swarming with international media. They
are used to Denver, their big-city neighbor about 20 miles to the
northeast, making headlines, but that's it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sitting at Applebee's eating dinner watching President
Clinton talk about Littleton,'' marveled the Rev. Brad Berglund, a
Baptist pastor from Englewood. ``All of a sudden the whole world is
focused on Littleton, this sort of snoozy, upscale part of town.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people were able to carry on with their activities without
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   At a store a few blocks from the school, Mattison, the classroom
volunteer, struggled to pick out a birthday card for a son who
turns 18 today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like a zombie,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She broke into tears talking about the slain students whose
bodies could not be immediately recovered because of homemade bombs
littering the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's babies are lying like rag dolls and no one can get
there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mattison also expressed concern for a friend whose two sons
attend Columbine. No one had been answering the phone at their
house, and she feared the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said she intended to carry on with plans to make her
son's birthday special, cashing in frequent flier miles to take him
on a quick surprise trip to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I need to celebrate his life,'' she said.

KANSAS CITY STAR BUDGET OFFERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
   
<TEXT>
<P>
   These are stories the Kansas City Star is offering for April 22,
1999:
COLORADO SHOOTING COVERAGE: GOTHS: The first reports of the
Littleton suspects were that they were part of the ``goth'' crowd,
but later accounts showed they leaned more toward right-wing
extremism. Nonethless, local goths lament that once again, they
have been portrayed as dangerous and unstable. They fear that
others will continue to treat them poorly - just as classmates said
others mocked the Denver suspects. A look at the realities and
misperceptions behind the goth subculture. Oscar Avila. 18ish
w/photo.
NRA: More about the growing problems of the NRA which wanted to
hold a national convention in Denver. Scott Canon.
DEATH: Youth disconnect regarding death. What leads people like
these young shooters to become completely disconnected from the
concept and reality of death? To have no regard for their own lives
or the lives of anyone else? To be unable to empathize with others
about death, dying or suffering? We talk to theologians,
psychologists and others about this phenomenon. Ed Eveld. With
CHECKLST. List of danger signs indicating a teen may threaten
serious trouble.
EXCEL: Excelsior Springs, Mo., High School today holds a mock
intruder drill because of the Littleton, Colo., tragedy. The school
puts a sign on someone that says intruder. School officials see how
long it takes for someone to report the intruder to the office. The
school has done this in the past as a security precaution, but the
recent event prompted officials to hold it again. Jerry Berrios.
10. Photos.
GUNS: For years, people thought nothing could be done about drunken
driving, but then a bunch of mothers got mad and changed society's
perceptions. Some people wonder when Americans will get fed up with
gun violence and say `We're mad as hell, and we're not going to
take it any more?' 25. Richard Espinoza.
CON: Violence experts say schools must adopt and encourage conflict
resolution programs to stop incidents like Littleton. A number of
area schools have such program. To show how the programs work,
we're trying to set up an interview with a counselor and two
students who've used the program. TBA.
VICTIM: We'll try to round out a story about the teens who were
shot in Littleton, Colo., now that some of the names are coming
out. Rick Montgomery. 30.
OTHER OFFERS: QUAKE: Researcher at University of Missouri-Columbia
reports his findings in Science magazine that the New Madrid
earthquake fault in Missouri's bootheel probably won't witness an
8.0 earthquake for another couple thousand years. Turns out the
hype about the possibility of a huge earthquake in Missouri was
just that -- hype. But there still could be a 6.0 quake in
Missouri's future _ and such a quake could cause serious damage and
cost lives. Lynn Franey. 25 inches. w/ photo from the Web, locator
map, and fact box of highlights from New Madrid Fault history.
DRIVE: A year ago, three Blue Valley High softball players died in
a wreck on their way to practice. It was one of three fatal wrecks
involving BVH students last year. In response, several students
created a presentation on safe driving. We watch it Thursday
morning at a middle school. Christine Malamanig. 18 inches. .MDNM/
MERGE: The Missouri Public Service Commission and the Missouri
Office of Public Counsel file their testimony on the proposed
merger of Western and KCP&AMP;L. The testimony is expected to be
critical of the union. Steve Everly
BLOCK: H&AMP;R Block acquires a sixth accounting firm. Gene Meyer
UMB: UMB releases first quarter earnings; annual meeting and proxy
report. Charles R.T. Crumpley
TENTATIVE OFFERS: NATO: Washington, D.C. braces for NATO's 50th
anniversary celebration, which begins Friday and will virtually
shut down the entire city for the weekend. It will be the largest
gathering ever of world leaders in Washington. David Goldstein. 30
inches.
NHIST: NATO's 50th anniversary celebration will be overshadowed by
the failing war in Kosovo, but the organization's birth was not
without controversy, either. Promoters of NATO had to overcome 150
years of isolationism dating to George Washington's warning about
entangling alliances with Europe. But the aggressive Soviet Union
was the concept's best salesman. With map showing evolution of NATO
membership. Brian Burnes. 25 inches.

GE CHIEF WOOS STOCKHOLDERS, BUT RETIREES SEEK SLICE OF PIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAY MILLER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The theme at the annual meeting of General Electric
Co. shareholders could have been ``taking big swings.''
</P>
<P>
   Some were taken by chief executive John F. Welch. Others were
taken by dissident shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Welch used the phrase to describe the strength of his diverse
company, whose 1998 revenues topped $100 billion for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one decisive advantage a big, global company has (is) the
ability to take big swings in the pursuit of growth,'' Welch said
Wednesday in his closing remarks to about 2,000 shareholders,
retirees and securities analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Welch said the company used its size in 1998 to spend $21
billion on 108 acquisitions. The big swings in those buys, he said,
were the $15 billion in acquisitions in economically troubled
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Welch drew applause from the audience as he recounted the
financial results of the year _ a 13 percent growth in earnings to
$9.3 billion and record results for operating margins and total
return on capital.
</P>
<P>
   The company's ``Six Sigma'' quality improvement margin came in
for considerable praise from Welch. He credited the 3 1/2-year
program with saving the company $750 million and extolled its
potential to increase company sales and market share.
</P>
<P>
   After Welch spoke, shareholders who had put their own issues
before shareholders trooped up to two microphones to expound on
their proposals. Helen Quirini and Hank Antonelli from Schenectady,
N.Y., spoke in favor of a shareholder proposal that raised the
issue of pension payments.
</P>
<P>
   Quirini, who is president of International Union of Electrical
Workers Local 301 retiree group, asked that the company use
pension-fund surpluses to grant annual cost-of-living increases to
long-time retirees. Retirees estimate the surplus at $16 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Quirini and Antonelli were among about 50 retirees, mostly from
Erie, Pa., who picketed quietly outside the entrance of the
International Exposition Center in suburban Brook Park before
entering the meeting. Most wore yellow T-shirts with the message,
``GE _ Bring Good Things to Retirees _ Please!'' on the front.
</P>
<P>
   Quirini, 79, said that when she retired in 1980, after 39 years
with the company, she began receiving pension payments of $444 per
month. The pensions of more recent retirees are higher, because of
a higher earnings at retirement and the way base retirement pay is
computed.
</P>
<P>
   Quirini had no increase in her retirement for 11 years, until
1991, when the company boosted it to $480 a month. Now, after
several more increases, it is $576 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pension fund has a huge surplus, and it's a shame that
such pitiful pensions are still being paid to earlier retirees,''
she said. ``Make us whole again, Jack.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonelli, who worked for GE in Schenectady for 44 years, added
that while he and other retirees appreciated the past pension
increases, ``Our fund certainly can support substantial payouts
without jeopardizing its solvency.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch responded by describing the issue as ``a no-win
discussion.'' He said the company is living up to all its
responsibilities to its retirees, who number 190,000, but that it
also had to consider the future needs of its 276,000 employees.
Then, referring to his own impending retirement in two years, Welch
added, ``I'll be out there with you in three or four years.''
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Quirini called the response ``disgusting.''
The measure was defeated, but it received more than 29 percent of
shares voted, a significantly higher affirmative vote than any
other shareholder proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Other shareholder issues focused on environmental issues. Three
proposals questioned the company's commitment to environmental
concerns, particularly in the Hudson River Valley.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nuns from several Catholic orders questioned a recent study that
found no connection between exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) and cancer deaths. Others urged the company to cooperate
with the Environmental Protection Agency's review of the PCB issue.
</P>
<P>
   Welch defended the company's environmental record in his
prepared remarks, saying the company spent $2 billion in the last
decade to comply with environmental regulations ``and going beyond
them to voluntarily improve the air, water and soil in the
communities in which we operate.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a recent study of workers in upstate New York _ the
fifth undertaken _ reached the same conclusion as others: ``There
is no evidence that PCBs cause cancer in people.'' None of three
environmental proposals received more than 8.4 percent of the
shares voted.
</P>
<P>
   GE used PCBs for about three decades as an insulator in electric
capacitors. The company legally discharged more than one million
pounds of the chemicals into the Hudson River before the chemicals
were banned in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The company _ and Welch in particular _ have been highly
regarded by shareholders and analysts.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a half hour before the start of the meeting, Welch
stood outside the meeting hall surrounded by reporters and largely
admiring shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Some asked for autographs and others, including several
retirees, thanked him for improving their financial circumstances.

<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ It's Matt Weinstein's job to have fun at
work.
</P>
<P>
   As the founder of Playfair in Berkeley _ his job title is
``emperor'' _ Weinstein has been telling companies for decades that
making the workplace fun will make the company stronger.
</P>
<P>
   In a new book, ``Work Like Your Dog,'' Weinstein and Luke Barber
describe the benefits that large and small companies derive from
making work more enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes so much sense,'' Weinstein said in an interview,
``yet it's one of those disconnects in people's brains.''
</P>
<P>
   He said more companies are realizing that making work fun is one
way to retain good employees, which is crucial because of the low
unemployment rate, but many are reluctant to change age-old company
policies.
</P>
<P>
   The book includes a story about Jim McGory, who worked in
corporate sales for a major airline. His boss told him that
although his numbers were excellent, he wasn't acting in a
professional manner: He was always the first one to take off his
jacket at meetings, and the boss would hear him laughing when he
was talking on the phone with customers.
</P>
<P>
   McGory explained that the reason he did so well was because he
treated customers like friends, but the boss wasn't buying it.
</P>
<P>
   ```Jim, you have to remember that in business, perception is
reality,' responded his boss. ``If people hear you laughing, then
they won't believe you're doing a good job.'''
</P>
<P>
   McGory started his own business, and told Weinstein what he
recalled about his old boss: ``I remember that he didn't understand
me at all. But the main thing that I remember is that he forced me
out the door and forced me to become a millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its title, the book does not carry the ``Work Like Your
Dog'' idea to extremes. One short chapter does, however, describe
how guide dogs and other working canines can teach human workers a
lot of lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They approach their work not only with dedication, loyalty,
discipline, sensitivity and love, but also with joy, enthusiasm and
happiness,'' Weinstein writes. ``If you want to increase your
abilities in this area of study, spend a few hours this week in the
company of a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein writes that managers often don't understand that
people will work harder if they know that doing well will allow
them to have some fun. He describes how Kirt Womack, who works at a
plant that makes booster rockets, persuaded his supervisor to let
workers have a paper airplane contest if they reached 150 percent
of their quota by 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   By 2:30, they had reached 210 percent of their quota.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all celebrated by going outside and jubilantly flying
their paper airplanes,'' Weinstein writes, ``and when Kirt asked
his manager what he thought of their accomplishment, his manager
churlishly replied, `If you can produce this well with an hour off,
imagine how much more you could get done if you actually worked
that hard for the whole shift.'''
</P>
<P>
   But when Womack proposed the same sort of reward the following
week, the manager had a change of heart. ``After the team handily
trounced its quota once again that day, it began to dawn on Kirt's
supervisor that the days with the highest productivity were the
days when Kirt's team was having some organized fun together.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Weinstein said that having organized fun is
far easier in companies with enlightened management, but even
rank-and-file employees can make work better by spending their
breaks having fun. Here are some of the favorite activities he has
come across:
</P>
<P>
   _ Having secret pals.
</P>
<P>
   For a period of two weeks, give each participating employee a
secret pal, a co-worker who tries to do something nice for the
person each day, like putting chocolates in her desk or sending
flowers to his wife. If the company doesn't provide any money for
the program, agree on how much each person should spend during the
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Creating a ``stress-free day.''
</P>
<P>
   Have a masseuse walk through the office giving free neck and
shoulder rubs all day. Have a bootblack give free shoeshines and
have someone in the parking lot to give free carwashes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Establishing a swearing room.
</P>
<P>
   A company did this, putting the swearing room next to a
trainer's office. Prizes were awarded to employees who came up with
particularly creative curses.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dressing as a favorite holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein said that Women Inc. in Sacramento, Calif., had just
such an event, with people dressing as the Easter Bunny or Cupid.
</P>
<P>
   One woman showed up with pillows stuffed under her dress.
</P>
<P>
   She was Labor Day.

 &HT;    CHICAGO'S BAN ON SOCIAL PROMOTIONS MAY BECOME NATIONAL MODEL
 &HT;    700&AMP;add. With PROMOTION-DATA for release Sunday, April 25.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Last June, Monica Turner failed eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   She was one of more than 25,000 grade-school students in Chicago
who were held back, and like most of them, she had failed to score
high enough on Iowa Tests of Basic Skills in reading and math.
</P>
<P>
   Monica became a beneficiary _ or a victim, some would say _ of
the city's ban on social promotions, the widespread practice of
keeping all but the worst students with their own age group.
</P>
<P>
   And if President Clinton can persuade Congress to make a similar
ban a condition of receiving federal education aid, there could be
millions of Monicas from coast to coast within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, one-fourth of the city's third-, sixth- and
eighth-graders were ordered to go to summer school last year for
courses in arts, sports, reading and math.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them did go. In August, more than half of them passed
both Iowa tests and were promoted.
</P>
<P>
   But Monica, who passed only the math test, was among the 12,152
who were held back once again.
</P>
<P>
   In January, she flunked the reading test for the third time. As
of April, according to the Chicago Public Schools, 7,568 of the
children still hadn't been promoted.
</P>
<P>
   School officials are coy about how many have dropped out, were
pushed out, or transferred to other school systems. Most, like
Monica, are still plugging away.
</P>
<P>
   On a cold, rainy Thursday in late April, parents and guardians
collected their children's latest report cards at Sengstacke
Transition Center, one of nine special schools for eighth-graders
15 or older who haven't qualified for high school.
</P>
<P>
   Monica's card showed passing grades in high school-level courses
and in her double-period course in reading, which takes 100 minutes
a day. She was feeling a lot more confident than she did a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   When she takes the reading test for the fourth time in May,
``I'm going to hit this test,'' Monica said.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley is proud of the students who
persist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't say the kids are dumb,'' Daley said. The mayor, who
needed three tries to pass the exam that allowed him to practice
law, said, ``I flunked the bar twice and I'm not dumb.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before 1995, they socially promoted children. It was the easy
way out for adults,'' Daley said. ``The children got into eighth
grade and they just moved them into high school, and then it was,
'What are we going to do? Let's just give them this diploma.' ``
</P>
<P>
   He said social promotions had horrifying effects: eighth graders
promoted to high school while reading at the third-grade level, and
high school juniors reading at the fourth-grade level.
</P>
<P>
   Half who began high school dropped out before graduation. Of the
graduates who were admitted to Chicago's colleges and universities,
96 percent had to take remedial reading courses.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston, a friend of Daley's who also
appoints his city's school board, doesn't have as much faith in
standardized tests. He says some well-educated students, like some
candidates for teaching posts, just happen to freeze up on tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much emphasis on testing,'' Menino said. ``You
know what it is? It's a good mechanism for politicians to beat up
teachers and students.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Chicago, children who are held back get lots of expensive
extra help. The city offers summer school, extra teachers, remedial
specialists, smaller classes, test-taking courses, after-school
programs and tutors drawn from from colleges, businesses and the
ranks of retired teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago voters also approved a $2 billion bond issue that Daley
is using for replacement or renovation of the city's tattered old
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, all of Chicago's 431,000 school children will be
covered by a private or public health plan. Free eyeglasses will be
provided for the thousands who can't focus on the blackboard when
they are at their desks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can call it retention with intervention,'' said Cozette
Buckney, chief educational officer of the Chicago Public Schools.
``Our attendance is up, our dropout rate is down. Teachers are
working diligently to make sure the students are achieving their
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   However, new school policies might not deserve the credit for
those improvements or for a slight upward tilt in average test
scores, said Tony Bryk, co-director of the Consortium for Chicago
School Research. For example, teenagers in Chicago can't get
welfare assistance if they leave school; that may be why the
dropout rate among the city's 1,100 pregnant teens fell to less
than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents are upset about the city's tough promotion policy,
and others are indifferent, even though those held back include 42
eighth-graders who first failed the Iowa tests in May 1997. School
officials are considering admitting that group into special high
school classes if they fail one more time.
</P>
<P>
   But surveys and election results indicate that most parents
support Chicago's use of high-stakes tests to hold back students
who perform poorly and dump teachers whose students don't pass the
tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were coming up in life, they were just pushing you
through school,'' said Camilla Dickens, whose daughter also goes to
the Sengstacke center. ``My daughter is reading better than she was
before. Now she just has to pass the test.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I was antsy,'' said another parent, Brenda Baker.
``But they have shown here that what kids thought they couldn't do,
they can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 216 older eighth-graders who have been bused to the
Sengstacke center on the fringe of downtown Chicago since last
August, 72 passed the January tests and were promoted immediately,
57 transferred or dropped out, and 87 are preparing to retake the
tests in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reform changed the culture among students in (the worst) high
schools,'' said Fred Hess, director of Northwestern University's
Center on Urban Policy. ``More students are serious about their
work and not embarrassed by doing good work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, the attitude among the professionals toward reform
was, 'This too shall pass,' `` said Betty Dispenza-Green, principal
of Chicago Vocational Career Academy. ``Now everybody understands
there are repercussions, that there is accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   However, positive reports on Chicago's retention policy will
fade within a few years, predicted Ernest House, a professor of
education at the University of Colorado at Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't they identify at-risk kids and that special
treatment early on, so they can avoid flunking them?'' asked House,
who charted the collapse of a similar experiment in New York City
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have all these lesson plans based on the Iowa tests, but
the kids will do worse when they give them other tests,'' House
said. ``Even worse, flunking a kid increases the kid's chances of
dropping out.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Vallas, chief executive officer of the Chicago Public
Schools, said the city had to rely on the well-known Iowa tests
because nobody trusted the system's ``phony grades and phony
diplomas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think three or four years down the road, grades from classes
will carry much greater weight than they carry now,'' Vallas said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Monica Turner yearns desperately to pass the
reading test that is her only passport to promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice here, but it ain't where you want to be,'' she said.
``You want to get into a regular high school.''

CANDIDATES' STANCES VARY WITH AUDIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Patrick J. Buchanan opened his White House
campaign in New Hampshire, he promptly promised to ``oppose and
veto any and all tax increases'' if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   But a week later, Buchanan showed up in Texas vowing to impose a
new tax on oil imports. The proposal appeared to violate his
no-new-taxes pledge and could be unpopular with voters who depend
on home heating oil in the Northeast, including the first-primary
state of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's action provides a window into the way candidates
change or shade their views to court constituencies in different
states. In the case of the oil-import tax, Buchanan insisted he was
not really breaking his pledge because the new tax revenue would
pay for a rebate to cover the increased price of heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Buchanan explained he is proposing ``no net new
taxes,'' but he is hardly alone in spinning policies to suit an
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, wrote a widely
noticed op-ed piece in The New York Times in November 1996 titled
``Nature is not a liberal plot.'' McCain said polls showed that
Americans' top concern about the Republican-controlled Congress was
the GOP view on the environment. The next Congress, he wrote, must
assure the public that ``the Republican environmental agenda will
consist of more than coining new epithets for environmental
extremists or offering banal symbolic gestures.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the following two years, McCain voted with the
environmental lobby only 13 percent of the time, including a zero
percent record in 1998, according to a scorecard compiled by the
League of Conservation Voters. In response, McCain spokesman Howard
Opinsky said the senator had taken a number of steps in those two
years that went unnoticed by the league, including backing a
national park trust fund, an environmental technology award, the
establishment of the Institute for Environmental Conflict
Resolution, and a noise pollution proposal for the Grand Canyon, as
well as being named honorary board member of the Coalition of
Republican Environmental activists.
</P>
<P>
   McCain does earns kudos from some campaign analysts for refusing
to change his stand on an issue that could hurt his presidential
bid _ opposing government subsidies for ethanol, a corn-based
additive to gasoline that is popular among farmers in Iowa, the
first-caucus state.
</P>
<P>
   Other presidential candidates support the ethanol tax break. For
example, Texas Governor George W. Bush, a former oil man who has
risen to power with support from his state's oil industry, might be
expected to oppose the ethanol subsidy. The tax break is unpopular
in Texas because it provides extra competition to the oil industry,
and legions of Texas politicians have spent years trying to kill
the subsidy. But with Bush in little danger of losing his
home-state vote, the Texas governor recently told all four
Republican House members from Iowa that he would support the
ethanol subsidy. The four congressmen subsequently endorsed Bush
for president.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Greg Ganske, one of the four Iowa lawmakers who
endorsed Bush, said he pressed the governor on ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that was important,'' Ganske said. ``It is
one of many different issues that are important.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, special interests in early primary and caucus states
have long counted on their influence to sway presidential
candidates on key issues.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is a champion of catering to Iowa's
interests. In recent months, Gore used his power within the
administration to announce a series of grants to help the nation's
pork producers, 18,000 of whom live in Iowa. The administration
provided $50 million in direct payments to the nation's hog farmers
and spent another $80 million to compensate farmers with herds
infected with the pseudorabies virus.
</P>
<P>
   Some candidates play down positions that are popular in one
state but unpopular in another. This year, every GOP presidential
candidate opposes abortion, some make little or no mention of the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Vice President Dan Quayle spoke to the
Christian Coalition in September, he used the word ``abortion'' 13
times, according to his prepared text. But in some of his speeches
announcing his presidential candidacy this year, he rarely used the
word. Instead, he made a passing reference to the issue by saying
he is fighting for ``faith, family, freedom, and life.'' The
audience was left to figure out whether he is referring to
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Elizabeth Dole in the past has spoken about her
antiabortion view in Iowa, which has many influential religious
conservatives. But earlier this month, she urged tolerance on the
issue, saying she didn't want to be ``drawn into dead-end
debates.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, meanwhile, is trying to explain why his proposed tax
on oil imports does not violate his no-new-taxes pledge. Buchanan
made the proposal earlier this month in Texas, partly to tweak Bush
for overseeing a state economy where oil producers are suffering
from low prices.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, in the interview, said he would impose a tax on
imported oil if the price dropped to a certain level, such as $14
per barrel. The price has hovered around $16 or $17 per barrel.
Buchanan suggested that a tax of $1 per barrel could bring in $3.6
billion a year. But oil import taxes have long been opposed in the
Northeast because they would raise the price of home heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already `enjoy' some of the highest energy costs in the
country,'' said New Hampshire Republican Party chairman Steven
Duprey, who said Buchanan's proposal has received no notice in the
Granite State until now. ``I think people in New Hampshire
historically have reacted very negatively to surcharges and fees on
energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, in a footnote that he did not explain in any of his
Texas speeches, said his oil-import tax would be offset by using
some of the revenues as a ``rebate to those in the Northeast for
gasoline and fuel'' increases from the new tax. ``So you would net
out to zero. This is no net new taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   But if anyone knows the risks of deviating from a no-tax pledge,
it is Buchanan. In the 1992 presidential campaign, Buchanan ran an
effective television commercial titled ``Broken Promises'' that
focused on how Bush broke his pledge of ``Read My Lips, No New
Taxes''when he agreed to a budget deal. The commercial shows a
crowd of Buchanan supporters saying ``Read Our Lips,'' followed by
an announcer who says: ``Send Bush a message. Vote Pat Buchanan for
president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat Buchanan is an experienced enough fellow that he will be
able to ably defend his position,'' said Duprey, the New Hampshire
GOP chairman. ``And I'm sure other candidates will raise it.''

PERIL SEEN IN UNLAWFUL EXPORT OF REFUGEES

   DURRES, Albania _ The name is whispered like an illicit drug.
``Skaf?'' the local men ask, using the Albanian for boat, as they
approach Kosovars in refugee camps to peddle a midnight ride across
the Adriatic Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Only some 1,000 of the 340,000 refugees throughout Albania have
accepted the illegal offer in recent weeks, paying approximately
$350 each for the rough sea journey to Italy, according to law
enforcement officials and smugglers themselves. Nearly half of the
Kosovars transported since March 24 have been caught on the other
side, only to be placed in Italian refugee camps like the ones they
left behind.
</P>
<P>
   But as warmer weather sets in and as the time since their flight
from Kosovo begins to lengthen, many more refugees are expected to
seep into the network of smuggling. That has long plagued the
Albanian coast, which has sparked massive political turmoil over
the last year, officials said. In a worst case scenario, thousand
of refugees _ already preyed upon in Yugoslavia _ are in danger of
falling victim to the violence of the local smugglers, who last
fall murdered at least one foreign refugee, or to the rough seas,
which claimed six lives in a single night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great concern for the situation,'' said Ylli
Vejsiu, a member of the Albanian Parliament. ``Fortunately, the
situation is under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Or at least it appears to be. According to one refugee smuggler
in the southern port of Vlore, from which the vast majority of
illegal immigrants depart, the main impediments to the trading in
Kosovar refugees have been bad weather and price. Most Kosovars
fled their homes without money or were robbed by Serb troops along
the way, leaving them unable to pay the fee _ even though many boat
operators have dropped their prices to accommodate the newcomers,
according to the smuggler, who agreed to be identified only by his
first name, Bashkim.
</P>
<P>
   And even for those Kosovars with enough cash, available boats
have been few, and freezing rains have made the Adriatic too rough
to cross, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is cold on the water,'' he said. Then he joked: ``But with
all the money we take, we should be hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Bashkim, 25, a native of Vlore, says he runs what amounts to a
ferry service between Albania and Italy, with three partners. He
said he shipped several thousand people across the water each year,
departing from Vlore at 1 a.m. almost every night and arriving in
Italy an hour-and-a-half later. The showpiece of the operation is
his skaf, a rubber Yamaha boat with two 250-horsepower engines that
is big enough to seat up to 30 adults. And the product comes with a
guarantee: Refugees caught and returned to Albania within five days
are given their money back, their identities checked against
Polaroid photos Bashkim snaps before every trip.
</P>
<P>
   No Kosovar refugees have returned as yet, he said. And the
numbers have remained relatively low; Bashkim said he has
personally driven just one boatload of Kosovars in recent weeks,
transporting 28 adults and 8 children on April 8. Local officials
also believe traffic has remained steady, with no more than six
boats running each night.
</P>
<P>
   But few have forgotten the Albanian smuggling explosions of the
past. In the early 1990s, more than 100,000 fled the country's
Communist regime, causing chaos as they tumbled from the shores of
Durras into boats run by the Albanian and Italian Mafias. In 1998,
another wave of refugees fled the country's financial crisis at a
rate of 800 passengers a night, prompting an outcry nationwide when
several were killed. Last Oct. 22, smugglers robbed and beat an
Iraqi passenger traveling from Vlore, tossing his body overboard.
Three nights later, two speedboats collided, killing a half-dozen
refugees, including an 18-month-old baby and a 19-year-old woman.
</P>
<P>
   Police immediately cracked down, and the Albanian government
earlier this year tried to remove the skafs from the water
altogether, passing a law against running boats that travel faster
than 20 miles per hour. But the effort has been nearly meaningless.
The Vlore police chief, Sokol Kociu, was held hostage by local
smugglers when he tried to confiscate the boats and was forced to
give them back. Earlier this week, Kociu was dismissed, reportedly
as a result of the political controversy surrounding the smuggling
rings.
</P>
<P>
   Italian officials have tried to pick up the slack, installing an
operations center on a small island off the coast of Vlore. And yet
there seems to be little anyone can do in and around the refugee
camps where Kosovars tell stories of having been solicited. In
Durras, refugees at an Italian camp were told they could flee to
Italy at a price of $350 each, according to Veli Raduni, 23, a
waiter from Djakovica, who said he declined. In Tirana, Valdet
Nila, 35, of Pec, told a similar story, saying a man found him near
a refugee camp two weeks ago and said, ``You need a skaf.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I'm here. Here's my number,' '' Nila said. ``But I
said, I don't need the number because I don't need to go. I need to
go back to my home in Kosovo.''

   LITTLETON, Colo. _ If there was a sadder sound than the mournful
wail of a lone bagpiper in the Light of the World church Wednesday,
surely it was the quiet sobs of traumatized children mingling with
the notes of ``Amazing Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   They came by the hundreds to this Roman Catholic church a
half-mile west of the carnage at Columbine High School. They came
as much to purge themselves as to pray.
</P>
<P>
   In their baggy blue jeans and khaki cargo pants, they filled the
pews with pain as tangible as their tears.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver archbishop offered words of faith. The Colorado
governor offered words of comfort. But it was not until the priest
invited the students themselves to speak that they found solace in
one another. One by one they walked tentatively to the lectern to
bear witness to the terror they had seen and heard in the corridors
and classrooms of their suburban high school.
</P>
<P>
   Their voices thick with grief and exhaustion, teenagers who on
another April afternoon might have been discussing prom dresses and
graduation parties, stood up to speak of death and blood, gratitude
and guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got up for school Wednesday, I wondered what I would
wear, whether I'd be hip to the ladies,'' said one young man who
later that day spent three hours cowering with 50 classmates in a
locked classroom. ``When you are listening to your friends being
shot, you find out quick what's important _ God, family, your
friends. I called my parents from my cell phone and I didn't know
if I would ever see them again. I wanted to tell them `I love you.'
''
</P>
<P>
   A student whose best friend died in the hail of gunfire told the
congregation that, in her mind's eye, she can see her lost
classmate smiling down from heaven. ``I know she would tell you
that heaven is beautiful, that our life here is just a little time
compared with eternity. Yes, it does hurt. I know that life seems
unbearable know. But I see her in heaven, saying, `Don't give up.'
She knows it's hard for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how hard was evident on the tear-streaked face of Eddie
Olsen, a senior and star athlete at Columbine. He told his
classmates he may never get over the guilt he feels, simply for
surviving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember running out of school to the sound of blasts going
off in the halls and screams coming from the library. Innocent
people died because they were trying to kill people like me,'' he
said, referring to Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, who are
said to have targeted their rage at popular athletes and the few
minorities among the 1,800-member student body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry. I'm sorry I ran out of the building when I was
being targeted.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling with a different sort of guilt were two high school
girls who counted themselves informal members of the Trench Coat
Mafia, the collection of misfits from which the gunmen sprang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, please, don't blame us,'' one girl named Nicole begged
her classmates. ``We didn't see any signs of this. We are so sorry
our friends did this to all of us. We had no clue this was going to
happen. To us, they were cotton-fuzzy, the sweetest guys in the
world. I would never have thought they could have done this.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither could 16-year-old Eric Veik. He met Harris and Klebold
last semester in a video production class. They wrote a screenplay
and acted in what Veik described as an ``action video,'' which Veik
turned over to police Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you looked at the video carefully, maybe there were some
subtle hints,'' he said. ``But the video can't explain anything.
Can't give us a motive. These guys weren't violent, but there was
always this physical tension toward other people. This spring one
of them said to me, it's time to plan a senior prank. I didn't
consider it to be any kind of threat,'' he said, choking back sobs.
``I thought they were just two normal people in school who wanted
to dress their own way and be individualists. They often walked
around as if they were macho guys. Everyone in the halls always got
out of their way.''
</P>
<P>
   Not always.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, 12 students and one teacher at Columbine High School
did not have that chance.

NO FEAR OF ROAD RAGE ON THIS LONG COMMUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Somewhere, about an hour south of Kansas City,
Mo., daughters and sons of some 45 American daddies got shut out of
``Take Your Daughter (or Son) to Work Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other prohibitions, the dads have just too long of a
commute: 15 hours one-way to the skies above the Republic of
Yugoslavia; 15 hours straight back.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the expense. Each time one of the dads goes to
work, it costs the taxpayers of the United States about $441,000.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the seating problem.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the dads commute in a $2.2 billion jet plane, the
B-2 stealth bomber, there are only two seats: one each for two
pilots. If a daughter or son would be willing to ride in the cargo
hold (and if Mom would allow it), there still would be no room:
Every B-2 is stuffed to the gills with a dozen 2,000-ton bombs,
nicknamed ``bunker busters.''
</P>
<P>
   One nice thing though: The long-commuting dads are away from
home only one night. Because they never land their B-2s during a
mission (jet gasoline tankers fill 'em up in mid-air), they can
leave on a Monday morning, drop their bunker busters on Yugoslavia
and be back home by Tuesday to take in a daughter's ball game or a
son's school play.
</P>
<P>
   The above scenario may sound like a sequel to Stanley Kubrick's
1964 tour de force, ``Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned To Stop
Worrying and Love the Bomb,'' but it is merely a slice of modern
American life.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, not in the late Mr. Kubrick's fantasies, almost four
dozen U.S. Air Force pilots _ most married with children _ commute
via B-2 from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri to the ether above
the Balkans. In a chilling story by Thomas E. Ricks in the Wall
Street Journal, several unnamed pilots and their wives talked about
how ``weird'' and ``surreal'' it is to operate under such
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   One wife, whose pilot husband's birthday coincided with his
first combat commute to Yugoslavia, put a piece of celebratory cake
in the lunch she packed for him. Without a hitch, he made it home
the next day in time to see their son score his first-ever goal in
a soccer game. The wife allowed as how the experience was ``very
strange _ to drop bombs and then come home and watch my son's
soccer game.''
</P>
<P>
   A pilot who returned from his first mission to a kiss and the
command to ``mow the lawn,'' described his home-gathered K-rations.
</P>
<P>
   On the 30-hour mission, he ``went through two gallons of water,
a liter of Mountain Dew, half a bag of nachos, some chocolate.''
</P>
<P>
   Other pilots protein-load for their missions on the
``traditional `bomber dogs' _ hot dogs and chili _ warmed with the
heater just behind the second pilot's seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all that long ago (the Persian Gulf War), U.S. bomber pilots
did not commute to combat. They were stationed for months on end in
the Indian Ocean. But that was before the B-2 saw bona fide action.
So advanced is the plane, the Air Force prefers to keep all of them
based at Whiteman; it's easier, and the security is better.
</P>
<P>
   So now, instead of fleeting phone calls, the wives of the B-2
pilots are telephoned in Missouri by Air Force personnel as soon as
their husbands have completed their bombing runs, are out of harm's
way and are headed for home.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots interviewed by Ricks said they did not take their
missions lightly. Just because they are allowed to live at home,
they said, did not make the combat runs ``antiseptic flyovers.''
</P>
<P>
   With technology this clean and efficient, however, who can rule
out a future in which even B-2 stealth bomber pilots participate in
Take Your Daughter (or Son) to Work Day? The kids would just love
those chili dogs.

`CLIFFIES' LOOK BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They wore their hair in deliberate curls, high buns, and severe
parts. Black collars hid their pale necks, and stiff pleats flowed
like tents around their ankles.
</P>
<P>
   As 21 women from the Harvard Annex class of 1882 posed modestly,
the faint grains of a black-and-white portrait trapped them in
photographic amber. But the folded hands and lowered eyes disguised
the movement these women were spurring.
</P>
<P>
   It was an experiment that unleashed revolution inside the
nation's premier university: an independent women's college with
Harvard professors as its faculty. In a few years, Radcliffe
reached a level of excellence other women's colleges struggled to
match.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Adam's rib of its more powerful brother, Radcliffe
found itself in a constant push-pull bind with Harvard _ banned
from its campus, dependent on its faculty, obscured by its global
footprint.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle ended Tuesday, when Harvard announced it would
absorb Radcliffe and dissolve it as a separate college. The
Radcliffe name will remain as an ``institute,'' but it will give up
what few remaining holds it has on undergraduate life for women at
Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Radcliffe students are in a great state of shock,'' Maya
Sen, a junior and treasurer of the Radcliffe Union of Students,
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tension over fund raising and real estate forced the change, in
part. But by making good on its century-old mission _ access to
Harvard for women _ Radcliffe also helped bring about its undoing.
</P>
<P>
   Graduates from decades past say something important will be lost
now that Radcliffe exists only as an institute. Future students,
they say, will never know the all-female bonds that grew out of
exclusion, or have the independent pulpit that once meant as much
to Radcliffe students as the privileges Harvard denied them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my day, we gathered at Agassiz theater for all kinds of
plays and songs, and we never thought about Harvard,'' said Alice
Johnson Brown of Chesterfield, Mo., who graduated in 1925.
</P>
<P>
   Why? ``Because Harvard just wasn't that important to us. Sure,
we'd go over to Harvard Yard to meet boys for dates. But in those
days, we did not lean on Harvard as undergraduates.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, only alumnae of a fading era will remember Radcliffe as it
was at its moment of greatest independence. It was a segregated
world of curfews and gloved hands, but also one where student
government presidents, drama directors, newspaper editors, and band
leaders were women.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Radcliffe girl carries feminism and feminity in almost
equal balance. It's enough to upset anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   _a Harvard professor to an interviewer, 1951
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the benign sentiments of Radcliffe's founding ladies _
who never wanted coeducation, only the chance to mold pupils into
enlightened wives and mothers _ turmoil has rocked Radcliffe
throughout its history.
</P>
<P>
   Once the ``annex maidens'' proved they could match the men grade
for grade, Radcliffe found itself in an awkward position: forced to
choose between protesting inequality and quietly pushing forward
the goal of higher education for women.
</P>
<P>
   In that balancing act, it carried a burden no other womens'
college shared: a never-ending obligation to please the country's
most prestigious university.
</P>
<P>
   ``Radcliffe was always careful to keep Harvard happy with them,
so that as an institution, it ended up being very conservative,''
said Dorothy Howells, 1960 graduate and author of ``A Century to
Celebrate: Radcliffe College, 1879-1979.'' ``There were political
issues the college just shouldn't get into. It was seen as
unlady-like.''
</P>
<P>
   That caution extended to the outside world, making for an odd
contradiction. Reluctant to offend its powerful older brother and
rock their delicate arrangement, Radcliffe's managers towed a
conservative line against some of the very social movements being
pushed by its more radical alumnae.
</P>
<P>
   Like almost every other womens' college at the turn of the
century, Radcliffe opposed women's suffrage. But it nurtured
genteel defiance in women such as Maud Wood Park, the first
president of the League of Women Voters. Dressed in white linen and
a wide-brimmed hat, the 1898 alumna stood over a leather chair
inside the House of Representatives as congressmen signed a woman's
right to vote into law in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   By 1930, Radcliffe had produced a pioneering suffragist and a
founding member of the NAACP. In the next 40 years, it would
graduate a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet, a member of Congress, and a
prime minister of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   But whether its students tapped softly against closed doors or
barreled headlong into them, they always found their way back to
Radcliffe Yard, a campus that began as an appendage but emerged as
a full-fledged community, where women were the best athletes and
the brightest thinkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a company of women, and starting after World War I, it
really came into its own identity,'' Howells said. ``The doors to
Harvard were shut, and what do you do when the door is shut? You
develop your own community. And as that community developed, women
developed a strong allegiance to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth ``Bucky'' Helman, class of 1943, said the Radcliffe she
remembered handed down strict rules on chaperones (no lenient older
brothers) and forbade pants (they broke the rule once, allowing ski
pants during a brutal storm).
</P>
<P>
   But it was also a place where women took on the male roles in
Greek plays, operated their own radio station, and led their own
choral society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Radcliffe Yard was jumping,'' Helman said. ``I mean, it's a
serene place now, but back then, there were students spilling out
all over the lawns . . . We felt we had the capability of doing
whatever we wanted to do. We were encouraged in this, and we would
attack things.''
</P>
<P>
   When Helman was a student, war had pushed women to hold on to
the jobs men had left in order to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Mirroring that struggle, Harvard was flirting with coeducation.
By 1943, Harvard opened all courses to women and moved toward more
merging of the two schools. But Helman was already making daily
treks to Harvard Yard, having negotiated her way into a previously
all-male, graduate biology class.
</P>
<P>
   Though she and other women excelled in those courses, Harvard
still did not grant them equal status on many fronts. While men
freely roamed the stacks of Widener Library, Helman and her
classmates were confined to a single room. To retrieve a book, they
had to hand a slip to a male ``runner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``God knows what they thought we were going to do to those men
on our way to the card catalog,'' said Helman, former president and
trustee of the Radcliffe Alumnae Association. ``The bottom line
was, we had to wait longer for books.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Howells was a senior, in 1960, the contradictions
were more flagrant. Classes were fully coed, and women were allowed
to enter Widener. But they were not allowed to use the newer Lamont
Library. Suddenly, the movement to fully infiltrate Harvard was on.
</P>
<P>
   But with every push, the bonds Radcliffe graduates had forged
with each other over generations loosened.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Phyllis Lugger entered Harvard College in 1972, one of the
first orientation meetings she attended was sponsored by Radcliffe
College. Nervous as they began their freshman year, Lugger said,
the gathering of women without men seemed even more awkward, almost
unnatural.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave us a Radcliffe mug and talked about maintaining our
Radcliffe identity,'' said Lugger, now an astronomy professor at
the University of Indiana. ``But for the women that I knew, I don't
think there ever was a bond to Radcliffe as an institution. We
didn't want there to be any difference between us and the men. We
wanted to be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time of the student protests in the 1960s and '70s, men
and women at Harvard were much more the same than they had ever
been. From sit-ins at Harvard Yard to invasions of Radcliffe
offices, the war between men and women gave way to wars between
students and administrations. And most of the women who arrived on
Harvard's campus had not sought out a Radcliffe identity, yet found
themselves bound by the rules of an archaic charter _ the
transcripts they sent to graduate schools still said ``Radcliffe,''
not ``Harvard.''
</P>
<P>
   Female students seemed ready to shed their Radcliffe ties and
fight their battles at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the gender battles that continue to rage at
Harvard are subtler than those of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Conflicts over diversity and the lack of tenured female faculty
still plague the school; some say the conflicts have discouraged
women from pursuing certain fields. But almost all agree the merger
that Radcliffe in part brought about has closed the door on an era
of male domination at the university.
</P>
<P>
   Now, alumnae say, Radcliffe faces a challenge as tough as its
pioneering mission of education for women excluded from Harvard: to
stay relevant as a resource for Harvard women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Radcliffe hasn't been a college in a really, really long
time,'' said Lugger. ``The most important thing it can do right now
is to keep building on its incredible network of women, and help
the young women who continue to seek it out.''

THE SEEDY SIDE OF GARDENING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dee Dee, our all-purpose advice columnist, is shocked by the
results of a survey conducted by a British gardening magazine. It
revealed that one in four women prefers gardening to sex.
</P>
<P>
   Only one in four? Is it possible? Dee Dee would have guessed it
was more like three out of four. Because everywhere she turns all
anybody talks about is gardening, gardening, gardening.
</P>
<P>
   It seems like only Wednesday that all anybody talked about was
sex, sex, sex. Maybe it was only Wednesday because, as the contents
of Dee Dee's mailbag indicate, sex and gardening raise similar
issues. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dear Dee Dee:
</P>
<P>
   My husband has given me an ultimatum. I must choose between him
and my compost heap. He says I lavish all my attention on my
compost at the expense of his needs. I have tried to cut back on
composting, but compost requires constant attention. Like
lovemaking, it cannot be rushed.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any way to save my compost and my marriage?
</P>
<P>
   SuperHot, Sharp Sand, R.I. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ask yourself: Do I really want to spend my life with a man who
doesn't understand my compost? Dee Dee thinks the answer is
obvious. However, if you feel you must try to salvage the marriage,
Dee Dee advises you to read ``The Joy of Compost'' together. This
may help him see that his needs, and yours, too, must come second
to your compost's. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dear Dee Dee:
</P>
<P>
   My boyfriend wants me to share my garden fantasies. I feel it is
far too soon. We have known each other only two years. Last night,
in bed, he asked me to describe my preferences in ornamental
shrubbery in more detail than I thought appropriate. I told him I
wasn't ready.
</P>
<P>
   He says that unless I am willing to share my most intimate
horticultural thoughts, our relationship is doomed. What should I
do?
</P>
<P>
   Shrinking Violet, Dormant, Vt. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tell your boyfriend in no uncertain terms that you are saving
your garden fantasies for marriage. If he refuses to accept that,
it's best to end the relationship now before you do something you
may regret. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dear Dee Dee:
</P>
<P>
   Believe me when I tell you that I never meant to stray. But I
wasn't getting the satisfaction I needed at home, so I foolishly
became involved in a neighbor's garden. I began spending more and
more time in her prize-winning perennial beds, at the expense of my
own modest plot.
</P>
<P>
   That's all behind me now. But my wife says she can't trust me
and has forbidden me to set foot in our garden. The grounds are
looking seedy and the children are beginning to ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   Faithless, East Ragwort, Mass. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dee Dee thinks you're being too hard on yourself. Your wife
needs to see a therapist who specializes in horticultural issues to
help her work through her unreasonable jealousy. As for the
children, it's never too early to learn the facts of gardening
life. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dear Dee Dee:
</P>
<P>
   My wife feels uncomfortable experimenting with anything even
slightly out of the ordinary, so I have had to put my plans for a
water garden on hold. She says she feels ``uncomfortable'' with the
idea of turning our back yard into a half-acre pond complete with
waterlilies, ducks, frogs, islands, ornamental fountains, schools
of koi, canoes, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Is she narrow-minded? Or am I asking too much?
</P>
<P>
   Submerged, Poxweed, N.H. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dee Dee thinks it's no wonder almost one in two marriages ends
in divorce. Remind her that she pledged herself to you for better
or for worse, and that Dee Dee says ``worse'' includes a water
garden.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

DECIPHERING THE HEART SYMBOL ON FOOD

<P>
   Q: What does the American Heart Association logo mean on food?
</P>
<P>
   A: A food packaging that carries the logo _ a red heart with a
white check mark _ means the food has no more than 3 grams of fat
per serving, 20 milligrams of cholesterol and 480 milligrams of
sodium. The food must also contain at least 10 percent of the daily
value for one or more of the following nutrients: protein, vitamin
A, vitamin C, calcium, iron, or dietary fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Products that carry the logo aren't necessarily better than
products without it, according to Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many cups of cooked barley does one cup of uncooked make?
</P>
<P>
   A: One cup of uncooked barley yields three cups of cooked
barley. Can't eat that much all at once? Store the unused cooked
barley in an airtight container and refrigerate. It will keep for a
week.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELMONT, Mass. _ A large scythe leans against the wall in the
far corner of his office, just as a bat once rested against the
back of his locker.
</P>
<P>
   The former has replaced the latter in his arsenal, but his
current teammates needn't fear for their safety. Dale Murphy does
not wield this implement as he once did a Louisville Slugger while
winning two consecutive National League Most Valuable Player awards
and clubbing 398 home runs during a 14-year career from which he
emerged as a borderline Hall of Fame candidate. The scythe is
purely symbolic. ``It's the analogy of harvesting souls,'' says
Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   He is responsible for an extensive crop in his latest line of
work _ volunteer work, that is. Like all but a handful of others
who serve the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints,
popularly known as Mormons, Murphy receives no compensation in his
role as president of the Boston Mission. During his three-year
tour, which began in July 1997, he gets a house, a car, a food
allowance, and a dizzying array of duties. ``This is the most
challenging thing I've ever done,'' says Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   So pardon the mess. Sifting through the clutter on his desk in
the corner office of an eight-room downtown suite that houses the
Boston Mission's administration, Murphy laughs and says, ``It looks
like my locker. My teammates would be quite familiar with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they probably wouldn't. The few vestiges of baseball _
a Norman Rockwell illustration of some kids engaged in a sandlot
dialogue; a couple of plastic figurines from a birthday cake; a bat
from Cooperstown sent by a friend _ are overwhelmed by the
trappings of his calling. Behind his chair is a large portrait of
Christ. A Bible sits atop his slide drawer. His desk is piled with
reports and Mormon literature and little colored pieces of sticky
paper that facilitate his major undertaking: overseeing 209
missionaries throughout Massachusetts and parts of New Hampshire,
Rhode Island, Vermont, and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like the supervisor,'' says Murphy, 43. ``I help, I train,
I educate, I see how they're doing. We help find them apartments
and provide them cars.''
</P>
<P>
   He readily acknowledges that he is far afield from his career as
an All-Star, Gold Glove outfielder spent primarily with the Atlanta
Braves before brief end-of-the-line stops in Philadelphia and
Colorado. He likens it to facing Nolan Ryan every day, and a look
at the wall across from his desk bears this out. It resembles a
strategic map in a war room, except that this one is dotted with
small pictures of each missionary in Murphy's jurisdiction. They
are placed under headings that identify their territories; each
photo is accompanied by an index card listing hometown, age, and
other pertinent background information, along with a slip of
stick-'em paper indicating months of service.
</P>
<P>
   These missionaries _ mostly young men and women, with a
sprinkling of couples whose children have grown or who have no
children _ are charged with spreading the word of God as revealed
to church founder Joseph Smith in the 1820s and contained in the
Book of Mormon, subtitled, ``Another Testament of Jesus Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bible is part of our canonized Scripture,'' says Murphy,
``and we believe in something more. We believe that God the Father
came to Joseph Smith and said the true church of Christ was not on
Earth at the time, that it had been gone roughly since the deaths
of the apostles.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the strongly committed need apply. The typical missionary's
day begins at 6:30 a.m. and includes two hours of religious study
followed by 12 hours of proselytizing in pairs _ until 9:30 each
night _ with lights out at 10:30. During their terms, missionaries
cannot watch television, read newspapers and magazines, listen to
popular music, or date. They receive no compensation; in fact, they
are required to provide $375 monthly toward expenses.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the missionary term is two years for men, 1 1/2 for
women, and no one is allowed a second tour of duty. ``It's so
rigorous,'' says Murphy. ``It's very challenging. The challenge is
to find people receptive to the message of who we are: Christian,
family-oriented, service-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is no shortage of applicants, culled from a church
membership numbering some 10 million worldwide. The popular
perception is that the Mormon stronghold is Salt Lake City, and the
church indeed is headquartered there. But Murphy points out that
less than half the Utah capital's population is now Mormon (perhaps
they've been displaced by International Olympic Committee members),
and more than 50 percent of the church's constituency is outside
the United States. That's one reason the Book of Mormon can be
found in 42 languages, from Albanian to Zulu, in one of the Boston
Mission's offices.
</P>
<P>
   There are some 300 missions, some 60,000 missionaries, and
Murphy has noticed a transformation among those in his purview.
``When they start, they're out of their comfort zone,'' he says.
``But from a reluctance to being here, they go through a change,
and eventually, they're reluctant to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   That easily could describe Murphy's Mormon journey.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Portland, Ore., and raised in the Presbyterian
faith. He considered his parents extremely spiritual; as for
himself, ``growing up, I had a few (religious) thoughts. When I was
18 or 19, I started having a few more.''
</P>
<P>
   He found a receptive audience in Barry Bonnell, a future major
league journeyman outfielder who was his teammate with the Braves'
Single A affiliate at Greenwood, S.C., in 1975. Bonnell was married
and a Mormon, but he struck up a lasting friendship with the
19-year-old prospect.

PUTTS USUALLY THE DIFFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes memorable putts sidebar)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL HARBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How many of us have stood over a simple 3-foot putt, a $5 Nassau
on the line? All that has to be done is to roll the ball in, but
you stare at the ball and dart your eyes to the cup, which seems to
be shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   You back away, look at it from one side, then the other. You
walk behind the hole and check it out for a second time. You grit
your teeth. You begin to kick yourself for not getting the first
putt closer to the hole, in gimme range.
</P>
<P>
   Then you can feel the dagger-like stare of your partner piercing
your back. You won't look him in the eye. You won't look at your
opponents, either. You just know they are smiling, believing there
is no way you are going to sink this putt.
</P>
<P>
   If you make it, all those weak irons, pop-up drives, and stubbed
chips are forgiven. If you miss it, you figure you wasted four
hours on a beautiful Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you stand over the putt. You pick your line, take a
deep breath, pull back the putter, and strike the ball. It rolls,
and . . .
</P>
<P>
   Do you sink the putt? Sometimes you do and sometimes you don't.
</P>
<P>
   There are a thousand reasons why you may have missed it. Average
weekend hackers make a little more than half of the 3-footers they
face. PGA Tour pros sink 95 percent of their 3-footers.
</P>
<P>
   But that means PGA Tour pros, the best players in the world,
miss 5 percent of their 3-footers, a statistic that almost seems
inconceivable given their talent.
</P>
<P>
   Putts are either the bane or the salvation of every golfer
because, as Billy Casper once said, ``There are two kinds of
putters, those who find a way to miss it and those who find a way
to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's like style. Either you have it or you don't. Although there
are no born putters, there are plenty of golfers who seem to have a
knack for knocking in putts when it matters. Putting theories are
similar to one of those philosophical debates, such as how many
angels can fit on the top of a pin. There is no right answer or
wrong answer. Putting is an abstract. Some will argue that it is an
art _ a black art. Others believe it is a science that can be
quantified and analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, putting is also the most important part of the
game. There are several ways to move the ball down the fairway to
the green. Just look at all the different swings that work, from
Jim Furyk's to Tiger Woods's.
</P>
<P>
   But once you get to the green, it is an entirely different game.
</P>
<P>
   Perfectionist Ben Hogan was blunt about it. He said putting
simply was not golf. Sam Snead said as much when he attempted to
use a croquet-type stroke that the US Golf Association quickly
outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   More putters are broken in anger than any other club in the bag.
However, those who putted well, like the late Bobby Jones, and Ben
Crenshaw in his prime, humanized the flat stick by giving it a name
like Calamity Jane or Little Ben. But many abuse the putter. Ky
Laffon, a colorful Depression-era professional, often punished his
putter by dragging it along the highway while driving from one tour
stop to another.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Palmer has gone through more putters than Imelda Marcos
has had shoes. He has a garage full at his Florida home. If Palmer
ran through putters, Johnny Miller has taken another route. He has
tried countless putting stances and strokes over his career. During
the 1973 Hawaiian Open, he was paired with Jack Nicklaus and
noticed the Golden Bear's stroke. Nicklaus had his right elbow way
out. Miller tried it ``and the floodgates opened.'' In 1973 Miller
won the US Open, shooting a record-breaking 63 at Oakmont. The
following year he adopted another putting routine and won eight
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest putting tip can turn around your game, and such
enlightenment can come from anywhere. Kenny Knox set a PGA Tour
record by taking just 93 putts during the 72-hole Heritage Classic
on Hilton Head Island, S.C., in 1989. He credited his amateur
partners from the Wednesday pro-am, telling the media: ``In trying
to ascertain why these high handicappers pushed and pulled their
putts, I noticed that they lifted their heads just before impact.
That head movement led to body movement, which in turn caused the
putter head to stray.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus picked up a putting tip while watching television in
the clubhouse after his final round at the 1966 Masters when he
tied Gay Brewer and Tommy Jacobs after 72 holes. ``My putting
ranged from average to awful all week and I'm just about to leave
the clubhouse and work on it,'' Nicklaus told the press. ``CBS was
replaying the 17th hole, where I missed the cup entirely from 3 1/2
feet, and I saw that I was moving my head at impact.'' Nicklaus
literally ran out to the practice green and resolved his putting
problems. The following day he won the 18-hole playoff.
</P>
<P>
   As important as putting is, one rarely sees amateurs work on
their strokes.
</P>
<P>
   They will invest time and money on the driving range, hitting
countless buckets of balls and taking lessons from professionals so
that they might hit it 10 yards farther off the tee.
</P>
<P>
   But they spend just a few minutes on the putting green as they
wait for the foursome ahead to vacate the first tee.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that 43 percent of all the shots on the PGA and LPGA
tours are putts. If a professional shoots 70, he takes about 30
putts a round. As for amateurs, if they shoot 85, they average
around 35 putts, and if they shoot 95, they take about 38. If you
can putt like a professional, that would knock more strokes off
your score than 10 extra yards off the tee.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``Putt Like The Pros,'' Dave Pelz quantified how
well the players on the LPGA and PGA Tours putt. For example, pros
make 95 percent of 3-footers, but the numbers quickly drop off.
They make only 50 percent of 6-footers; 30 percent of 10-footers;
20 percent of 15-footers; 12 percent of 20-footers; 10 percent of
25-footers; and 7 percent of 30-footers.
</P>
<P>
   Putting simply wins tournaments. When Woods won the Masters by
12 strokes in 1997, he was the only competitor to survive all 72
holes without a three-putt. This year he was nowhere to be found.
He took 126 putts, second most (to Vijay Singh's 127).
</P>
<P>
   There is no right way or wrong way to putt. But practice is a
key.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus and local favorite Brad Faxon are among pros who have
had artificial putting greens installed in their backyards. Both of
their practice putting areas were built by Form Technology/Symmetry
Products of Lincoln, R.I., which is one of the world's largest
artificial putting green companies. Besides providing backyard
systems for avid putters, they have built million-dollar miniature
golf putting surfaces on luxury ocean liners, such as the Royal
Caribbean and the Princess Cruise Lines.
</P>
<P>
   Good swing thoughts are vital. The late Harvey Penick in his
``Little Red Book,'' suggested that one concentrate on the line on
short putts, but on long putts, one should concentrate on distance.
Penick suggested that the putter be carried in your left hand (if
you are a righthander) for feel, because the arm is an extension of
the putter shaft.
</P>
<P>
   Penick said to never allow yourself to think about what is
riding on the putt, whether it is a major championship or a $2
Nassau. Fuzzy Zoeller agrees, saying the biggest obstacle keeping
amateurs from being good putters is fear, especially when there is
something on the line. Timid putts usually are missed.
</P>
<P>
   When Tom Kite left for the PGA Tour, Penick gave him a final
word of advice. ``Go to dinner with good putters.'' The reason?
Good putters talk about what putts they are going to make, or great
putts they have made. Bad putters complain about the tough
conditions and say there are some putts that are impossible to
sink. It is a matter of attitude.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
RECORD PUTTS . . . THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some putts have been defining moments in the history of golf.
Jack Nicklaus's birdie putt on No. 17 at Augusta National set up
his Masters victory in 1986. Crenshaw drained a 60-footer on the
10th hole at the Masters that sparked his ride to victory in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   There are putts that lose championships as well. Scott Hoch
never will live down the 18-inch putt he missed on the first
playoff hole that cost him the Masters in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Shorter putts have been missed. Bruce Lietzke tried to backhand
a 2-inch putt at Colonial and semi-whiffed. This gaffe cost him a
playoff berth. Hale Irwin tried to backhand a 1-inch putt in the
third round of the 1983 British Open and missed. He finished one
stroke behind eventual champion Tom Watson at Royal Birkdale. Andy
Bean could have won the 1983 Canadian Open, but he tapped in a
2-inch putt with the grip end of his putter and was assessed a
two-stroke penalty. He missed getting into a playoff by two
strokes.
</P>
<P>
   The longest putt ever sunk in competition, according to Golf
Digest, is 140 feet. It was drained on the 18th green of the Old
Course at Saint Andrews, Scotland, during the International
Four-Ball Pro-Am in 1976. Nick Faldo holed out the longest putt in
the history of the Masters, when he won the tournament in 1989.
Faldo sunk a 100-footer for a birdie-4 on the second hole during
the third round. This feat bettered Cary Middlecoff's record eagle
putt at the 13th hole of Augusta National in 1955. He also won the
tournament that year.
</P>
<P>
   The longest putt in PGA Tour history was a 110-footer made by
Nicklaus in the 1964 Tournament of Champions at the final hole at
the Desert Inn CC in Las Vegas. It gave him a two-shot victory over
Doug Sanders and Al Geiberger, who were standing by hoping Nicklaus
would three-putt and extend the tournament to a playoff.

GOOD SALADS DON'T HAVE TO BE GREEN AND LEAFY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no law that says salads have to contain leafy greens.
And in addition to tuna, chicken and potatoes, there's a whole host
of foods you can use as the basis for a good salad. Not the least
of which is grains.
</P>
<P>
   Start with a package of long grain and wild rice pilaf, toss in
a few colorful and flavorful additions such as nuts, raw vegetables
and cheeses, then bind the dish with dressing for a salad good
enough to be a lunch entree or dinner side dish.
</P>
<P>
   But don't limit yourself to rice. Wheat berries, quinoa, barley
and amaranth are also perfectly good salad starters. If you want,
you can even combine grains. A supermarket down south sells a salad
made of long-grain and wild rice mixed with wheat berries. It's
flavored with almonds, dried cranberries and orange peel for a
crunchy, nutty, zesty mixture.
</P>
<P>
   The keys to a successful grain salad are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pre-mixed grains, such as rice pilaf mixes, usually cook
faster and more consistently than if you buy the different grains
individually.
</P>
<P>
   _ If using a rice pilaf or other grain mix, try to find one
where the seasonings are package separately from the grain. This
way, you can control what kind and how much seasoning is in the
salad.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vary the texture of the ingredients. Since most grains cook up
relatively soft, mix in some crisp ingredients such as raw bell
peppers, grated carrots, minced celery or nuts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make it colorful. The more colors in your salad, the more
nutrients you'll be including. For orange or red; add bell peppers,
chile peppers, carrots, dried cranberries, dried apricots, orange
sections, melons, mangoes or tomatoes. For yellow, add corn kernels
or bell pepper. For green; add scallions, green beans, snow peas,
parsley, bell peppers or jalapenos.
</P>
<P>
   _ Toast nuts to bring out their flavor. Simply place a nonstick
skillet on the burner over medium heat. When pan is hot, add nuts
and toast, shaking occasionally for a few minutes until the nuts
begin to give up their aroma and turn darker.
</P>
<P>
   _ Add heavily flavored cheeses such as crumbled blue or feta.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use oil and vinegar based dressings _ either bottled or
homemade _ instead of creamy dressings. Experiment with flavored
vinegars such as berry or tarragon vinegars to complement the
ingredients or substitute fruit juice for half the vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   _ Combine the ingredients while the grain is still warm but only
mix in half the dressing. Just cooked grains will absorb more
dressing than cold grains. Reserve part of the dressing to add
fresh flavor just before serving.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chill for several hours to allow the flavors to marry but let
sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before serving for best
flavor.
</P>

PLUGGING INTO THE SUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As birthdays go, the 29th lacks the glamor that goes with a
number ending in zero. But for Denis Hayes, who has been nurturing
Earth Day since its inception in 1970, this year's anniversary has
been commandeered as the launching pad for a really big event next
year, one replete with zeros. Hayes wants Earth Day 1999 dedicated
to a national goal of deriving a quarter of the nation's energy
needs from the sun. It is a worthy ambition.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, president of Earth Day Network, wants to make the country
_ and the world _ more aware of the burdens rich industrialized
nations place on a fragile and changing environment.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the problem is the ominous certainty of global
warming, for which there is, in Hayes's words, ``overwhelming
evidence.'' That makes it imperative to stop the steady release of
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes's pragmatic approach deserves careful attention. His
specific objective is a reduction of the cost of photovoltaic
energy _ produced when sunlight is converted to electric current _
by two-thirds of its present level of $5 a watt. That can be
achieved, he contends, by a subsidy program that would increase
demand and add to productive capacity. Economies of scale, he says,
would lower costs to levels no longer requiring subsidies, making
it possible to reach the target of replacing a quarter of
carbon-based fuels by the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
   This is a sensible approach that would not lower anyone's
standard of living or even rule out continuing use of fossil fuels.
America is the appropriate leader to undo some of the collateral
damage from its consumption practices. The United States, with
about 4.5 percent of world population, consumes 25 percent of the
world's oil and is a similar glutton with other resources. Earth
Day is the time to focus on changing that.

CARNAGE AT COLUMBINE HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The horror in Colorado tells the tale of two high school
students waging a private war against their world. It focuses the
country inward to what it holds most dear _ its children.
</P>
<P>
   This week and possibly for many weeks to come, the searing
hometown tragedy in Columbine High School will take precedence over
far-off international battles as Americans analyze the eruption of
a comparatively small-scale yet devastating hatred and seek to
explain and prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the bloodshed in Littleton, Colo., where more than
three-dozen people were killed or wounded Tuesday, repeats recent
history. It was the eighth school shooting rampage by young males
in the United States since 1997. The peaceful town near Denver now
shares the continuing grief of Fayetteville, Tenn.; Jonesboro,
Ark.; Springfield, Ore.; Edinboro, Penn.; West Paducah, Ky.; Pearl,
Miss.; and Bethel, Alaska _ as well as Dunblane, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1996 Dunblane massacre of 16 elementary school
children and their teacher, the British government swiftly banned
handguns of .22 caliber or more and set 10-year jail sentences for
anyone caught owning one. But the United States _ with its active
gun lobby, easy access to firearms by just about anyone of any age,
and the continual celebration of violence by the entertainment
industry _ shows no such resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and parents also keep missing the warning signals. The
young Colorado killers were part of a group called the Trench Coat
Mafia, whose members voiced neo-Nazi views. They boasted about
having weapons but were ridiculed by many students. Adults should
have noticed and intervened long before Tuesday. But adults often
look the other way, either because they have too much on their
minds or because they fear appearing to be overly critical of their
children or someone else's.
</P>
<P>
   Better to speak up and take the heat from a rebellious teenager
or a defensive parent than to risk the eventual explosion of rage
into bloodshed. This emotional war zone demands the attention of
every community before there is gunfire. Asking ``What can we do
now?'' may prevent the anguish of ``Why us?''

 (s and a coding)  
 BELMONT, Mass.: ... 19-year-old prospect.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Riding on a godforsaken old school bus _ ``built for
sixth-graders,'' recalls Bonnell _ through sweltering Carolina
nights from one obscure outpost to another, Bonnell would read the
Book of Mormon, and curious teammates would approach him, asking
questions. Bonnell noticed that Murphy was a listener, though, not
a questioner. So one night he got on the bus after Murphy, sat next
to him, and began reading, illuminated by a fishing flashlight. He
and Murphy quickly struck up a dialogue, and the next morning at
the team's roach motel, Bonnell asked Murphy if e would like to
pursue the discussion with a couple of Mormon missionaries. The
answer was yes. The day after the season, Bonnell baptized Murphy
into the church.
</P>
<P>
   Mormons don't drink or smoke or curse, and Murphy acknowledges,
``I had to make some changes in my lifestyle,'' though he won't
elaborate. At any rate, it doesn't seem that a dramatic overhaul
was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd drink a beer every now and then before,'' says Bonnell,
``but Dale was never a runaround guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonnell recalls that Murphy's conversion occurred during a time
of Christian reawakening, athletes included, and that
``nondenominational Christianity became so big that it got to be
like a denomination. On Sundays, we'd hold services before the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Murphy is emphatic in dismissing the widespread
notion that religion and competition don't mix, that being devout
is at odds with being a winner. ``Competitiveness is not an
un-Christian thing,'' he says. ``You can be competitive and a good
sport. Maybe I wasn't outwardly emotional about the game _ I was
never one to show emotion just for the sake of showing emotion _
but believe me, if we lost, I'd kick the water cooler. If I had to
take a guy out at second, I'd take him out. If I'd been a pitcher,
I'd have knocked you down if I felt it was necessary. I tried to
have a level of intensity. You can't play without a fire burning
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   The proof was in the 1982 and '83 MVP Awards, the two NL home
run and RBI titles, the five 30-homer and 100-RBI seasons Murphy
accumulated while earning a reputation as one of the game's
courtliest gentlemen.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When he retired in 1993 after a couple of months with the
Rockies _ ``I figured that if I couldn't hit home runs in Denver, I
couldn't hit home runs, period'' _ Murphy was adrift. Despite
standing offers of an organizational job from the Braves, Phillies,
and Rockies, ``I kind of by design wanted to get away from
baseball,'' he says. He did some public speaking and endorsements,
spent a year in Atlanta, then moved with his wife, Nancy _ a native
of Utah and lifelong Mormon whom he'd met during a semester at
Brigham Young University in 1978 _ to the town of Alpine, between
Salt Lake City and Provo. While helping to raise seven sons and a
daughter who now range in age from 5 to 18, he was still casting
about for something he could immerse himself in when, as Murphy
recounts it, something almost mystical occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the mission presidents have three-year terms, about 100
become vacant every year,'' he says. ``Someone _ I have no idea who
_ nominated me. I went through the interview process, and one of
the 12 church leaders called and asked to see us. Nancy and I had
no idea what it was about.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his recruitment lacked the intrigue Murphy suspects.
Boyd K. Packer, a former Boston Mission president who now is
president of the 12 apostles (leaders), was the man who contacted
Murphy. ``We keep track of men as we travel around who have the
spirit and capacity to relate to young men in particular, who know
the gospel, and are stable in their professional and family
circumstances,'' explains Packer. ``Everybody knew Dale Murphy. It
was well known that he had served in callings for the church.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Murphys met with Packer and he told them Dale was under
consideration for a mission presidency, ``it was the most surprised
and honored Nancy and I had ever been,'' says Dale.
</P>
<P>
   His lack of a business background was not considered a
deterrent. ``We have mission presidents from all walks of life,''
says Packer.
</P>
<P>
   His fame could have been. ``Some celebrities are celebrities,''
says Packer. ``When Dale looks in the mirror, he doesn't see a
celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Until July 2000, when Murphy looks in the mirror, he will see
the president of the Boston Mission. After that, he's not sure.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His only connection with baseball now is as an assistant coach
on his 11-year-old son Travis's Little League team, the Red Sox.
``I'm in charge of hitting,'' he says. ``We'd better hit this year.
I've never felt such pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Murphy is a magnet on the diamond. The kids listen
raptly as he delivers the same message countless other coaches have
passed along to deaf ears. And when he provides individual
attention for a would-be slugger, the fathers gawk and elbow one
another: ``That's Dale Murphy.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't know whether he'll resume a professional affiliation
with the game; despite those standing offers, ``I don't know about
the fit.'' One thing he's sure about: His dream destination is
Cooperstown. This year, his first for Hall of Fame eligibility, he
received 96 of the 373 votes required for induction. ``I thought
about it a lot this year and I'll think about it a lot next year,''
he says. ``I think I have a chance. I have some borderline
statistics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonnell can envision a future in the church for Murphy as one of
the general authorities, ``although if you ask Dale, he'll deny it
because he's so humble. That's why he'd be perfect for the job.
What you see is exactly what he is _ a gentlemanly, wonderful
man.''

<P>
   Occasionally you find a recipe that's so easy, so flexible and
so universally devoured by everyone who tastes it that it becomes
THE recipe for all entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   In my house it's a teriyaki marinade my mother and I discovered
during a trip to Hawaii. And it's perfect for grilling, even when
it's still too chilly to dine outside.
</P>
<P>
   It's simple.
</P>
<P>
   Combine 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup bourbon (I'm not kidding), 2
cloves crushed garlic, 1 tablespoon grated gingerroot, 2
tablespoons brown sugar and a dash of dry mustard.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve 1/4 cup of the marinade and use the rest of the mixture
to marinate chicken, pork or a London broil for at least two but
not more than 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Grill the meat as you normally would, basting occasionally with
the reserved marinade. The chicken will be nicely browned, not
charred, if you cook it slowly for 45 minutes to an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the cooking time, throw some pineapple slices
on the grill and brush them with the marinade, too. Add a rice
pilaf and pretend you're in the islands for dinner.

COLORADO'S CARNAGE IS INEVITABLE IN OUR CULTURE OF VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   We have surrounded ourselves with violence. It is everywhere we
turn. It is in our music. It is on our televisions. It is in our
movies. It is on our video games. It is prominently featured in
print media and on popular Web sites. If it bleeds it leads, and it
leads because it sells.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.,
was not an aberration. It was and is a fact of modern American
life. Wednesday, the Associated Press published a list of school
shootings from the 1997-98 academic year. Add Littleton to this
reading of the roll:
</P>
<P>
   --In October 1997, a 16-year-old boy in Pearl, Miss., killed his
mother, then went to his high school and shot nine students.
</P>
<P>
   --In November of that same year, three students were murdered
and five more were wounded at Heath High School in Paducah, Ky. The
shooter was a 14-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   --In March 1998, four girls and a teacher were killed and 10
others wounded during a false fire alarm at a middle school in
Jonesboro, Ark. Two boys, ages 11 and 13, lurking in the nearby
woods, opened fire as students and teachers emerged into the kill
zone.
</P>
<P>
   --In May, two teenagers were killed and more than 20 people were
injured when a 15-year-old boy opened fire at a high school in
Springfield, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   This shooting spree overshadowed the murder of an 18-year-old
high school student, two days earlier, in Fayetville, Tenn. A
classmate killed him in the school's parking lot, just like that.
</P>
<P>
   What happened in Littleton this week and across the country last
year will happen again, somewhere in America, and soon. How can it
not?
</P>
<P>
   Ours is a culture that glorifies violence, profits from it,
sells it with the most advanced technology known to mankind.
Violence bounces off satellites in outer space and beams into every
American home, every hour of every day, every month of every year.
</P>
<P>
   A group called TV-Free America recently published a set of
statistics that describe what is really happening in our homes. The
data do not lie. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   Every week, the average American child between the ages of 2 and
11 watches 1,197 minutes of TV and spends 39 minutes talking with
his or her parents. Fifty-two percent of kids between 5 and 17
years old have a TV in their bedroom. Every year, the average
teenager spends 900 hours in school and 1,500 hours watching
television.
</P>
<P>
   In any given period during prime time viewing hours, there are
at least 50 people killed, shot, maimed, or raped across the
spectrum of broadcast and cable television channels. Eighty percent
of television producers believe there's a link between television
violence and real-life violence. Fifty-four percent of local
television newscasts are devoted to stories about crimes,
disasters, and wars.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just television. These data do not include the time
kids spend listening to ``gangsta'' rap and heavy metal, playing
Dungeons and Dragons, watching violent movies (on video and in
theaters), and perusing the Internet for Web sites that show how to
build a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   American society is sitting on that bomb, waiting for it to
explode, making money on it in the interim. The television
networks, the major movie studios, record companies, video game
software producers, print and other media are spending hundreds of
millions of dollars every year to adapt children to this diet of
violence and carnage. Once addicted, they'll want more of it, which
can and will be provided at a slightly higher price.
</P>
<P>
   The success of this effort can be seen in the stock pages. Time
Warner, CBS, GE, Fox, Sony, Disney, Interscope, and many, many
other great and not-so-great corporations have all seen their
shares skyrocket in value. Investors who have profited from this
bonanza may include residents of Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, evangelical groups tried to lead boycotts against
entertainment and media companies that produced and broadcast
gratuitously violent fare. Their efforts met with some success at
the grass roots and nothing but scorn from media elites.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Bob Dole sought to make cultural and media violence a
major theme of his presidential campaign. He was reviled for his
efforts. Hollywood's contempt for public concern about the
ceaseless stream of violent media was perfectly captured in a quote
from Ted Field, the Marshall Field department store heir and
co-founder of Interscope. ``You can tell the people who want to
stop us from releasing controversial rap music one thing,'' said
Field: ``Kiss my ass.''
</P>
<P>
   Either we change it or we don't. If we don't, then don't be
surprised when the next Littleton happens. And the one after that.
And the one after that. Littleton is just a piece. The larger whole
is a society collapsing under the weight of its own recklessness
and irresponsibility.

HASBRO BELIEVES THE FORCE IS WITH IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can the Force propel a stock already near its all-time high?
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro Inc., the Pawtucket, R.I., toy company riding the wild
success of Furby, will find out. A barrage of Hasbro toys and other
products tied to ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' go
on sale May 3, more than two weeks before the opening of the movie
itself.
</P>
<P>
   People are already camping out near California theaters waiting
to buy movie tickets. Anticipation about the merchandising power of
the most eagerly anticipated movie in recent memory has the toy
industry buzzing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be the biggest toy story of the year,''
said Chris Byrne an independent consultant and author of The Toy
Report, an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   But the Force has to pay the Tab. Hasbro has agreed to cough up
at least $590 million in four advance payments in toy royalties
over the next decade for rights connected to the three films in the
``Star Wars'' prequel era about to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro, the nation's number two toymaker, paid the first
installment of $100 million last year. When The Phantom Meance
premieres on May 19, Hasbro chief Alan Hassenfeld will write a
check for another $250 million. Other advances are due upon the
release of the two remaining film trilogy ``episodes.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not all: Hasbro has issued warrants for 5.7 million
shares to Lucas Licensing Ltd., excercisable at $28 each. Warrants
are securities that allow the holder to buy stock at a specified
price. Hasbro stock, riding the announcement of strong first
quarter earnings, hit an all-time high of 32 15/16 this week. It
finished Wednesday 31 7/16 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   To put that in perspective, consider that the new ``Star Wars''
film itself only cost producer George Lucas $115 million to make.
Hasbro thinks it is still getting a good deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a significant property,'' said John T. O'Neill, Hasbro's
chief financial officer. ``Obviously we expect an awful lot of good
things to happen from the licensing arrangement and, yes, good
things are expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how significant the toy rights will become is open to
widely differing estimates. On the high end of the range, some
people think ``Star Wars'' toy products can sell nearly $1 billion
this year as as much as $5 billion over the 10-year life of the
prequel era. All Hasbro sales totaled $3.3 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro officials declined to provide details about their new
``Star Wars'' line, but agree that it is their largest product
rollout ever. Games, toys, even interactive candy are in the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   There will be more. One reason the ``Star Wars'' license is so
valuable is the large number of film characters, vehicles and other
figures that can be turned into toys. That means Hasbro can
continue to roll out new toys in the years between films.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Hasbro is going to make a concentrated effort to pace
itself by holding some new product for next year and the following
year,'' said analyst John Taylor of Arcadia Investment Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro has been selling ``Star Wars'' toys, based on the
original three films, for years under an old license. It was
awarded the license for larger toys tied to the new series and
Lewis Galoob Toys Inc. won a license for miniature products in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro bought Galoob last year and wound up with all the ``Star
Wars'' toy business, except for a small piece awarded to Lego Group
AG of Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars'' success would represent another big score for
Hasbro, which has been on a roll. Its portfolio of hot lines, from
Furbies to Teletubbies and a fast-growing interactive games unit,
boosted first quarter earnings by 77 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The performance, achieved while top toymaker Mattel Inc. was
peparing to lay off 3,000 employees, added more fuel to a stock run
that has boosted the price of Hasbro shares by 60 percent since
Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more going on than `Star Wars,' although it's
the single most visible thing,'' said Taylor. ``The whole operation
is running well.''

REVOLUTION GETS KICK BACK IN SAVARESE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Giovanni Savarese's career with the Revolution could
not have started much more dramatically. The second time Savarese
touched the ball, he converted a goal, leading to speculation that
he would continue the rate which made him the MLS's second-leading
scorer in three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But Savarese has not produced a goal since the game against the
Miami Fusion on March 28, opening day. In fact, he has played only
13 minutes since then, after suffering an ankle injury in a
training match against the New Hampshire Phantoms March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Now Savarese is on the verge of returning. Though Savarese will
not likely be at full speed, the Revolution could use his
inspiration and offensive instincts for their visit to D.C. United
Saturday night. Since Savarese's goal, a rebound of a Joe-Max Moore
shot off the post, the Revolution have just three goals, and only
twice in the run of play, in 359 minutes 38 seconds of official
play.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive output has been better than opposition, as the
Revolution have established themselves as a potentially solid
defensive team. And their defensive play has been an especially
important point of reference during a stretch of two games against
D.C. United and one against Columbus, the top teams in the Eastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be going there to win the game,'' said Savarese, who
returned from a visit to his ailing grandmother in Caracas for
training at Babson College in Wellesley Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't go in there and just play crazy. We have to have the
right mentality. But whether we are playing at home or away, we are
playing to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Savarese was seeking a sort of second chance with the Revolution
after having been relegated to a reserve role with the MetroStars,
despite his dependability and dynamic scoring figures. In 85 games,
he scored 41 goals for the MetroStars, a strike rate of .488, one
of the best in the league. His quick start seemed a portent of a
positive future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a good sign,'' Savarese said. ``To be away
from home and score the first goal was great. Even though they
scored to tie the game, it was a good start to the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then I got hurt, and I haven't been able to go full speed.
It's been frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution is not a direct part of the Carlos Valderrama
stakes. But they could be involved in a three-way deal, since Miami
has committed itself to dealing Valderrama, and Tampa Bay is the
logical taker. The Fusion refused a deal of Valderrama for Swedish
defender Jan Eriksson and Costa Rican forward Alejandro Sequeira,
demanding Bolivian midfielder Mauricio Ramos . . . Giuseppe
Galderisi was named assistant coach after acting in that role for
the Revolution's first two home games. Galderisi, 36, played in the
1986 World Cup finals in Mexico, and scored 38 goals in 156 games
in Italy's Serie A and another 50 goals in Serie B games. In the
MLS, Galderisi scored 12 goals in 48 games for the Revolution and
Tampa Bay . . . Tickets for the Revolution's July 21 exhibition
against Ajax of Amsterdam became available Thursday (April 22).

A SELF-DEFEATING WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   War is the mother of unintended consequences.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said that the Balkans will not get better
until democracy comes to Serbia. The NATO attack, however, has
drastically harmed the prospects for Serbian democracy. Political
forces allied against Slobodan Milosevic have been routed as Serbs
rally to the defense of the country.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the air war is necessary to prevent the
conflict from spreading. Yet the war has destabilized the
surrounding countries by threatening the fragile peace in Bosnia,
putting at risk the advocates of democracy in Montenegro,
dangerously altering the ethnic mix in Macedonia, and emboldening
the fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army, whom the United States
only recently branded as terrorists. Albania is on its way to
becoming a client state as NATO begins to use the refugee-swamped
country as a base for its Kosovo operations.
</P>
<P>
   In a less obvious way, the war is destabilizing Russia,
marginalizing pro-Western reformers and bolstering the hard-line
nationalists who are sure to do better in the upcoming elections
than they otherwise would have done.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the war was necessary to prevent ethnic
cleansing in Kosovo. Yet the ethnic cleansing has accelerated under
cover of the NATO attacks.
</P>
<P>
   So now, as the bombing enters its fourth week, the United States
and NATO are throwing more planes and more bombs into the breach to
pressure Milosevic, whom they badly underestimated in their fatally
flawed attempt to bring him to heel at the talks in Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
   When the reason for continuing a war shifts from its original
goal and toward maintaining credibility, the policy is in trouble.
In a subtle way, that is what is happening to NATO. The
organization should not reject a chance to end the war just because
the alliance needs to save face. With each escalation there are new
and often unforeseeable consequences.
</P>
<P>
   What can easily be foreseen is that sending NATO ground troops
to fight a land war in the Balkans would even further destabilize
Europe, and perhaps the United States, too. The effect on Russia
would be calamitous, and the cost in blood and treasure to the
United States would be considerable. At first there would be an
attempt to limit the ground operation to Kosovo. But once troops
are engaged, protecting soldiers becomes part of the war aim, and
inexorably they would be drawn deeper into Serbia itself.
</P>
<P>
   TV pictures of refugees have pumped up public support in the
United States for ground troops, but pictures of American soldiers
in body bags would as quickly deflate it. The vaunted budget
surplus would quickly dwindle, and the confidence that has buoyed
the stock market in the teeth of financial woes elsewhere could be
expected to erode as well. Preserving Social Security and Medicare
would have to take a back seat to the all-devouring needs of war.
The backlash would feed the forces of isolation in this country,
harming America's ability to lead.
</P>
<P>
   Using military logic, Senator John McCain is right when he says
that there is no substitute for victory and the United States
should take all measures necessary to win. But political and
strategic logic at times has to trump military logic, as President
Truman found when General Douglas MacArthur proposed using all
necessary force to win the Korean War. The resulting truce was
frustrating and inconclusive but infinitely wiser than expanding
the war.
</P>
<P>
   America's national interests are not directly engaged in Kosovo
as they are in Iraq. For all his atrocities, Milosevic is not
manufacturing nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. If
reasonable compromises can be reached in Kosovo, the United States
and NATO should take them, even if it is morally repugnant to deal
with Milosevic. After all, it was morally repugnant of Croatia's
Franjo Tudjman to ethnically cleanse 200,000 Serbs from the Krajina
region of Croatia, yet nobody suggested that NATO intervene then.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should be wary of committing the United States to the
course of ground combat. Wars should not be entered into in the
white heat of emotion. The consequences of committing troops to
fight in the Balkans could haunt America for generations to come.

NO PORK FOR THE PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five Boston businessmen and the chancellor of Boston College
believe they ``will have done well by our citizens and our
Commonwealth'' if they succeed in derailing the New England
Patriots' agreement to move from Massachusetts to Connecticut. But
they offer no evidence for that belief. That is because there is
none.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the six prominent Bostonians _ Wayne Budd, William
Connell, John Connors Jr., Paul Kirk Jr., Thomas May, and the Rev.
J. Donald Monan _ don't even try to make an argument for keeping
the Patriots in Massachusetts. They merely assert, ``We _ not
Hartford _ should be the home of the Patriots.'' Why? Who knows?
The closest Budd &AMP; Co. come to an explanation is their passing
reference to ``our state's dynamic economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriots are irrelevant to the Massachusetts economy.
Their presence hasn't been a boon, and their departure wouldn't be
a blow. Budd &AMP; Co. imply that forcing taxpayers to subsidize a new
stadium _ that is what they are calling for, even if they never
muster the candor to say so _ would be good for the Commonwealth
and its residents. There is a mountain of economic research that
says they are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   --Robert Baade of Lake Forest University compared data from 36
metropolitan regions that have professional sports teams with 12
regions that don't. Finding: Pro sports had no statistically
significant impact on economic growth rates.
</P>
<P>
   --Baade and Allen Sanderson of the University of Chicago looked
at 35 years' worth of data to test the hypothesis that adding a new
team or stadium leads to higher employment. Finding: No new net job
creation takes place, since leisure spending does not measurably
increase and not enough fans are attracted from outside the region
to make an economic difference.
</P>
<P>
   --Michael Walden of North Carolina State University studied
growth patterns in 46 cities between 1990 and 1994. Finding: Cities
with major league sports teams grew more slowly than those without
them.
</P>
<P>
   --Denis Coates and Brad Humphreys of the University of Maryland
analyzed the effect of professional sports on per capita income.
Finding: Cities with new ballparks suffered a $100 decrease in per
capita income. In cities with new baseball teams, the drop was
$400.
</P>
<P>
   --The Allegheny Institute ranked cities according to their
ability to attract new business facilities or expand existing ones
in 1990-95. Finding: Five out of the five slowest-growing cities
were home to two or more big-league teams. Of the nine
fastest-growing local economies, none had a major league baseball
or football team.
</P>
<P>
   If Boston's tycoons want the Patriots to have a new stadium,
nothing prevents them from privately raising the money to build
one. Some of the finest ballparks and arenas in America were built
with private funds, including Fenway Park, Chicago's United Center,
and Turner Field in Atlanta. But if Budd and friends aren't willing
to risk their own capital on a stadium project, what possible
excuse can they have for risking everyone else's?
</P>
<P>
   ``A new sports facility has an extremely small (perhaps even
negative) effect on overall economic activity and employment,''
conclude Roger Noll of Stanford University and Andrew Zimbalist of
Smith College in a study for the Brookings Institution. ``No recent
facility appears to have earned anything approaching a reasonable
return on investment. No recent facility has been self-financing in
terms of . . . net tax revenues. Regardless of whether the unit of
analysis is a local neighborhood, a city, or an entire metropolitan
area, the economic benefits of sports facilities are de minimus.''
</P>
<P>
   How much clearer can it be? When taxpayers are forced to
subsidize sports teams and stadiums, the chief beneficiaries are
nearly always the millionaire players and their multimillionaire
owners. This is corporate welfare at its most egregious.
</P>
<P>
   There is no ``multiplier'' effect from pumping public money into
ballparks. Maryland taxpayers spent nearly $500 million to
subsidize beautiful new stadiums for the Orioles and the Ravens.
Yet their city's blight, if anything, grew worse. Residents are
fleeing Baltimore at the rate of 1,000 per month. The new
facilities provided full-time work for fewer than 2,500 people,
which means that the new employment was achieved at a cost to
taxpayers of $200,000 per job.
</P>
<P>
   Ballparks rarely attract new money. Families tend to have a
fixed amount of income available for entertainment; if they don't
spend it on professional sports, they spend it on a concert or
video rentals or a boat show. And since the vast majority of fans
attending a game live within 20 miles of the stadium, money spent
on sports is money that would have been spent locally anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is beyond dispute: There is no economic case for
diverting public funds to woo a major league sports team. Nor is
there any pressing need to make Bob Kraft and his football players
richer than they already are. If Wayne Budd and his colleagues want
the Patriots to have a subsidy, let them pass the hat among their
friends. Better yet, let them listen to Chuck Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad wouldn't have let the taxpayers of Massachusetts or
Connecticut build a stadium for him,'' says the son of Billy
Sullivan, the Patriots' longtime owner. ``He felt the taxpayers
shouldn't foot the bill for a private business.''

IN HP'S CASE, SPEED THRILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With personal computer prices crashing, companies like Hewlett
Packard are scrambling at the high end.
</P>
<P>
   These PC makers are attempting to build powerful systems, loaded
with features, at a price point high enough to provide a healthy
profit margin. A major weapon for the computer companies is Intel's
new Pentium III microprocessor, a chip that can command a
significant premium because it is the latest and fastest from
chipmaker Intel .
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, of course, Intel created a different kind of
stir with its Pentium III. Every Pentium III chip contains a unique
serial number that can be used to track the movements of consumers
on the Internet. As a result, some privacy groups, including the
Electronic Privacy Information Center, have called for a boycott of
this chip.
</P>
<P>
   But does it make sense to boycott Intel's latest and greatest?
Eager to find out, and curious about what it would be like to
``drive'' the world's fastest PC, I asked Hewlett Packard to lend
me its top-of-the-line home computer, the HP Pavilion 8490.
</P>
<P>
   The Pavilion 8490 is an imposing machine. The system comes with
a Pentium III microprocessor screaming along at 500 Mhz. (That's
more than 100 times faster than the original IBM PC, which had a
clock speed of just 4.77 Mhz.)
</P>
<P>
   The Pavilion 8490 comes with not one, but two optical drives.
One is a CDROM/DVD drive that can play movies directly from an
optical disc onto the computer's screen. You can buy DVD movies in
the stores now for less than $15; there are literally hundreds of
titles. The second optical drive is a compact disc recorder (CD-R).
Black CDs can be purchased for roughly $2 each at Staples and most
computer supply stores.
</P>
<P>
   Two drives means that it's easy to copy from one CD to another.
In fact, the HP Pavilion comes with disc-copying software
pre-installed. (Unfortunately, you can't copy DVD discs, because
they store data in the a different format.)
</P>
<P>
   The HP Pavilion also comes with a fancy keyboard that includes
an extra row of buttons for playing audio CDs. There is also a big
volume control, and buttons that are supposed to automatically
launch your favorite application programs, sort of like station
presets that you might see on a car stereo.
</P>
<P>
   This whole package costs roughly $2,500 for the basic
configuration. That includes 128MB of RAM, a 17.9GB hard drive, and
a fax modem. Throw in another $150 and HP will install a Diamond
Viper 550 video card with 16 megabytes of video RAM,
high-performance 3D graphics, and a rock-solid refresh. (The
Pavilion's built-in video is an 8MB ATI Rage, which flickered
somewhat on my monitor.)
</P>
<P>
   You'll also need a monitor. HP sells a 15-inch multimedia
monitor (which means it has a set of built-in speakers) for $299
and a 17-inch monitor for $449.
</P>
<P>
   So how does the whole package work together?
</P>
<P>
   Quite well. As long as Microsoft's software is cooperative. I
was amazed by how much faster programs like Outlook Express and
Internet Explorer ran on the 500 Mhz Pentium III. I had thought
that the main factor limiting these programs was the speed of my
Internet connection, which is a fairly zippy cable modem from
MediaOne. But running on the Pentium III, Web pages just snapped
into place. The browser's ``Back'' button gave me instantaneous
satisfaction. Even mundane activities like hitting the ``Page Up''
and ``Page Down'' keys were noticeably faster. The increased speed
made the computer more enjoyable to use.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, faster doesn't mean more reliable. I consistently
had problems with drivers and other system software. Blue screens
would appear with writing on them, telling me that an illegal
operation had occurred. Sometimes the computer would just freeze up
for no apparent reason at all. Thankfully, the computer also boots
fast!
</P>
<P>
   Some of the built-in software didn't work properly, either. The
Pavilion comes with Symantec Fax Starter Edition, but it never
worked for me. I ended up installing WinFax instead. The special
``media'' buttons on the HP keyboard stopped working when I
installed Internet Explorer 5. The computer that I got came with
the Viper 550 video card, but the DVD playing software for the
built-in ATI video system. HP says that this was a mistake made
with my particular machine. Still, the only way that I could play a
DVD was by removing the Viper card and using the built-in video.
</P>
<P>
   I was also annoyed by a high-pitched chattering that accompanied
certain kinds of screen operations, such as moving a window or
redrawing a page of text. The chattering sounds a lot like the old
Apollo workstations from the early 1980s. I believe that it comes
from the power supply when it's called upon to supply a little
extra juice for transferring images to and from the screen. HP told
me that I could make the noise go away by changing a jumper on the
inside of the computer. I changed the jumper, but the noise
remained.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond ultra-fast speed, the Pentium III also brings a whole
bunch of new instructions that software vendors can use in their
products. Dragon Systems, for instance, has a version of its speech
recognition software that uses the special Pentium III instructions
to achieve faster recognition and shorter training times than was
with previous microprocessors. I tried a beta release of the
program and was amazed by the improvements _ you can now train
Dragon in just 3 minutes, as opposed to half an hour. Dragon's
product is a real reason to purchase the Pentium III, rather than
the competing chips from AMD and other vendors that are nearly as
fast but much cheaper.

   As far as the privacy-shattering Pentium III goes, I must have
visited more than 100 Web sites during the time that I've been
testing the machine. Not one of them asked to download an applet
that could read the processor serial number (PSN).
</P>
<P>
   And why would they? Pentium IIIs are in the vast minority on the
Internet today. Why would any Web site restrict an area so that the
majority of Internet users couldn't access it?
</P>
<P>
   Overall, HP's Pavilion is great system if you want to watch
movies, master compact discs, or if you just need to have the
zippiest computer on the block and you are willing to pay for it.
Configured as it is, this is a computer that will last for several
years without the need to upgrade. But if you do decide to get it ,
you're probably better off buying your own 17-inch monitor for $300
and hooking the computer up to your stereo system. You'll get
better sound, and save money as well.

   &UR; Zinc found to reduce infant mortality risk &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Giving zinc supplements to children _ including low birth weight
babies _ can substantially reduce infant mortality, one study
shows, and can also dramatically lower the risk of developing
diarrhea and pneumonia, according to another.
</P>
<P>
   The studies were presented this week at a meeting of the
Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.
</P>
<P>
   The first study, led by Dr. Sunil Sazawal, a pediatrician and
researcher at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in Baltimore,
involved 1,250 babies in India weighing between 2 and 5 pounds.
They were divided into four groups. One group got a daily syrup
containing 5 milligrams of zinc; another got zinc plus vitamins and
other minerals; a third got vitamins and minerals but no zinc; the
fourth got a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure that the babies were given the proper medicine, a
public health worker visited every family every day, Sazawal said
in a telephone interview. The results were impressive: the two
groups that got zinc showed a reduction in infant mortality of
about one-third, perhaps because of zinc's ability to boost immune
function.
</P>
<P>
   In the second study, researchers pooled data on about 4,000
children from 17 studies and found zinc reduced the prevalence of
diarrhea by 25 percent and pneumonia by 41 percent. ``We need to
ensure that children get enough zinc,'' said Sazawal. For children
less than one year old, that is 5 milligrams a day; for older
youngsters, it is 10. Many get all they need from fortified
cereals, whole grains, meat, and beans.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Sobriety, counseling trim domestic abuse
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Domestic violence is often linked to alcoholism, and a study
shows that when a couple gets counseling and an abusive husband
stops drinking, the violence often abates. The study was led by
psychologist Timothy O'Farrell, director of the Counseling for
Alcoholics' Marriages (CALM) Project at the Brockton VA Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The team studied 75 couples in which the man was an alcoholic
and the wife was not. Before treatment, 60 percent of the men were
violent toward their wives, said O'Farrell, whose study is
published  &UR; today &LR;  in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after treatment _ which involved 20 sessions of
couples counseling, plus a medication called Antabuse and/or
Alcoholic Anonymous meetings _ the prevalence of violence dropped
to 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For couples in which the man maintained sobriety _ which was
nearly half the sample _ only 3 percent reported violence.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Medication backed for heart ailments
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A study of 10,333 volunteers provides evidence for what doctors
have long assumed to be true: Blood-pressure medicine reduces the
prevalence of high blood pressure and of a heart problem called
left ventricular hypertrophy and may in part explain the 50 percent
decline in heart disease deaths since 1950.
</P>
<P>
   The research, from the Framingham Heart Study, tracked data from
1950 to 1989 and is published in the current New England Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Week without TV? Some moving advice
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ok, kids, you may not want to hear this, but listen up.
</P>
<P>
   Top health officials, including Surgeon General David Satcher,
have a plan. It's called TV-Free America and the idea is _ gasp _
to turn off the TV for a whole week starting Thursday (April 22).
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because obesity is at epidemic proportions. About 55
percent of adults are overweight or obese, government figures show.
More than 13 percent of children 6 to 17 are overweight and are
getter fatter each year. Moreover, research shows that the average
American watches three hours and 43 minutes of TV a day.
</P>
<P>
   Put it all together and the answer is: Get off the couch, turn
off the TV, and do something like ride a bike, play soccer, jump
rope, fly a kite or _ double gasp _ clean your room.

FOR PARENTS, A TIME TO TALK _ AND LISTEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and l coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the biggest mistakes we can make as parents in dealing
with the Littleton, Colo., murders is to think or hope that our
children haven't heard about the tragedy and thus to say nothing.
This would send a message that it's unimportant or that we don't
care. It also leaves room for children to imagine awful
possibilities, including the scariest thought of all: ``This could
happen in my school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the fear children of all ages have and they all need a
chance to get it out,'' says Cornell University psychologist James
Garbarino, an authority on the impact of violence on children.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is not to say too much to preschoolers or too little
to adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   Preschoolers. Find out what he already knows, says psychologist
Diane Levin, a professor at Wheelock College. A good opener:
``There was something on the news about teenagers. Did you hear
about it?'' If your child says no, you could say, ``Some teenagers
got hurt, but everyone is taken care of now.'' If she says yes,
here are some points to make:
</P>
<P>
   --It happened in a place far from here. Children ages 3 to 5
don't have a good grasp of time and distance, so they personalize
details, says psychologist Susan Linn of the Judge Baker Children's
Center in Boston. Reassure them about their safety: ``Your school
is safe.''
</P>
<P>
   --It makes you sad. Sadness may be the only thing that
differentiates this event from violence they may see on TV. If we
don't talk about our feelings, it increases the likelihood that
children become accepting of violence.
</P>
<P>
   --You don't know why it happened. Levin suggests saying,
``People are working to make sure this never happens again.''
</P>
<P>
   School-age. Even if you discussed it Wednesday, start a
conversation today: ``I`m wondering what you've heard.'' The 6- to
12-year-old's response can be confusing. She may grill you for
details, then run out to play. ``It's too threatening for them to
stay with the thoughts for long,'' says psychologist Sandra
Graham-Bermann of the University of Michigan. Don't push her to
talk, but don't be surprised if in a day she's fearful (``Will bad
kids come to my school?'') or angry (``Why couldn't adults stop
it?'')
</P>
<P>
   --Validate her feelings and share your own: ``I don't blame you
for being angry/upset/sad. I am too.'' Letting her vent can be a
source of comfort. Let her experience your compassion: ``My heart
goes out to those parents.''
</P>
<P>
   --Keep communication open. Answer honestly what you can but feel
comfortable saying, ``I don't know. If I hear more, I'll tell
you.'' If he's not talking, the third-person may be less
threatening: ``I know some kids worry about their school.''
</P>
<P>
   --Find truthful ways to reassure about safety. School vacation
this week could cause children to worry either more or less. Some
children may not be troubled today, but come Monday, they won't
want to go to school. Assume the refusal is related, says Linn of
the Judge Baker center. Say, ``I wonder if you're worried about
safety. Let's talk to the principal.''
</P>
<P>
   --Distinguish between behavior and dress. Because school-age
children think concretely, they may assume that anyone who wears a
black raincoat is a bad person. ``They need to hear you say that
(wearing unusual clothes) doesn't mean a person is bad,'' Levin
says.
</P>
<P>
   Teenagers. Because of his age group's melodramatic impulse, a
17-year-old may say, ``I'm going to carry a weapon from now on'' or
``I'm dropping lacrosse because athletes were targeted.'' Don't get
caught up in it, says Garbarino of Cornell University; it's
probably masking worry and fear. The more you can tolerate what
they say with simple responses (``I know how you feel, this is very
scary''), the sooner you can get to the feeling itself. Also:
</P>
<P>
   --If your teen isn't talking, let him know you're always
available or that you hope there's another adult he'll talk to.
</P>
<P>
   --Watch TV with her, read the articles she reads, visit the same
Web sites. It can be a starting point for a conversation.
</P>
<P>
   --Share your feelings even if he isn't sharing his, including
worries about the spread of violence in our society.
</P>
<P>
   --Talk about peers who may be troubled and how to help them.
</P>
<P>
   Garbarino says that teens who are contending with other issues _
parents divorcing, a recent breakup with a girlfriend or boyfriend,
a death in the family _ need particular attention.
</P>
<P>
   With any child, he advises, have a family dinner tonight and a
moment of silence or a prayer. ``After the initial hunger for
information, kids need the chance to be reflective with you.''
</P>

WEB SITES BUSY AS MANY SEEK OUTLET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A family in Orem, Utah, sent out kind words and electronic
prayers. A free-lance Web designer in California set up an on-line
condolence board. Teen-agers in chat rooms alternated between
anger, despair, and tough-guy posturing. Harvard professor and
child psychiatrist Alvin Poussaint counseled parents and teens in a
live chat on America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Wednesday, Web sites with the words ``trench coat'' in
their addresses were bombarded with hits Wednesday, despite the
fact that these sites had nothing to do with suspected killers in
Tuesday's Littleton, Colorado school rampage or with their group,
the Trench Coat Mafia. Rumors blanketed bulletin boards and dubious
news sites before being quickly swatted down by vigilant Web users.
And in Golden, Colorado, at the offices of the Jefferson County
Schools, an official worked to dispel such rumors and set up a
on-line resource center in the aftermath of the tragic shootings at
Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   As it has in other crises, the Internet was both a labyrinth of
misinformation about the shootings as well as a comfort zone for
concerned citizens. ``Please be careful about taking any
information about this event from unreliable Internet sources,''
warned John Adsit, who set up the site for the the county school
system. (The site is at
http://204.98.1.2/communications/crisis/crisis.html.) Adsit was
responding to a series of on-line hoaxes and rumors that emerged
instantaneously on-line, even as police and rescue workers were
still clearing the school building of explosives.
</P>
<P>
   On America Online, for instance, more than a hundred users
altered their member profiles to include references to the killings
and the Trench Coat group _ seeking to draw attention to
themselves. In addition, several news reports broke late Tuesday
about an AOL page alleged to have been posted by deceased gunman
Eric Harris, one of the two students who went on a wild shooting
rampage at the Colordo high school. The address for the AOL site,
which is posted on many electronic discussion groups, has been
removed from the server, but it is said to have featured pictures
of the kind of pipe bombs used in the Tuesday's attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been working with the FBI since (Tuesday) night, and
our folks here pulled content to preserve some information they
thought was relevant to the case,'' said AOL spokesperson Kim
McCleery.
</P>
<P>
   At least one other site was pulled from the Internet Wednesday,
and others posted disclaimers. An adult entertainment site with an
address that seemed affiliated with the fringe group received so
many hits Wednesday it temporarily suspended its business and
posted this message: ``This site has nothing to do with the Trench
Coat Mafia...I'm just as disturbed and saddened as the rest of you
about the events that transpired in Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Internet users aimed to inflame the tragedy even as it
was still unfolding. In the discussion group
alt.motorcycles.harley, a user who used the handle Queen Jeff
alleged that the attack had been unleashed by ``gay bikers''
seeking revenge. The user posted the message via the popular
on-line service Dejanews.com. ``We are a very democratic site, and
we don't alter content,'' a spokesperson for the New York-based
Deja News, Inc said ``It's unbiased _ that's the beauty of it. The
company does not control content. That is too Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   But while hoaxers used the Internet to posture, other users
sought solace and comfort in discussion groups and live chat
forums. Marian McKenna Olivas, a California Web designer, set up a
condolence site on her business pages (see
http://www.wecanhelp.net/columbine.html). ``I lost my second child
(to meningitis, not violence) and was just moved by the sight of
parents waiting to hear from their children,'' she said. ``I
decided to set up a place where people could send sympathy.'' The
site was receiving 10 condolence letters an hour Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, various on-line sites offered cyber
counseling: At family.com, for instance, therapist Sylvia Rimm
posted a piece called ``What to Tell Your Kids.'' Poussaint fielded
questions on AOL; friends supported each other in such forums as
alt.teens.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere on-line was a mix of heartfelt emotion and false
bravado. ``I could make a bomb,'' boasted an AOL member in a chat
room. Recipes for explosives are, in fact, readily available
on-line.
</P>
<P>
   But for every braggart on-line Wednesday, there was a somber
counterpoint. This message appeared on Olivas' bulletin board
Thursday night: ``All I can say is I'm sorry. I live in Jonesboro
(Arkansas), and I went to the high school at Westside when last
year there was the shooting. I know how hard it is and I know how
hard it will end up being.'' The posting was signed, ``Sincerely,
Erin.''

PUTTING YOUR VCR ON STEROIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One reason I dread leaving the office for a week is all the mail
that piles up in my absence. It's 90 percent trash, of course, even
the boxes filled with software and gadgets that arrive unbidden
from publicity-hungry entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   The big black box from Replay Networks Inc. of Mountain View,
Calif., fell into that category. I thought one of our arts and
entertainment reporters might want to take it home and play with
their new ReplayTV device. But he didn't. So I ended up lugging it
home, hooking it up to my television, and chuckling with admiration
and delight. You've heard of VCR Plus? ReplayTV is VCR Squared.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's a computer that thinks it's a VCR. Hook it up to
a TV antenna or cable, and ReplayTV will let you copy 10 to 28
hours of video. Unlike a VCR, which records on a long spool of
analog videotape, ReplayTV uses a data protocol known as MPEG-2 to
create compressed digital copies of TV shows and store them on a
built-in hard drive. In addition, ReplayTV connects by telephone
modem to a free on-line service that automatically updates your
local TV listings every day, storing the information in an
electronic channel guide. And, of course, the thing sets its own
internal clock; no blinking 12:00 here.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a device that makes TV time-shifting a trivial
exercise. Want to tape tonight's evening news? Just open the
channel guide with ReplayTV's remote control. Flip to the network
of your choice, and press the record button. You can even tell it
to record the same news show every night.
</P>
<P>
   Putting a computer in charge of the process allows even more
sophisticated controls. Say you want to watch the Flintstones but
don't know when it's on. Punch in the word ``Flintstones,'' and
ReplayTV will scan its database, find the program, and record it.
</P>
<P>
   Some genius at ReplayTV came up with the idea of a data buffer
that records a portion of any live show you might be watching. What
good is that? Two words: instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   I tried it during an Atlanta Braves baseball game. The batter
hit a pop fly to right field. I wanted to see it again. I pressed
the replay button, and instantly the TV image leapt backward in
time by a few seconds, rerunning the play. Meanwhile, the unit kept
recording the live TV feed. I could keep watching in replay mode,
seeing the rest of the game delayed by several seconds. Or I could
push a live-feed button and go back to watching the game in real
time.
</P>
<P>
   The video recording looked at least as good as videotape on my
ancient RCA set, and the sound quality, pumped through my home
stereo system, was excellent.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, ReplayTV isn't a complete substitute for a VCR.
It won't play rented movies. Equally important, its hard drive
eventually fills up, forcing you to record over shows. It's easy to
plug a VCR into the back and offload the stuff you want to keep
permanently. As for extra hard drive space, the designers had the
wit to include a couple of data ports that use Apple Computer
Inc.'s red-hot FireWire system. Replay Networks plans to sell
plug-and-play FireWire hard drives that would let a user boost
video storage capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the price, $700 for the basic 10-hour unit, up to
$1,500 for a model that can store 28 hours of video. This is much
too high. Then again, it's bound to get cheaper. After all,
ReplayTV is a computer, and we all know what's been happening to
computer prices lately. In a year or so, one of the basic units
could well be in the $350-$400 range.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing I'd like to see is a hookup with Microsoft Corp.,
whose superb WebTV device still hasn't achieved the success it
deserves. WebTV has full Internet access, and a slick
picture-in-picture feature that would look great on a ReplayTV
unit. Merge the two technologies in a cheap consumer device and
you'd have the hottest home electronics product since the Sony
Playstation. I'd love to find a box like that waiting after my next
road trip.

ARMCHAIR QUARTERBACKING THE WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Day twenty-seven and no end in sight,'' declared CNN
``Crossfire'' host Bill Press, kicking off another television food
fight over who lost Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Over on MSNBC, talk host John Gibson sifted through the Balkan
rubble for psychological clues to its origin. ``What was (Bill
Clinton's) real motive here?'' he asked his guests. Is the
president ``doing the right thing'' or ``fighting for his legacy''?
</P>
<P>
   Most journalists may have been driven from the war zone in
Yugoslavia, but commentators have overrun the TV studios. And the
first major war conducted in the glare of the 24-hour-media
universe has produced a torrent of punditry that observers say
creates unrealistic public expectations _ and potentially
signficant policy implications _ for a conflict that may involve
serious time and sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of what former ABC diplomatic correspondent Barrie
Dunsmore called ``the armchair quarterback syndrome'' is apparent
in a recent CNN/USA Today survey. While the main sentiment was that
NATO was losing the war, the most revealing finding was that only 9
percent thought it was ``too soon'' to render a verdict on the
success of the mission after a few short weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one thinks about the various major conflicts that have
taken place, the notion that this thing should be settled in the
first two or three weeks is bizarre,'' added Dunsmore, an associate
fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. ``I think the
time frame has been reduced . . . because of television and the
all-news channels.''
</P>
<P>
   The cable news networks _ with their ravenous appetite for
talking heads and instant opinion _ have become ``a media
technology issue that ultimately affects the culture and people's
expectations about war and life,'' said Marvin Kalb, director of
Harvard's Shorenstein Center.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on television coverage early on in the Kosovo
conflict, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman warned that
``this is war, not infotainment.'' But that can be hard to
remember, watching such unlikely military experts as Bianca Jagger
and Michael Isikoff weigh in on the use of ground troops and Bill
Clinton's resolve as commander in chief. Or when, in the apparent
interest of fairness, Fox News Channel airs a debate between a
political science professor calling for a full-fledged ground war
and a peace activist offering college scholarships to Serb
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   According to several analysts, the demand for instant answers to
intractable problems represents an evolution in both the media and
political environments. Conventional wisdom holds that the public
did not decide America was in trouble in Vietnam until Walter
Cronkite said so in his famous 1968 Tet offensive broadcast. Three
decades later, TV pundits rush to declare the United States a loser
in 20 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are different now because there's not the kind of
consensus about foreign policy that there was in the Cold War
era,'' said Daniel Hallin, author of ``The Uncensored War: The
Media and Vietnam.'' ``When there is no consensus, journalists step
into the void and try to sort things out.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalb contrasts today's rampaging punditry with what CBS used to
call ``instant analysis.'' In moments of grave crisis,
correspondents covering the story would cautiously discuss the
situation on air. ``We generally filled out the half-hour of time
and that was that,'' Kalb said. Even that modest level of
pontificating, he added, was deemed ``controversial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, you have a lot of time,'' he added. ``Everything is a
crisis. And retired admirals and generals need work.''
</P>
<P>
   This often comes across as a cacophony of confusion as the
voices of competing interests battle for the precious media
megaphone. In one hectic sequence on Fox News Channel this past
weekend, viewers were bombarded with the pleadings of a Bulgarian
senator arguing for a negotiated settlement, an Albanian
representative urging a ground war, and a US congressman advocating
both an intensified military and diplomatic campaign at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   This past Sunday's television talk-show circuit offered a
smorgasbord of doomsday scenarios and second-guessing. Republican
presidential candidate Pat Buchanan and Senator Judd Gregg,
Republican of New Hampshire, argued for a quick diplomatic solution
to cut US losses. ABC commentator William Kristol and former NATO
supreme commander General George Joulwan advocated a major ground
campaign before all was lost.
</P>
<P>
   When Senator Christopher Dodd Democrat of Connecticut, speaking
on CBS's ``Face the Nation,'' wondered how such crucial judgments
could have solidified so soon and warned that ``we have a tendency
to lose patience quickly,'' journalist Gloria Borger seemed
stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``But how much patience do you think the American people have?''
she responded.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics say the problem with this punditry is its potential
to prematurely galvanize opinion, and thus to influence the elected
officials who must conduct the war with some sort of public
mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Shultz, director of the Security Studies Program at
Tufts's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, believes a good deal
of this armchair quarterbacking is not particularly ``serious,''
but that the implications can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is it fuels the crisis mentality,'' Shultz
declared. ``I think it does put (policy makers) in a bind. We
expect results fast. Yet, we have an air campaign designed not to
have fast results.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference now is the intensity of the negative
drumbeat,'' said Dunsmore. ``In terms of how this affects policy, I
have to believe it has some impact simply because the drumbeat
ultimately does get through.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A TABLOID'S RESTRAINT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Chicago Sun-Times editor Nigel Wade kept the Columbine High
School carnage off the front page of his tabloid, it marked the
second time in two years that he made news by bucking journalistic
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, the Sun-Times covered a deadly Oregon high school
attack inside the paper and published a note voicing Wade's concern
that front-page treatment would traumatize children and inspire
copycat crimes. Many news industry observers suspected a publicity
stunt and Wade made the media rounds, discussing his unorthodox
decision on the ``Today'' show and in an New York Times op-ed
column.
</P>
<P>
   Wade acknowledges that the level of bloodshed in Colorado made
it ``a tougher call'' to run the news on inside pages. But, ``If we
were right to do it last time, we're right to do it again,'' he
said. ``This is certainly not censorship. This is presentation.''
</P>
<P>
   As was the case last May, Wade said his decision was proving
very popular with grateful parents. ``My phone's going nuts,'' he
said.

R. KELLY TURNS HIS THOUGHTS TO TOURING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mixing streetwise hip-hop with R &AMP; B love ballads, Chicago's R.
Kelly has enjoyed a dominant chart presence. He reached the top of
the pop charts and won two Grammys for ``I Believe I Can Fly'' from
the ``Space Jam'' soundtrack. He just had a long-running No. 1 hit
with Celine Dion on their duet ``I'm Your Angel.'' And his songs
are all over the soundtrack of the new Eddie Murphy film, ``Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly keeps the hits rolling, thanks to one of the busiest
schedules in the pop field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I write all the time, no matter where I am and whatever
situation I'm in. I'm always writing songs,'' says Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Because he writes so much, Kelly confesses, ``sometimes it's
hard to get the tour together. Everything piles in at once _ on the
same day, on the same hour, and it's like `Wow, this is a bit too
much.' And that's when I run away and get me a room or something
and just chill on out.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who shared his thoughts during a recent teleprint press
conference from Chicago, hasn't done much chilling lately. Instead,
he's been going through grueling eight-hour-per-day rehearsals for
the tour, which includes opening acts Deborah Cox and Foxy Brown.
He promises ``gimmicks and things'' onstage, in addition to
screening a 10-minute film that he just finished shooting in Los
Angeles. ``We score it and the whole deal,'' he says of the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly is prolific _ a prime example being his ambitious and
highly successful double album, ``R.,'' which came out last year.
It had guest appearances by the likes of Dion, Brown, Jay-Z, Keith
Murray, and Nas.
</P>
<P>
   But Kelly is now focused on touring and is not afraid to declare
his love of it. ``I want to say that it's better than sex, but I
don't know,'' Kelly says. ``It's just an awesome, awesome feeling
to be onstage and have people loving you. It's like _ I guess, it
is better than sex. . . . Yes, it's better than sex. There, I said
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly can be controversial _ his past tours have occasionally
found him dropping his pants onstage _ and, certainly, his earlier
songs were on the controversial side. You only have to look back to
his sex anthem ``Bump `N' Grind'' in 1993, and associated songs
such as ``I Like the Crotch on You'' and ``Freak Dat Body.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the last year, and especially on ``R.,'' Kelly has
mellowed. The album is rich in soul ballads that reveal vocal
influences from Donny Hathaway and Stevie Wonder. And his views
toward women have been tempered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is probably the result of maturity,'' the
30-year-old Kelly says. ``I've been in a few serious relationships
and had my heart broken. You know, poor me. And it resulted in
songs.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Kelly is a fast-rising mogul as well as a singer
and composer. His Rockland Records label has signed such acts as
Talent, Sparkle, the Vegas Cats, and Secret Weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly couldn't be happier about the current trend of blending
hip-hop with classic R &AMP; B. ``You know, I like it because it's
where I'm from. It's got that ghetto feel on it. And that's
something that I can never get rid of because I grew up that way.
It's like home to me.''

A GIRL'S-EYE VIEW OF QUIRKINESS GOING CRAZY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE DANIEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
LAST THINGS 
By Jenny Offill 
Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, 272 pp., $23, 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like most children, Grace Davitt has an active imagination. She
plays detective, pretends to fly, and her favorite book is ``The
Encyclopedia of the Unexplained,'' full of weird ``true'' tales,
such as the man in California struck dead when a hunk of meat fell
from the sky, or the baby in Oregon born half-chicken, half-boy,
who pecked his mother to death.
</P>
<P>
   The book was a gift from Grace's mother, Anna, who leads an even
richer fantasy life than her 8-year-old daughter. An ornithologist
who works at a center for raptors in a small Vermont community,
Anna imparts fables, myths, and imaginings to her impressionable
daughter. Her quirkiness brings to mind Aunt Sylvie in Marilynne
Robinson's dark coming-of-age classic, ``Housekeeping.'' Sylvie's
young niece, Ruth, watched helplessly as her aunt's eccentricity
veered toward insanity; Grace is in a similar situation.
</P>
<P>
   Grace's father, Jonathan, a chemistry teacher, is the opposite
of his wife; he's a stubborn realist who sees everything in black
and white, and then only when there's proof.
</P>
<P>
   Writer Jenny Offill, in this strong debut novel, has created a
fantastical family, at times loving and sweet, sorrowful and
dangerous. The prose, told through the eyes of Grace, is sparse,
elegant, and inviting. What starts off innocently often ends up
chilling, with no warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat on the edge of the bathtub and watched my mother put on
her face. Outside, the trees were breaking themselves into pieces.
Ice tapped against the glass. My mother went to the window and
rubbed away the steam. `Listen, Grace,' she said, `I think
someone's speaking to us in code.' I looked out the window. There
was nothing but the dark trees to see. My mother tapped twice on
the glass, then cupped a hand to her ear. . . . I wanted to ask her
if she had really been a spy, but I was too afraid. If I told you
that, I'd have to kill you, she said once.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of their family traditions are charming if not bizarre.
Because Anna doesn't believe in cutting down trees for Christmas,
they choose one in the forest. ``On Christmas morning, we got
dressed in our warmest clothes and went to see our tree. My father
pulled a sled behind him with all our presents on it and we had a
picnic breakfast in the snow. Pine needles fell on the coffee cake
my mother had made. We opened our presents all at once because it
was too cold to take turns.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace's baby sitter is Edgar, a tall, 16-year-old genius who
studies mold, including a luminous variety he hopes will someday be
used to light entire cities. The only normal thing about him is the
unrelenting crush he has on Anna.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan's twin brother, Uncle Pete, represents yet another side
of science, the popular version that he dispenses daily on his
``Mr. Science'' national television show, which Grace's parents
enjoy mocking with a nasty, jealous fervor. His children, who visit
occasionally, are the closest thing Grace has to traditional
playmates.
</P>
<P>
   Anna is the kind of mother many girls wish from afar they had _
alluring, playful, young, and beautiful. But up close, when the
mystery turns to madness, it's no longer fun. One moment Anna is
joyous, innocent, wise; the next, Offill has painted her as a
disturbed, pitiable creature whose behavior equates neglect or even
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   During one of the many nighttime trips to the local lake, where
Anna is convinced a monster lives, Grace falls asleep while riding
her mother's back in the water and nearly drowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we reached the shallow part, my mother set me down. `If
you ever try a stunt like that again, I'll kill you,' she said. I
tried to take her hand, but she pulled away.''
</P>
<P>
   After Grace mildly acts out at school, Anna decides to
home-school her, using the sewing room, which she'd painted black
to represent the galaxy, as her classroom. They trace the cosmic
calendar, beginning with the Big Bang and ending with the first
humans. Sometimes lessons are given in Annic, the secret language
Anna's father developed for her that Grace, like her grandmother,
could never catch the hang of.
</P>
<P>
   As for her father, the only real show of strength he makes is a
move to New York City for a job; his weakness is in asking his
8-year-old child to take care of his wife. Mother and daughter go
on a schizophrenic road trip that includes New Orleans, Joshua Tree
National Park in California, and the Burning Man festival in
Nevada. Here, Offill could have done a better job of pulling
together earlier events with current ones, perhaps using Grace's
detective kit.
</P>
<P>
   What is made painfully, poignantly clear is that when the two
return home, it's time for the Davitt family to deal with their
monsters, at home and in the lake.

MOLD IN THE TOILET TANK? TRY BLEACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My toilet tank is just chock full of black mold: Sides and
bottom are covered. How can I get rid of it, and is there a way to
keep it away?
</P>
<P>
   PAULINE, Westborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. As far as toilets are concerned, that's an easy one. Mold
will grow virtually anywhere it is damp and preferably warm. But as
you discovered, it can grow in water, and in cold water. The
handyman had it a little while ago, and this is what he did: Pour a
cup of liquid chlorine bleach into the tank, leave it for a while,
and scrub the sides and bottom with a brush to loosen the stuff.
Then flush the toilet; you will have to do this several times to
flush away the mold. If you have a low-flow toilet, keep the
flushing handle down to empty the tank, then wait for the tank to
fill before flushing again. Completely emptying the tank will get
rid of more mold.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the mold away, add a cup of bleach to the tank once a
week.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The handyman has received many calls and letters on how to
reduce sound transmission from one apartment or condo unit to
another, or between rooms in a house. Goodness knows, there is too
much sound pollution in our modern lives, and anything one can do
to reduce it or block it will be a big help.
</P>
<P>
   And the handyman has given out the proper answers to those calls
and letters. Those answers describe sound as vibration, which makes
its way through the solid part of a wall: studs and other wood and
metal members. To stop this transmission, the wall finish
(plasterboard, paneling, etc.) must be separate from the wall
itself. Thus, those vibrations still will go through the solid
parts, but they will dissipate in the air space between wall finish
and solid parts.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish this separation, apply acoustic resilient strips,
which are steel strips shaped like an ``L.'' Screw one leg of this
``L'' to the wall, then screw sound-absorbing board to the other
leg of the ``L.'' This will allow the sound-absorbing board to
stand out from the original wall by a half to three-quarters of an
inch, enough dead air to dissipate the vibrations. Then apply
plasterboard as a final finish.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy the strips at Waltham Sand &AMP; Cement Co. and possibly
building supply centers. Sound-absorbing board is sold in building
supply centers and lumber stores.
</P>
<P>
   What's the point of all this?
</P>
<P>
   The point came from Janet Donovan of South Boston, who called to
say that she did this with her ceiling, as per the handyman's
suggestion, and it ``worked perfectly. The sound transmission is 80
percent reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan to do the walls,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, Janet Donovan, for taking the time to reply, all of
which proves that the handyman's theory really does work.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I plan to put ceramic tile on my kitchen floor. There are
vinyl tiles there now. I was told to put down quarter-inch plywood
and install the ceramic tile with thin-set mortar. Is this a good
way?
</P>
<P>
   JACK DOHERTY, Natick, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. That is one way, and it is a good one, especially if you do
it yourself. If you put down the plywood, make it as even as
possible; that is, with no ridges or sudden changes in grade. An
even surface will allow tiles to be set flat and full against the
plywood and not rock over an uneven surface. If the tiles do rock,
they will break. That is a promise. As an extra precaution, the
smaller the tile, the less it will rock. So put in tiles that are 6
or 8 inches square.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to do it: Instead of plywood, use cement board,
which is one-half-inch thick and made of concrete. The tiles will
stick better on cement board with thin-set mortar than on plywood.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am putting in a hardwood floor in my kitchen. The boards
will be sanded, and then three coats of polyurethane varnish will
be applied. I read that hardwood floors should be put down in the
winter, when the boards are at their driest, to prevent the boards
from opening up when they dry. The floor will be installed in
mid-April; is that too late?
</P>
<P>
   MARY LYNN RITCHEY, Auburn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Not at all. The advice to have the boards installed in winter
was a general one, to ensure the boards are at their driest (and
smallest) when installed. The months to avoid laying the boards are
June, July, August, and September.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to fight those joints' opening up is to store the
boards in the house for two weeks before installation; this is to
allow the boards to become acclimated to the moisture in the house.
</P>
<P>
   A good way to get around all this is to install prefinished
boards, ones that have four or more coats of polyurethane on them.
Laid tightly, such prefinished boards will resist opening of the
joints.
</P>
<P>

BMW'S M COUPE _ A MITE ODD-LOOIKING, BUT OH SO FRISKY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There has been a remarkable ebb and flow in America's
relationship with the sports car _ foreign or domestic, roadster or
coupe _ for nearly 50 years now.
</P>
<P>
   Some old standards _ Porsches and Corvettes _ have been
enduring; others have come and gone, or come and gone and come
again, or are new: the MG, the Nissan Z models, Jaguars, Volvos, a
funky Saab, the Mazda Miata.
</P>
<P>
   Now we are in the midst of a dual-track revival. Mazda gave us
the Miata at the dawn of the 1990s and the roadster was reborn as
other manufacturers followed. Now comes at least a minirevival of
the coupe. BMW has produced the M coupe, descendant of its
roadster, Audi will have its TT coupe in showrooms in weeks, and
Nissan is bringing back the Z, 20 years after it was first
introduced.
</P>
<P>
   And if the M coupe is any example of what the meld of modern
technology and the old Italiante style of Gran Turismo sports car
can produce, enthusiasts are in for a choice of wild rides.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the 1999 M coupe is like taking a frisky puppy for a
walk on a leash; all that energy if you can harness it. But puppies
do not cost $41,800, as does this 3.2-liter rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: This is a driver's car. No one will buy it for
sheer utility and no one should. You do not need an inline
six-cylinder aluminum engine, with dual overhead cams and four
valves per cylinder stuffed (literally) into a 3,131-pound auto to
get to the store for milk. You do not need to accelerate from 0-60
in just over 5 seconds to be first away from a stoplight on your
morning commute, or take a sweeping highway entrance ramp at 80
m.p.h. or click into fifth as you hit the highway and feel the
puppy ready to leap because there is plenty more energy there.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in some ways, an odd-looking car: fenders bulging like
muscles, long hood jutting like a bully's chin, short cab abruptly
chopped at the rear. Some have said it looks like a roller-skate.
Others are reminded of the Volvo 1800. I prefer to think of it as
an MGB-GT on steroids.
</P>
<P>
   When a muscle car accelerates, it pushes you straight back in
your seat as if you were riding a rocket sled. High performance
cars are different: They seem to suck you down into the seat as
they crouch ever lower on the road, and that is what the M coupe
does as you accelerate through the tight clicks of its 5-speed
manual transmission.
</P>
<P>
   In the windshield, the world comes at you like some video game,
darting ahead with a domain at your fingertips. Indeed, with many
of its controls _ lights, cruise control, directionals, wipers _
hidden on short stems behind the air-bag- filled center of the
steering wheel, this is a futuristic step toward the day when
driving will be much like operating a computer.
</P>
<P>
   With any high-performance sports car, corners are the crucible.
That is why we do not prefer to race them straight-ahead or
round-and-round. The M coupe is remarkable on the corners. Set the
inside front wheel to any line you wish to take through a corner,
power the turn with the gas pedal, and the coupe sticks to the arc
as if it's on a rail.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is a hardtop, this is a stiffer car than its
stablemate, the M3 roadster. It's got stiff springs, an anitroll
system, and an ABS keyed to vented disc brakes nearly a
foot-and-a-half in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   It is equipped with an automatic stability and traction control
system. In generic terms, that means that if it senses one of the
rear drive wheels spinning faster than the other _ as in losing it
on a corner, snow, ice, water, sand _ it cuts motor torque or
gently applies the brakes. A light flashes on the dash when you
reach this point. It is a simple circular arrow but means: Without
me, you'd be sideways right now. The daring can turn off this
system.
</P>
<P>
   With a wonderful guttural rumble from its exhausts, the M coupe
cruises the interstate on a commute to work with an effortless
ease, moving in and out of traffic, changing lanes nimbly. On
rougher roads _ frost-heaved pavement in New Hampshire and a
handful of dirt and gravel roads _ it is remarkably smooth. There
is none of the jarring you might expect from a small, stiff sports
car.
</P>
<P>
   Dirt roads and the lingering sand left on pavement from a winter
just past indicated, however, that this would not be a car you'd
want to rely on in the snow and ice. Tap the gas on these surfaces
and the ``you'd be sideways'' light comes on.
</P>
<P>
   It has been said of fine sports cars that you don't sit in them,
you wear them. That is the case with the M coupe. The leather seats
sit low to the floor and wrap thighs and shoulders. There are two
long pockets of leg room, though the roof is so low it is hard not
to wonder if someone with legs to fill those pockets would bang
their head on the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   And as futuristic as parts of the car seem, there are
wonderfully retro aspects to some of its interior design. Most of
the gauges are analog (wonderful to not confuse the time with the
call letters of the radio station you have on). They are each
circled in chrome and are reminiscent of older sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   Because it seats two and has airbags front and side, this is not
a car in which to transport children. Its rear compartment will
hold ample suitcases for a trip. On a trip to the recycling center,
it held four plastic bags of garbage, a week's worth of newspapers,
one grocery bag full of bottles, and another full of cans.
</P>
<P>
   Golfers beware: You cannot fit your clubs safely into this rear
compartment. But if you can afford this toy, you can afford to
belong to a club where you just leave your clubs in your locker.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
NICE TOUCHES:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --The 10- and-2-o'clock grips on the leather-wrapped wheel.
</P>
<P>
   --Windows on each door that open slightly each time the door is
opened and close only after the door is shut. No more surge of
eardrum pressure that comes when a door to a small compartment is
slammed.
</P>
<P>
   --The search-free, single, rectangular knob on each seat that
controls height and distance from the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   --The separation net that shields the driving compartment from
the rear storage.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --The cheap plastic box of a tiny console jammed between the
seats almost as if an afterthought. At $40,000 plus, I'd expect
wood or leather.
</P>
<P>
   --The way whatever aerodynamics are going on outside coat the
rear window with road dirt.
</P>
<P>
   --The sound of whistling wind at the tops of the doors at 60
m.p.h. and above.

MAKING AN 1896 PORCH AS GOOD AS NEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD PENNINGTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seemed a straightforward job.
</P>
<P>
   The front porch of our Queen Anne-style house, nicely designed
and built as these houses always are, needed new decking, stairs,
and railings. The lattice skirt under the deck had to be removed
and redesigned. The whole porch could use a bit of scraping and a
new coat of paint.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the wood dated from 1896 and it was as strong as ever.
The services of an architect were not required; a major rebuilding
was not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   My plan was to replace the decking with teak or mahogany, but
while searching for these materials, I came upon a similar
reddish-brown wood in the yard of Moynihan Lumber in Beverly, Mass.
It is called Cambara.
</P>
<P>
   My only surprise came when I ripped up the old fir deck. It had
rotted where rain had been collecting and water had seeped into the
six-inch-square beam that supported the deck. Carpenter ants had
tunneled into it until it was as light and frail as a feather.
</P>
<P>
   I decided not to replace it with a new six- by six-inch beam but
made up a beam from three 2 x 6 pressure-treated joists. I bolted
them together after filling the joints with roofing tar.
</P>
<P>
   Moisture is the enemy of wood, so I applied Thompson's Water
Seal to the now exposed joists and beams. Later I would use
caulking liberally wherever pieces of exposed wood were joined.
</P>
<P>
   A screw jack, a column with a big screw on the top, allowed me
to lift the corner post and the entryway off the decking, and made
it possible to slip the new Cambara boards underneath. I
blind-nailed galvanized nails into the tongue and groove decking. I
prefered not to have the end grains of the boards exposed, so I
finished off the ends with several tapered strips of Cambara,
cutting a drip groove along the bottom of the board so that the
water would fall away from the porch. I applied an oil-based primer
and stain to the deck. I don't trust water-based stains on flat
surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   I applied a new coat of mortar around the outside of the brick
pier that supports the deck porch beams, and I gave extra support
to the long beam by adding two posts.
</P>
<P>
   When designing the skirt below the deck I decided against the
usual lattice panels in favor of a row of vertical beveled strips
cut from cedar boards. I painted these strips gray to match the
color of the brick foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The original railings and balusters had been replaced years
earlier with 2 x 4s and 2 x 2s. I replaced these with wood more in
keeping with the original style of the house: slope-topped beaded
fir rails and turned hemlock balusters. The spacing of the
balusters posed a tricky problem in arithmetic. I ended up spacing
them 4 1/2 inches apart. I cut a channel in the underside of the
handrail to accept a subrail wood strip, to which I attached the
balusters.
</P>
<P>
   The cedar newel post is attached to the decking with two hidden
dowels.
</P>
<P>
   The large space under the porch provides a convenient place to
store an extension ladder and a kayak, if I ever get one. The
stairs detach from the porch to permit access to the space under
it.
</P>
<P>
   A Mission-style lamp purchased at Restoration Hardware in Boston
replaced the bare light bulb over the porch. I added another light
inside the foyer for security.
</P>
<P>
   The project did seem simple enough when I began, but in the end
I had spent well over 50 hours putting it together. Out of
curiosity I counted the pieces of wood: 233 had to be put in place,
many cut several ways for an exact fit.
</P>
<P>
   The materials cost about $1,300. The decking for the 12- by
7-foot porch came to $350; the Mission lamp was $100; and the 35
hemlock balusters cost $4.25 each, or $150. The cedar is costly,
$3.36 a board foot, but is worth it, considering the fact that the
skirt is close to the ground. Even clear pine costs $3.08 a board
foot.
</P>
<P>
   A good table saw is indispensible for a project like this. It
might not have been necessary, but I sanded all materials before I
finished them. One extremely useful tool proved to be a handheld
grinder, which I used to cut stubborn nails and screws.
</P>
<P>
   A handy guide is ``The Book of Ideas for Porch Design'' by J.
Gregory Tatsch (Vintage Wood Works, Quinlan, Texas; telephone

WHEN TO WEAN? WHEN IT FEELS NATURAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the reasons a mother may give for wanting to wean her
baby, lactation specialist Lisa McSherry says only two really mean
a mother is done nursing: ``I'm tired of having a baby draped over
me'' or ``I want my body back.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything else, she says, is ambivalence, and for these women,
her advice is to continue to nurse. ``Sooner or later, the
ambivalence disappears and weaning is easy,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In our Western culture, where autonomy is highly valued even in
young children, it's not surprising that women feel torn about
weaning. To many fathers as well as some pediatricians and
grandparents, a 2-year-old who's still nursing is a child who isn't
being allowed to grow up. To the nursing mother, however,
breast-feeding describes a relationship, not just a source of
nutrition. The societal norm to give it up can feel like pressure,
and even a loving husband can become an antagonist.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a habit that needs to be quit,'' says Gale Pryor,
author of ``Nursing Mother, Working Mother: The Essential Guide for
Breastfeeding'' (Harvard Common Press).
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, pediatrician and parenting author T. Berry Brazelton
says weaning is a developmental process, like walking or talking:
It happens when it happens, on a timetable that has little to do
with our wishes or needs.
</P>
<P>
   He agrees with the recommendation of the American Academy of
Pediatrics that nursing last through the first year for the medical
benefits and emotional closeness it continues to accrue.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many mothers stop earlier because they think
their child is telling them to. ``At five months, a baby may turn
away, and parents take it as a signal he doesn't want to nurse
anymore. That's mistaken,'' says Brazelton. The turning away is not
a loss of interest, it's a burst of cognitive development as the
baby becomes more curious about the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to plow through that period and nurse in a dark,
quiet spot to minimize distractions,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Your baby will tell you when she's ready to stop nursing, but
it's far more likely to be during the second year.

   Linnea Warburton was 12 1/2 months old when she let her mother
know. ``She was walking more and becoming more active, and she was
so busy, she'd forget to come to me to nurse,'' says her mother,
Betty Gau. As her meals became more substantial, Linnea also
stopped asking to nurse in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, without any effort on Gau's part, they were nursing
only once a day, first thing in the morning. Then one morning, when
Linnea slept late, there was no time for the feeding in Mama's bed.
``We just took her right downstairs for breakfast, and she didn't
ask to nurse that day,'' says Gau. ``It was pretty clear she was
done. That began to become our routine.''
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks have passed since then. At first, Gau anxiously
awaited Linnea's tug on her shirt, her baby's signal that she
wanted to nurse. It hasn't happened even once.
</P>
<P>
   This is close to Pryor's ideal: a child initiates weaning
because she's expanded her ability to comfort herself and is ready
to have a different kind of relationship with Mom.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't necessarily what Gau had in mind, though.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, she had a difficult time nursing; her goal was to
keep at it for only six months. As things improved, she decided to
stay with it for another six. When she evaluated at a year, she
says simply, ``I wasn't ready to give it up.'' Two weeks later,
when it was Linnea who initiated weaning, Gau was not only
surprised but emotionally unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was incredibly sad, and I still am sometimes,'' she says,
fighting back tears. ``But I can see how excited she is at all the
new things in her life, so I have to move on, too. I wish there was
a ritual to mark this, though. It's such a moment in time, such a
significant life passage.''
</P>
<P>
   This sense of loss is normal, says Diane Bengson, a leader and
spokeswoman for La Leche League International and author of a
forthcoming League book, ``How Weaning Happens.'' She says mothers
who are saddest are those who are nursing a last baby; who
struggled with breast-feeding to begin with; who nurse to provide
comfort as well as nutrition; who wean quickly and have hormones
that haven't adjusted; or who feel pressured to stop. The last
group worries her most.
</P>
<P>
   Bengson says a woman's sense of loss is less intense when
weaning is on her timetable. When pressure comes from a husband,
especially one who was supportive of breast-feeding, there is
confusion and anger. She cites four reasons a dad may push to end
breast-feeding:
</P>
<P>
   --He's tired of sharing his wife with the baby and hopes for a
resumption of the pre-baby sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   --He feels insecure or unsure of his role as a father.
</P>
<P>
   --He thinks nursing is encouraging too much dependency in the
baby.
</P>
<P>
   --He's uncomfortable with public nursing.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, Bengson urges couples to be honest and talk
it through, lest resentment build. ``Look for ways to compromise,''
she says. ``If he's uncomfortable when you nurse in public, can you
keep it private? If he feels lost, can you carve out a specialty
for him, like bathing the baby?''
</P>
<P>
   An emotionally healthier path to weaning is mother-initiated,
although if you begin when a baby is under 12 months, it can be
difficult. ``The breasts are more likely to get engorged,'' says
McSherry, who works at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in
Boston. If a woman wants to wean in the first year as a
prerequisite for returning to work, McSherry recommends taking a
minimum of a month to accomplish it, with at least three days
between each dropped feeding.
</P>
<P>
   Pryor argues that working moms should be last to wean. ``Nursing
provides a connection despite the daily separation. It builds
confidence for a working mother,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Weinstein, a lawyer, went back to work when daughter
Katrina was 5 months old but she continued to nurse full time,
pumping twice a day. When Katrina turned a year, Weinstein weaned
gradually, over three months. Like Gau, she feels sad, even six
months later. ``Nursing guaranteed snuggle time. I miss the bond it
provided,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps with that in mind, she wasn't rigid about weaning. For
instance, when they were down to only one feeding a day and Katrina
took sick and wanted to nurse on demand, Weinstein complied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much milk I had, but the nursing gave her
comfort. I didn't see a reason not to,'' she says. Once Katrina was
well, she adds, they easily resumed weaning.
</P>
<P>
   Pryor says this kind of approach feeds into a child's
developmental need. ``If he falls and wants to nurse for comfort,
that's appropriate,'' she says. Relaxed weaning _ for three days
you drop a feeding, the fourth you don't, and then you do again _
comes easier if nursing wasn't on a time schedule, either.
</P>
<P>
   When you wean gradually, a toddler may not even miss it, says
Pryor. For the times when he does, you can:
</P>
<P>
   --Nurse, but keep it short: ``We can nurse for as long as it
takes to sing the `ABC' song.''
</P>
<P>
   --Offer choices: ``You can nurse or have chocolate milk/read a
book/play a game.''
</P>
<P>
   --Defer it: ``We're not going to nurse now, but we can do it
before your nap.'' Avoid saying simply, ``Not now'' or ``No.'' That
can confuse a child: ``Why is Mommy acting differently?'' Even
``Mommy doesn't want to nurse now,'' said kindly, is OK.
</P>
<P>
   Pryor, who is in the process of weaning her 22-month-old son,
sometimes tell him, `` `My breasts are empty now; let's get a glass
of milk.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He accepts that just fine,'' she says.
</P>

SPRING DETOXIFYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget spring cleaning. The dirt can stay where it is.
</P>
<P>
   This year I'm performing an exorcism instead, ridding my home of
threats to my family's health. I don't know why it's taken me so
long to act on my knowledge that the American home is filled with
products containing toxic chemicals. A recent five-year EPA study
found peak concentrations of 20 toxic compounds _ some linked with
cancer and birth defects _ 100 to 200 times higher indoors than
outdoors. It's no wonder women who stay at home have a higher
cancer-death rate than women who go to work.
</P>
<P>
   I'm finally ready to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   I'll start under the sink with my all-purpose cleaners,
including one that proclaims itself ``environmentally safe,
non-toxic, biodegradable, and phosphate free.'' I've been blithely
spraying this on my shower walls without using rubber gloves or
worrying about the fumes, even though our bathroom window doesn't
open. The label, however, reveals that this product contains butyl
cellosolve, which according to David Steinman and Samuel Epstein,
authors of ``The Safe Shopper's Bible: A Consumer's Guide to
Nontoxic Household Products, Cosmetics and Food,'' is a neurotoxin
that rapidly penetrates the skin. I don't want it in my house.
</P>
<P>
   Out goes every spot remover and glass, tile, carpet, and oven
cleaner whose labels disguise hazardous ingredients by calling them
``cleaning agents'' and ``grease cutters.'' I'm also ditching my
antibacterial liquid soaps and ``improved'' pot scrubbers imbued
with the fungicide triclosan, a derivative of Agent Orange. Since
the law doesn't require companies to list the cancer-causing
chemicals commonly found in household products, why expose myself
unnecessarily? They're headed for the trash.
</P>
<P>
   I'm also getting rid of my aerosol products. I don't need to
have what's in them delivered to my lungs in an easily inhaled
mist. Out goes every product with the following words: ``harmful
fumes,'' ``eye irritation,'' ``use rubber gloves,'' and my
favorite, ``contact a physician.'' With cases of multiple chemical
sensitivity on the rise, I'm removing all products that can
irritate my eyes, skin, or respiratory tract.
</P>
<P>
   In the bathroom I'm tossing out all my old nail polish. Those
characteristic fumes you can't help but inhale as you paint your
fingernails are laced with toluene, a poison with serious
reproductive effects, including spontaneous abortion and birth
defects. California has banned its use so now you can actually find
nail polish labeled, ``Toluene free.'' How come they'll tell us
it's gone, but not that it was there in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that cosmetics are the least regulated products in
the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Who knew that even the
most expensive of them contain dangerous wetting agents,
preservatives, colorings, pesticides, talc, silica, and
formaldehyde, which can cause contact dermatitis, allergies, tissue
irritation, or cancer?
</P>
<P>
   I've always considered my reluctance to wear make-up a fault. I
may have done myself a favor.
</P>
<P>
   I know why I've held back from doing this sooner. I couldn't
believe that companies would promote products that harmed their
customers. A childlike part of me wanted to think that some
all-knowing parent was watching out for my interests. It's taken
years for me to face that I, and others like me, are the only
people I can trust to look out for my interests. Everyone's
reaching the same conclusion. Even a middle-of-the-road magazine
like Time recently stated that ``industry develops products for
their physical characteristics and doesn't always test for human
toxicity.'' It concludes that current tests for dangerous
substances are ``being conducted on involuntary human
populations.''
</P>
<P>
   This spring, I stop being a guinea pig.
</P>
<P>
   It's not going to make my life more difficult. With the ``Safe
Shopper's Bible'' in hand, I'm going to a supermarket like Bread
and Circus or Wild Harvest and, checking the labels carefully,
stocking up on brand names given a seal of approval. One careful
shop and I'm done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Safe Shopper's Bible'' is full of do-it-yourself recipes.
I plan to whip up my own all-purpose cleaner from borax, vinegar,
soap and water, to deodorize my house with strategically placed
boxes of baking soda, and to polish my furniture with vinegar and
olive oil. If this seems like a step back to the good old days, so
be it.
</P>
<P>
   Let people call me names. How about pioneer?
</P>

(poetry style 
 
Here's to the mud, the dried leaves and crud, 
here's to the detritus of last season. 
Here's to our dreams, drawn out in schemes, 
here's to complete loss of reason. 
 
(end poetry style) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spring comes in fits and starts. The gardener, at least this
gardener, rushes out on a lovely warm day in March (40 degrees,
gusty, intermittent sun) to survy the domain.
</P>
<P>
   GardenPathways
</P>
<P>
   This leads to catalog orders (not to mention illness), stoking
the gardening ambition that has smoldered all winter. Later forays,
in better weather, reveal the true, tattered condition of the
garden, necessitating another round of purchases.
</P>
<P>
   While more is clearly needed of this and that, we must have
replacements for the English roses that evidently were not planted
deeply enough to survive the winter (lack of snow cover left
vulnerable bud unions between understock and desirable cultivars
exposed).
</P>
<P>
   Bergenias bit the dust, too, and where did those geraniums go? I
see just two, no, three, of the six I planted last year. Those on
order, intended to extend the presence of geraniums, will simply
mark time until I can obtain even more. On the other hand, the
lamb's ears are just ducky.
</P>
<P>
   From April on, it rains every weekend, of course _ is there some
way we can blame the Red Sox for this? _ and when it isn't raining,
the ground is too soggy to be worked. Digging destroys the soil's
tilth, and just walking on grassy paths and lawn causes destructive
soil compaction.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually I sally forth, pruners hanging from my belt, gripping
a rake in one hand and in the other toting large heavy-duty plastic
bags designed to hold and transport debris.
</P>
<P>
   The yellow garden needs raking. Oak leaves are specially formed
to burrow their way deep into santolina and cactus (and cotoneaster
is a nightmare). Out they must come and into the bags. The only way
is to start at one end and work to the other, then on to the next
bed, and the next.
</P>
<P>
   While I work in the front beds, I have loosed the hounds on the
backyard. Tessie noses clean through the screen in the back door
and returns to bed. (Is she a bad dog or smarter than me?) Lucy
goes the other way, wiggling under the back fence and making for
either the husky next door (Lucy's intentions are unclear) or the
woods and swamp on the other side. I know when she chooses the
latter because the yappy beast two houses down goes bazoo. Lucy is
a 120-pound Newfoundland and to the yapmeister must look for all
the world to be a large bear emerging from the woods, probably
hungry.
</P>
<P>
   After a successful bear hunt, I return to gardening.
Distractions are a gardener's lot, and the next is an inquisitive
neighbor asking what kind of tree that is. She is pointing to a
large hunk of ornamental grass. I need to whack it down to the
ground to make way for new growth, and it is overdue for dividing.
Slyly I suggest that she could have some for free if she'd like to
help in the division. We shall see.
</P>
<P>
   The ornamental plum that is bedeviled with black knot, a fungal
disease, is almost gone now. I hack off all the diseased parts, and
perhaps it will spring back to life from the sparse sprouts that
remain. Otherwise, I will be acquiring that lacecap hydrangea I
have wanted for several years.
</P>
<P>
   The apple tree undergoes its regular butchery, this year another
large, high branch removed to let in light, while smaller branches
that drag the ground also are removed, along with watersprouts.
</P>
<P>
   Peonies are spring, but first the old foliage must go and wire
rings installed above them to keep the heavy stems of the new
plants from flopping. I take care to not disturb the swelling buds
rising from the crowns. Each stake of each ring strikes a rock, but
eventually I shove them firmly in place.
</P>
<P>
   Roses require pruning (they also require a measure of blood),
sweetpeas demand a dollop of composted manure where I plant them,
and squirrels just insist on replanting certain bulbs (I am
positive I did not stick crocuses in the herb garden).
</P>
<P>
   Yes, like dogs, gardening is demanding. But there is enjoyment,
too, as we face our spring tasks. Even as we toil, we see. The
bulbs that went in last fall are up and glorious. Many, many
daffodils, delicate snowdrops under a dwarf blue spruce, cheery
yellow winter aconite here and there. The furry catkins on the
pussy willow bring smiles, and the spread of violets throughout the
lawn makes us beam.
</P>
<P>
   As old friends emerge, we forget winter's losses and glory in
the season aborning.

U.S. TOUR COULD TURN CREE SUMMER INTO HOT STUFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - In December, singer and sometime actress Cree Summer
opened for Lenny Kravitz on his European tour. In many ways, she
considers it one of the most terrifying experiences in her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lights would go black,'' Summer recalls, on the phone from
her home in the Hollywood Hills. ``Like 15,000 people in the
audience think Lenny is coming out. Then here I come, and everybody
is like, `Who the (expletive) is that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   History probably won't repeat itself next week in Phoenix, when
Summer does the honors again for the recent Grammy winner. She's
familiar to sitcom viewers from her run as the idealistic Freddie
on ``ADifferent World'' as well as her voice-over work on the
animated ``Rugrats'' and ``Tiny Toons.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't get nightmarish visions of another Tatyana Ali assaulting
the radio waves. Summer's enchanting ``Street Faerie'' disc is a
cool, refreshing taste of retro-minded soul and sensual rock.
Production chores are handled by her pal Kravitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your friends push you,'' Summer enthuses. ``When I'm working
with strangers, I can get a little timid or scared. With friends,
I'm willing to try anything, because there's a lot of trust
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old Summer, a self-proclaimed daughter of a couple
of hippies, grew up on a Canadian Indian reservation. She has a
trippy, bohemian way of talking that is engaging. Same thing goes
for her music, which is delicately spiritual in nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just inspired by music,'' she says. ``I just talked to
this chick the other day, and she told me she draws every day. I
felt like putting a pencil in my eye! On the one hand, it's really
mystical. On the other hand, it's really frustrating because I'm
completely at the mercy of the muse.''
</P>
<P>
   Her songs spring to life as poems, then music is added later.
Inspiration comes from the strangest places; for example, imagine
the birth process of the swirling ``Soul Sister.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lenny and I picked the songs according to how we felt each
day,'' she recalls. ``One day I showed up with this T-shirt that
said `Soul Sister.' There was no rhyme or reason for anything _
that's why I liked the process so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Summer and Kravitz go back a long way. She's also friends with
Lisa Bonet, star of ``A Different World'' (a ``Cosby Show''
spinoff) and Kravitz's ex. Apparently it was an amicable split,
because Bonet directed Summer's first video and was involved in the
album's recording in the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we did was laugh, talk, (expletive) and write,'' Summer
says. ``It was just a gas. I feel so safe that way. When you sit
around and share your dreams with your friends, just talking smack
about the stuff you're going to do . . . when it happens, it just
blows your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The disc hit streets last week, the realization of her dream.
But it's not her first time in the studio. She cut an album for
Capitol Records in the early '90s and toured behind the disc.
Ultimately, the album never was released.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad that happened,'' she says. ``At the time, it was
horrible. But now, for this record, I'm not going in green. I know
my way around the studio. I knew what I was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To think back about making a record in my early 20s, when
you're young and righteous and your writing is just (expletive). I
think I lucked out that it never got released.''
</P>
<P>
   She focuses exclusively on ``Street Faerie'' material in her
shows. After surviving the European dates, she's looking forward to
seeing how American crowds will react.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nerve-racking enough singing in front of 150 people, let
alone 15,000,'' she says. ``I mean, even my eyebrows were
sweating.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, while audiences responded positively to her music, there
was a different reaction when she simply walked around the streets
of the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere I went, the people thought I was Scary Spice,''
says the big-haired Summer, spitting out the words. ``People get
locked on to something and they don't care, but they all thought I
was Scary Spice.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, other than the awe-inspiring hair, she doesn't
resemble the Brit hitmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for that, honey!'' she says with a laugh. ``And
thank you, Lord! That is one woman I don't want to look like.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen. &QL;

LESSONS FROM COLORADO: BOMB THE TELEVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The real world didn't become defined by
television until my junior year in high school when a lone gunman
(or so I believe) killed our president.
</P>
<P>
   Then the real world, as filtered through TV, began being defined
by a series of lone gunmen. TV and lone gunmen sort of grew up
together.
</P>
<P>
   This week TV and reality were redefined by an organized,
uniformed club of lone gunmen at a high school.
</P>
<P>
   The high prince of all lone gunmen, celebrated in movies, books
and continued conversation, was Charles Whitman, who climbed the
tower at the University of Texas and shot 15 people to death.
</P>
<P>
   That was on Aug. 1, 1966, and I even remember where I was at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   I was a patient in the Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland, then
filled with wounded, embittered teen-age Marines. A few crazy ones
talked about what weapons they would have taken to the tower.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman had some hunting rifles and a shotgun. One Marine I knew
said he could have done better with an M-60 machine gun and a
grenade launcher.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that these guys at Bethesda were evil, or that they
would have done anything. That's just the way the inflamed and
bored male teen-age mind sometimes works.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, teen-agers don't commit a fraction of the homicides
that adults think they do. Unless the adults send them to war.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the occasional evil teen-age mind or two.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, only nine people were killed this school year
in American schools, down from 55 in 1992. School is a safer place
to be than home. School buses kill more children than guns. School
lunches may be more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly 13 more people have been killed in one school by two
young gunmen who then took their lives. But 200 million people were
watching.
</P>
<P>
   Visceral horror outweighs statistics. We don't like to believe
statistics. We slurp up horror. The scale of this horror outweighs
even a growing and vicious war in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   All over America, people will tell you TV coverage of the
massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., was
sensationalistic, and it was.
</P>
<P>
   But the people still watch, and TV still serves it up. The
coverage may increase black trench coat sales and put strange ideas
in disturbed teen-age minds. Maybe a few will talk about what
weapons they would have brought into school.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of stuff definitely will appear on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Things were different before Lee Harvey Oswald, Charles Whitman
and the Vietnam War, the failure of which gave us Rambo, Soldier of
Fortune magazine and paramilitary culture, or ``Warrior Dreams,''
as James William Gibson titled his great book on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, my friends and I hated the popular kids and they
hated us. We owned guns. But we didn't shoot anyone. Our .22s were
for shooting rats at the town dump. Our parents made us work and
kept us in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   When we wanted revenge on the popular kids, we ambushed them
with snowballs. We drove the football players crazy by starting a
soccer club. No American played soccer in the early 1960s. It was
the sport of outcasts, and we wore funny shorts and knee socks.
</P>
<P>
   We knew high school was stupid and the only acceptable stance
was to be different.
</P>
<P>
   There were no video games. The most violent movie was
``Psycho,'' and my mom wouldn't let me see it. We had heard about
Charlie Starkweather and his girlfriend, Caril Ann Fugate, driving
around the country killing people in 1958. They were later
celebrated by the 1973 movie, ``Badlands.''
</P>
<P>
   We have immortalized our psychopaths since the days of Billy the
Kid. If CNN had been around in Wild West times, it would have had a
bureau in Dodge City.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a pair of teen-age lone gunmen blew a
multibillion-dollar war off the front pages. They got what they
wanted, going out in a blaze of gunfire with vengeance for God
knows what slights.
</P>
<P>
   This week, many Americans sounded like Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, when he commented on the massacre in Colorado,
saying, ``Violence is obviously the only principle and value which
the American society knows, unfortunately for its youth and future
generations.''
</P>
<P>
   You have to admit, the timing was atrocious. President Clinton
was saying that our children need to be taught to ``resolve their
conflicts with words, not weapons,'' just as his cruise missiles
hit a high-rise building in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   We've been getting our heads whipped back and forth between
aerial video of falling bombs and aerial pictures of children
fleeing a high school in terror.
</P>
<P>
   But we know Milosevic is wrong when he says violence is our only
value. So why are so many Americans bemoaning our supposedly
murderous culture?
</P>
<P>
   I'm critical of our air war in the Balkans, but I would never
say it is being waged for the sake of violence. Neither would I say
that our culture is corrupt or our children hopelessly vicious.
</P>
<P>
   The homicide rate is falling nationwide, but rising
precipitously on television. One study shows murders increased 721
percent on network news between 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   If you own a gun, keep it locked away from children. But first
shoot your TV.

 (s and a coding)  
 BELMONT, Mass.: ... 19-year-old prospect.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Riding on a godforsaken old school bus _ ``built for
sixth-graders,'' recalls Bonnell _ through sweltering Carolina
nights from one obscure outpost to another, Bonnell would read the
Book of Mormon, and curious teammates would approach him, asking
questions. Bonnell noticed that Murphy was a listener, though, not
a questioner. So one night he got on the bus after Murphy, sat next
to him, and began reading, illuminated by a fishing flashlight. He
and Murphy quickly struck up a dialogue, and the next morning at
the team's roach motel, Bonnell asked Murphy if e would like to
pursue the discussion with a couple of Mormon missionaries. The
answer was yes. The day after the season, Bonnell baptized Murphy
into the church.
</P>
<P>
   Mormons don't drink or smoke or curse, and Murphy acknowledges,
``I had to make some changes in my lifestyle,'' though he won't
elaborate. At any rate, it doesn't seem that a dramatic overhaul
was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd drink a beer every now and then before,'' says Bonnell,
``but Dale was never a runaround guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonnell recalls that Murphy's conversion occurred during a time
of Christian reawakening, athletes included, and that
``nondenominational Christianity became so big that it got to be
like a denomination. On Sundays, we'd hold services before the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Murphy is emphatic in dismissing the widespread
notion that religion and competition don't mix, that being devout
is at odds with being a winner. ``Competitiveness is not an
un-Christian thing,'' he says. ``You can be competitive and a good
sport. Maybe I wasn't outwardly emotional about the game _ I was
never one to show emotion just for the sake of showing emotion _
but believe me, if we lost, I'd kick the water cooler. If I had to
take a guy out at second, I'd take him out. If I'd been a pitcher,
I'd have knocked you down if I felt it was necessary. I tried to
have a level of intensity. You can't play without a fire burning
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   The proof was in the 1982 and '83 MVP Awards, the two NL home
run and RBI titles, the five 30-homer and 100-RBI seasons Murphy
accumulated while earning a reputation as one of the game's
courtliest gentlemen.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When he retired in 1993 after a couple of months with the
Rockies _ ``I figured that if I couldn't hit home runs in Denver, I
couldn't hit home runs, period'' _ Murphy was adrift. Despite
standing offers of an organizational job from the Braves, Phillies,
and Rockies, ``I kind of by design wanted to get away from
baseball,'' he says. He did some public speaking and endorsements,
spent a year in Atlanta, then moved with his wife, Nancy _ a native
of Utah and lifelong Mormon whom he'd met during a semester at
Brigham Young University in 1978 _ to the town of Alpine, between
Salt Lake City and Provo. While helping to raise seven sons and a
daughter who now range in age from 5 to 18, he was still casting
about for something he could immerse himself in when, as Murphy
recounts it, something almost mystical occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the mission presidents have three-year terms, about 100
become vacant every year,'' he says. ``Someone _ I have no idea who
_ nominated me. I went through the interview process, and one of
the 12 church leaders called and asked to see us. Nancy and I had
no idea what it was about.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his recruitment lacked the intrigue Murphy suspects.
Boyd K. Packer, a former Boston Mission president who now is
president of the 12 apostles (leaders), was the man who contacted
Murphy. ``We keep track of men as we travel around who have the
spirit and capacity to relate to young men in particular, who know
the gospel, and are stable in their professional and family
circumstances,'' explains Packer. ``Everybody knew Dale Murphy. It
was well known that he had served in callings for the church.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Murphys met with Packer and he told them Dale was under
consideration for a mission presidency, ``it was the most surprised
and honored Nancy and I had ever been,'' says Dale.
</P>
<P>
   His lack of a business background was not considered a
deterrent. ``We have mission presidents from all walks of life,''
says Packer.
</P>
<P>
   His fame could have been. ``Some celebrities are celebrities,''
says Packer. ``When Dale looks in the mirror, he doesn't see a
celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Until July 2000, when Murphy looks in the mirror, he will see
the president of the Boston Mission. After that, he's not sure.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His only connection with baseball now is as an assistant coach
on his 11-year-old son Travis's Little League team, the Red Sox.
``I'm in charge of hitting,'' he says. ``We'd better hit this year.
I've never felt such pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Murphy is a magnet on the diamond. The kids listen
raptly as he delivers the same message countless other coaches have
passed along to deaf ears. And when he provides individual
attention for a would-be slugger, the fathers gawk and elbow one
another: ``That's Dale Murphy.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't know whether he'll resume a professional affiliation
with the game; despite those standing offers, ``I don't know about
the fit.'' One thing he's sure about: His dream destination is
Cooperstown. This year, his first for Hall of Fame eligibility, he
received 96 of the 373 votes required for induction. ``I thought
about it a lot this year and I'll think about it a lot next year,''
he says. ``I think I have a chance. I have some borderline
statistics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonnell can envision a future in the church for Murphy as one of
the general authorities, ``although if you ask Dale, he'll deny it
because he's so humble. That's why he'd be perfect for the job.
What you see is exactly what he is _ a gentlemanly, wonderful
man.''

FOR PARENTS, A TIME TO TALK _ AND LISTEN

   One of the biggest mistakes we can make as parents in dealing
with the Littleton, Colo., murders is to think or hope that our
children haven't heard about the tragedy and thus to say nothing.
This would send a message that it's unimportant or that we don't
care. It also leaves room for children to imagine awful
possibilities, including the scariest thought of all: ``This could
happen in my school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the fear children of all ages have and they all need a
chance to get it out,'' says Cornell University psychologist James
Garbarino, an authority on the impact of violence on children.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is not to say too much to preschoolers or too little
to adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   Preschoolers. Find out what he already knows, says psychologist
Diane Levin, a professor at Wheelock College. A good opener:
``There was something on the news about teenagers. Did you hear
about it?'' If your child says no, you could say, ``Some teenagers
got hurt, but everyone is taken care of now.'' If she says yes,
here are some points to make:
</P>
<P>
   --It happened in a place far from here. Children ages 3 to 5
don't have a good grasp of time and distance, so they personalize
details, says psychologist Susan Linn of the Judge Baker Children's
Center in Boston. Reassure them about their safety: ``Your school
is safe.''
</P>
<P>
   --It makes you sad. Sadness may be the only thing that
differentiates this event from violence they may see on TV. If we
don't talk about our feelings, it increases the likelihood that
children become accepting of violence.
</P>
<P>
   --You don't know why it happened. Levin suggests saying,
``People are working to make sure this never happens again.''
</P>
<P>
   School-age. Even if you discussed it Wednesday, start a
conversation today: ``I`m wondering what you've heard.'' The 6- to
12-year-old's response can be confusing. She may grill you for
details, then run out to play. ``It's too threatening for them to
stay with the thoughts for long,'' says psychologist Sandra
Graham-Bermann of the University of Michigan. Don't push her to
talk, but don't be surprised if in a day she's fearful (``Will bad
kids come to my school?'') or angry (``Why couldn't adults stop
it?'')
</P>
<P>
   --Validate her feelings and share your own: ``I don't blame you
for being angry/upset/sad. I am too.'' Letting her vent can be a
source of comfort. Let her experience your compassion: ``My heart
goes out to those parents.''
</P>
<P>
   --Keep communication open. Answer honestly what you can but feel
comfortable saying, ``I don't know. If I hear more, I'll tell
you.'' If he's not talking, the third-person may be less
threatening: ``I know some kids worry about their school.''
</P>
<P>
   --Find truthful ways to reassure about safety. School vacation
this week could cause children to worry either more or less. Some
children may not be troubled today, but come Monday, they won't
want to go to school. Assume the refusal is related, says Linn of
the Judge Baker center. Say, ``I wonder if you're worried about
safety. Let's talk to the principal.''
</P>
<P>
   --Distinguish between behavior and dress. Because school-age
children think concretely, they may assume that anyone who wears a
black raincoat is a bad person. ``They need to hear you say that
(wearing unusual clothes) doesn't mean a person is bad,'' Levin
says.
</P>
<P>
   Teenagers. Because of his age group's melodramatic impulse, a
17-year-old may say, ``I'm going to carry a weapon from now on'' or
``I'm dropping lacrosse because athletes were targeted.'' Don't get
caught up in it, says Garbarino of Cornell University; it's
probably masking worry and fear. The more you can tolerate what
they say with simple responses (``I know how you feel, this is very
scary''), the sooner you can get to the feeling itself. Also:
</P>
<P>
   --If your teen isn't talking, let him know you're always
available or that you hope there's another adult he'll talk to.
</P>
<P>
   --Watch TV with her, read the articles she reads, visit the same
Web sites. It can be a starting point for a conversation.
</P>
<P>
   --Share your feelings even if he isn't sharing his, including
worries about the spread of violence in our society.
</P>
<P>
   --Talk about peers who may be troubled and how to help them.
</P>
<P>
   Garbarino says that teens who are contending with other issues _
parents divorcing, a recent breakup with a girlfriend or boyfriend,
a death in the family _ need particular attention.
</P>
<P>
   With any child, he advises, have a family dinner tonight and a
moment of silence or a prayer. ``After the initial hunger for
information, kids need the chance to be reflective with you.''

<P>
   BELMONT, Mass. _ A large scythe leans against the wall in the
far corner of his office, just as a bat once rested against the
back of his locker.
</P>
<P>
   The former has replaced the latter in his arsenal, but his
current teammates needn't fear for their safety. Dale Murphy does
not wield this implement as he once did a Louisville Slugger while
winning two consecutive National League Most Valuable Player awards
and clubbing 398 home runs during a 14-year career from which he
emerged as a borderline Hall of Fame candidate. The scythe is
purely symbolic. ``It's the analogy of harvesting souls,'' says
Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   He is responsible for an extensive crop in his latest line of
work _ volunteer work, that is. Like all but a handful of others
who serve the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints,
popularly known as Mormons, Murphy receives no compensation in his
role as president of the Boston Mission. During his three-year
tour, which began in July 1997, he gets a house, a car, a food
allowance, and a dizzying array of duties. ``This is the most
challenging thing I've ever done,'' says Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   So pardon the mess. Sifting through the clutter on his desk in
the corner office of an eight-room downtown suite that houses the
Boston Mission's administration, Murphy laughs and says, ``It looks
like my locker. My teammates would be quite familiar with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they probably wouldn't. The few vestiges of baseball _
a Norman Rockwell illustration of some kids engaged in a sandlot
dialogue; a couple of plastic figurines from a birthday cake; a bat
from Cooperstown sent by a friend _ are overwhelmed by the
trappings of his calling. Behind his chair is a large portrait of
Christ. A Bible sits atop his slide drawer. His desk is piled with
reports and Mormon literature and little colored pieces of sticky
paper that facilitate his major undertaking: overseeing 209
missionaries throughout Massachusetts and parts of New Hampshire,
Rhode Island, Vermont, and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like the supervisor,'' says Murphy, 43. ``I help, I train,
I educate, I see how they're doing. We help find them apartments
and provide them cars.''
</P>
<P>
   He readily acknowledges that he is far afield from his career as
an All-Star, Gold Glove outfielder spent primarily with the Atlanta
Braves before brief end-of-the-line stops in Philadelphia and
Colorado. He likens it to facing Nolan Ryan every day, and a look
at the wall across from his desk bears this out. It resembles a
strategic map in a war room, except that this one is dotted with
small pictures of each missionary in Murphy's jurisdiction. They
are placed under headings that identify their territories; each
photo is accompanied by an index card listing hometown, age, and
other pertinent background information, along with a slip of
stick-'em paper indicating months of service.
</P>
<P>
   These missionaries _ mostly young men and women, with a
sprinkling of couples whose children have grown or who have no
children _ are charged with spreading the word of God as revealed
to church founder Joseph Smith in the 1820s and contained in the
Book of Mormon, subtitled, ``Another Testament of Jesus Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bible is part of our canonized Scripture,'' says Murphy,
``and we believe in something more. We believe that God the Father
came to Joseph Smith and said the true church of Christ was not on
Earth at the time, that it had been gone roughly since the deaths
of the apostles.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the strongly committed need apply. The typical missionary's
day begins at 6:30 a.m. and includes two hours of religious study
followed by 12 hours of proselytizing in pairs _ until 9:30 each
night _ with lights out at 10:30. During their terms, missionaries
cannot watch television, read newspapers and magazines, listen to
popular music, or date. They receive no compensation; in fact, they
are required to provide $375 monthly toward expenses.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the missionary term is two years for men, 1 1/2 for
women, and no one is allowed a second tour of duty. ``It's so
rigorous,'' says Murphy. ``It's very challenging. The challenge is
to find people receptive to the message of who we are: Christian,
family-oriented, service-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is no shortage of applicants, culled from a church
membership numbering some 10 million worldwide. The popular
perception is that the Mormon stronghold is Salt Lake City, and the
church indeed is headquartered there. But Murphy points out that
less than half the Utah capital's population is now Mormon (perhaps
they've been displaced by International Olympic Committee members),
and more than 50 percent of the church's constituency is outside
the United States. That's one reason the Book of Mormon can be
found in 42 languages, from Albanian to Zulu, in one of the Boston
Mission's offices.
</P>
<P>
   There are some 300 missions, some 60,000 missionaries, and
Murphy has noticed a transformation among those in his purview.
``When they start, they're out of their comfort zone,'' he says.
``But from a reluctance to being here, they go through a change,
and eventually, they're reluctant to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   That easily could describe Murphy's Mormon journey.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Portland, Ore., and raised in the Presbyterian
faith. He considered his parents extremely spiritual; as for
himself, ``growing up, I had a few (religious) thoughts. When I was
18 or 19, I started having a few more.''
</P>
<P>
   He found a receptive audience in Barry Bonnell, a future major
league journeyman outfielder who was his teammate with the Braves'
Single A affiliate at Greenwood, S.C., in 1975. Bonnell was married
and a Mormon, but he struck up a lasting friendship with the
19-year-old prospect.

OLSON SEEMS TO HAVE FOUND TOUCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - A huge development took place at Bank One Ballpark
Wednesday night, and it had nothing to do with the Diamondbacks'
victory or their first sweep or climbing two games over .500.
</P>
<P>
   The club's closing situation may finally have been resolved and,
lo and behold, the guy to take care of their worries may be the
same one who put them in a temporary mess.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Buck Showalter called on Gregg Olson to record the final
three outs of Wednesday's 4-2 victory over the Phillies. Yes, the
same Gregg Olson who badly botched all three of his save
opportunities during the first week.
</P>
<P>
   Olson fired three straight strikes to Bobby Abreu moments after
he replaced Todd Stottlemyre one batter into the ninth inning. He
then got catcher Mike Leiberthal on a called third strike before
giving up a double and getting the final out on a sharp grounder to
third base.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was probably the last step I needed,'' Olson said shortly
after recording his first save. ``There were definitely some nerves
going on there. After I got the first two outs, I started sniffing
the end and probably got a little jumpy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once that final out was done, I felt like all those monkeys
that were on my back jumped off.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter had told Olson before the start of Tuesday's game that
he was returning to the full-time closer's role. This was important
not only for Olson, who was in need of serious psychological help a
little over a week ago, but to the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   In this age of specialized relievers, it is almost vital for a
club's bullpen to know its role. It is the single biggest reason so
few clubs use a bullpen by committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start piece-mealing things together, it messes up
Darren Holmes, Greg Swindell, John Frascatore, Brian Anderson and
Vladimir Nunez,'' Showalter said. ``Oly knows this was just the
first taste. He knows this was just the start. You don't want to
think too much with your heart, but it's tough with him because
he's a guy who gives with all his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson remains heartbroken over blowing three ninth-inning leads
during the first six games of the season, when so many questions
surrounding the bullpen arose.
</P>
<P>
   Now Wednesday's save was simply step No. 1. By no means should
it be taken as a clear indication that all is right with Olson, who
was successful in 30 of 33 closing situations last season.
</P>
<P>
   Olson is not in the clear just yet, but the Diamondbacks are one
step closer to having normalcy return to their bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Olson was equally wounded during the club's home opener when he
was loudly booed during player introductions. The boos did not come
as any big surprise to the 10-year veteran, but that doesn't mean
they didn't sting.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything else, they stick,'' Olson said. ``No doubt
about it. I'll admit that I use them as motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia closer Jeff Brantley, who knows a thing or two
about being booed, can sympathize with Olson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing for him (Wednesday) was when he came in and
the fans were behind him,'' Brantley said. ``When you hear boos as
you come in from the pen, it's an immediate downer. But he's not a
young kid. He knows what he needs to do.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what, the Diamondbacks appear to be hitting on all
cylinders as they prepare to leave on their longest trip, one that
will take them to four cities.
</P>
<P>
   They can rest a little more assured knowing they have one person
to close games again, not several. Showalter used a bullpen by
committee to close out Monday's victory over Philadelphia, bringing
in Holmes to get the second out of the ninth and Swindell for the
final out.
</P>
<P>
   It worked that night but doing so over time could only turn a
bullpen into one big, confused mess.
</P>
<P>
   Olson has been around long enough to realize this job is not his
for the duration simply because he has it right now. This is a job
he must continue to perform at.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the Diamondbacks, there is no one else on the
roster they would rather see in the closing role. &QL;

INTEL PRODUCT MAY EASE COST OF HOME NETWORKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIE J. BALBA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With the prices of personal computers moving
toward affordable levels, more and more families are buying them,
creating a new breed of computer-dependent households in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   The number of households with at least one or two computers has
soared. According to a 1998 Dataquest survey, 28 million households
will have at least two computers by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   As people buy more computers, they consider buying additional
peripherals, installing separate phone lines for Internet
connections and subscribing to an additional Internet service
provider. To bypass these costly additions, many have considered
networking their home computers to share resources and peripherals.
</P>
<P>
   Networking can be a costly endeavor, however. A traditional home
network involves such expenses as adapters, wires and cables
including installation, hubs (if necessary) and the time spent in
learning and implementing the features of the operating system.
There may be additional costs for adding network cards.
</P>
<P>
   To justify home networking, its costs must not exceed the cost
of buying duplicate resources, such as printers. If each home
computer user needs a printer, would it be more expensive to buy a
second printer or to install a network to share the printer with
another home computer? What technical know-how is needed to install
another printer vs. installing a network?
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp. of Santa Clara, the world's top chip maker, says it
has a solution to the cost and hassle of traditional networking:
the Intel AnyPoint Home Network, a home networking system.
</P>
<P>
   The AnyPoint Home Network kit includes all the hardware and
software needed to connect two home computers and enable them to
share Internet access, share resources and communicate with each
other using any existing phone line.
</P>
<P>
   Intel says that any home computer user who can set up a new
printer or install a new piece of software can also install and use
the AnyPoint Home Network.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Intel network uses regular phone lines, it's not
supposed to compromise telephone service. In my case, though, I
could hear some background noise on the phone lines after I'd
connected the network.
</P>
<P>
   At times, it affected the telephone connection. After using the
AnyPoint Home Network, we tried to call our home number from a
cellular phone and found that our line was busy even after we had
disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   Transferring files across the newly formed network was rather
quick, but it could be interrupted by such things as lifting the
telephone receiver. Printing to a remote printer was just as quick
as transferring a file across the network.
</P>
<P>
   When downloading files from the Internet, AnyPoint users can
choose to use either the server or the client. The server was
definitely faster.
</P>
<P>
   Although our modem speed is 56K bps, data transfer tops out at
32.3K bps in my neighborhood and sometimes fluctuates.
</P>
<P>
   I was happy to note that two people in our household can access
the Internet at the same time, thus overcoming a common problem
when one person needs the Net for business and another needs it for
school work.
</P>
<P>
   This product is not a bad buy for $189, which includes two
external units, cables to connect two computers and one or more
printers and Intel's networking software. It beats paying hundreds
for a traditional networking environment installed in a home
setting.
</P>
<P>
   I would advise you to be sure that your equipment can handle any
additional gadgets before you start any installation.
</P>
<P>
   Because this product is new on the market, I would also give it
a chance to grow and develop into something else. I am sure that
Intel is already looking into upgrading it.

POLITICS, THEATER OF THE ABSURB MELD IN `HOUSE ARREST'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Honest Abe Lincoln is lying through his teeth. Or
is he?
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes ago, the Great Emancipator was smirking cynically
while swearing to Illinois voters that he'd never, ever support
interracial interbreeding. Read his lips!
</P>
<P>
   Now, here he is declaring in highfalutin rhetoric that he's
freeing the Southern slaves! Where's Sam Donaldson when you need
him?
</P>
<P>
   Speaking, incidentally, of the national media police, don't be
distracted by that camera-toting paparazzo, stalking the stage of
the Mark Taper Forum like a deranged hit man, or by those twin
video loops of the Zapruder film, endlessly recycling American
history both as tragedy and farce.
</P>
<P>
   If at this point you're not beginning to suffer from
metaphorical overload, certain questions may begin to pop out at
you during ``House Arrest: An Introgression,'' Anna Deavere Smith's
frenetic and thematically top-heavy yet thrillingly insightful new
work in progress, which recently wrapped up a regrettably brief
11-performance run here.
</P>
<P>
   Namely, was that earlier Lincoln a redneck impostor, the evil
twin of America's martyred 16th president? Or is Smith simply
showing us two sides of a complex, even conflicted human being,
whose occasional willingness to put politics above principal says
as much about the people who elected him as it does about the man
himself? Was there a shadow side to Lincoln, Jefferson and JFK, not
unlike that of the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.?
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, ``House Arrest'' isn't wholly equating William
Jefferson Clinton with his Jeffersonian namesake. But it can't
resist lumping Bill and Hillary, Clarence and Anita, O.J. and
Nicole, and the author of the Declaration of Independence and his
slave-mistress, Sally Hemmings, in a funny if belabored s&AMP;m
vignette titled ``Monticello Fashion Week.''
</P>
<P>
   What's the point of this salacious three-ring circus? When it
comes to '90s politics, Smith believes, all of us _ voters,
politicians, the dreaded mass media _ have become celebrity-stooges
in a mediocre melodrama-cum-minstrel show. Everyone is under
``house arrest,'' imprisoned in a kind of ideological blackface
that obscures our purpose and betrays our complex and diverse
national character.
</P>
<P>
   A writer, performer and academic sleuth of Holmes-ian
intellectual dexterity, Smith is best-known for her two
ultra-topical solo shows, ``Fires in the Mirror,'' about a fatal
ethnic clash between Jews and African-Americans in the Crown
Heights section of Brooklyn, and ``Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992,''
about the civil disturbance following the acquittal of four police
officers in the Rodney King beating trial.
</P>
<P>
   Basing her characters on real-life interviews, which she
conducts herself, Smith has developed a unique brand of theater
that's equal parts journalism, performance art, dramatic monologue
and impersonation.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing history with burlesque, tart editorial commentary with
Barnum &AMP; Bailey theatrics, ``House Arrest'' arrives in Los Angeles
more than a year behind schedule. Originally commissioned by the
Arena Stage in Washington, D.C, it was performed in the nation's
capital before l'affaire Lewinsky broke, forcing Smith to go back
and incorporate new material into her work.
</P>
<P>
   In ``House Arrest'' the ``characters'' form a rainbow coalition
of famous and not-so-famous Americans, stretching from George Bush,
Arianna Huffington and anti-abortion crusader Flip Benton to U.S.
Rep. Maxine Waters, Tom Hayden, Huck Finn, Walt Whitman, journalist
Christopher Hitchens, a Maryland prison guard, the French
philosopher/social critic Michel Foucault, and the writer Studs
Terkel, portrayed by Smith as a kind of cranky-wise vaudevillian
prophet.
</P>
<P>
   What's notably different is that until now Smith has been a
miniaturist, letting her individual portraits coalesce into broader
statements about American society and culture. In ``House Arrest''
she's working with her biggest, most experimental canvas, which she
fills with a fine, multi-ethnic cast of 11, film and video clips, a
strolling violinist, metal scaffolding used to represent everything
from prison cells to presidential grandstands, and interpretive
dance sequences choreographed by Donald Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   That makes for an awfully busy stage, and at times the incessant
tumble of historical cross-references and docu-surrealist
digressions make ``House Arrest'' seem like a play divided against
itself. Nor did the 45-minute community forum following the show
add much to an already packed evening.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Smith has bitten off more than she can digest in 120
minutes of sophisticated street theater, ``House Arrest'' offers
more provocative grist to munch on than 120 hours of Sunday morning
TV punditry. The phrase ``work in progress'' simply can't do
justice to this prodigious display of historical pyrotechnics and
bipartisan wit, which scorches the mind like Fourth of July
fireworks. I'd suggest ``masterpiece in training.''

   TOM WAITS/``MULE VARIATIONS'' (EPITAPH)
</P>
<P>
   Gravel-voiced Waits' 12th studio record and his first since 1993
is an occasionally abrasive, inventively melodic and bluesy
collection that recalls earlier efforts ``The Black Rider'' and
``Swordfishtrombones.'' Calling on blues harpist Charlie
Musselwhite, imaginative Bay Area guitarist Joe Gore and Primus on
opening track ``Big in Japan,'' the disc's most immediately
effective numbers are the harsh ballads ``Georgia Lee'' and ``Take
It With Me.'' Equally fascinating is the dark spoken-word piece
``What's He Building in There?'' along with the vintage low-fi
tracks ``Lowside of the Road'' and ``Get Behind the Mule.'' Look
for it Tuesday. 3 1/2 stars

BUCKCHERRY/``BUCKCHERRY'' (DreamWorks)
</P>
<P>
   Pedestrian '80s hard rock that relies on recycled James Gang
licks and the short memory of anyone that hears it _ that's
tattooed trailer trash Buckcherry in a nutshell. First single ``Lit
Up'' boasts a doofus chorus (``I love the co-caine'') that's
supposed to shock but doesn't come within a nose. In the good old
days, bands didn't have to advertise such things. ``Buckcherry'' is
so dumb, it'll probably sell a million only to be forgotten two
weeks later. 1 star

previous solo effort. If you like her TV work, you'll probably
enjoy the upbeat confessional tone and warm delivery of ``By

tuneful single, ``Baby, Don't You Break My Heart Slow.'' 2 1/2

   FOUNTAINS OF WAYNE/``UTOPIA PARKWAY'' (Atlantic)
</P>
<P>
   Although rarely equal to the left-field power-pop glory of the
Fountains' self-titled 1996 debut, ``Utopia Parkway'' brims with
enjoyable guitar-pop, memorable writing and sturdy harmonies from
Wayne's world-weary auteurs Adam Schlesinger and Chris Collingwood.
Best of all is the Beach Boys homage ``Denise,'' the cynical
anti-consumerist rant ``The Valley of Malls,'' and the high-school
sendup ``Prom Theme'' (``We'll forget each other's names ... Then
we'll work until we die''). A nice tribute to a time when pop ruled

and ex-Black Crowes guitar man Marc Ford. The high-energy outfit,
led by dizzying ex-Allmans guitarist Warren Haynes, covers
well-chosen oldies from Free (``Mr. Big''), Dave Mason (``Sad and
Deep as You'') and Humble Pie (``30 Days in the Hole'') along with
Mongo Santamaria's ``Afro-Blue'' stretched into a soaring half-hour

this disarming, Grammy-nominated Nashville dream-pop quintet scored
with the sweetly lyrical ``Kiss Me,'' featured in the teen comedy
``She's All That'' and TV's ``Dawson's Creek.'' On their third
album, the band's soft, pensive sound and high-quality
musicianship, often reminiscent of the Sundays, 10,000 Maniacs and
the Cranberries, makes for an ethereal and enjoyable diversion. The
band appears Thursday at the House of Blues. 3 stars

</P>
<P>
   OSCAR PETERSON/``PLAYS THE DUKE ELLINGTON SONGBOOK''
(Verve)!off!
</P>
<P>
   This varied set of reissues from Verve coincide with Ellington's
birthday centennial and aptly demonstrates the diversity of the
composer-bandleader's talents.
</P>
<P>
   On the Fitzgerald date (4 stars), Ellington supports the great
vocalist with a variety of backings _ big band, small combo and
sometimes with just Barney Kessel's expressive guitar. The variety
makes for fascinating listening. The big-band numbers swing hard,
while the small groups, often featuring former Ellington sideman
Ben Webster to great effect, display a warm lyricism for the
material. Needless to say, Fitzgerald's voice and range are
unsurpassed. This triple-disc package also features an extended
orchestral suite and unreleased rehearsal takes of Ellington and
partner Billy Strayhorn working with Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   ``Side by Side'' (4 stars) is a little misleading, since
Ellington and Hodges play together on only three of the album's
nine songs. Small matter. The record's two small combos are
fantastic, with trumpeters Harry ``Sweets'' Edison and Roy Eldridge
shining along with Hodges, Ellington and Strayhorn, who plays piano
on those tracks where Ellington is absent. You won't hear a better
small-band album.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soul Call'' (3 stars) comes from the same 1966 live dates that
produced the recent eight-disc Fitzgerald-Ellington Cote d' Azur
set. This reissue expands on the original album's skimpy six-song
set, adding eight tracks. It isn't essential Ellington, but the
orchestra is in fine fettle, mixing challenging works like ``La
Plus Belle Africaine'' with standards like ``Caravan'' and ``Take
the `A' Train.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oscar Peterson Plays the Duke Ellington Songbook'' (3 stars)
combines albums made in 1952 and 1959. The earlier date features
Peterson with guitarist Kessel and bassist Ray Brown; seven years
later, Kessel moved out and drummer Ed Thigpen moved in,
maintaining the trio format. While the same dozen Ellington songs
are repeated, the results vary significantly _ the earlier
recordings are so much more adventurous. Unfortunately, some quite
audible surface noise slightly diminishes the impact, leaving this
one to Ellington and Peterson enthusiasts.

BACKSLIDERS/``SOUTHERN LINES'' (Mammoth)
</P>
<P>
   You can't help falling for this roots-rock platter from North
Carolina's solid Backsliders. Ear-catching tunes on the follow-up
to 1997's acclaimed ``Throwing Rocks at the Moon'' include the
rockin' ``Abe Lincoln'' and ``Never Be Your Darling,'' along with
message-tinged ballads by bandleader Chip Robinson. Tasty
Springsteen-inspired guitar, chunky organ, pedal steel and grown-up
themes make ``Southern Lines'' a honky-tonk gem comfortably filed
under Americana. In stores Tuesday. 3 stars

LIZ TILBERIS: ICON OF PRINT AND LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In her 1998 autobiography, ``No Time to Die:
Living With Ovarian Cancer,'' Harper's BAZAAR editor-in-chief Liz
Tilberis wrote: ``It's hard to keep your spirits up when you're
looking and feeling drained, but you cannot allow yourself to dwell
on the side effects of chemo or regard it as a poison. It's a life
force, an ally, a weapon, a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis, 51, lost her five-year battle with cancer early
Wednesday morning in New York City. But she left an indelible mark
on the magazine she resurrected in 1992 and on the lives of the
people with whom she worked. Tilberis was to have been honored June
2 with the Council of Fashion Designers of America annual
Humanitarian Award; actress Meg Ryan plans a TV movie of the
memoir.
</P>
<P>
   Jeannette Chang, publisher of Harper's BAZAAR, said Wednesday,
``Two hundred and fifty people have called since 5:30 this morning.
You're talking about one who was so loved, who so inspired us. She
was influential in everything she said. Her leaving has left a huge
gap in this world. She touched so many people. I have spoken to
Donatella Versace. She is devastated. So is Laura Ungaro, Emanuel's
wife, and Calvin Klein, and Donna, Ralph ... all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   With her shiny, cropped helmet of silver hair (she never let it
grow back after chemotherapy), and her elegant Michael Kors skirts,
platinum Celine turtlenecks and deliciously sexy Manolo Blahnik
ankle boots, Liz Tilberis was the picture of English reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, said Simon Doonan, author of ``Confessions of a Window
Dresser,'' a fellow Briton (whose windows for Maxfield's in Los
Angeles and Barney's in New York are legendary), ``She had this
cheeky, Monty Pythonesque sense of humor along with this English
stiff upper lip thing. She dealt with her serious illness with
incredible integrity and bravery. No whining. She was a tour de
force of optimism, humor and kindness. She was lovely.''
</P>
<P>
   Doonan said he would create a Tilberis tribute window at
Barney's on Madison Avenue in a few weeks to coincide with the
memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Kelly was born Sept. 7, 1947, in Bath, England.
</P>
<P>
   When she enrolled in art school in Leeds as a teen-ager, she met
her future husband, Andrew Tilberis, who was one of her tutors.
</P>
<P>
   While the school forbade any romantic entanglements between
faculty and student, Liz and Andrew fell in love and married in
1971.
</P>
<P>
   Two years earlier, however, she had entered a writing and design
contest sponsored by British Vogue. She won a summer internship and
signed on as a fashion assistant. Four years later, she became
fashion editor and in 1984 she was named executive fashion editor.
She worked for Anna Wintour, British Vogue's editor-in-chief, and
when Wintour left to take over House and Garden, she suggested that
Liz Tilberis move into her slot.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gross, author of ``Model,'' and former fashion editor of
New York Magazine, chronicled Tilberis' rocky ride as British
Vogue's slightly overweight editor with the pageboy bob and
straight-across bangs. He commented that the British press ``put
her through the wringer.'' After she slugged a security guard who
was rude to one of her staff during a Parisian fashion show, she
became a kind of heroine.
</P>
<P>
   When Tilberis came to the States with husband Andrew and their
two adopted children in 1992 to take the reins at Harper's BAZAAR,
the magazine had lost subscribers and was in a state of disrepair.
Hearst Magazines gave her both the imprimatur and the money to
bring back the luster of the 130-year-old publication.
</P>
<P>
   She hired the best art director she could find _ Fabien Baron,
who stripped the magazine down to create a spare, elegant look with
stacked type and pictures that bled off the pages. She hired
photographers Patrick Demarchelier and Peter Lindburgh and, said
Jeannette Chang, ``told them to get the best goddamn pictures they
could. They told her to make BAZAAR the most beautiful magazine in
the world. That was her mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   The first of Tilberis' editions hit the stands in September
1992. The cover was supermodel Linda Evangelista's face and hand on
a stark white background with one cover line: ``Enter the era of
elegance ...''
</P>
<P>
   She beefed up the arts coverage, instituting sections on
literature, decor and fine arts, for which she had as good an eye
as she did for fashion. Eventually, Tilberis replaced supermodels
with celebrities, populating her covers with everyone from her
friend, Diana, the princess of Wales, to Calista Flockhart of
``Ally McBeal,'' Elizabeth Hurley and Hugh Grant and Sharon Stone.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first of the high fashion editors to discard the
ghostly ``heroin chic'' look, Chang recounted that Tilberis told
her photographers, ``Tell those girls to think of sex and put a
smile on their faces.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She couldn't stand that drabby little look anymore,'' Chang
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis was devoted to Andrew, her husband of 28 years, and her
two boys. She tried to give them as normal a life as possible,
trundling out to the family's house in the Hamptons on weekends.
Brave and down-to-earth are two terms that come up the most to
describe Tilberis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always loved to read the foreword she wrote in the front of
the magazine,'' said Gladys Palmer, director of fashion at the
Academy of Art College and former fashion editor of the San
Francisco Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wrote to people in a very intimate, immediate way. You
really could identify with her. She spoke for a lot of women
instead of talking down to them. Anyone who read that page felt
assured rather than intimidated.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In writing ``No Time to Die,'' Tilberis could have dropped every
name she ever met (and the list of celebrities, writers, artists,
designers and photographers who considered her a friend is legion),
but she devotes a great part of the book to educating her
readership about ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   She was diagnosed shortly after she came to the states with a
Stage III cancer which she blames upon the series of fertility
drugs she took in failed efforts to get pregnant. She underwent a
(then) experimental bone marrow transplant and managed to bounce
back each time.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a heroic fighter,'' said Cathleen Black, president of
Hearst Magazines. ``In many ways, it was the magazine that kept her
alive, knowing that she was choosing a cover or had a photo shoot
to assign. She kept going. We'd meet in the Ritz Bar in Paris and
have a drink and gossip and laugh. Here was a woman with great joie
de vivre, who was going to put all of her really painful days aside
and kept trucking on.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Let the phone ring.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was 6 a.m. on a weekday, and it could only mean
one of two bad things _ upsetting personal news or they want me to
write something on deadline for the next day's paper.
</P>
<P>
   The last time I'd made the mistake of answering before the
coffee had taken effect, I was confronted with an unwittingly
hilarious straight line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Garcia is apparently dead,'' advised an ernest editor.
</P>
<P>
   The ``apparently'' cracked me up. But only after I'd spent the
better part of a day trying to fashion an ``appreciation'' of old
Jerry.
</P>
<P>
   This time, when I did eventually answer the phone, it was a jolt
out of the ozone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've been making love all night, haven't you?'' oozed the
male voice from Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, I remembered. It was time for my interview with Julio
Iglesias. From my home. At 9 a.m. his time.
</P>
<P>
   Julio _ who appears tonight and Saturday at the Universal
Amphitheatre _ was warming up to a favorite theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're making love all night,'' he declared dreamily. ``It is
good to make love.''
</P>
<P>
   The conversation carried on like that for a few more minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Iglesias, who recently released a double-CD package of hits and
has seen his son Enrique begin to sell nearly as many records as
dad, is still the Latin love man.
</P>
<P>
   And he sees no reason to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I change anything?'' he asked. ``I still have my
females _ they're my ladies. They like what I do, and I love to
please them. I'm still making love, even when I'm up there on the
stage.''
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who want to check that out, there are still
some tickets available, ranging from $39.50 to $62.50. For
information, call (213) 480-3232.

Jeff Beck update
</P>
<P>
   After his highly successful tour supporting new album ``Who
Else!'' guitarist Jeff Beck may return to the concert trail this
summer, perhaps opening for fellow Epic Records act the Allman
Brothers at outdoor venues. Nothing's set, but we're keeping our
fingers crossed. &QL;

 &HT;    IRAQI KURDS SEE YUGOSLAVIAN MIRROR, FROM REFUGEES TO 'SAFE
HAVEN'
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., April 25 And Thereafter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANI SHAITAN REFUGEE CAMP, Iraqi Kurdistan _ They don't have
electricity or television in this camp between grassy mountains, so
they can't follow events in Kosovo. But, the Kurdish refugees
huddled around these tents and mud outhouses know all about death
and displacement -- at the hands of Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Every week, Kurds are forced from their homes in Iraq and
trucked to this semi-autonomous area in northernmost Iraq. About
the size of Austria, it is protected now by U.S. air cover and has
been run for the last seven years by a provisional Kurdish
government.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations estimates that, since 1991, more than 150,000
Kurds have been forced to the Kurdish zone from homes in other
parts of Iraq. In this tent village of 103 families and the
hallways of the grimy, fetid and crumbling hotel where many others
end up for years, refugees tell of being jailed until they agree to
leave the country, then having an hour to pack and leave.
</P>
<P>
   Kurdish leaders see an almost eerie similarity between their
peoples' plight and events in Kosovo. They say their current
``safe-haven'' in northern Iraq could provide a model for a
solution in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parallels are quite striking,'' said Shafiq Qazzaz(CQ), a
Kurdish cabinet minister in Iraqi Kurdistan. ``I have a satellite
television. I sit there and watch. It is mesmerizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurdish leaders favor the NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia's Serb
military forces -- just as fervently as Iraqi leaders have sided
with the Yugoslavian Serbs -- and say the world should not be cowed
by the scenes of refugees in flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end result is what's important,'' said Sami Abdel Rahman,
a top leader of the Kurdish Democratic Party in an interview this
month with Cox Newspapers. He expects the refugees to be returned
to Kosovo in a safe-haven arrangement similar to Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was NATO -- the U.S. and Britain -- that saved us,'' Rahman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Kosovars, Kurds throughout the region have sought their
independence for decades. In southeastern Turkey, a civil war has
killed 35,000 Turks and Kurds since 1984 with little intervention
from the West.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, drawn by Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, the West has
intervened. But, before it did, the Kurds already faced brutality
and persecution that continues, though to a lesser extent, today.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the 1970s, Hussein has destroyed more than 4,000
Kurdish villages. In the late 1980s, Iraq's campaign of ``Anfal,''
or ``Plunder,'' killed tens of thousands of Kurds. When Kurds and
Iranian troops briefly took over the Iraqi town of Halabja, Iraq
used nerve gas to kill more than 5,000 civilians in one horrible
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   After the Persian Gulf War in 1991, Kurds answered the call of
then-U.S. President George Bush to rise against Hussein. But his
army, thought to be reeling from its defeat in Kuwait, mustered an
overwhelming counter-attack that the U.S. did little to impede.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown thousands of Kurds died and an estimated 1 million fled
to the neighboring mountains near Turkey and Iran. The pathetic
scenes of refugees streaming for cover in the rugged, frigid
landscape, prompted the United States and Britain to use their air
power and establish the so-called ``safe-haven'' now in northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi representatives deny they mistreat the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   Kurdish Najdid Abdel Majid, member of a council of Kurds in
Baghdad who support Hussein's regime, calls the notion of chemical
attacks, though widely confirmed, ``propaganda.'' He notes that
more than a million Kurds live in Iraqi controlled-areas and they
own hotels, stores and factories. He says only criminals are forced
from their lands.
</P>
<P>
   But those in strategic and oil-rich Kirkuk, just outside the
autonomous area, still face what Amnesty International calls Iraq's
``Arabization'' of the important city.
</P>
<P>
   Their first stop is often this refugee camp Kani Shaitan, or
``Devil's Spring,'' where many say they were forced to leave Kirkuk
after refusing to change their official identity from Kurdish to
Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, one mother was trying to get her family of six
set up in the small tent that was now their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The army came to our house. My husband was away, so they held
me in jail (two days) until my husband came back,'' recounts Saydan
Ali, 27. Then, they were given an hour to pack, and dropped off at
the border of the autonomous region.

   ``The children always ask why we left the house and always ask
about the bathroom. In Kirkuk, we had a good bathroom, here we
can't even wash,'' said Ali, gesturing to an open latrine. ``I tell
them this is our fate.''

   Kurdish minister Qazzaz said it is the kind of treatment the
world will no longer ignore, whether it occurs in Iraq or Europe.

   ``When you have that kind of treatment toward people, then the
international community has an obligation to intervene,'' he said.

<P>
   He became part of rock-culture history when he joined Jimi
Hendrix, Otis Redding and dozens of hippie bands at the Monterey
Pop Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never knew where to place me,'' Masekela said. ``But the
fact that I was an activist got me with the flower children, so I
was a flower child, as well. I played the Fillmore in San Francisco
quite a few times. I had the pleasure of hanging out with Sly Stone
and Hendrix and the Grateful Dead and Big Brother &AMP; the Holding
Co.''
</P>
<P>
   Masekela has moved around. He's lived in Ghana, where he led a
group called Hedzollah Sounds. In Botswana, across the border from
South Africa, he put together a band called Kalahari, with which he
recorded the international hit album ``Techno Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   He was planning to build an international music school in
Botswana when a dozen South African activists were killed by South
African death squads. He left Botswana shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Masekela toured with Paul Simon on the Graceland tour,
which reintroduced South African music to the Western pop audience.
He then joined the touring cast of the hit South African musical
``Sarafina!''
</P>
<P>
   His experience in ``Sarafina!'' reminded him that home is not
only where the music is, but it's also where the heart is. And his
heart was in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Since he's returned to his homeland, Masekela has become
something of a national institution. His latest album, ``Black to
the Future,'' has sold more than 100,000 copies _ the equivalent of
double-platinum in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Africans don't have the groupie mentality, with all the
screaming and fainting,'' he said. ``But it can be kind of a drag
to hang out with me in South Africa, because everybody knows me.
And everybody sings along with the songs when we play them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish that everybody was as advantaged and comfortable as I
am. But it's wonderful to be home.''

MASEKELA'S MUSIC IS HOME FREE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICK MITCHELL 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than 30 years, Hugh Masekela figured home was wherever
the music was.
</P>
<P>
   The South African trumpeter left his country in 1960 to attend
the Manhattan School of Music. With his ex-wife, Miriam Makeba, he
helped introduce South African rhythms and melodies to American
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   But when Masekela spoke out against the apartheid policies of
the white South African government, he found himself banished from
his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s, Masekela lived in the United States. In the '70s
and '80s, he spent time in Liberia, Nigeria, Ghana and Botswana. He
titled one of his best albums Home Is Where the Music Is.
</P>
<P>
   When his mother died, he was denied permission to return to
South Africa, even for the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think we'd ever come back,'' said Masekela by phone
from his home outside Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, after African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela
was released from prison as a result of international pressure,
Masekela was allowed to move back to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see so many wars,'' said Masekela. ``It's a miracle that
this leadership taught us to forgive the past. Not to forget, but
to forgive, so we didn't burn the country down. We are still
economically oppressed, but it's wonderful to be living in this
country in peace after 350 years of war.''
</P>
<P>
   Masekela, 59, grew up in the township of Witbank. As a child, he
sang with an Anglican school choir. He fell in love with the
trumpet after seeing the movie Young Man with a Horn, starring Kirk
Douglas, based on the life of American jazz trumpeter Bix
Beiderbecke.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of a local priest, Masekela formed a band
with other township youth. His first musical hero was Louis
Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was everybody's hero,'' said Masekela. ``In my
township, everybody knew ''Blueberry Hill,'' everybody knew ``When
It's Sleepy Time Down South,'' everybody knew ``Rockin' Chair.'' It
was not just musicians who liked it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about Louis Armstrong is that he brought music
down to everybody's level. He made it universally accessible. Of
course, he blew a great horn, but it was always simple. You could
sing along with his trumpet lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong also taught Masekela about maintaining a positive
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``His style of music made it enjoyable to be alive. ''What a
Wonderful World'' came way down the line, but he had been singing
it in his soul all the time. He taught everybody to say `Yeah!' and
to walk with a little dip in their hip instead of looking dignified
with powdered wigs.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Masekela arrived in the United States, he had fallen
under the spell of bebop trumpeter Clifford Brown, as well as jazz
modernists such as John Coltrane. Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie
suggested that he experiment with a hybrid of African rhythms and
jazz improvisation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me, `There are thousands of us. There is only one of
you.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-'60s, Masekela scored a pop hit with ``Grazin' in the
Grass,'' based on a traditional South African folk melody. He
toured with folk artists such as Harry Belafonte, as well as with
pop-soul stars, including the Supremes and Stevie Wonder.

YOU SHOULD BE GAME FOR THIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The spell-checker-challenging title of David Cronenberg's
``eXistenZ'' refers to a game, and a game is what the movie plays
with viewers' minds. Cronenberg is out to deconstruct notions of
reality, as if he were making a more intellectual answer to ``The
Matrix,'' and by the time ``eXistenZ'' ends, you may find yourself
wanting to see it again just to unravel its knots.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that this is a sort of Cronenberg-lite, a movie with
more humor and less sense of confrontation than recent Cronenberg
efforts such as ``Crash'' and ``Naked Lunch'' (it also helps that
the movie is a mere 90 minutes long). Jennifer Jason Leigh _ in a
sly, flirtatious performance that belies her more introverted
nature _ plays Allegra Geller, whose design of the virtual-reality
game eXistenZ has given her a rock-star celebrity status. It's also
affected some folks so strongly that they want to kill her, and an
assassin nearly succeeds at a demonstration of the game. Allegra
goes on the lam, taking along baffled security guard Ted Pikul
(who's merely a moonlighting publicist, played by ``Gattaca's''
Jude Law). To get more insight into what's going on, Allegra and a
reluctant Pikul play the game.
</P>
<P>
   You can see why Pikul is reluctant; playing involves having a
large hole drilled into your back so that what looks like a giant
umbilical cord can be plugged directly into the spinal cord. The
``umby cord'' connects to a kidney-shaped port that has breastlike
qualities, which the user manipulates to play the game. The
lifelike port is virtually a supporting actor; it's said that Leigh
developed such a maternal attachment to it that she took it home
during filming.
</P>
<P>
   While on the run, Allegra and Pikul run into a series of
eccentrics played by Willem Dafoe, Ian Holm and Don McKellar; the
actors employ odd accents (the dependable Holm appears to be doing
a Boris Badenov impersonation) as a way of furthering the movie's
reality-twisting themes. Cronenberg, who was inspired to write a
story of an artist on the run after meeting Salman Rushdie, says he
couldn't resist ``playing'' the game himself, and the screenplay
began to take on a life of its own, adding to the feeling that the
movie is making things up as it goes along.
</P>
<P>
   Although on the surface ``eXistenZ'' appears slight, especially
for Cronenberg, it keeps coming back after you see it. It evokes
faint echoes of 1997's ``The Game,'' but without the glossy veneer
and underlying sense of smugness. ``The Game'' was essentially one
long practical joke that didn't hold up under scrutiny;
``eXistenZ,'' with its underpinnings of existential philosophy and
man-as-technology, is one of the most thought-provoking escapist
entertainments to come along in a while. It's receiving limited
distribution, but it's well worth seeking out.
</P>

&HT;        PENNSYLVANIANS HAVE BETTER THAN AVERAGE CHANCE OF AVOIDING
IRS AUDITS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, April 21 -- Fear of being audited by the IRS is
common to taxpayers everywhere, but Pennsylvanians have less to
worry about than residents of many other states.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania ranked 25 out of the 33 IRS districts for the
likelihood of being audited last year, according to the
Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University,
which collects and analyzes IRS data.
</P>
<P>
   William Kressman, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania IRS district,
said the state's rank was remarkable because it is the fifth
largest district in population.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has one of the highest numbers of returns for an individual
district,'' Kressman said. ``But I have no reason to think there's
a difference in quality or accuracy of returns from Pennsylvania,
than from somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the IRS audited 17,046 of the 5.5 million individual
tax returns filed in Pennsylvania, giving residents about a 0.31
percent chance of being examined. The national audit rate was 0.46
percent in fiscal year 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the rate of audits in the country has gone down in
recent years from 66 percent in 1992. Still, since that year,
Pennsylvania has been among the bottom 10 IRS districts when ranked
for the chances of being audited.
</P>
<P>
   Tax experts attribute the nationwide drop in audits to the
downsizing of the IRS. They say Pennsylvania's luck may be because
the state has fewer than average IRS agents.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the national average of IRS agents per million people
was 54.4, Pennsylvania had only 44.8.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really isn't a lot to it,'' said Bernie Phillips, tax
manager, at the National Society of Accountants. ``There are fewer
IRS agents, and the ones who leave often take with them the old
line harsher technique. There's some slackening in the old attitude
... a 'kinder gentler' IRS, which we've all heard about.''
</P>
<P>
   As IRS agents leave Pennsylvania, the number of audits goes
down. Last year in Pennsylvania, there were more than 6,000 fewer
audits than in 1994. There were 615 IRS agents in Pennsylvania in
1994 and 538 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said audit rates differ in the 33 districts, because
some IRS district offices are tougher than others.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Northern California taxpayers had the highest audit
rate of 1.08 percent, while Ohio taxpayers were least likely to be
audited, with a rate of 0.22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers in neighboring New Jersey were only slightly worse off
than Pennsylvania, being the 24th most likely to be audited.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just happens because of the particular personnel in a
district,'' Phillips said. ``It depends on how aggressive the
personnel are.''

`NO': A FARCICAL `NO' (MEANING NO, AND, YES, A PUN ON NOH) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The notion that history will sooner or later repeat itself as
farce is given an intriguing twist in the Canadian director Robert
Lepage's amusingly knotty film ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just repeated history that can be ludicrous, the film
asserts. It can be pretty silly the first time around, especially
when recalled a decade later by the people who lived through it.
</P>
<P>
   The particular bit of Canadian history ``No'' cleverly
deconstructs is the October crisis of 1970. That fall the Quebec
Liberation Front, a militant group advocating the secession of
Quebec province from the rest of the country, initiated a series of
uprisings that led to a declaration of martial law throughout
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem facing ``No,'' which opens Friday in
Manhattan, has to do with historical recognition. While many
Americans may have heard something about the October crisis, it was
eclipsed at the time by political turmoil in the United States. For
an American audience, the events the movie remembers will have
little or no resonance.
</P>
<P>
   In recalling those turbulent days, ``No,'' adapted from a
fragment of Lepage's seven-hour theatrical epic ``The Seven Streams
of the River Ota,'' explores questions of national identity through
the interrelationships of a group of Canadian and Japanese artists,
theater performers, diplomats and a Japanese translator who was
blinded in the bombing of Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the film is set in Osaka, Japan, at Expo '70, an event
that also marked the 25th anniversary of the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian contribution to Expo '70 is an admittedly shoddy
production (done in French) of a Feydeau farce starring Sophie
(Anne-Marie Cadieux), a headstrong, wildly self-dramatizing actress
who while in Japan discovers that she is pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has a boyfriend, Michel (Alexis Martin), back home,
Sophie is not sure who the father is, and the couple are on the
verge of separating over the issue of raising a family. Michel, an
aspiring left-wing playwright dabbling in revolutionary politics,
has assembled a crude homemade bomb with two of his cronies.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' whose title is a pun on Japanese Noh drama, underscores
its bicultural view by switching back and forth between color (for
its Japanese scenes) and grainy black and white (for its Canadian
scenes). The ineptly performed Feydeau play in which Sophie
performs becomes a metaphor for the behavior of all the major
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Sophie allows herself to be taken out for dinner by Walter
(Richard Frechette), a philandering diplomat, and his mean, bossy
wife, Patricia (Marie Gignac). In the movie's wittiest scene, life
imitates art as the relationship among the three evolves into a
real-life bedroom farce unfolding in a hotel room that resembles
the tacky set of the Feydeau play.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back in Quebec City, Michel and his revolutionary
cohorts embark on a bumbling, farcical exercise in terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   If ``No'' is an ingeniously structured play of ideas and has
impressively accurate period detail and several tart comic
performances (Ms. Gignac is particularly effective as the imperious
Patricia), it isn't a very compelling movie.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its location settings, the film feels less like an
unfolding story than a filmed theatrical collage whose vivid
characters become abrasive when blown up on the big screen.
</P>
<P>

`LOST AND FOUND': CHEF FINDS A RECIPE FOR LOVE: IT'S A DOG 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can a leering, chicken-chested twerp who does the worst Neil
Diamond impersonation you've ever seen win the heart of a
beautiful, cultivated French cellist?
</P>
<P>
   In Hollywood comedies where adolescent arrested development is
celebrated as an exalted state, no pubescent daydream is beyond
realization.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first 15 minutes of ``Lost and Found,'' a rancid
little nothing of a movie that baldly recycles plot elements of
``There's Something About Mary,'' it seems more than likely that
Dylan Ramsey (David Spade), a geeky Los Angeles chef with financial
problems, will eventually land his musically gifted dream girl and
next-door neighbor Lila Dubois (Sophie Marceau).
</P>
<P>
   Dylan may have some talent at business, but emotionally he is
about 13 years old, the age of the audience most likely to
appreciate ``Lost and Found.'' His master plan for winning Lila's
love involves stealing her dog, Jack, holding it prisoner, and then
heroically ``retrieving'' the lost animal and reaping his just
romantic rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lost and Found'' probably wouldn't have been made had not the
success of ``There's Something About Mary'' reminded Hollywood of
the farcical possibilities of doggie jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan's scheme goes smoothly until the moment the animal, in a
perky fit of defiance, scarfs down the diamond anniversary ring
Dylan's friend and business partner, Mark (Mitchell Whitfield),
bought for his wife and has asked Dylan to guard until the day of
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Much of ``Lost and Found'' focuses on Dylan's frantic efforts to
hasten the ring's passage through the dog's digestive system. Dylan
alternately bullies and pampers the mischievous canine, at one
point plying Jack with a bottle of Pepto-Bismol.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, piles of doggie doo-doo enter the picture. (The
movie also flaunts desperately unfunny running jokes about
flatulence and pedophilia.)
</P>
<P>
   The only genuinely funny scene involves bringing the pooch to a
coarse, loudmouthed ``dog whisperer'' (Jon Lovitz) who after only a
cursory examination of Jack reels off a list of Dylan's abuses
toward the animal and prescribes luxurious pampering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lost and Found,'' directed by Jeff Pollack, follows the
loose-jointed format of ``There's Something About Mary,'' but it
has none of the verve of its prototype. With his sly grin and
imperturbably upbeat attitude, Spade's Dylan suggests a
post-slacker embodiment of Mad Magazine's smirking totem, Alfred E.
Neuman.
</P>
<P>
   The movie also gives Dylan a rival for Lila's affection in Rene
(Patrick Bruel), a slimy, supersuave ex-boyfriend who has flown all
the way from Paris to try to win her back and who quickly catches
on to Dylan's tricks. It's a measure of Spade's repulsive screen
presence that Bruel's villain emerges as marginally more likable
than the star.
</P>
<P>
   One can only feel sorry for Ms. Marceau, who has the thankless
role of Lila. The lustrous French actress joins a long line of
European stars who have given in to temptation and allowed
themselves to be molested by Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES
</P>
<P>
   The movie is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has
off-color humor and sexual situations.

   DENVER _ The large illuminated sign in front of the Denver
Center for the Performing Arts read: ``A time to reflect.''
</P>
<P>
   On news racks at every street corner, Wednesday's Denver Post
carried the double-deck banner headline ``High School Massacre.''
Its competitor, the Rocky Mountain News, displayed ``Heartbreak.''
</P>
<P>
   Coors Field, home of Major League Baseball's Colorado Rockies,
was empty. A scheduled game had been postponed for a second
straight day.
</P>
<P>
   Gray skies high above Denver's usually bustling lower downtown
area _ affectionately known here as ``Lodo'' _ matched the mood of
the people on the streets. The high school shooting that took place
about 25 miles southwest of Denver on Tuesday was on the mind of
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Offenbaker works at a small convenience and souvenir store,
Out of Time?, on Blake Street. Located along a stretch of popular
eateries and bars, it is usually buzzing with patrons.
</P>
<P>
   During a 10-minute interview, no one entered the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are melancholy,'' Offenbaker said. ``They push to go on
with their lives, but in the back of their minds they are thinking
it could have been someone they knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Offenbaker has lived in Denver for 13 years. He has overcome
polio, and because of that he professes a strong faith. He was
shaken by the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here are two young boys,'' Offenbaker said of the gunmen who
died in the carnage. ``You can't call them young men because they
weren't yet. They're still children. What was going on in their
heads?''
</P>
<P>
   Down the street, Karen is a bartender at Dick's Last Resort,
just a Mark McGwire clout away from Coors Field. No matter what
time of the day or night, people are eating there. And they were
Wednesday, too. But instead of television sets tuned to sports
programming, channels were fixed to news stations.
</P>
<P>
   A co-worker reached up to change the channel and Karen
interrupted, ``No, they're going to tell us the names of the
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Colehour staffs the concierge desk at the downtown Westin
Hotel. Since the shooting, she has found out-of-towners to be
respectful and understanding, all except one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one guy I wanted to hit,'' she said. ``He didn't
understand why the baseball game was canceled. No heart.
Unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside Coors Field, a homeless man noticed that there wasn't
much traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``No baseball game, huh?'' he said. ``Those guys really made a
name for themselves. That's awful.''

THE STATS ON RUSH LIMBAUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: My sister says Rush Limbaugh is a has-been. I say his radio
show is rated No. 1. Am I correct?
</P>
<P>
   _J.B., Whitney, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Rush Limbaugh leads all nationally syndicated radio talk-show
hosts, with an audience of 14.75 million, according to the industry
journal Talkers Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Limbaugh is followed by Dr. Laura Schlessinger at 14.5 million,
Howard Stern at 9.25 million, Art Bell at 6.25 million and Dr. Joy
Browne at 6.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   The twice-annual Talkers survey was led by Limbaugh from 1990
until spring 1998, when he placed third, 750,000 behind
Schlessinger and 500,000 behind Stern.
</P>
<P>
   Limbaugh, who claims a current audience of 18 million to 19
million after a high of 21 million in 1994, disputed the Talkers
third-place findings.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have quite a few black iron skillets, pots and lids my
mother-in-law left me. They are badly rusted. How can I clean them
up?
</P>
<P>
   _ S.D., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Either scour the rust away with cleanser and a scrubbing pad,
or put the cookware in the oven during a self-cleaning cycle for 60
to 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   This tip comes from Wagnerware Corp., which has sold cast iron
cookware since the 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   Use the self-cleaning oven method only if the pan is made
exclusively of cast iron, a Wagnerware customer support
representative said. Also, don't exceed 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When the rust is removed, wash out the cookware and wipe each
piece with a paper towel dipped in vegetable oil to ``reseason''
it, taking care not to overuse the oil. Place the clean, oiled
pieces in a 300-degree oven for one hour, and the cookware should
be ready to use.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call Wagnerware at (888) 457-2665.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to William Styron, the author of ``Sophie's
Choice''? My maiden name is Styron, and I have a family tree I'd
like to send him.
</P>
<P>
   _ L.S.G., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Styron in care of Vintage Publicity, 201 E. 50th
St., New York, NY 10022.
</P>
<P>
   Styron, whose most recent book is ``A Tidewater Morning'' from
1993, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1968 for ``The Confessions of Nat
Turner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shadrach,'' a film released last year, was based on a short
story Styron wrote in the '70s. The film was directed by his
daughter, Susanna, who wrote the script with Bridget Terry.

`TOUT TRUFFAUT': AUDACIOUS CHARMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Francois Truffaut was sent to a juvenile
detention center at the request of his parents in 1948, his first
letter home requested the essentials: jam, and his files on Charlie
Chaplin and Orson Welles. In retrospect, it's clear why that would
sustain him.
</P>
<P>
   By the time his stay at the Observation Center for Minors was
immortalized on film, fictionalized 11 years later at the end of
``The 400 Blows,'' he had acquired an encyclopedic film education
(after making three earlier short films) and weathered enough
turmoil and amour to tell stories laced with precocious wisdom. He
began his feature filmmaking career with enough experience and
subtle finesse to last a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   That career is being celebrated with ``Tout Truffaut,'' a
comprehensive nine-week series that begins Friday at the Film Forum
in New York City. (It will be followed by similar series in cities
including San Franciso, Los Angeles and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It is also chronicled in a newly translated French biography
(``Truffaut,'' by Antoine de Baecque and Serge Toubiana) that makes
a first-rate companion piece for the program. Dry but extremely
informative, the book (from Knopf) provides much background
material on Truffaut's evolution.
</P>
<P>
   From unwanted child to take-no-prisoners critic (once branded
``that young thug of journalism'') to dean of the Nouvelle Vague
(he wrote the brief story synopsis that evolved into Jean-Luc
Godard's ``Breathless''), he grew into the role of brand-name
filmmaker specializing in blithe romance. Yet as this series makes
clear, it is for his deeper, darker adult films that Truffaut is
best remembered.
</P>
<P>
   It's astonishing to realize, while re-experiencing the obsessive
passions of ``The Story of Adele H.'' and ``The Woman Next Door,''
the delicate balance of ``Two English Girls'' or the literally
haunting power of ``The Green Room,'' that these were not among his
widely acknowledged successes. (The incomparably devastating
``Story of Adele H.'' was a critical failure in France, and ``Two
English Girls'' an outright disaster.)
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, this series spans the full range from early
classics (``Jules and Jim,'' ``Shoot the Piano Player'') to a late
masterpiece (the 1981 ``Woman Next Door'' was his penultimate
feature, made three years before his death from a brain tumor at
52), with audacious experiments (``The Wild Child''), curious
anomalies (``Such a Gorgeous Kid Like Me'') and tales of the
adorably obstinate Antoine Doinel along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The great performances, like Isabelle Adjani's (in ``Adele
H.''), Jeanne Moreau's (``Jules and Jim,'') and of course
Jean-Pierre Leaud's as the Truffaut alter ego who came of age so
unforgettably on camera, remain sublime. And thanks to the series'
thoroughness, the misfires are here too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love on the Run'' (1979), Doinel's last gasp, was partly
cobbled together from nostalgic film clips. Though it's welcome in
a series where the complete Doinel cycle can be seen (beginning
with the 1962 short ``Antoine and Colette,'' and including ``Stolen
Kisses'' and ``Bed and Board''), ``Love on the Run'' joined
``Fahrenheit 451'' (from Ray Bradbury's book-burning book) and
``The Bride Wore Black'' (his closest Hitchcock approximation,
starring Jeanne Moreau) as the Truffaut films the director himself
liked least.
</P>
<P>
   Films about childhood, courtship and sexual betrayal gave
Truffaut's work its most obvious thematic hallmarks. They also gave
him the reputation of a filmmaker of narrowly bourgeois concerns.
And they made him an easy target for former New Wave friends like
Godard, who called him ``a businessman in the morning and a poet in
the afternoon'' and claimed that ``Shoot the Piano Player'' was the
only Truffaut film he could bear.
</P>
<P>
   On the occasion of one of Truffaut's most lovable and popular
films, Godard asked him for financial backing. He wrote: ``After
`Day for Night' you ought to help me, so that audiences don't think
that the only kind of movies being made are your kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's true that while France exploded into the
revolutionary turmoil of 1968, Truffaut was delivering ``Stolen
Kisses,'' the most delightful film in the Doinel cycle. (It holds
up charmingly well, as does the next installment, ``Bed and
Board.'')
</P>
<P>
   But in retrospect, he was also maturing in ways that would lead
him to revisit and reconsider early work in a more reflective,
sometimes newly passionate light. At opposite ends of his career
came ``The Soft Skin'' (1964) and ``The Woman Next Door,'' two
films about extramarital love affairs that have life-or-death
consequences, yet their attitudes could not be more different.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The Soft Skin'' is the film in this series most likely to
prompt tomato-throwing at the screen. Having the temerity to shoot
this black-and-white film in the apartment he still shared with his
wife, Madeleine Morgenstern, Truffaut watches how a celebrity
Balzac scholar (only in France!) becomes infatuated with an
admiring stewardess.
</P>
<P>
   She is played by Francoise Dorleac, part of the parade of demure
yet smoldering women whose high heels, silken lingerie and
especially beautiful eyes helped to define Truffaut's feminine
ideal. (It seemed to date back to the mother whose flirtatiousness
and neglect during Truffaut's boyhood exerted a formidable
influence on his art.)
</P>
<P>
   She enraptures the scholar, who remains guilty but insufferably
smug even while in the throes of erotic obsession. ``The Soft
Skin'' still plays like a marital mea culpa, effective chiefly for
its Hitchcockian homages (especially in a nighttime hotel sequence)
and candor about the husband's desires.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Woman Next Door'' explores these same ideas in a very
different atmosphere, a far more complex and passionate one. A
blandly contented suburban husband and father, played by Gerard
Depardieu in one of his most stirring performances, is startled to
find that a former lover is his new neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, now married and played ravishingly by the spirited
Fanny Ardant, does not share his eagerness to escape the past.
</P>
<P>
   So the film watches, with immense acuity, as the affair is
secretly rekindled and the lovers recapitulate their old struggles
while plunging headlong into new ones. As Ms. Ardant mentions in
the chatty biographical documentary, ``Stolen Portraits,'' that is
also part of the series, the film's eloquent visual restraint
contributes greatly to its power.
</P>
<P>
   She notes that an encounter lending itself to melodrama, a
lovers' quarrel at the end of which the woman faints, is
deliberately staged in a dull cement parking garage with grocery
bags as props. The emotions in the film are so pure that Truffaut's
simple, quotidian style only emphasized them further.
</P>
<P>
   His directorial shifts are also apparent in the similarly themed
``Jules and Jim'' (1962) and ``Two English Girls'' (1971). These
two menage-a-trois stories are derived from the work of the same
author, Henri-Pierre Roche, who was 76 and completely obscure when
Truffaut found ``Jules and Jim'' in a secondhand bookseller's
stall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two English Girls'' is also the somewhat autobiographical
story that Roche transposed into his book ``Jules and Jim,''
adapted by Truffaut into a classic that now looks as fascinating
for its hidden cruelty as for its sense of freedom. ``This is the
third time it's happened to me,'' Truffaut wrote of ``Jules and
Jim,'' expressing the constant undercurrent that so deepens his
work. ``Starting a film with the thought that it's going to be
amusing and realizing along the way that it will be saved only by
its sadness.''

THIS DOG STORY HAS BEEN SPADE _ AND THAT'S A GOOD THING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At this year's ShoWest in Las Vegas, even David Spade seemed
dumbfounded that he was starring in the lightweight, canine-centric
romantic comedy Lost &AMP; Found.'' But don't worry, the former
``Saturday Night Live'' snarkster hasn't gone to the dogs just yet.
</P>
<P>
   Though you'd never know it from the trailers, ``Lost &AMP; Found''
actually has a number of funny moments that don't involve
animal-based sight gags.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan (Spade) is a struggling restaurateur whose lousy love life
seems largely due to his unrepentant smugness. But when Lila
(Sophie Marceau), a beautiful French cellist with a proclivity for
losing her precious pooch, moves into the building, Dylan believes
he's found true love. He also figures out how to get a four-legged
foot in the door by dognapping the pup in order to spend quality
time looking with Lila. What could go wrong, right?
</P>
<P>
   It works like a charm until the little hairball ends up
swallowing an expensive ring Dylan's been holding for his best
friend, so now he's stuck with the pooch until the problem ...
passes.
</P>
<P>
   Good thing his idiot delivery boy Wally (''MAD TV's'' Artie
Lang) is on hand to help with the dirty work, but the stakes are
raised when Lila's ex-lover Rene (Patrick Bruel) shows up to refuel
an old flame. Dylan and Rene immediately size each other up as
competitors, and the race is on to win Lila's love.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, all this sounds like agonizingly awful romantic fluff,
and in many ways it is. But Spade's amusing asides and snide banter
keep the mood so light and silly, you have a hard time noticing how
cheesy the whole thing is. But, like almost every
former-SNL-cast-member-turned-movie-star venture, the film relies
too heavily on your personal like of Spade, and not enough on a
well-told story. If you hate his arrogant, caustic sense of humor _
something he honed on SNL and as a successful stand-up _ well,
there's not much sense in shelling out the 6 bucks.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it's an entertaining romp reminiscent of ``There's
Something About Mary,'' with wittier dialogue and sans hair-gel
jokes. Watch for cameos from Jon Lovitz and Martin Sheen, and stick
around for the amusing music video for Deee-Lite's ``Groove is in
the Heart'' over the closing credits.

   NEVER BEEN KISSED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drew Barrymore, David Arquette, Michael Vartan &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Raja Gosnell &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 97 minutes
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you thought about Dartmouth?'' Sam (Vartan), a high
school English teacher, asks the student Josie Geller (Ms.
Barrymore). Josie says she hasn't. That's because she has already
graduated from Northwestern.
</P>
<P>
   Sam doesn't realize it, but Josie is really 25 and a reporter
who has gone undercover at her old school to whip up a report on
today's youth. If she's nervous at the prospect, it's because eight
years earlier on the same campus she virtually defined the term
hapless dork.
</P>
<P>
   Josie was the overly sweet and vulnerable one who did
everybody's homework and got splattered with egg for her trouble.
As an adult, Josie does needlepoint, talks to her turtle and
rhapsodizes about what will happen when she gets her first real
kiss. (It will get all hazy.)
</P>
<P>
   At school she passes for 17, even after bandying about higher
literary concepts in Sam's class. (Poor Shakespeare is trotted out
yet again in a high school movie.) Everything else goes badly.
School now entails a weapons check each morning, and the students
are just as crude and nasty.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow Josie remains as gushily obsequious as she was at 17.
But after eating too much ganja cake and otherwise making a fool of
herself, she inadvertently reinvents her image by coming up with a
theme for the prom, which at this school is a little like Moses
returning from the mountain top.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly cool, she gets to hang out with the in-group. Later she
shows her true colors and issues a ringing defense of the dorks.
And now for that kiss.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE None. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 10 Older viewers in this category, especially girls,
will enjoy themselves. The little ones will take to Ms. Barrymore,
an engaging presence, but as simple-minded as the film is (and it
gets goofy), it is probably too complicated. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11-13 If they don't succumb to sugar shock, girls will love
it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 14 AND UP Many older teen-agers acknowledge the silliness
but report a warm and cuddly sensation brought on by Ms. Barrymore
and a general identification with a loser who finally rises up.
</P>
<P>
   THE MATRIX &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo
Weaving, Joe Pantoliano &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski &QL;
</P>
<P>
   R 115 minutes
</P>
<P>
   A sleek, pallid computer hacker named Neo (Reeves) is recruited
to serve as a time-traveling Ping-Pong ball being swatted back and
forth between the pervasive artificial intelligence that rules the
world and a band of ragtag survivors fighting to save the new
millennium for good old humankind.
</P>
<P>
   Scooped up in a limo by an acrobatic operative named Trinity
(Ms. Moss), Neo gets briefed by Morpheus ( Fishburne), leader of
the embattled outcasts. It seems that all life on earth is really a
computer construct called the matrix, in which everybody goes about
business as usual unware that they are slaves to the artificial
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the problem? Morpheus points out that without free
determination humans will be forever chained to our not wholly
exemplary way of conducting ourselves. Inside the matrix, however,
is a man, referred to as ``the One,'' who has the power to break
the bond and change everything. Morpheus believes that the One is
Neo.
</P>
<P>
   On a computer screen, the matrix resembles beads of water
running down a shower curtain. Neo gets trained physically by a set
of floppy disks, which instantly impart fighting skills. But the
challenge is mental. To assume his full powers, he must let go any
notion of doubt or limitation.
</P>
<P>
   When Morpheus deems him ready, Neo will be taken to the Oracle,
who has the final say on who is the One. Down in the matrix there
are preliminary skirmishes with the artificial intelligence,
represented by Agent Smith ( Weaving) and several clones who
resemble the Blues Brothers. The Oracle, it turns out, is an
elderly woman who holds forth in her kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Is Neo the One? ``Sorry, kid,'' she says. ``You've got the
gifts, but you're waiting for something.'' The next life maybe.
Morpheus and friends fight on, as does Neo. But what is he waiting
for?
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Gore flies, but while the movie is a grabber visually
and technologically, nothing, including the violence, seems in the
least way real. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY Minimal. &QL;
</P>
<P>

   AGES 10-12 The film is very violent (however surreal) and
parents should judge accordingly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP If the violence isn't a problem, neither is the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   TWIN DRAGONS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Chan, Maggie Cheung, Teddy Robin, Nina Li Chi &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Tsui Hark and Ringo Lam &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 88 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Chan always has fun with himself in his movies, and here
two Jackie Chans have a wonderful time with each other as they dart
around Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Separated shortly after birth, the Ma twins, John and Boomer
(both Chan), develop along separate career paths as, respectively,
a renowned conductor and an auto mechanic with a talent for
antagonizing the mob.
</P>
<P>
   To cut to the chase (there not being too much else to dwell on
in this movie), the sedate John arrives for a performance and finds
himself in the middle of a very active altercation between Boomer
and a horde of gangsters he has offended and kicked and punched all
over town.
</P>
<P>
   Though they've never met, the twins react instinctively to each
other, with Boomer's fingers working uncontrollably while John is
at the piano and the sedate John gyrating wildly every time Boomer
takes on his tormentors. (At one point, John nearly wrecks a hotel
lobby just sitting there.)
</P>
<P>
   Later the boys involuntarily swap girlfriends (an impresario's
daughter and a bar girl), as well as cell phones, which gets them
dashing off into each other's total confusion. But at last they
meet and join forces to trash a department store and take part in a
citywide donnybrook. ``You fight like a girl,'' Boomer tells John.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Much damage is inflicted with fists, feet, bullets,
vehicles and whatever, but it's all in a spirit of fun (sort of)
and at times approaches slapstick. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Boomer and the impresario's daughter (Ms. Li Chi) are shown
in bed and there are other sexual situations and references. &QL;

OLD 97'S TAKE A MAINSTREAM TURN WITH LATEST CD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The grumbles, Murry Hammond says, have already started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard about 100 responses, and I'd say 90 percent are
positive,'' says the bassist for Dallas country quartet the Old
97's. ``The other 10 percent are like, `Well, I just like your old
stuff.'''
</P>
<P>
   The old stuff: records like their 1994 debut, ``Hitchhike to
Rhome,'' and their 1995 follow-up, ``Wreck Your Life,'' melodic but
raw efforts that earned the group a hard-core following, a
next-big-thing buzz and, as a result, a major-label deal.
</P>
<P>
   The new stuff: the group's latest effort, ``Fight Songs,'' its
second for major label Elektra and fourth overall. The disc, which
comes out Tuesday, marks a drastic change in the band's signature,
bare-bones sound: Most of ``Fight Songs'' consists of radio-ready
pop songs shimmering with chiming guitars, lush melodies and glossy
finishes. In other words, it could easily fit onto the play lists
of mainstream radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   As out of character as it may sound, the disc could finally lead
the guys to mainstream success. It could also be their last chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last record that's guaranteed on our contract, so
I don't know what will happen if it doesn't sell,'' says Rhett
Miller, the band's singer and primary songwriter. ``The (label) has
assured us up and down that they believe in us, and they've worked
with a lot of bands that haven't courted radio or tried to have a
hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we don't feel like we're selling out or writing songs that
we hate,'' Miller says. ``We've put out a record that radio could
potentially pick up. People have said, `You've made a great record
and if the label can't make a hit out of it, it's their fault.' And
that's from people at the label.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime fans will notice another change: Miller's not wearing
glasses anymore. It was rumored that the label ``recommended'' he
switch to contacts to play up a more handsome image. Not so, Miller
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That whole thing's so funny,'' he says. ``I just decided to
stop wearing them because every time I play live, they fog up.
What's weird is that people at the label did, awhile back, say
stuff like, `When are you gonna stop wearing those dorky glasses?'
But that's not why I stopped wearing 'em. I stopped because I
couldn't see our set list.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, this story is a familiar one: The Old 97's' Elektra
debut, 1997's ``Too Far to Care,'' was also, the label hoped,
destined to be a commercial breakthrough for the group, which
formed in 1993 and is rounded out by guitarist Ken Bethea and
drummer Philip Peeples.
</P>
<P>
   Even though a few of the disc's tracks were featured in movies,
including ``Hope Floats'' and ``Clay Pigeons, Too Far's'' slight
taste of success was too little. It sold 40,000 copies, far too few
in the eyes of a major.
</P>
<P>
   ```With Too Far to Care,' Elektra scratched their heads. They
liked it, but they didn't know how to get it to mainstream
America,'' Hammond says. ``I think the difference is now they feel
they have something they can work with.''
</P>
<P>
   True. At least half of ``Fight Songs''' are anything but:
Oppenheimer, 19 and the first single, ``Murder (Or a Heart
Attack),'' echo the easily digestible, choral melodies of '60s-era
pop.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time, we explored our fascination with Buddy Holly and
Everly Brothers more than Hank Williams,'' Hammond says. ``We still
love Hank. We still love everything we love. We're just emphasizing
some things over others, which is the way we've always been.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller says that although the music has changed, his approach to
writing song lyrics has not.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the songs I write are invariably sad,'' he says.
``Sometimes it's obvious, but here I have more of a
sounds-happy-but-is-really-sad sort of thing going on. Put sad
lyrics behind upbeat, British Invasion-type music, you get this
weird hybrid. It's been done before but not by us.''
</P>
<P>
   A new sound, a new image _ maybe it'll help; maybe not.
Regardless, Miller says, the group will continue, success or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want this record to do well, but even if doesn't, the Old
97's will make another one,'' Miller says. ``We've made enough
friends and contacts in the industry to where if we did get dropped
or whatever, we could put our music out elsewhere. Main thing is, I
wanna do this as long as I can. I don't want to have to go back to
work.''

 TIN-MOVIE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The best thing about ``Pushing Tin,'' the air-traffic
controller movie, is that if you successfully duck it in the
theaters, you won't be surprised by having to watch it on your next
long-distance plane trip.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are not going to show an in-flight movie about
air-traffic controllers pushing themselves to the point of nervous
breakdowns. In the case of ``Pushing Tin,'' however, the ban may be
a matter of good critical judgment rather than concern for
passenger squeamishness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pushing Tin'' is based on a magazine article, and it plays
like a magazine article: some interesting facts, no drama. Not many
laughs either, in case director Mike Newell thought he was making a
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is set in New York's control center, where a group of
frenetic, kibitzing controllers directs planes from three metro
airports, slicing the available air into ever-diminishing shreds
while the controllers try to land planes on time and, incidentally,
keep them from crashing into each other.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes inside the control room play like a math nightmare:
lines of nervous people staring at blips on radar screens while
mumbling such pithy dialogue as, ``Delta two-four-seven-eight, you
have traffic at 10 o'clock. Turn right, heading zero-six-zero.
Continental, descend to 3,000, heading four-niner-three.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie tracks the rivalry between two controllers, Nick (John
Cusack), the veteran hotshot, and Russell (Billy Bob Thornton), the
enigmatic outsider who can really land them.
</P>
<P>
   The two men compete in pushing tin around the sky, shooting free
throws and bedding women.
</P>

<P>
   Because director Newell (``Donnie Brasco'') can pump little
drama into the takeoffs and arrivals of airplanes, he diverts the
movie into an investigation of infidelity and other acts of marital
chaos.

<P>
   The movie makes a serious point: that the air-traffic control
system is out of control because the control freaks running it are
too apt to crack under the stress. However, it doesn't make that
point in cinematic fashion.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Newell has to employ the interjection of facts (for example,
that each flight controller is responsible for more lives during a
single shift than a surgeon during an entire career) so we don't
think we're watching guys playing video games and talking math.

COUNSELORS ADVISE PARENTS TO TALK ABOUT SCHOOL VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHLEEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Parents who wonder whether the high school shootings in Colorado
have troubled their children should face the issue head on by
inviting their children to talk.
</P>
<P>
   By discussing the topic, parents reassure their children that it
is all right to express their thoughts and feelings about the
shootings, said Sharon Williams, director of child and adolescent
psychiatry at the Stanford University Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all over the newspapers and on television,'' she said.
``Even if they didn't hear about it at home, they're going to hear
about it from their friends. They're going to know it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Find out what children know, Williams advised, and then ask
open-ended questions as they tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to find out what's going on in your kid's head, to
see how they're making sense of what happened,'' she said. ``If
they're worried, be sure and ask them what they're worried about.
Let them tell you what their fears are.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents should also keep an eye out for behavioral changes that
show children may need help coping.
</P>
<P>
   Nightmares, loss of appetite, aggressive play, irritability,
isolation, clinging to parents _ all could be signs that a child or
teen-ager needs professional help, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we know about trauma symptoms is that the earlier people
come for treatment, the better off they are,'' said Williams, who
works with children who have experienced traumatic events.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging how scary and heartbreaking the Colorado
incident is, parents should also emphasize that it is extremely
rare for children to be hurt at school by this kind of violence,
said Lois Salisbury, president of Children Now, a national
organization based in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not realistic for a child to walk around with their heart
in their throat worrying it's going to happen to them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Salisbury also suggested reminding children that there were many
adults who were looking out for their safety: teachers, neighbors,
the police.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about the mayhem in Colorado with an adult can be
reassuring, said Sue Crivello, a counselor at Washington High
School in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents can say: We may never know why it happened,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened in a relatively affluent community, so the kids
had material things, but maybe something else was lacking in their
lives _ like Mom, or Dad, or love. You can discuss what might have
been missing in their lives. Kids are very perceptive about those
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Mock, director of family, youth and children's services
at Berkeley Mental Health, a city agency, said parents should
monitor how much information children received on the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents should not let their kids, particularly if they're
younger, watch such TV accounts without parental discussion or
involvement to see what their reactions are, to see how the kids
are responding,'' he said.

WE'RE NOT USING AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY FULLY, BILL GATES WRITES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Information Age is about 30 years old, so why are we still
covered in a sea of paperwork?
</P>
<P>
   Because we're not using the tools in front of our faces, says
Bill Gates, creator and chief executive of the dominant leader in
computer toolmaking, Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical company has made 80 percent of the investment in
the technology that can give it a healthy flow of information yet
is typically getting only 20 percent of the benefits that are now
possible,'' Gates writes. ``The gap between what companies are
spending and what they're getting stems from the combination of not
understanding what is possible and not seeing the potential when
you use technology to move the right information quickly to
everyone in your company.''
</P>
<P>
   Filling that gap with ideas and examples is the basis of Gates'
latest book, ``Business (at) The Speed of Thought: Using a Digital
Nervous System'' (Warner Books, 470 pages).
</P>
<P>
   This book is a vast improvement over Gates' last tome, a
semi-autobiographical, industry observation that rambled more than
informed.
</P>
<P>
   Gates has honed his skills, becoming a writer of organized
thoughts and useful ideas. And he probably will sell some of his
products along the way.
</P>
<P>
   But that's OK, as long as he can give readers some insight into
what current information trends are and how to apply them.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Gates writes that only recently, new tools have
become available for analyzing and disseminating rich information
that could launch your company deep into the Information Age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here on the edge of the twenty-first century, the tools and
connectivity of the digital age now give us a way to easily obtain,
share and act on information in new and remarkable ways,'' he
writes.
</P>
<P>
   Those tools can be used to create what he has termed a digital
nervous system, which like a human nervous system reaches all parts
of the company, linking them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A digital nervous system consists of the digital processes
that enable a company to perceive and react to its environment, to
sense competitor challenges and customer needs, and to organize
timely responses,'' he writes. ``... It's distinguished from a mere
network of computers by the accuracy, immediacy, and richness of
the information it brings to knowledge workers and the insight and
collaboration made possible by the information.''
</P>
<P>
   That rich information, for example, may come in the form of
digitally tracking what your customers are buying. Grocery stores
have been doing it for years, with scanners that were originally
designed to speed checkouts.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be too expensive and technically complex to track
customers' buying habits, Gates said, ``but the PC and the Internet
give us an infrastructure that makes exchanging all kinds of
digital information very inexpensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates has developed 12 steps for getting your company up to
speed with technology. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   _ Use e-mail as an in-house communication system.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use digital transactions with all suppliers and partners.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use digital systems to route customer complaints immediately
to the people who can improve the product or service.
</P>
<P>
   The book is also full of vignettes on how companies are using
the new tools.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric, for example, has developed an ``extranet''
from which its 12 operating units work. An extranet is a private
Internet site that lets several companies share information and
conduct business.
</P>
<P>
   ``GE expects to do more than $5 billion in capital procurements
over the extranet by 2001, compared with less than 1 percent in
electronic purchases today,'' Gates writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fully deployed, the extranet could involve as many as 40,000
trading partners.''
</P>
<P>
   With nontechnical language, Gates provides a clear picture of
what's happening in a highly complex and vital area of business
from which many could profit.

   ``Infinite Loop: How Apple, the World's Most Insanely Great
Computer Company, Went Insane''
</P>
<P>
   By Michael S. Malone
</P>
<P>
   Currency Doubleday, $27.50
</P>
<P>
   I'm afraid that Tom Wolfe has started a bad trend: books that
never seem to end. At 597 pages, you would think seasoned
journalist Michael Malone was getting paid by the page. This
corporate history promises yet again all of the ``truth'' about the
topsy-turvy world of Steve Jobs, the Woz and the world of Apple
computing. I'm sure it's in there, but who wants to wade through
such a tome to find it? Especially when it has been written about
so many times before.

</P>

   Villard, $22.95
</P>
<P>
   Work should be play, according to the latest book by Matt
Weinstein, a management consultant who also wrote the great
``Managing to Have Fun.'' Unfortunately, he says, Americans have a
fundamental idea that work and play should be as separate as church
and state. In a breezy, short-chapter style, his book explains how
to combine work and play for a happier and more productive work
force. The co-author is Luke Barber, a philosophy professor at
Richland College in Dallas.

   Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25
</P>
<P>
   This is an engaging look at how a 52-year-old electronics
distributor, Marshall Industries, reinvented itself using a Web
presence, an inverted organizational pyramid and a new pay plan.
``While you can't predict the future, you can prepare for it,''
writes Marshall's CEO, Robert Rodin. ``And that, as we're learning
at Marshall, can become a way to invent it.'' An interesting look
at one company's treatment of the new world of business.

`A PRIVATE LIFE:' CASTING HENRY JAMES AS AN ARTISTIC CAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Henry James once described himself, half jokingly, as ``that
queer monster, the artist.'' It's a description that proves all too
fitting in Lyndall Gordon's new book about James, a book that
paints a chilling portrait of the novelist as a predatory genius
who did ``nothing that did not feed his art'' and who willfully
possessed ``the souls of certain people he had marked for `use.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Most prominent among those ``certain people'' were James' cousin
Minny Temple and the writer Constance Fenimore Woolson, the women,
Ms. Gordon argues, who inspired the two high waves of creativity of
the novelist's career, the first culminating in ``The Portrait of a
Lady'' in 1881, the other in ``The Ambassadors'' in 1903.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that James' fiction was heavily indebted to
autobiographical sources; nor is it a secret that Minny, and to a
lesser degree ``Fenimore'' (as Woolson was known), played major
roles in shaping his conception of the Jamesian woman. What's
different about Ms. Gordon's account is the vehemence with which
she accuses James of appropriating these women's sensibilities
while withdrawing from them in real life, when they most needed his
friendship. James, in her telling, emerges as the ultimate esthetic
cad, using women not for sexual favors but for literary material
and then cavalierly dumping them when they were no longer of any
use.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Private Life of Henry James'' is less a conventional
biography than a long, impassioned and often hectoring essay filled
with illuminating insights and highly speculative accusations. It
represents a significant departure from Ms. Gordon's previous work,
highly nuanced studies of Charlotte Bronte, Virginia Woolf and T.S.
Eliot, and from Leon Edel's monumental five-volume biography of
James, which took a psychological approach to the novelist's life
and art, but refrained from passing judgments.
</P>
<P>
   As we know from James' writings, Minny was a direct, eager girl,
blessed with a searching, restless spirit and a ``moral
spontaneity.'' The young James came to know Minny during their late
teens, and she made such an impression on him, his brother William
and their friends that James later hailed her as ``the heroine of
our scene.''
</P>
<P>
   For James, whose failure to serve in the Army during the Civil
War had cast his manhood into question, Ms. Gordon argues, Minny
was a kind of soul mate in defiance. She represented an alternative
to the prim and passive image of the traditional woman, ``a
parallel to the shadowed man'' (like himself) who defied
traditional conceptions of gender.
</P>
<P>
   Minny, who was suffering from consumption, dreamed of going to
Rome to visit its fabled museums and ruins and to seek a respite
from her illness in its temperate winter climate. Ms. Gordon
suggests that as a young single woman, Minny would have needed a
companion (preferably a family member) for her travels, and that
James, who was already in Europe, exhibited ``a willful blindness
in the way he would not grasp the gravity of her illness and the
urgency of her pleas to him to take her on.'' She would end up
dying in Pelham, N.Y., in 1870 at age 24.
</P>
<P>
   Minny's death, Ms. Gordon argues (and here she echoes Edel),
enabled James to take imaginative possession of her in a way he
never could have, or would have dared, in real life. She became an
idea, an ideal who could be ``locked away, incorruptibly, within
the crystal walls of the past,'' and she would also become an
avatar of the new ``American girl,'' featured in ``The Portrait of
the Lady'' and ``Daisy Miller.'' Many years later, James would
resurrect Minny in ``The Wings of the Dove,'' casting her as the
doomed Milly Theale, whose death transfigures her mercenary suitor
Merton Densher.
</P>
<P>
   Like the radiant Milly, the spinsterish Constance Fenimore
Woolson _ the great-niece of Fenimore Cooper and the author of such
works as ``Miss Grief'' and ``The Street of the Hyacinth'' _
possessed an independent spirit, and during James' middle years,
Ms. Gordon writes, she ``opened up a woman's mind'' to him, much
``as Minny Temple had done at the outset of his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolson had sought James out in Europe as a kind of mentor, and
the two soon became close friends. By the end of 1886, James and
Woolson were sharing a house overlooking Florence. James had come
``closer than he had ever been to a voluntary domestic tie,'' Ms
Gordon writes, ``and Fenimore had the kind of intimacy she
craved.'' Ms. Gordon does not suggest, as Edel does, that Woolson
had sexual designs on James, but argues that James failed to be
supportive when she fell into a deep depression in 1893, thereby
repeating the same pattern of involvement and withdrawal that he
had exhibited with Minny. Near midnight on Jan. 24, 1894, after a
bout with the flu, Woolson fell or jumped to her death from her
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Gordon tells it, James, in typically self-absorbed
fashion, took her death personally: ``He, the knower, the deep
student of the female heart,'' was ``forced to acknowledge that he
had not known a woman'' who was one of his closest friends. She
also suggests that he began to spin Fenimore's death to friends and
colleagues, falsely describing her as being in the grip of an
uncontrollable dementia: ``The coded message is plain: no one, not
the best of friends, could have prevented this death.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Ms. Gordon's contention that James would continue to spin
his life, playing down the role Minny and Fenimore played in the
making of his art. Why, she asks, did ``he make a pact with
Fenimore to destroy their correspondence?''
</P>
<P>
   Why, as an old man, 44 years after Minny Temple's death, did he
destroy a batch of her letters, having used what he wanted from
them for his memoirs? The answer, she argues, is that James wanted
to promote ``the legend of a solitary artist'' and erase, or at
least diminish, ``the ghostly companions of his art.''
</P>
<P>
   In the course of setting out this argument, Ms. Gordon makes
some interesting observations concerning the ``spectatorial''
impulse behind James' art and the real-life antecedents behind his
frequent portrayal of innocents destroyed by opportunists and
schemers.
</P>
<P>
   It is no great revelation, however, that artists can be ruthless
in using family and friends as material. Faulkner famously observed
that ``if a writer has to rob his mother, he will not hesitate; the
`Ode on a Grecian Urn' is worth any number of old ladies.'' In
addition, James has long been renowned for his voyeuristic
detachment and inability to form or sustain lasting emotional
connections.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Ms. Gordon undermines the valid points she wants to make
by overstating her thesis, arguing that Minny Temple and Constance
Fenimore Woolson formed a ``collaboration'' with James, that they
were ``posthumous partners'' in the creation of his art. She
suggests that James' actions (or failures to act) contributed to
their untimely deaths, and she reviles him as ``an amorous predator
of the soul.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, such bald statements (often based on speculative
readings of the available evidence) and Ms. Gordon's relentlessly
censorious tone make for an angry, polemical book, a book that
lacks the judicious scholarship of her earlier biographical works.

`PUSHING TIN:' BUCKLE UP FOR ROMANTIC TURBULENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review.)  (DW) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Pushing Tin'' betrays its origins as a magazine
article (in The New York Times Magazine) with more atmosphere and
data than built-in story. As it describes the stressful lives of
air traffic controllers in the New York area, it makes no automatic
point beyond noting that the work is demanding and crazy. But as
directed by Mike Newell, it gets past its initial ``M-A-S-H''-style
comic chaos and becomes a four-character story with four characters
worth watching. Newell's ensemble timing and breezily sardonic
style make it work better than might be expected.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that the principals are played by John Cusack, Billy
Bob Thornton, Cate Blanchett and Angelina Jolie. They make a cast
that would be worth watching in just about anything and, in fact,
``Pushing Tin'' gives each one a colorfully offbeat role. The
closest thing to a familiar character here is Cusack's Nick, a
fast-talking wise guy who turns brilliantly professional whenever
planes need controlling. Cusack, as a man clearly wrestling with
himself while guiding traffic, goes a long way toward making the
character real.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever possessed Ms. Blanchett to play Nick's spouse, a jaunty
Long Island housewife with a strong local accent, has stood her in
good stead. She fits in so well here that it may be a while before
you wonder why Elizabeth I is talking about tuna casseroles. She
and all the story's other wives get a shock when Ms. Jolie slithers
into the movie as the biker-chick bride of a new traffic
controller, a daredevil named Russell. Thornton, carefully laconic
in ways that make a powerful impression, plays the newcomer who
becomes Nick's chief rival on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the hell is she doin' with Russell?'' one member of the
group asks about Ms. Jolie's knockout. ``He got her parents tied up
in the basement,'' somebody answers, in a film with a lot of
casually funny repartee along those lines. There are times when the
snap and rhythm of the film's best scenes bring to mind Newell's
``Four Weddings and a Funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   In surprisingly credible fashion, ``Pushing Tin'' shows what
happens after Nick falls for Russell's wife one boozy evening.
</P>

BOTH FOUNDER OF A NATION AND DESIGNER

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In New York, George Washington is more than a
household name. Streets, avenues, a park, two bridges and a
magnificent marble triumphal arch all bear his name. And this year,
the city is marking the bicentennial of his death with exhibitions,
books and lectures. New York loves George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But the feeling was not necessarily reciprocal. As indicated in
``Washington's New York,'' an exhibition at the Museum of the City
of New York that runs through July 4, New York was a tough town for
Washington. He suffered his greatest military defeat in the
Revolutionary War here, and in 1783, when the British finally
evacuated the city, he promptly left; he gave his famous farewell
address to his officers at Samuel Fraunces' tavern and took a ferry
to New Jersey, en route to Annapolis to resign his commission.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the city as president in 1789, because New York
was the first capital of the United States. That year he contracted
what was then called anthrax (an abscess that took three months to
heal), and in 1790 he caught pneumonia. In August of that year he
left New York, never to return.
</P>
<P>
   As First Lady, Martha Washington held an open house on Friday
evenings at the first presidential mansion, on lower Broadway near
Bowling Green, when she and, often, the president would entertain
visitors with ice cream and lemonade.
</P>
<P>
   The museum show includes a misspelled letter she wrote in
October 1789 in which she complained, ``I lead a very dull life
hear and know nothing that passes in the town.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued: ``Indeed I think I am more like a state prisoner
than anything else. There is certain bounds set for me which I must
not depart from _and as I cannot doe as I like I am obstinate and
stay at home a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington's heart was in Virginia,'' said Dr. Deborah
Dependahl Waters, the curator of decorative arts and manuscripts at
the museum, who organized the show.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's spiritual home was always Mount Vernon. And a new
book by Allan Greenberg, an architect and architectural historian,
explores Washington's passion for his house and analyzes the
architecture and landscape of Mount Vernon as one might study a
great American antique.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``George Washington Architect,'' is to be published in
June by Andreas Papadakis. (Greenberg will lecture on his theme as
a benefit for the Sir John Soane's Museum Foundation on May 11 in
New York. Tickets are $75; reservations: (212) 258-2635.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Mount Vernon was Washington's lifelong preoccupation,''
Greenberg said in an interview. ``The bulk of his correspondence
deals with the farm.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Greenberg quotes Washington's detailed letters of
instruction to his estate managers throughout the Revolutionary
War, the Constitutional Convention and his first term of office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear from Washington's voluminous correspondence that
from the time he took possession of Mount Vernon until his death 45
years later,'' in 1799, ``the condition of the house and
surrounding farms was always in the forefront of his mind,''
Greenberg writes. ``His letters reveal his passionate preoccupation
with every aspect of daily life.''
</P>
<P>
   In studying Mount Vernon, Greenberg, who has taught at Yale
University's Schools of Architecture and of Law, the University of
Pennsylvania and the Department of Historic Preservation at
Columbia University, considered form, plan, design and execution.
</P>
<P>
   He argues that Washington deliberately designed Mount Vernon to
be asymmetrical in plan and elevation, inside and out. None of the
four facades of the estate is symmetrical. The doors and windows,
even the cupola, are slightly off center. Similarly, the interior
elevations are asymmetrical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The circulation through the rooms is deliberately informal,''
Greenberg said. ``None of the doors line up with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg said Washington considered asymmetry ``a design theme
that unifies the house.'' As he explained: ``Bringing the
informality of a vernacular farmhouse into a great mansion was very
unusual. Washington was preoccupied with asymmetry in a way that
has become important as a model for Americans who built houses in
the 19th and 20th centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in Greenberg's view, these designs showed Washington's
desire, as an amateur architect, to give the house a distinctly
American style. He postulates that Washington's contribution to
American architecture, landscape architecture and city planning
rivals that of Thomas Jefferson, who is usually seen as the
president who had the most influence on American architecture.
</P>
<P>
   When Washington inherited Mount Vernon from the widow of his
half-brother Lawrence, it was 1,280 square feet, with four rooms
flanking a center hall.
</P>
<P>
   He added two floors and extensions on either side: a large
dining room to the north and a study to the south. He put on the
90-foot-long porch overlooking the majestic Potomac River and two
open arcades to link the house to the dependencies on either side.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was finished, the house and outbuildings totaled
nearly 20,000 square feet. As Greenberg writes, ``Between 1754,
when he first leased Mount Vernon, and his death in 1799,
Washington increased the size of the estate from 2,126 acres to
more than 8,000 acres, or 12.5 square miles.''
</P>
<P>
   He experimented with crops of alfalfa, clover, rye, hops, wheat
and vegetables; put in orchards, and raised beef cattle, dairy
cows, hogs, sheep, various fowl and horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He considered economic self-sufficiency to be the basis of
freedom and prosperity,'' Greenberg writes.
</P>
<P>
   The two-story porch, in particular, was a Washington invention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first of its kind in domestic architecture that we
know of _ anywhere,'' Greenberg said. ``Before, such a portico
would have only been seen on a public building like the Pantheon.
At Mount Vernon, the columns are square and paneled, which tells
everyone they are wood. Of course, such porches later became the
mark of the great Mississippi River plantations.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg also describes Washington's decorative elements at
Mount Vernon. Instead of Greek gods, lyres, crossed weapons with
shields or other symbols of glory, Washington enriched his ceilings
with carved rakes and hoes and curling vine motifs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carvers did not use such idiosyncratic themes in plaster
decorations,'' Greenberg said. ``Farm implements on the ceiling of
a major house is very unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the new republic seems to have been looking for an
architecture appropriate to the new nation. How could he have
predicted that nearly every suburban housing tract in America would
have its own Mount Vernon 200 years later? Happy anniversary,
George.

NOSTALGIA FOGS UP MOVIE OF HEDONISTIC LONGINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new animated television series ``Family Guy'' is an object
lesson in trying too hard. A recent episode featured three
flashbacks in the first five minutes. Something similar happens in
the movie ``Metroland,'' which stars Christian Bale in a '70s-style
shag haircut that looks so heavy you wonder how he keeps his head
up.
</P>
<P>
   It probably helps that the picture is set in the 1970s, in which
time Bale plays a young married father whose life is thrown into
doubt when his freewheeling, free-spirited best friend shows up.
Bale, who has given up his dreams of art for art's sake _ in other
words, he's sold out _ is reminded of the dreams he had as a boy.
Slivers of his dreams, and his past life, flash throughout the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   He also has a tolerant wife (Emily Watson) who manages to keep
their household in order, as well as iron his underwear, although
we're never quite sure whether the ironing is a part of some
fantasy. (It's where she also tells him she understands if he needs
other sexual partners.) The glimmers of flashbacks crystallize into
one extended scene in which a younger Bale is living a happy, but
impoverished, existence in Paris. He struggles with his
photography, and finds a young Parisian (the doe-eyed charmer Elsa
Zylberstein) who instructs him in the ways of amour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Metroland'' _ which refers to the suburb where Bale, his wife
and baby live what he thinks may be a circumscribed life _ is the
kind of movie that used to be made all the time in the early '70s,
often starring Richard Benjamin as a middle-class bohemian. (These
were de facto versions of Philip Roth stories; in fact, Benjamin
starred in a few actual film versions of Roth stories.)
</P>
<P>
   These movies stopped being made because their time had passed.
They were about having your Sara Lee and eating it, too. The young
suburbanite would pass through his wild-oats phase and realize that
the real world was, in all places, the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   That is the same realization that Bale arrives at by movie's
end. Julian Barnes used his novel, from which the movie is derived,
as a way to get at the itch that never quite goes away, and the
perverse yearning for the return of a time that has just passed in
a man's life, the comedy of a guy in his early 30s pining for his
20s. (He also deals with the longing for the innocent hedonism of
the 1960s as compared to the tawdry hedonism of 1970s.)
</P>
<P>
   The exploration of such adult themes should add up to a better
movie. Director Philip Saville gets good performances out of his
cast. And the attempt to wrestle with sexual longing, and reconcile
oneself with monogamy, is an adult subject that pictures don't
tackle enough. But ``Metroland'' gazes at this grown-up dilemma
through the soft-focus purple haze of nostalgia. The emotional
content isn't nearly as up-to-date as it needs to be.

   Crippled combat aircraft should soon stand a better chance of
making it back to base, thanks to a novel neural network that has
just passed its first major test.
</P>
<P>
   When the control surfaces of an airplane, such as the rudder or
ailerons, are damaged or malfunctioning there is often very little
a pilot can do to avoid a disaster. But in a series of tests
completed last week, NASA engineers have shown that smart software
can keep aircraft flying even if some of their control surfaces are
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The tests, at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center in Edwards,
Calif., used a modified F-15 aircraft similar to those flying
combat missions against Serbia. The software was tested in high
performance maneuvers, such as tracking a target or performing a
360-degree roll. The neural net managed to keep disabled planes
under control even at supersonic speeds. This is the first time
such a system has helped control a piloted aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The software was developed at NASA's Ames Research Center in
Moffett Field, Calif. It is designed to kick in when the flight
control system detects a mismatch between data on the plane's
airspeed, bearing and the forces on its wings, tail and fuselage,
and a computer model showing what data should be received if the
plane were flying normally.
</P>
<P>
   Neural networks are programs that learn to perform a certain
task by trial and error, rather like the human brain. The Ames team
trained theirs to control an F-15 on a flight simulator, before
letting it loose on the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   In an emergency, the network reassesses flight data six times
every second to work out the best way of using the available
control surfaces and the plane's engines to maintain normal flight.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot would be warned of any failures, such as the loss of
his ailerons. But in most cases, he shouldn't notice that the plane
is handling differently from normal. ''The computer would determine
that the ailerons aren't available and would have another scheme in
mind,'' says Mike Thomson, the engineer at Dryden who supervised
the tests. ''It would learn to use another control surface
instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomson believes commercial airliners could also benefit from
the system, although it would be restricted to modern fly-by-wire
planes. When an airliner loses its control surfaces, the results
can be horrific: at Sioux City, Iowa, in 1989, a full hydraulic
failure left an aircrew trying to land a DC-10 using only the
throttles of its two remaining engines. It crash-landed, killing
110 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   However, civil authorities may be less willing than the military
to embrace the system. They will demand standardized tests of the
system's performance, says Tom Anderson, an expert on software
reliability at Newcastle University. But such tests will be hard to
devise, as the performance of neural networks is inherently
difficult to predict. &QL;   &UR; (This article is excerpted from New

   Autoimmune diseases, in which the body attacks its own tissues,
may in some cases be triggered by cells from your mother that have
been lurking within you since you were in the womb. Researchers
also have evidence that women may contract autoimmune diseases
because of cells from their fetuses that persisted for decades
after crossing the placenta.
</P>
<P>
   Many autoimmune conditions appear similar to graft versus host
disease, in which cells from a transplanted organ mount an immune
response against the host. That has led some researchers to
speculate that microchimerism _ a condition in which small numbers
of another person's cells persist in the body _ could be involved
in some cases of autoimmunity. The idea is bolstered by the fact
that autoimmune diseases are more common in women, who may be
repeatedly exposed to their fetuses' cells while pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, researchers in Boston made the surprising
discovery that fetal cells can survive in a woman for as long as 27
years after her last pregnancy. Since then, other studies have
shown that women with autoimmune diseases such as scleroderma,
which causes the skin to become thick and leathery and can damage
internal organs, seem to have an unusually high incidence of
microchimerism.
</P>
<P>
   In one study, male cells were detected in 32 out of 69 women
with scleroderma, but just one out of 25 women who did not have the
disease. Women with scleroderma and microchimerism also seem to
have 10 or more times as many foreign cells in their bodies as
women with microchimerism who are not suffering from any autoimmune
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the theory has been that men get autoimmune
diseases too. But this week, at the Experimental Biology '99
meeting in Washington D.C., researchers announced that maternal
cells can also cross over to fetuses and survive for decades.
</P>
<P>
   J. Lee Nelson and her colleagues at the University of Washington
in Seattle hunted for maternal cells in a 47-year-old man with
scleroderma, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to search
for the gene for a molecule found on the surface of his mother's
cells but not his own. Sure enough, they found maternal cells.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also looked at blood from a 15-year-old boy with
lupus, another autoimmune disease that attacks the skin and
internal organs, using a technique that stains X chromosomes one
color and Y chromosomes another. They were able to find a female
cell, which has two X chromosomes, and, using PCR, they confirmed
that it came from the boy's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson admits that she is still some way from proving that
maternal cells can trigger autoimmunity. ''But I think they're
likely to be a significant piece of the puzzle,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Antony Rosen, an expert on autoimmunity at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore, says, ''It's at that stage where the
hypothesis is reasonable and the preliminary data are supportive.
But you can't get unequivocal data in a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Artlett of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia,
who has found maternal cells in five out of eight men suffering
from scleroderma, says that microchimerism cannot be the whole
story, as it can occur in people without autoimmune disease.
Artlett suggests that autoimmunity can arise when a trigger such as
a viral infection spurs the foreign cells to begin attacking their
host. This reaction disrupts the host's immune system so that it
joins the attack against the body's own tissues, she believes. &QL;

<P>
   To give astronauts a good night's sleep, the best option is to
cover them with electrodes. That's the conclusion from the latest
investigation of orbital insomnia.
</P>
<P>
   Crew members on space shuttle missions typically get only five
or six hours of restless sleep each night. Some astronauts have
resorted to sleeping pills, but these can affect alertness and
reaction time. So for the past six years, NASA has given its
astronauts melatonin, a hormone released by the body during
darkness that makes us feel sleepy.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Czeisler of Harvard Medical School in Boston knew that
melatonin pills seem to improve sleep only for people whose bodies
are not producing normal levels of melatonin. So he decided to test
whether the pills were really helping shuttle astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   During two shuttle flights last year, five astronauts took
either melatonin or a placebo before sleep. On some days they wore
a simple wristwatch monitor, while on others they wore numerous
electrodes and monitors to record their sleep patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Melatonin had no effect on either the quality of sleep or on the
astronauts' performance in psychomotor tests the next day.
Surprisingly, the astronauts seemed to sleep best when they were
covered with electrodes, even though some had joked that no one
could sleep while wearing so many monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Czeisler revealed his findings at a meeting at the National
Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C., last week. He believes
astronauts can't sleep because they are preoccupied by their
duties. He suggests that covering them in monitoring equipment
convinces them that sleep is an integral part of their mission, and
that this allows them to relax enough to rest normally. &QL;

   Studying bats could be forcing them to go hungry, warn
researchers in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, two rings are used to study bats. A durable, metal
ring with a serial number gives the animals a lifelong identity
mark. And in short-term studies, researchers often add a second,
colored plastic ring so that they can determine who's who at a
distance. Both rings are clipped onto one of the forearms that
supports each wing.
</P>
<P>
   Gareth Jones and his colleagues at the University of Bristol say
these rings could be interfering with the bats' feeding behavior
because they knock together, making a sound that scares away
insects the bats feed on.
</P>
<P>
   The team was recording the echolocation calls of two species of
mouse-eared bat, Myotis myotis and Myotis blythii, in the lab when
they picked up strange ultrasonic noises from rings clashing on the
bats. ''We noticed it as an aside, really,'' says Jones. ''It is
like an ultrasonic clonk.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones speculated that the sounds might be audible to moths that
the bats eat. The moths have tympanic organs, drum-like hearing
devices that are sensitive to ultrasonic frequencies. The team
tested the theory by first checking the neural response of lesser
yellow underwing moths, Noctua comes, to the ring sounds.
Mouse-eared bats usually echolocate at night using ultrasound
frequencies around 45 kilohertz. Moths can hear these calls, but
the team found that the moth's nerves respond even more sensitively
to ultrasound at 20 kilohertz, which is close to the frequency
produced by the clinking rings.
</P>
<P>
   Next the researchers played back the ring sounds to 33 flying
moths. Nearly half the moths performed an elaborate escape maneuver
on hearing the noise.
</P>
<P>
   ''It might be dangerous to double-ring bats,'' says Jones.
''It's equivalent to putting a cat bell on a cat. The sound alerts
prey.'' Previous research has shown that evasive maneuvers give
moths a 40 per cent better chance of avoiding being eaten.
</P>
<P>
   Jones expects that other prey insects could also detect the ring
sounds. Bush crickets, for instance, may stop singing on hearing
the noise, making it harder for bats to locate them. He doesn't
believe, however, that the ring noises would confuse the bats
themselves. ''Bats are good at filtering out sounds they are not
interested in. They can work out their own echoes in a cave of
hundreds of bats all echolocating at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bat expert Paul Racey of Aberdeen University says the discovery
is important. ''Rendering bats less able to get food could have
very serious conservation consequences.'' It could also affect the
results of studies into complex bat behaviour, he says. Racey
suggests that researchers could get round the problem by adding
colored reflective tape to single metal rings to identify the bats
at a distance. &QL;

HARDTOP CORVETTE A CHARMER  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SATURDAY, APRIL 24) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Corvette hardtop is a lighter, tighter, racier and
marginally cheaper version of Chevrolet's brawny sports car.
</P>
<P>
   As originally conceived by Chevy designers, the fixed-hardtop
model was going to be a (begin ital) significantly (end ital)
cheaper Corvette, a no-frills version that would have deleted such
amenities as power windows and computer enhancements.
</P>
<P>
   It was to be more of a race car than the fastback coupe or
convertible versions, with fewer creature comforts but more of a
competitive edge. However, after a stripped-down hardtop prototype
registered disappointment among groups of Corvette aficionados,
that idea was ditched by the Chevy people and a new plan created.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Corvette turns out to be a sportier version, compared
with the coupe and convertible, but its power accessories, comfort
features and most of the price tag remain intact. It's tuned in to
drivers primarily interested in performance, and is available only
with a six-speed stick shift, beefier suspension and a limited-slip
differential.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still a luxury sports car by any measure, more geared
toward grand touring than club racing.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this is a Corvette and the performance is right up
there. All three versions of the new Corvette are a quantum leap
beyond the previous models, with acceleration, handling and
stopping power of the first order. In other words, you can get in
deep trouble driving without restraint.
</P>
<P>
   The hardtop is a low-volume 'Vette _ only about 15 percent of
the overall 1999 Corvette run of 28,500 will be hardtops _ and as
such could have the potential of becoming a collector's item.
Fixed-hardtop Corvettes are a definite rarity in the model's
46-year history, with most being convertibles or coupes with
removable roof inserts.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the advantage of the '99 hardtop is a body stiffened by
the solid roof, as well as the sports-handling package, which comes
as standard equipment. There's a practical side, too: Unlike the
coupe or convertible, the hardtop has a reasonably good-size trunk.
</P>
<P>
   But there's disappointment of my own entering in here. Instead
of being a snug and quiet cockpit, as expected, the interior is
open into the trunk space all the way back to the tail. This makes
a fine little echo chamber to transmit all of the road noise
created by the rear tires.
</P>
<P>
   There's significant tire noise when you have foot-wide
high-performance rubber. The open trunk area just serves to amplify
the racket, especially on freeway concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Also, you find that when you open the trunk, there's something
missing: a light. That's annoying for a car in the $40,000 range.
</P>
<P>
   Although the performance is hot, I have the same complaint with
the hardtop that I do with other 'Vettes: The traction-control
system is intrusive and annoying, stealing the fun right out from
under you. It can get really dicey scooting out into traffic, when
the engine suddenly shuts down for an instant as the overly
sensitive system detects some wheel spin. Other drivers slamming on
their brakes are not real understanding.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to deal with the traction control is to shut it off
every time you drive. Unless, maybe, you're driving in snow.
</P>
<P>
   The test Corvette was equipped with the Active Handling System,
a $500 option. This can save your hide if things get going a little
too fast, or you enter a turn just a bit too hot. It can keep the
car from skidding out of control or spinning.
</P>
<P>
   A Corvette with stick shift is preferred by far over one with
automatic. In the past, I've found the Corvette's automatic to be
sluggish and uninspiring, stealing too much of the excitement of
driving such a hot car. The six-speed shifts slickly, and that
sixth gear, which allows you to travel at highway speed with the
engine turning at a slow rumble, is excellent for gas economy.
</P>
<P>
   The hardtop configuration brings a new look to the swooping
shape of the fiberglass body. It looks interesting and purposeful,
more so than the fastback or even the convertible.
</P>
<P>
   One fault, though: no open-air driving.
</P>
<P>
   For Corvette fans, the new hardtop is an exciting development,
an acknowledgment by Chevrolet that the 'Vette is indeed a hot
number that can perform on the racetrack as well as the street.
</P>
<P>
   The price is still too high for most folk, though a couple
thousand less than the fastback and about $7,000 less than the
ragtop.
</P>
<P>
   Corvettes in general are not to everyone's taste, looking too
garish or roaring too loud or just seeming like an outward
manifestation of the driver's insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, we've heard all that, but the newest version of the
Corvette has sparked interest from people who never were interested
in 'Vettes before, including those who drive European sports cars.
Many of them have come around to appreciating the sound and fury of
this modern classic. &QL;

summer, Boxer asked for the lifting of a federal requirement that
communities must pay 25 percent of the overall cost. (250 words.)

there was no need to proclaim the Colorado connection. The state's

   MAINE-DRUG-ALLEN. Drug makers and U.S. Rep. Tom Allen, D-Maine,
fired new salvos this week in their high-stakes battle over whether
the federal government should regulate how much old people pay for
prescription drugs. The drug makers' trade group released a study
on Monday that appears to debunk Democratic lawmakers' claims that
the industry gouges older Americans with unfair prices. And
Thursday, lawmakers responded with a critique of the new study. At
stake is Allen's ``Prescription Drug Fairness Act,'' a high-profile
bill that would force drug makers to charge neighborhood pharmacies
the same prices they give their bulk customers. (600 words.) By

PLAYERS DEFEND VIOLENT COMPUTER GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHERINE SELIGMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 15 million copies of a shoot-'em-up 3-D computer game
called Doom are floating around the world, used by players who
wield virtual guns and chain saws to blast away monsters.
</P>
<P>
   One such user apparently was one of the young gunmen in
Littleton, Colo., who knew the game well enough to design his own
map. A World Wide Web site believed to have been originated by Eric
Harris indicates his interest in Doom, which features imaginary
combat on a number of escalating levels of difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, 18, and fellow gunman Dylan Klebold, 17, reportedly
dipped into the Gothic subculture, wearing black clothes, trench
coats and playing fantasy games. They are believed to be members of
what was called the ``Trench Coat Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Columbine High School students apparently took their own
lives after killing 13 other people at the school Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Blaming video games for the mass murder at Columbine is
ridiculous, Doom enthusiasts said Wednesday, a week after families
of three students killed in a school rampage in Paducah, Ky., filed
a lawsuit against video game software companies, claiming the
violent games contributed to that attack.
</P>
<P>
   Internet chat rooms and billboards frequented by fans of the
computer game were buzzing with reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine people playing the game and deciding to
emulate the game unless they have severe problems otherwise,'' said
Andrew Stine, 17, a San Diego high school student who moderates a
Doom Web site. ``I don't think playing Doom and committing violent
acts have any relationship to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Stine said he had watched a televised account of items being
removed from Harris' house, including books based on the game Doom,
and found it ``creepy.'' But he still places no faith in the theory
that violent video games, which have been around for years before
software makers figured out a way to create 3-D adventures, cause
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Dixon, a 20-year-old college student in Canada who is
studying education, agrees. An avid fan who plays about an hour per
day, Dixon thinks ``poor parenting'' is a more likely cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is losing sight of what the problem is,'' he said.
``If better parenting were involved, none of this would have
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The families in Kentucky also sued other entertainment
companies, alleging that the movie ``The Basketball Diaries''
influenced the killer. Among the list of video game defendants was
id Software Inc., the maker of Doom.
</P>
<P>
   An id Software executive did not return a telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   Doom, developed in 1993, has been joined by newer games created
by id and other companies, Doom players said. Id's Quake games are
similar to Doom, with players being guided through battles that can
be played singly or in groups.
</P>
<P>
   Quake III features ``heart-thumping action'' along with
``atmospheric use of fog and spectacular lighting,'' according to
id's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The players are generally high school and college students. Id's
Web site says that more than 15 million copies of the free version
of Doom have been downloaded around the world. More than 2 million
copies of a subsequent version available in stores have been sold,
it says.
</P>
<P>
   The game has won numerous awards from computer game magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it surprising they'd be playing Doom,'' said Stine,
who has stuck to the game because of its simplicity and the fact it
runs on his older model computer. ``It's such an old game. My Web
site gets only about 1,500 unique visitors a day. It's creepy to
think that two of those might have been those two kids.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the wake of any war come questions, dazed, wondering
questions. What, finally, did we gain from fighting? What did we
learn? Why did this conflict have to happen in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, then, it is appropriate that the new musical called
``The Civil War,'' whose subject is nothing less than what its
grand, stark title promises, should provoke a similar litany of
questions. Why are we here at the St. James Theater? What is the
point in remaining for more than two hours? Why would anyone stage
a show that improbably drains the drama from what is still the most
fraught and painful chapter in American history?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Civil War,'' which opened Thursday night, has a score by
Frank Wildhorn, who these days bestrides Broadway with the
colossus-like status once belonging to Andrew Lloyd Webber.
Wildhorn is also the composer of two other current shows, the
tenacious cult hit ``Jekyll and Hyde'' and ``The Scarlet
Pimpernel.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Wildhorn, whose work has sliced right through thorny
thickets of hostile reviews, knows his public. It is his avowed
intention to blur the lines between what is heard in new American
musicals, which have become increasingly cerebral, and what is
heard on popular radio. In extending his thematic breadth, he has
made the not illogical leap from ghouls and swashbucklers to a war
that, as the success of Ken Burns' documentary series on the same
subject testified, remains enduringly close to the American heart.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, this all makes sense in an age in which most new
Broadway scores are about as easy to whistle as Schoenberg. (Try to
imagine something from ``Passion'' or ``Parade'' in the Top 40.)
Nonetheless, you are unlikely to leave ``The Civil War'' with its
tunes clinging doggedly to your memory in the sticky manner of
Lloyd Webber's. Indeed, even more than in ``Jekyll'' and
``Pimpernel,'' Wildhorn's songs for ``The Civil War'' blend into
one bland current of generic pop. The overall effect is of being
imprisoned not in some theme-appropriate cell in Andersonville but
in a jukebox stocked entirely with B-side selections.
</P>
<P>
   Generic is the operative word for ``The Civil War,'' which has
been directed by no less a Broadway veteran than Jerry Zaks and
features lyrics by Wildhorn, Gregory Boyd and Jack Murphy.
Originally commissioned for the Alley Theater in Houston, where
Boyd is the artistic director, the show is without plot and
essentially without character.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it is a string of musical numbers meant to frame the
war through the varying perspectives of Yankees, Confederates and
Southern slaves. Frederick Douglass (played by Keith Byron Kirk),
the fabled black journalist and statesman, occasionally wanders in
to offer some rather baffling spoken narrative snippets, and the
voice of Abraham Lincoln (David M. Lutken) is heard saying what
Lincoln always says, but everything else is presented in
self-contained songs. It's a bit as if ``Ragtime'' had been crossed
with a revue like ``Smokey Joe's Cafe'' and then run through a
homogenizing synthesizer.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't the form. It's that there's not one moment of
insight or originality in the show's consideration of matters that
have already been exhaustively written about and portrayed. The
method of ``The Civil War,'' in its lyrics and historical allusions
as well as in its music, is to strike chords with which even an
elementary school student would be familiar.
</P>
<P>
   The show arranges its archetypal elements into confoundingly
static patterns, laying out all its cards in its opening minutes
and then failing to combine them in ways that would build to
revelation or strong emotional response. Though the musical covers
the full span of the war, with the names, dates and casualty counts
of major battles projected in supertitles, you eventually come to
feel that you have been watching the same rotating diorama.
</P>
<P>
   By the first battle scene, for example, a boy in blue has shot a
boy in gray and, examining the corpse, exclaimed, ``No! He's my
brother.'' Neither killer nor victim has been established as a
character, so both are sterile abstractions.
</P>
<P>
   Members from troops of both sides sing interchangeably about the
idea of honor. A young Union corporal and his wife (Gilles Chiasson
and Irene Molloy) sing wistful love letters to each other that give
no sense whatever of individual identity. The chorus of slaves
shifts, again and again, between mournful and angry denunciations
of the institution that has dehumanized them and uplifting gospel
numbers guaranteed to set the audience clapping.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The lyrics throughout use, and consistently flatten, imagery of
dark nights and hoped-for mornings, of rushing, metaphoric streams
and rivers, one of which is actually made up of ``blood, sweat and
tears.'' Occasionally there are slow-motion fights amid clouds of
smoke and flashing light. (The ``musical staging'' is by Luis
Perez.) By the end, the adversarial soldiers realize, ``When all is
said and done, I guess we're all the same,'' that the only thing
distinguishing them from one another is ``a different name.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, the absence of character-defining specificity was
deliberate, an attempt to extend the show's universal resonance.
The feeling is underscored by Douglas W. Schmidt's allegorical set,
which features the outsize images of a war-rent American flag and a
Hellenic frieze showing battling gods. But without humanizing
detail, none of the people onstage grab our hearts.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're going to quote once again Lincoln's famous letter
to Mrs. Bixby on the loss of her five sons, which was conspicuously
used in the movie ``Saving Private Ryan,'' surely it could be
followed up with something more enlightening than the bereaved
mother (Beth Leavell) singing vaguely about her boys playing with
angels in a field.
</P>
<P>
   When period photographs of soldiers and slaves are shown (the
projections are by the ubiquitous Wendall K. Harrington), it
creates a hunger to know the stories behind those images. That the
same cannot be said of any of the live presences onstage isn't
because the eager, attractive cast members don't do their jobs.
They all sing rousingly or prettily, as the occasion demands,
through those snakelike appendages over their faces; when America
goes to war on Broadway in 1999, it wears a head mike.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestrations (by Kim Scharnberg) make use of banjos,
fiddles, guitars and harmonicas in a score that invokes period
gospels, waltzes and marches. But it all tends to merge into one
contemporary melodic blur that brings to mind an easy-listening
radio station.
</P>
<P>
   You find your attention straying from the songs themselves to
what they vaguely remind you of, from folksy numbers associated
with Harry Chapin and James Taylor to the heartbreak ballads of
Whitney Houston and Celine Dion. Such are the ghosts that float
through ``The Civil War,'' a show haunted less by the victims of
war than by these pale variations on pop standards.

 &HT;    JAMAICA PLAGUED BY MORE UNREST, TOURISM COULD SUFFER
 &HT;    Moving in (i) international category

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI -- Jamaica is a popular tourist destination known for many
things -- nice beaches, Red Stripe beer and all-inclusive resorts.
And, sometimes, it's been known for violence.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the island lived up to the worst of its reputation.
Jamaicans erupted in fury after the government proposed $100
million in new taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Looting, shootings and the setting of fiery barricades of tires
and furniture forced schools, businesses, and even the U.S. Embassy
to close Wednesday. Several airlines cancelled flights to the
island.
</P>
<P>
   At least six people were killed and 23 people were seriously
injured. One 25-year-old pregnant woman was shot by a private
security guard as he tried to fend off looters.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister P.J. Patterson now says he's ready to back down
on taxes, which appeared to bring calm on Thursday. The U.S.
Embassy reopended as well.
</P>
<P>
   But the violence, which sparked fears of a decline in Jamaica's
tourism industry, was nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country has a long history of violence, partly driven by
politics, partly driven by a gun culture, and partly driven by
economic troubles,'' said Larry Birns, director of the Council on
Hemispheric Affairs, a Washington-based research group.
</P>
<P>
   Although there's been a slight dip in the nation's astonishing
murder rate, street crime -- everything from carjackings to armed
robberies --persists.
</P>
<P>
   In a country of 2.5 million, 953 people were murdered in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, two busloads of German tourists were held up by
robbers armed with guns and daggers. No one was injured, but it was
one of the high-profile crimes against tourists that made the
Jamaican government decide in January to deploy troops to resort
areas to safeguard tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Then in March, a German tour operator was killed by a hammer
blow to the head during a robbery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things happen here as they do in any country, but that
shouldn't impact a tourist's decision to visit Jamaica, which has
so much to offer,'' said Noel Mignott, deputy director of the
Jamaica Tourist Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police in Jamaica do an excellent job,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials say crimes against visitors have dropped
dramatically in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   But experts who know Jamaica say crime levels in general are
still high, fueled by drug trafficking and the large number of
firearms routinely smuggled into the country.
</P>
<P>
   Violent streaks also occur whenever the population grows
frustrated with a deteriorating economy, as it did this week.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1985, at least seven people were killed in two days
of violence as Jamaicans paralyzed traffic to protest higher gas
prices in the midst of a foundering economy. Deadly gas price riots
also occurred in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials emphasize that the country's murder rate is
down from an all-time high of 1,038 in 1997, and that the vast
majority of killings take place in Kingston, Jamaica's capital, far
from the tourist resorts in Ocho Rios and Montego Bay.
</P>
<P>
   And most of this week's unrest occurred in Kingston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that this was an internal thing and that
protesters made an attempt to leave hotels and tourists out of it
because they recognize the value of that industry,'' said Karen
Hackshaw, a spokeswoman for the Caribbean Tourism Organization in
Barbados.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said tourism officials are concerned there could be
some fallout from the unrest.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines canceled flights to Kingston on Wednesday,
although service was to resume Friday. Air Jamaica _ which resumed
service Thursday _ and British Airways, also had canceled trips, as
did three cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   On an island that has an unemployment rate of nearly 17 percent,
at least 25 percent of the country's residents depend on tourism
for their livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
   The Caribbean's largest English-speaking nation hosts 2 million
visitors a year, including 700,000 cruise ship passengers, most
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Although some hotels reported cancellations, many in the tourist
industry reported business as usual on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a normal amount of business in Montego Bay and
the hotel has been full of tourists, so we're not being affected,''
said Suzette Scott of the Coyaba Beach Resort in Montego Bay.
</P>
<P>
   But Dennis Gayle, a professor of international business at
Florida International University who was born in Jamaica, said this
week's unrest had cost the country at least $30 million in trip
cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an economy that will not be revived any time soon,''
he said, adding that it has been plagued by mounting government
budget deficits for decades.
</P>
<P>
   This week's protests began last Friday after Finance Minister
Omar Davies unveiled a 30 percent tax increase on gasoline and
diesel and other fuels. The hike would take the price of leaded
gasoline from $1.55 to $2.01 per U.S. gallon, and the price of
diesel fuel from $1.33 to $1.74 per U.S. gallon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imposing taxes is never pleasant, but what we've done is the
best for Jamaica,'' said Prime Minister Patterson early in the
week.
</P>
<P>
   But Patterson softened his stance Wednesday in the face of
widespread protests and calls for his resignation. He named a panel
to make recommendations for at least a partial reduction on the
proposed tax by Sunday so that his Cabinet might consider it on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson's announcement may provide only a temporary reprieve
since, in the midst of a faltering economy, the government still
must find a way out of its financial quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   Both the country's agriculture and manufacturing sectors have
experienced declines, and even tourism's growth has been minimal.
As a result, the economy contracted by 0.8 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the government admitted it couldn't afford its $3.6
billion budget and that it would have to slash public expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed taxes were to help restore lost money to about 2
million depositors at failed banks, 500,000 policyholders in
collapsed insurance companies, and 55,000 pensioners.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, opposition Labor Party leader Edward Seaga warned
that protests would begin anew if Patterson's proposal failed to
lead to a ditching of the taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were already concerned about jobs and the high cost of
living,'' said Cliff Cameron, former president of the Private
Sector Organization of Jamaica. ``That gas tax increase was just
the straw that broke the camel's back.''

SPEAKING OF DEMONS ... BUT WE CAN'T
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is unfortunate that modern, civilized men and women have
become too sophisticated to speak seriously of demon possession or
to describe acts of unspeakable horror as manifestations of evil
incarnated.
</P>
<P>
   If that were not so, it would be so much easier to explain the
ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, the Rwandan genocidal rampage, the
hideousness of the killing and mutilating in Sierra Leone, Saddam
Hussein and the massacre of the innocents at Columbine High School
in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   To suggest that the devil makes them do it is to risk being
branded as naive, although no one else has a better explanation.
</P>
<P>
   The devil aside, the usual suspects must be hauled in again
after the Littleton atrocity to try to make some sense of the
incomprehensible. The objective of that exercise is to try to
prevent more repetitions of a form of tragedy that has been
repeated with terrifying frequency in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Suspect No. 1 in the view of many Americans will once again be a
decline in the quality of parenting. It is logical to conclude that
adolescent sociopaths capable of slaughtering fellow students and
taking great relish in doing so were in some major respects failed
by their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Something had to be missing in their rearing _ love, discipline,
moral instruction, quality time.
</P>
<P>
   Suspect No. 2, some will suggest, is a combination of lax campus
security and the inattentiveness of teachers, counselors and
administrators to anti-social behavior on the part of some
students.
</P>
<P>
   There was, after all, something decidedly peculiar about a group
of students who wore black trench coats year-round, exhibited
hostility toward other students and showed a fascination with guns.
</P>
<P>
   But that's crystal-clear hindsight. The Littleton school
authorities and everyone in that community were perfectly justified
in assuming that such a bloodbath would never happen there _ not in
their largely homogeneous, affluent, suburban school district.
</P>
<P>
   There will now be a rush to take steps to prevent a recurrence,
and in the process the school could become more like a prison.
Other schools around the nation will react similarly. But the
simple fact is that a determined sociopath, particularly one
disposed to suicide, can defeat any protective system.
</P>
<P>
   The third suspect is the ready availability of guns in this
society. In the wake of this tragedy, there will be intensified
calls for tighter restrictions on gun ownership. But the truth is
that the culprits in this case would have found a way to get the
weapons they used, including grenades and homemade bombs, under any
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth suspect is entertainment. Every time something like
this happens, the movie industry, the video game industry, the
music industry and television take a public beating for promoting a
culture of violence. And they deserve it.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the usual suspects, the media are the most culpable.
Amusement industries' apologists try to brush off the criticism by
glibly asserting, like gunmakers, that their products don't make
people hurt people. But they do.
</P>
<P>
   The constant inundation of violent images with which children's
minds are bombarded from toddlerhood to adulthood predisposes them
to accepting violent action, including multiple murders, as
ordinary fare. In the process, human life is devalued for them.
</P>
<P>
   It is no wonder, then, that one of the suicidal members of the
Littleton slaughter team reportedly quoted a line from a movie
(''It's a good day to die'') as he went about his egregious
business.
</P>
<P>
   The killers appeared to be divorced from reality, caught up in a
virtual world gone mad _ a world in which they were free to play
God; to decide who should live and who should die; to take
vengeance upon anyone who had ever offended them; to eliminate
those they envied (the athletes) and those they hated instinctively
(the minorities).
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, they were similar to Slobodan Milosevic, Saddam
Hussein and Adolf Hitler, that personification of evil whose
birthday anniversary fell, certainly not coincidentally, on the day
they vented their pent-up rage.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that the makers of films, records and video games
contribute to the development of that kind of mind-set, they are
complicit in the increasing amount of violence being perpetrated by
America's children.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the devaluation of human life that is occurring in
this country and around the world certainly cannot be blamed
entirely on films, television or the virtual-reality-enhancing
powers of increasingly sophisticated computer games and networks.
</P>
<P>
   There appears to be something more pervasive and frightening
going on. But it is not sophisticated to speak of evil or demon
possession these days, even if no one has a better explanation.

SHOOTING LEAVES A CLOUD OF DARKNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ The skies over Columbine High School mirrored
the anguished, inconsistent mood of the throngs convened below.
Sometimes the tears and the rain could come, sometimes they
couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   As hundreds of people circulated through an adjacent park
Wednesday in a hushed state of ambulatory bereavement, the clouds
above dropped lower by the hour, finally forming charcoal cumulus
formations that dipped like molten wax over the assemblage.
</P>
<P>
   Only the occasional sprinkle mingled with the tears of the
weeping masses, many of them students of the school where death
came calling one day before.
</P>
<P>
   Clinging to one another in couples and in groups, the students
sobbed silently, or wailed. They hoisted signs, created shrines
and, like the teen-agers they are, mingled madly.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen dead. Gunned down by two of their own, who apparently
killed themselves. There was the one thing the students couldn't
wrap their arms around. The circumstance remained stubbornly
incomprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   The children were not alone. They were matched in numbers by
adult members of this mind-boggled community, including many of
their parents. Clergy strolled through the crowd, offering
consolation to those who asked for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm struck by the sense of caring that these people are
showing each other,'' said the Rev. Peter Sawtell of the Columbine
United Church. ``It's amazing how people find a place to gather and
show their sense of caring.''
</P>
<P>
   One shrine, at the base of a leafless tree, was festooned by
balloons _ some in the shapes of butterflies, others bearing the
proud name of Columbine High School _ as well as hundreds of
flowers and several teddy bears.
</P>
<P>
   Another featured a huge canvas sign where students could write
messages to the living and the dead. One read: ``We'll miss all of
you. I don't understand why this had to happen to us. WHY? Jami.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why'' and ``love'' are frequently used here.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say there was no anger. Above the tree shrine, on
a giant poster board, was this declaration: ``These flowers and
prayers are for the innocent victims and their families, not for
the two monsters that committed these selfish and violent acts.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Dylan Klebold, 17, and Eric Harris, 18, the two
gunmen who rampaged through the school Tuesday, killing students
and a teacher, before turning their guns on themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One female friend told a Denver TV station the two young men
were ``good people who made bad choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Josh Swanson, a 17-year-old senior, knew them both, though not
well. He said Harris played on the recreational soccer league
before joining the so-called ``Trench Coat Mafia,'' a small group
of outcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson said most of the Trench Coat Mafia ``are very smart
kids. They made good grades.''
</P>
<P>
   But they had been rejected, and teased, by many of the students.
Why? ``They didn't have very good hygiene,'' Swanson said. ``They
had greasy hair and smelled a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Klebold, he added, ``got teased a little more'' than the rest.

`EXISTENZ': IN A GRISLY `VIRTUAL' GAME, FLESH AND BLOOD ARE NOT 
</HEADLINE>
   Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most films that explore the possibilities of virtual reality
have some aspirations to sleek science fiction. Not David
Cronenberg's. His ``Existenz'' has the oozing, throbbing, ghoulish
hallmarks of other Cronenberg fever dreams (``Naked Lunch,'' ``The
Fly'').
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes it even has enough coolly remote style to make
them palatable. Detachment helps when a film's weapon of choice is
called a gristle gun and defined this way: ``A pistol made of bone
and gristle, almost like the half-decayed body of a small mammal
whose snout is the barrel, and whose rigid hind leg is the trigger.
Instead of bullets, the gun shoots human teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   But who is being wounded? And where? And why? Quicker than you
can say yuck, the film tosses its audience into a bizarre
assassination attempt on Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), the
supposedly awesome designer of the world's most challenging virtual
reality game.
</P>
<P>
   Its name, the film's title, is pronounced ``eggs is tense'' and
meant to have a whiff of the philosophical, even if its
intellectual ambition seems mostly limited to spelling
affectations. (The official title is ``eXistenZ.'') In any case,
Cronenberg reportedly had his cast read Sartre, Kierkegaard,
Nietzsche and Camus to get into the proper mood.
</P>
<P>
   Even more improbably, he took his story's inspiration from the
plight of Salman Rushdie, to the extent that the screenplay uses
the word fatwa and Allegra finds herself on the run. After being
pronounced both ``goddess'' and ``demoness'' in the opening
sequence, and after having introduced her game to a group of
players, Allegra goes into hiding with her prototype meta-flesh
game pod for company.
</P>
<P>
   This contains the essence of her new game. It's a fleshy lump
with several nipples, and it's meant to be stroked by game players
with masturbatory raptness. It comes with an umbilical cord.
Allegra refers to it as ``my baby.''
</P>
<P>
   And this is just the setup for ``Existenz,'' which gives Allegra
a bewildered young admirer, Ted Pikul (Jude Law), for companionship
and sends her hurtling into her own game. Bristling with more bored
hauteur than the situation warrants, Ms. Leigh's Allegra petulantly
explains to Ted that they must test her invention to make sure it
hasn't been damaged. And for that he needs a Bioport, a special new
orifice, in his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I've been dying to play your games, but I have this
phobia about having my body penetrated surgically,'' Ted tells her.
That would be the film's best line if Allegra didn't later stick
her tongue into Ted's port, explaining: ``That wasn't me. That was
my game character.'' Sure.
</P>
<P>
   The film's two main characters, who never mesh especially well,
find themselves moving between reality and an increasingly grisly
virtual world. Long before the audience meets a two-headed
salamander or learns that frog parts are being used to make game
pods, the film has tried to meld Cronenberg's ideas about an artist
struggling with her creation with the stomach-turning kinks that
define his brand of psychological horror.
</P>
<P>
   As Ted says while eating something ghastly in a Chinese
restaurant, ``I find this disgusting, but I can't help myself.''
The best-case scenario for being caught up in ``Existenz'' goes
something like that.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way to the game's unknown goal, and to a trick ending
better than most of what precedes it, ``Existenz'' has a brief,
sharp interlude with Willem Dafoe, who is darkly funny in the role
of a mechanic. (``Is this a gas station?'' he is asked. ``Only on
the most pathetic level of reality,'' he replies.)
</P>
<P>
   Several actors who have appeared with chilling effectiveness in
Atom Egoyan's films (Ian Holm, Sarah Polley, Don McKellar) are also
on hand to add their share of mystery. Design note: though the film
includes a few distinctively throbbing, fleshy props, it is more
interestingly bare of clocks, watches, screens, telephones and
other familiar elements. If only the frog parts had been missing
too.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES

<P>
   ``I really must insist you help me win the election tomorrow,''
declares Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon), a tough little cookie
running for president of her high school in Omaha, Neb.
Unfortunately, she's praying at the time. Doesn't matter. Tracy
sees herself as the class winner and she brooks no interference.
She finds it best to talk to everyone that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Election'' is Alexander Payne's acerbic satire of the American
electoral process. From the news that Tracy's Mom solicited
tactical advice from Elizabeth Dole and Connie Chung to a
photograph of Tracy smiling confidently at the polling place, it
joins his earlier (and even more wicked) ``Citizen Ruth'' in
skewering political ethics and behavior, with a lovely ear for
hypocritical conversation. The screenplay, by Payne and Jim Taylor,
delights in letting the teachers sound extra-teachery (``Good luck
there, Tracy'') and in keeping all the characters a few beats off
what they actually mean. In keeping with that spirit, the film
takes place at George Washington Carver High School, where almost
all the students are white.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, when a faculty member named Jim McAllister (Matthew
Broderick) says, ``Maybe it's time to give something back'' to a
handsome jock, what he really means is: ``Run against Tracy. Crush
her like a bug. She has to be stopped.'' McAllister would probably
hate Tracy even if she hadn't ruined the life of one of his
colleagues, whose mentoring of Tracy (``It seems you might need a
friend'') eventually meant sending her a mash note inviting her to
Maui. Tracy's affair with the other teacher is described
humorously, even if it doesn't seem like a credible occurrence.
Tracy is too busy making Tracy posters to fool around.
</P>
<P>
   As for McAllister, Payne has him begin by lecturing students on
the difference between morals and ethics. This is a sure tipoff
that his own scruples are about to be ruined. Sure enough, the film
watches him try to sabotage Tracy's campaign while also developing
a yen for a neighborhood divorcee, the ex-wife of Tracy's paramour.
``I began to see what an incredibly sensitive and giving person she
was,'' he says in voice-over. The camera notices that it's really
the divorcee's cleavage that he has begun to see.
</P>
<P>
   This story might have lent itself to pratfalls and broad gags,
but Payne keeps it chillier. He sees the frailties of all the
film's characters, even if its plot is supposedly about winners and
losers. And for all its nicely malevolent humor, this is a story
that ultimately leads to disillusionment. As in ``Citizen Ruth,''
Payne has trouble resolving real issues with a simple ending. But
the sentiment voiced by McAllister is ``It just makes me sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Broderick knows how to make a fool of himself in very funny
ways, and he gives a sneakily good performance here. Ms.
Witherspoon, narrowing her eyes into slits whenever Tracy is
thwarted, charges through the film with all due comic monstrousness
and turns her character into somebody everyone knows.
</P>
<P>
   And Chris Klein, as the hunk who runs against Tracy, plays his
role winningly, in a style best described as early Keanu. His
sister, Tammy (Jessica Campbell), also a memorable character, makes
herself the school's favorite dark horse by declaring, ``Who cares
about this stupid election?'' This is no week to be laughing about
surreptitious scheming in a high school. But ``Election'' is a deft
dark comedy with a resemblance to ``Rushmore.'' It's smart no
matter what.

TEENS SHOWED SIGNS OF TROUBLE, SPECIALISTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARSHA GINSBURG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Had anyone been looking a little harder, they
would have seen red flags hinting that Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan
Klebold, 17, were in serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The two Colorado seniors who killed 12 classmates, a teacher
and, finally, themselves in the worst school shooting in American
history were behaving in ways that analysts say indicate a child is
headed toward violence.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, many teen-agers behave similarly, yet they don't
burst into schools and kill people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are patterns of behavior you can recognize, but the
behavior is not so different from other kids who go through radical
behaviors and emerge just fine,'' said Michael Kelleher, who has
analyzed school killings in his book, ``When Good Kids Kill.''
``There are very subtle differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Although much is still unknown about Harris and Klebold, the few
facts tumbling out about them suggest that, like other young
killers in other school shootings in the past two years, there were
plenty of warning signs.
</P>
<P>
   They were isolated from other students who taunted them for not
fitting in with one of Columbine High School's cliques, and created
their own group: the black-clad ``Trench Coat Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   They immersed themselves in so-called fringe activities such as
role-playing computer games heavy on violence and fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   They held Web site conversations that discussed death, killing
and fury.
</P>
<P>
   They openly expressed hatred of certain groups: ethnic
minorities, athletes and the in-crowd.
</P>
<P>
   They boasted to classmates of having guns and the knowledge to
make bombs.
</P>
<P>
   They had recent run-ins with the law, arrested last year for
breaking into a car.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher and other specialists say any adult should pay
attention to these warning signs, even while realizing that most
disenfranchised teens turn out fine. And they should intervene by
talking extensively with children in their lives and by getting
them involved in social activities, be it work, or clubs or
volunteer efforts. If they don't, Kelleher said, society must
always be prepared to pay the price.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just pack yourself away and say you don't care,
because society won't work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Educators, psychologists and others say there are many things
that schools, parents and society at large can do to stem what
seems to be an increasing culture of violence in America.
</P>
<P>
   Most say the first line of defense remains the family.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a 1997 study published in the Journal of the American
Medical Association found that teen-agers' connections with their
parents and schools were the most powerful predictors of their
well-being.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers surveyed 90,000 seventh- through 12th-graders
nationwide. They found that children who spent more time with their
parents before or after school, and who discussed values and
expectations with their parents, were far less likely to drink,
smoke, have thoughts of suicide or get involved in violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``How often do we sit down and really communicate about issues
with our kids?'' Kelleher said. ``Information flows in great
quantity and with great rapidity, but it lacks the moral imperative
that goes with the communication of old-fashioned talking.''
</P>
<P>
   The schools, the next line of defense, can also do a better job
of knowing the student they are preparing for the world, added
Michael Rosenberg, chairman of the special education department at
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many activities for the sports-minded and
academic-minded,'' Rosenberg said. ``But what happens is that kids
who are not in either group feel further and further away.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had been stunned when he saw Columbine High students
saying on television news that the suspects were at the bottom of
the ``food chain'' at the 1,965-student school.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's it like for these kids to be at the bottom of the food
chain?'' Rosenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Bullying, teasing and name-calling have been going on since
childhood was born, he acknowledged, but not every kid takes it in
the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some listen to taunts and suck it up and become brain
surgeons,'' he said. ``Others go to a bell tower and shoot
people.''

`DURANGO': AH, HOME ON THE RANGE, AND ESPECIALLY GREEN ONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af)  
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes it's comforting to watch a film that lets you know in
its first minutes just where it's headed. ``Durango'' telegraphs
its trajectory immediately. It gives you a decent young man with a
Big Idea who asks his neighbors to believe in him. Will they do so?
Will their faith be rewarded? Will the young man's success help him
win the hand of his beloved?
</P>
<P>
   Are the hills of Ireland green?
</P>
<P>
   So with no need to worry about the proceedings turning tragic,
you can sit back and relax while this sweetly improbable story
meanders through the dazzling Irish countryside. The trip may not
be exciting, but it's a delight nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its title, ``Durango,'' which CBS is offering on Sunday
night, is not a western. It is about a cattle drive, but through
County Kerry in 1939. The drive ends at a cowboy-theme pub called
Durango. That might seem like an anachronistic touch.
</P>
<P>
   But this being a made-for-television movie, it was based (all
together now!) (italics)on a true story.(end italics) In this case
the true story inspired a book by John B. Keane, the
publican-novelist of Listowel, who was one of the real Irish
drovers.
</P>
<P>
   The decent young man is Mark Doran (Matt Keeslar), who raises
cows with his widowed mum. The other farmers in Mark's village sell
their cattle at a crummy price to a sleazy local businessman who
then sells the stock at a whopping profit. The farmers know they
could get a better price at the market town 40 miles away. But how
to move the animals? There's no rail connection, and the farmers
can't afford a truck.
</P>
<P>
   Mark's inspiration is to organize that cattle drive. ``There's
many a good reason why it can't be done,'' says one of the
village's leading citizens, Fergus Mullaney (Patrick Bergin). For
starters, the route to market passes through a treacherous bog and
over a haunted hill.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mark gets Fergus' blessing and his dear old bull to sell.
What Mark really wants from Fergus is permission to marry his
daughter Annie, his youngest child and the apple of his possessive
eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never let that darlin' girl go,'' says Fergus. ``If any
man ever comes near her, I'll pull off his head like the cork out
of an ink bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   The twinkle-eyed Annie (Nancy St. Alban) worries, but just for a
moment, that his neighbors' hopes and dreams may be too heavy a
burden for Mark. ``It doesn't weigh you down a bit?'' she asks.
``It lifts me up,'' he declares.
</P>
<P>
   Even a viewer too sophisticated for this kind of fluff may feel
a bit lifted up, too, as Mark and his ragtag crew move toward their
goal.
</P>
<P>
   The script, by the veteran screenwriter Walter Bernstein, never
strays across the border from sweet into maudlin. The film is full
of broadly drawn Irish characters, but there's no caricature in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most memorable supporting players are Brenda Fricker
as Mark's tough-talking Aunt Maeve, George Hearn, as a
motorcycle-riding Protestant rector, and Mark Lambert as a deserter
from the Irish Army who wants to join the British one so he can
fight Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Shields, who has been a producer for several ``Hallmark
Hall of Fame'' productions, makes his directing debut with this
one. He keeps his winning cast moving in the right direction, well
served by man and beast.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, beast. These cattle are not the monolithic longhorns of
``Rawhide.'' They are a mismatched pride of proud animals that seem
as wise as judges. Each one looks as if it could tell you a story
worth hearing. But none looks as if it would yield much of a
brisket.

A SURVIVAL TALE IN THE ICE FLOES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An engrossing if partial account of an incredible feat of
survival, Frank Hurley's film ``South: Ernest Shackleton and the
Endurance Expedition'' (1919) also must rank as one of the better
dog movies.
</P>
<P>
   On the 1914 voyage from Buenos Aires to the Antarctic continent,
which Shackleton planned to cross on foot, the decks of his ship,
the Endurance, were lined with kennels of the dogs who were to pull
his sleds. A more attractive, winning group of animals would be
hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, everything aboard the Endurance has a natural grace in
Hurley's film, which has been restored and is available on cassette
from Milestone Film and Video. As photographer of the expedition _
his still pictures and clips from the film are on view at the
American Museum of Natural History (review in the Art Guide, page
X) _ he reveals a group of 27 men who seem particularly at ease
with themselves and their situation, even when it begins to
deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   Shackleton never went on his trek, of course. The Endurance
became stuck in the ice before reaching land and was eventually
crushed. Having abandoned ship (the dogs sliding down a canvas
chute), the party drifted for months on the floes before sailing
their lifeboats to a tiny speck called Elephant Island.
</P>
<P>
   From there Shackleton and five crewmen got aboard the 22-foot
boat called the James Caird and in an astounding display of
seamanship kept it upright across 800 miles of the wildest water on
earth. Upon reaching South Georgia Island, he dispatched a rescue
party that, after three failed attempts, plucked his fellows off
Elephant Island. Every one of them lived.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley wasn't with Shackleton in the James Caird, so the latter
part of the saga is depicted only in drawings and referred to in
caption panels. But ``South'' offers wonderful views of the voyage.
Gradually the adventurers, who are mostly scientists, begin to see
their breath. A group of crab-eater seals is spotted headed in the
opposite direction, a sign of a bad winter. As the pack ice closes
in, Shackleton climbs to the crow's nest and directs the ship into
the floes.
</P>
<P>
   In one fine stretch of film, the Endurance acts as a battering
ram, with the great shadow of its bowsprit fleeting across the snow
as the prow opens seams through the ice beneath. At last the ship
is brought to a stop. The crew, a capable-looking pipe-smoking lot
dressed in woolens (no down parkas in those days) calmly gets off
and begins an earnest but by no means desperate-looking effort to
clear a path with picks and ice saws.
</P>
<P>
   The ship backs off and tries one more run at the pack. No luck.
Days later the Endurance sits pitched over to port with its stern
thrust high in the air. The men have set up camp close by and walk
about conversing, clapping one another on the back and choosing
items from the last of the clothing stores.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, a caption says, ``the real troubles and
hardships commenced.'' Hurley's account ends here, but the film
resumes on South Georgia Island. The syndicate sponsoring the film,
which runs 88 minutes, sent him back to fill it out with scenes of
seals and penguins, which were a novelty in movies of that era. The
dogs, alas, had perished.

   With a passing nod to historical accuracy, Shekhar Kapur's
lavish costume drama sets out for racier cinematic precincts. As
Elizabeth I, Cate Blanchett (left) carries her responsibilities
with the air of a glamorously stressed-out modern woman with a
super-intense case of having it all. At first intimidated by her
adversaries, she survives to see heads roll. Lovers come and go, no
match for her destiny or needs. That Kapur knew nothing about the
real queen, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ``only helps
to make his Elizabeth that much sassier a sovereign, slouching on
her throne.'' &QL;

   Isabel Kelly (Julia Roberts) couldn't be nicer or try harder
with her boyfriend's children (Jena Malone and Liam Aiken), but
everything she does either falls flat with them or is rated

Sarandon). Isabel, a fashion photographer, has moved in with Luke
(Ed Harris), the children's father. Since her divorce from Luke,
Jackie has held forth from their old house in the suburbs. But
Jackie is ill and suddenly it's time to drop the rivalry. Despite
all the platitudes five screenwriters could muster, Ms. Roberts and
Ms. Sarandon ``go through their motions with unexpected conviction

   CONSPIRATORS OF PLEASURE. The surrealist visionary Jan
Svankmajer, one of the world's most renowned animators, uses clay
marionettes, dolls and eerily infused everyday objects to create
fiendishly witty nightmares from the fantasies of a group of
ordinary Prague residents. Six actors also contribute, Stephen
Holden wrote in The New York Times, to a mostly silent film about
``the erotic impulse of everyday life as a wild, chaotic,
antisocial force that lends people their sense of individuality.''

 A JUG OF WINE, BOOK OF VERSE AND THOU   (For use by New York Times
News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An industry knows it has arrived when it graduates
from being looked on as a boutique ``special interest'' to being
both a political force and a political target.
</P>
<P>
   It's the American way.
</P>
<P>
   That's what has happened to the wine industry over the past
decade, as grapes grew to become the eighth largest crop in the
country and wine sales soared both at home and abroad. It is now an
agricultural giant to be reckoned with. And it has powerful allies
in the tourist and restaurant industries, which profit handsomely
from their wine-sipping customers.
</P>
<P>
   Wine has become so universally popular that a glass in most
restaurants and hotels sells for three to four times the retail
price, reaching as high as $15 a glass in the fanciest places. As
for the price of bottles _ wow! Chicken and beef may pose as the
main attraction but those items do not bring in nearly as much
profit.
</P>
<P>
   Money talks. And so the Wine Institute _ which represents the
vintners who are now the leading industry in California, in
addition to wineries in New York, Washington, Texas, Oregon and
Virginia _ was flexing its political muscle this week in
Washington. Led by Institute president John DeLuca, a horde of
folks representing big-name family labels descended on Capitol Hill
to lobby for their cause and fight off recent legislative attacks
upon their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   This thing about drinking is politically tricky. As a national
issue, only abortion is as emotionally susceptible to public
hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to drinking, we too often say one thing and do
another. Some of the heaviest drinkers in Congress over the years
have raised the loudest voices against alcohol, pandering to sober
folks back home who have religious or teetotalist objections to its
consumption. But this issue is not really about morality, or about
some liquor versus no liquor. It's about votes.
</P>
<P>
   The wine industry tries to rise above the din by separating
itself from the beer guzzlers and the martini drinkers. It
advertises wine as merely a natural and healthy complement to meals
when taken in moderation. And, actually, so it is.
</P>
<P>
   Independent scientific studies suggest but do not finally
confirm that moderate consumption can lower the risk of heart
disease. This led the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
(BATF) to allow wine bottles to use a label suggesting buyers learn
the ``health effects'' of wine consumption by sending for the
federal government's dietary guidelines for Americans. The
guidelines include a glass of wine or two at dinner.
</P>
<P>
   (Wine, beer and spirits must still carry a mandated government
warning about the risks of drinking alcoholic beverages during
pregnancy or before driving a car or operating machinery.)
</P>
<P>
   But the winemakers are under serious assault on two fronts these
days.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, held
hearings this month about legislation he has introduced that would
allow states to file suit against companies that ship beer, wine
and spirits directly to consumers who order them over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is described as necessary to prevent minors from buying
prohibited alcohol from out-of-state suppliers. And who could be
opposed to keeping kids from getting booze they shouldn't have?
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but that's not the whole story. This little bill is really a
wholesaler protection measure, designed to protect the traditional
distribution system from being bypassed by direct sales. It's the
wholesalers versus the small retailers and the Internet world.
</P>
<P>
   The kiddie issue, however, has legs. So California Sen. Dianne
Feinstein is working with Hatch to develop legislation that would
require the delivery service to certify the age of the package's
recipient to establish that the alcohol is put into the hands of a
hopefully responsible adult. Hatch isn't jumping sides yet, but he
may accept a compromise. There isn't a big wine industry in Utah
yet, but who knows?
</P>
<P>
   A more stubborn and emotional opponent, however, is Senate
President Pro Tem Strom Thurmond, whose daughter was killed by a
drunken driver. Thurmond is out to get the wine industry, plain and
simple. He is furious that the vintners have, in his words, been
``using health claims as a marketing scheme,'' no matter how
accurate those claims.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond has proposed new taxes on wine _ but not on beer or
distilled spirits _ because ``wine is consumed by more prosperous
taxpayers'' than those who drink beer. He would transfer authority
over alcoholic beverage labeling from the BATF to the Department of
Health and Human Services, thus punishing the bureau for its recent
decision to permit the new nonthreatening wine label. And he would
rescind the new label itself.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Thurmond has found no cosponsors to join him in picking
on the wine industry this way. He has underestimated its clout.
This bunch got the French _ the French! _ to drink $1 million worth
of American wine last year. Truly a sign of formidable power.

 &HT;    Three Colorado school districts ban black dusters
 &HT;    By Ted Taylor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Three Denver-area school districts on
Thursday decided to ban students from wearing long, black dusters
to school, but school officials in Grand Junction said such a rule
is not necessary here.
</P>
<P>
   School District 51 administrators say they haven't noticed many
students wearing the long, black cowboy dusters that have been
associated with the two boys, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, who
shot and killed 12 classmates and a teacher Tuesday in Littleton,
before killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The ones who do wear them, said Fruita Monument Principal Mark
Zipse, do so only when it's cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``To date it hasn't been a problem,'' he said. ``But if we did
see evidence of that, we'll absolutely take a stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver Public Schools, along with districts in Douglas County
and parts of Adams County, adopted new rules banning dusters,
saying in light of what happened at Columbine High School, seeing
people wearing such coats could be disruptive to students.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Junction High School Principal Joan Edmonds said she
believed there were two students who wore similar coats to class
before, but since Tuesday they have not been wearing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It presents a problem right now because of the nature of
what's happened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Policy already restricts students from wearing any attire that
is offensive or attire that inhibits student learning,'' said
Denise Henning, vice president of the District 51 school board.
``We have not had any discussion regarding banning any such apparel
nor do I think we need to put such a ban in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Clothing wasn't the most important issue, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do need to send a clear message that any hate symbols or
verbal expressions of hate toward any one individual or group is
not tolerated on school grounds,'' Henning said. Superintendent
George Straface was unavailable for comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Marcia Neal said banning black coats would work for
a while, just like a similar clothing ban did several years ago
when the district began prohibiting students from wearing red and
blue bandannas to school, which have been linked to gang activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be a temporary thing to make people feel better, but
if they're doing it because they think it will stop some future
event, I think they are wrong,'' Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always going to be another group. They'll change to
something else or they will object.''

STADIUM AUTHORITY CONSIDERS BIDS FOR OAKLAND CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The bidding game for the Oakland Athletics
baseball team has gone into extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than choose between two bids, an investment banking
company hired to find a buyer for the team by Wednesday's deadline
opted instead to leave the decision to the Oakland-Alameda County
Coliseum Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The $122.4 million bids from two groups of investors were
presented to the authority, said Randy Vataha, executive of Game
Plan LLC, the Boston sports investment banking company hired to
handle the bids.
</P>
<P>
   The authority has 20 days _ until May 11 _ to look over the
financing and terms of each bid before making a decision, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The authority's top choice must be approved by officials of
Major League Baseball. In addition, three-quarters of the American
League club owners and a majority of the National League owners
must give their approval. All decisions must be reached by
mid-September, Vataha said.
</P>
<P>
   Game Plan announced Tuesday that two prospective buyers had met
the authority's requirement that they put $12 million deposits in
escrow.
</P>
<P>
   One group consists of San Mateo lawyer and former bank executive
Michael Lazarus, Arizona banker Lyle Campbell and former Baltimore
Orioles star pitcher Steve Stone.
</P>
<P>
   The other group is led by former A's executive Andy Dolich. The
other investors include George Zimmer, owner of the Fremont-based
Men's Wearhouse clothing chain, Modesto grocery mogul Robert
Piccinin, the Oakland Tribune, and San Francisco advertising
executive Jeff Goodby.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors may join either group in the weeks ahead, Vataha
said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the non-negotiable terms of the proposed sale, the buyer
must pay $122.4 million (including $2.4 million in commissions) to
the club's owners, Steve Schott and Ken Hofmann, and agree to keep
the A's in Oakland at least through 2004. Dolich has said it would
be his group's intention to keep the A's in Oakland indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Without a buyer, Schott and Hofmann have the contractual right
to leave Oakland after the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   Leading candidates among alternative sites for the club are San
Jose and Santa Clara, where South Bay A's boosters say the club
would be able to make enough money to field a top-flight team.
</P>
<P>
   As the Coliseum Authority considers the offers, the buyers, too,
will have a chance to weigh their options. The A's confidential
financial statements have not yet been examined by a prospective
buyer, and the possibility remains that some spreadsheet revelation
could prompt a change in plans _ and heart.
</P>
<P>
   Dolich said recently that, although he had been a club official
through 1994, he has not seen the A's ``audited financials.''
</P>
<P>
   Other prospective buyers who came forward at various points in
the bidding process, but dropped out along the way or chose to
withhold a commitment until after Wednesday's deadline, included
Hollywood producers Peter Guber and Paul Schaeffer of Mandalay
Entertainment, and Northern California real estate man John
Kehriotis.
</P>
<P>
   Kehriotis said he would consider bidding only after the deadline
and would offer less than the $122.4 million demanded. He also has
expressed interest in moving the club to Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to present both bids to the Coliseum Authority
rather than Game Plan's pick as the front-runner was made early
Wednesday, said Vataha, after all of the interested parties agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The talks with prospective buyers had been intensive and more
complex than anticipated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're down to the last minute, and we're trying to do what
our company feels is best for baseball, the city and the county,''
Vataha said. ``You're not sure how it will come out.''

CARTOON ART IN SUBWAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Art is continually being produced for New York's
subway stations, but little finds its way into the subway cars.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Public Art Fund, a nonprofit organization that produces
art projects around New York, has begun a citywide exhibition of
cartoonlike images by Simon Grennan and Christopher Sperandio in
subway cars.
</P>
<P>
   The artist team has been creating Conceptual Art since 1988,
even though Greennan lives in Manchester, England, and Sperandio in
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Their latest project, ``The Invisible City,'' is a series of
comic strips that tell real-life stories of night-shift workers in
New York. The comics, in the form of 1,140 advertising placards,
are being installed in about 1,000 subway cars.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Eccles, director of the Public Art Fund, said he expected
them to be on display for at least a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The artists put ads in the paper seeking stories from
night-shift workers and got all kinds of responses,'' Eccles said.
They met with many of the respondents and chose several for the
project, including a cleaner, a waiter at a gay bar, a security
guard, a television network technician and, appropriately enough, a
worker in a subway train yard.
</P>
<P>
   The artists photographed the participants at work and with the
help of a computer program transformed these photographs into
comic-book-like scenes using the participant's own words to
illustrate the images. Each one tells of a different work
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were specifically looking for a media-based project,
something that would naturally follow Barbara Kruger's bus
project,'' Eccles said. (Two years ago Ms. Kruger decorated a New
York City bus in shrink-wrap plastic covered with her signature
pithy sayings.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Invisible City,'' sponsored by the Lannan Foundation, is
also available as a traditional comic book. Two thousand are
available free from the Public Art Fund, 1 East 53d Street, New
York, N.Y. 10022, or through its Web site at www.publicartfund.org.
</P>
<P>
   The Growing Hammer
</P>
<P>
   It's been just three months since Ann Philbin became director of
the Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center, and already
she is making things happen.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the museum's board gave Ms. Philbin approval to begin
a major renovation and expansion of the nine-year-old museum's
building in the Westwood section of Los Angeles. It hired Michael
Maltzan, a Los Angeles architect, for the project.
</P>
<P>
   When Armand Hammer, chairman of the Occidental Petroleum Corp.,
who founded the museum, died in 1990, much of the museum's $60
million building had not been finished. ``We plan to complete the
portions of the building that have never been properly finished and
renovate the building to make it more hospitable,'' Ms. Philbin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the proposed improvements are two flexible gallery spaces,
one for contemporary art and the other for works on paper. Another
addition would be a 300-seat auditorium, part of Hammer's original
design. Plans call for moving the bookstore from the second floor
to the Wilshire Boulevard entrance and adding a restaurant in the
courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the building's entrances are architecturally awkward and
uninviting,'' Ms. Philbin said. ``This is one of the few spots in
Los Angeles that actually gets pedestrian traffic, and we want to
figure out a way to take advantage of that and create a more
welcoming public space inside the museum.''
</P>
<P>
   The renovation is expected to cost about $10 million. The museum
has also hired Bruce Mau Design, the Toronto-based graphic
designer, to work with Maltzan in redesigning the museum's signs.
</P>
<P>
   An All-Weekend Party
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles County Museum of Art is pulling a double
all-nighter _ more precisely, a 63-hour run _ staying open
continuously from 9 a.m. Friday, May 14, through midnight on
Sunday, May 16. The occasion is the closing of its hugely popular
show ``Van Gogh's van Goghs: Masterpieces From the Van Gogh Museum,
Amsterdam,'' which was organized by the museum and the National
Gallery of Art in Washington (where it was on view last fall).
</P>
<P>
   Since the show opened in Los Angeles on Jan. 17, it has drawn
600,000 visitors, making it the most successful show the museum has
had in 20 years. The record holder is believed to be ``The
Treasures of Tutankhamen'' 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured, why not give it a final blast,'' said Andrea L.
Rich, the museum's president and chief executive officer. ``The
demand here for tickets has been huge. We started out being open
seven days a week for 12 hours a day and were sold out every
weekend.'' With the end of the show near, there is a feeding frenzy
for tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets cost $17.50 for adults on weekdays and $20 on weekends.
For those interested in seeing the show between midnight and 7
a.m., the museum will take $10. All tickets are available through
Ticketmaster as well as the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Late-night visitors may make a party of their visit. The museum
is transforming its fifth floor penthouse and outdoor terrace into
what it is calling the ``Club van Gogh,'' featuring hors d'oeuvres
inspired by the artist's paintings and a cash bar. (The drinks
include a van Gogh martini, a combination of Dutch gin and Pernod.)
</P>
<P>
   The museum can't claim to be the first to stay open all night.
The Royal Academy of London did it recently, for its crowd-pleasing
show ``Monet in the 20th Century,'' which closed last week.
</P>
<P>
   But Los Angeles, more than London, is a city that stays alive at
night. Evening attendance was so high that two years ago, after
surveying its visitors, the museum changed its hours from the
traditional 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and now opens at noon every day,
closing at 8 p.m. or, on Fridays, at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a whole new crowd,'' Ms. Rich said. ``Los Angeles has
people who work all over the city, and they find that it's most
convenient to visit museums after work.''

 &HT;    A NEW 'TRICKLE' TIRED, CONFUSED REFUGEES CROSS ALBANIA,
MACEDONIA BORDERS
 &HT;    With Photo.

<P>
   MORINA BORDER POINT, Albania _ A small surge of about 800
refugees escaped here from Kosovo Thursday, giving clues but no
real answers to the fate of hundreds of thousands of others
believed still trapped in the vise of Serbian ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   At least 2,000 refugees walked through Macedonia's main border
crossing, Blace, on Thursday. It was unclear if these were the
vanguard of a new phalanx of ethnic Albanians who would be
permitted to leave, or merely one group set free by some
authority's whim.
</P>
<P>
   Some bore bullet wounds and others the glazed look of
exhaustion. The great majority had walked about 20 miles that
morning, after taking refuge for four nights in a greenhouse at a
village northwest of the border crossing.
</P>
<P>
   They confirmed speculation that the Serb army and police had
halted their flight from Kosovo last Sunday, the day the flow of
refugees here virtually dried up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The soldiers stopped us and told us to go back, to go home,''
said Ganimete Berisha, 43, who was traveling with her husband and
seven children, including a six-week old baby.
</P>
<P>
   Her family and others confronted with the same demand were too
frightened to try to return to their villages, which they said
local Serbian police and army had forced them to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The townspeople of a village called Zrze took in the bewildered
wanderers, letting them stay in a large greenhouse and giving them
food and milk for the babies.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the refugees said, Serb soldiers came to
them and said they must leave Zrze in the morning. They said they
were told to chose their ravaged homes or this Albanian border as a
destination.
</P>
<P>
   None of the refugees questioned had any explanation for the
erratic policy of Yugoslavia's Serb authorities.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to this group still does not explain the
whereabouts of tens of thousands of others who had been reported on
the road in Kosovo and even standing in a line that refugees
arriving last Saturday and Sunday said extended more than 10 miles
to the border.
</P>
<P>
   Those others may have run into similar roadblocks to departure,
but have not yet been told they can cross into Albania.
</P>
<P>
   If these refugees are any example, the Kosovar Albanians are on
the run. Most of the refugees who arrived Thursday had been away
from their homes for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Berisha family told of being chased from their village and
staying in the mountains for three weeks before Serb forces found
them and demanded they get out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   They walked for three days, being sent first in one direction,
then another. Then they ran into the soldiers who told them to turn
around and go home. After that, they ended up in Zrze.
</P>
<P>
   Others described similar odysseys, punctuated by beatings and
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   At the Tekepat Ceshmes Military Post along the Macedonian border
of Kosovo province, humanitarian aid workers were finally allowed
Thursday to get food, water and blankets to refugees sheltering in
``medieval'' conditions in a snowy mountain village on the
frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey Davies of the U.N. World Food Programme, who was with
the convoy that entered the hamlet, said they had been rebuffed by
Macedonian authorities for three days before four aid trucks were
allowed to continue along the twisting, muddy road and deliver
their supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonians had for days forbidden access, citing what they said
was Serb military activity in the area. A short section of the road
passes through Serb territory.
</P>
<P>
   Even after aid workers were allowed through, journalists were
halted at the military post, which looks over a pair of steep
ridges into southern Kosovo. Throughout the day, warplanes roared
overhead, sonic booms sounding, and at one point a plume of smoke
could be seen rising in the distance on the Kosovo side of the
border.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers expressed relief at the Macedonian decision to
finally let supply convoys through and said they hoped it heralded
improved cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The episode marked the latest instance of tension between
Macedonia and international relief agencies. The government of the
former Yugoslav republic has expressed growing alarm about the
refugee influx, saying the huge numbers of new arrivals could lead
to political instability and an upsetting of the ethnic balance.
</P>
<P>
   If a big new wave of refugees is released, the relief agencies
here will be hard-pressed to accommodate them in Kukes, the largest
city in the district about 10 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday they started a new information campaign to urge
families to take the buses and trucks that were available to
relocate them to other cities or towns further south in Albania,
away from the increasingly dangerous Serb cross-border attacks up
here in the north.
</P>
<P>
   Teams went tent-to-tent in the camps, telling people the area is
risky and that the space they occupy well might be needed soon for
new refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Endres, coordinator here for the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said the Albanian government had
provided 30 trucks to move out refugees on Wednesday. But those
willing to depart filled up only eight of the trucks. He said 5,325
people left on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   This northern border region now holds about 125,000 refugees.
More than 130,000 are now in Macedonia.

   The Tony Show is a Mystery, Too
</P>
<P>
   Want to know who's the host of this year's Tonys? You're not
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks before the awards, the show's host, format and
presenters have yet to be announced. Tony officials say the event's
planning is on schedule, but the lack of information is making some
Broadway professionals anxious. It's also complicating the job of
promoting the show.
</P>
<P>
   What several of those involved in the planning will say, on
condition of anonymity, is that the show will not have a single
host but multiple presenters, that there may be fewer musical
production numbers and that there will be no seats available for
the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we have information we're withholding,'' said
one planner. ``Decisions just haven't yet been made.''
</P>
<P>
   The delays can be traced in part to a feud earlier this year
between the two groups that administer the awards: the League of
American Theaters and Producers and the American Theater Wing. The
spat was settled, but by that point, Rosie O'Donnell, who had been
the host for the last two years, had passed on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to lock up a similarly popular host, the organizers say
they are now aiming for an array of presenter-cum-hosts. This
strategy, however, has pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's Paul Newman and Gwyneth Paltrow, great,'' said one
Tony administrator. ``If it's not big names, though, we have a
problem.'' No presenter has yet been verified.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets will also be tight, since this year's program has moved
from the 5,882-seat Radio City Music Hall to the 1,933-seat
Gershwin Theater. (Radio City is under renovation.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the knottiest problem is promotion. With no hosts or
presenters yet, it's impossible for press agents to set up
interviews. Deadlines for magazine covers are also already passing,
the planners say.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Sherman, the press agent whose job it is to generate
excitement about the Tonys, said he could not say exactly when any
announcement on the show would be made. ``We'll let you know as
soon as we do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Union Split
</P>
<P>
   After decades of tension and a recent confrontation, the local
union chapter that represents professional theater designers and
scenic artists is close to breaking with its parent union and
joining the stagehands union.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Miller, the president of United Scenic Artists, said
this week that the local's 2,600 members would likely approve a
referendum to dissolve its 81-year affiliation with the
International Brotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades, which
primarily represents painters on construction sites and other
nontheater jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the referendum will not be announced until
Tuesday, but Ms. Miller said informal polls of the local's
membership showed that a vast majority approve of the split.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller said her membership, which pays dues to the
international brotherhood, was deeply dissatisfied with its
representation within the larger group, which, she said, had little
understanding of the theater world and its players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering the millions we've added to their coffers, we
really haven't got much back,'' Ms. Miller added.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated calls to the international brotherhood were not
returned, but a letter sent to chapter members by Michael E.
Monroe, the brotherhood's president, said that the vote was
``inadequate and undemocratic.''
</P>
<P>
   It has not been a happy divorce. Last Wednesday, Ms. Miller said
officials of the brotherhood arrived at the local's offices on West
61st Street and threatened to take over the union. Eventually the
police were called to defuse the situation, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, the local received a temporary restraining order
from a federal judge barring the attempted takeover. Both sides are
due to appear before Judge Richard Owen Friday to re-examine the
order.
</P>
<P>
   The uneasy relationship dates to 1918, when Broadway's designers
joined the brotherhood. The scenic artists tried to dissolve the
relationship several times but were never able to muster the money
or support to do so. This time, if the split is approved, the local
will likely have to turn more than $400,000 in current assets over
to the brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller said her membership will then align itself with the
International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which
represents production technicians, stagehands and other stage and
film personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are really where we belong,'' she said. ``They're our
home.''
</P>
<P>
   `Thwak,' a Hit
</P>
<P>
   Talking to the Umbilical Brothers involves, well, a lot of
listening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like a human cartoon,'' said David Collins, the
younger Umbilical, describing their show ``Thwak,'' at the Westbeth
Theater Center. ``It's like Jackie Chan meets Bugs Bunny with a bit
of my mother thrown in.''
</P>
<P>
   Shane Dundas, the older Umbilical, chimed in: ``It's kind of
doing an aerobics class in hell. Or on speed.''
</P>
<P>
   What their show is is a hit, a steady sell-out that transfers to
the Minetta Lane Theater on May 25.
</P>
<P>
   Stated loosely _ very loosely _ ``Thwak'' involves the Brothers'
battle for a microphone, an 80-minute skit that involves imaginary
pets, imaginary guns and headfuls of tiny imaginary men.
</P>
<P>
   Like many young talents, the Umbilical Brothers credit their
success to schooling. (Sort of.) They first met in 1988, while
enrolled at Theater Nepean, an acting school in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole idea springs from boredom with acting
classes,'' Dundas said. ``We intended to have serious acting
careers.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning a television talent contest in their native
Australia in 1991, they began working professionally, starting with
a bar mitzvah in Sydney. Even then, things turned surreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd built a model of the Wailing Wall to perform in front
of,'' Collins said. ``I think when they booked us they thought we
were a band.'' Since then, they've hit many of the world's major
comedy festivals, as well as healthy runs on the West End in London
and at the Sydney Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   Now that they're here, the Brothers say they're excited about
staying in one place for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have a bit more than an overnight,'' Dundas said.

CHEVY, NASCAR AT ODDS OVER THE NEW MONTE CARLO 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chevrolet has officially called it off. In a statement issued by
Kurt Ritter, Chevrolet's marketing general manager, the
manufacturer confirmed that it won't put a new version of the Monte
Carlo on the track until next year.
</P>
<P>
   That was pretty much a foregone conclusion as spokesmen for key
Chevy teams like Hendrick Motorsports have been saying since
February that there wasn't enough time to get the car approved,
built and tested prior to the end of this season.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter ripped NASCAR, blaming stock car racing's sanctioning
body for the delay in introducing the new model Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consistently used NASCAR's input to develop the car before
formally submitting it in January for approval,'' Ritter's
statement read.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the vehicle was in line with their expectations.
Unfortunately, they did not agree and approval was not granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it stands today,'' Ritter's statement continued, ``NASCAR
is asking us to make changes that, when compared to the current '99
Monte Carlo and to other brands, would make the car
uncompetitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, NASCAR's take on all this is that Chevy kept making
changes on the car which NASCAR then had to check out, particularly
in regard to aerodynamic improvements. That, NASCAR says, prevented
officials from coming up with a set of specifications for the new
Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   Before this is finally settled, it could get nasty because it
presents a problem for both Chevrolet and NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years, Chevy has had essentially one
competitive car, Jeff Gordon's.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt's Chevy has run well at Daytona and a couple
other places, but Earnhardt has dropped out of sight, and no new
Chevy teams have risen to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Although John Andretti won last Sunday in Martinsville, Va.,
with a terrific finish in his Pontiac, the race was dominated by
four cars _ Gordon and the three Fords of Jeff Burton, Mark Martin
and Rusty Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   And that is pretty much how the season has gone and will
continue to go. In Burton, Martin, Wallace and Dale Jarrett, Ford
has four cars that consistently run up front. Chevy has only
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   To remedy that, Chevy wants an improved Monte Carlo that will
help the performance of Earnhardt, Terry Labonte and some others.
</P>
<P>
   It is speculated, however, that NASCAR does not want the new
Monte Carlo to be any better than the current model because it's
afraid Gordon will simply crush everybody if he gets a superior
car.
</P>
<P>
   So this is a real dilemma because Chevy teams don't want to keep
getting embarrassed, and it could boil over before anyone comes up
with a solution.

 &HT;    Intertwined lives of two women brilliantly observed
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Like a well-written novel, the French
film ``The Dreamlife of Angels'' slowly studies the lives of two
young women, adrift in a harsh world, in search of connections.
They strike up a bond of convenience and perceived similarities,
but have such different needs and outlooks that they soon begin
growing apart.
</P>
<P>
   That's about it in this character-driven tale, co-written by
first-time director Erick Zonca (with Roger Bohbot). But the result
has considerable cumulative power and an unshakable tug of sadness
as we get to know Isa and Marie and begin to perceive their fates.
They are two 20-something women who live for the moment, drifting
in and out of jobs, each heading toward her own particular dead
end.
</P>
<P>
   The film is engrossing enough, but its real attraction is the
pair of performances Zonca gets from Elodie Bouchez and Natacha
Regnier. They are performers so well-matched, in roles so
interwoven, that they shared the best actress award at last year's
Cannes Film Festival. They have their heightened emotional moments
occasionally, but what impresses is the understated inner lives
they build from tiny tics, longing looks and other observant
details.
</P>
<P>
   Isa (Bouchez), a close-coiffed waif who carries her worldly
possessions in a humble backpack, arrives in the dreary gray
blue-collar town of Lille and proceeds to hawk religious cards to
strangers on the street. You might call her cards homemade, if only
she had a home. When a customer offers her a real job in a garment
factory, Isa tries to fake sewing skill, but is soon found out and
fired.
</P>
<P>
   She gravitates towards co-worker Marie (Regnier), a statuesque
former waitress, who allows Isa to stay in her flat. Actually, it
isn't hers, but belonged to a woman who died in a car accident that
left her daughter in a coma. Isa and Marie seem to be kindred
spirits, roaming the streets, flirting with the bouncers outside a
dance club, coquettishly talking their way inside.
</P>
<P>
   Marie even sleeps with bouncer Charly, a fat teddy bear biker
type, but she trades him in for Chriss, the self-satisfied club
owner who rescues her from a shoplifting arrest and initiates an
abusive affair. Meanwhile, Isa has discovered the diary of the
comatose Sandrine and is drawn to visit her in the hospital,
identifying with her predicament and mortality. Isa sees Chriss for
the cad he is, but her attempts to persuade Marie merely drives the
women further apart.
</P>
<P>
   Marie grows increasingly irrational over Chriss and the hurt on
Isa's face as she watches her former friend self-destruct is
devastating. When they are abruptly told that they must move out by
the deceased woman's brother, they choose contrasting routes for
their next chapters.
</P>
<P>
   At times glacially slow, the subtitled ``Dreamlife of Angels''
is the antithesis of a Hollywood production. And that's the good
news. Those willing to give themselves over to the aimless lives of
these two women will find a simple, often undramatic tale, as
touching as it is inexplicably memorable.

 &HT;    `Pushing Tin' flies above just-for-laughs formula
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Was this flick produced by Amtrak? You
may never fly again after ``Pushing Tin.'' The airline pilots are
sober. It's those boggle-eyed, wisecracking, coffee-slurping,
hormonally juiced air traffic controllers who give you the shakes.
</P>
<P>
   And a lot of laughs. Even though director Mike Newell can't land
this vehicle _ how many Hollywood movies end satisfactorily these
days? _ the flight of fancy is entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   We should mention what the movie rises above _ an
``Airplane''-type spoof or satire. These are real characters and
situations, although not too real, one hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pushing Tin'' _ slang for landing airplanes one after another
_ is part quirky comedy, part mature romance and part documentary
of a sort. At its core is a boys-will-be-boys,
mine's-bigger-than-yours rivalry between two different hotshots.
</P>
<P>
   However, the fun unfolds against a sympathetic recreation of the
pressures facing air traffic controllers who deal with as many as
7,000 flights a day in the skies around New York City.
</P>
<P>
   John Cusack is cool Nick Falzone, a liquid-tongued terror of the
tower. He owns the sky as the best controller in the business.
Until Billy Bob Thornton shows up. He is Russell Bell, a stoic
wack-job with a style more Zen-like than zesty. To clear his head,
he once stood on a runway beneath a departing 707. He wanted to
feel the turbulence, and wound up tumbling through the air like a
decompressing balloon. He felt better for it.
</P>
<P>
   Falzone sizes up his rival and doesn't like what he sees.
Feeling increasingly insecure, he enjoys ringing Russell's bell.
One misguided evening, however, the married Falzone rings Bell's
equally bizarro wife (Angelina Jolie). Suddenly, the rivalry turns
subtle and amusing, even if it involves adultery, a faltering
marriage and near-miss, mid-air collisions.
</P>
<P>
   This is funny? You bet. Glen and Les Charles (co-creators of
TV's sitcom ``Cheers'') deliver smart, rapid-fire dialogue. The
jokes often emerge from situations that don't usually end in punch
lines. You pay attention. Tense confrontations produce unexpected
chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   Until near the film's end, director Newell (``Four Weddings And
A Funeral'') keeps the weirdness within believable bounds. He's
also good with ensembles, making the most out of the control tower
repartee. The ``locker room'' camaraderie is predictable but
engaging, thanks to an eclectic supporting cast, each one a wit of
sorts. Their jests also speak seriously about the stress they face.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, the versatile stars mix well, an attraction of
opposites beyond their physical appearance. There's fun simply in
the way the flip Cusack and the steely Thornton eyeball each other.
(There are a lot of close-ups.) And Cusack is human and humorous
even when his control freak loses control of his life.
</P>
<P>
   As Cusack's wife, Cate Blanchett (``Elizabeth'') is no longer
queenly, but a vulnerable American spouse who can throw a punch
line in the midst of tears.
</P>
<P>
   The film is a bit long. There are plot contrivances. And it
doesn't take radar to see how things will end. But for wit and even
wisdom, ``Pushing Tin'' is a rough diamond.

GREAT STORY CAN'T SAVE `THE GENERAL'  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Inside every bloated two-hour and eight-minute movie
is a gripping 90-minute story.
</P>
<P>
   And inside the glossy Hollywood film ``The General'' is a
gritty, proletarian British film about class struggle.
</P>
<P>
   It's uncanny how director John Boorman has brought the amazing
and dinosaurian technical savvy of Hollywood to a subject that
would work all the more powerfully in grainy 16mm.
</P>
<P>
   The General is a clever Irish criminal, working in the space
left between the police and the Irish Republican Army. It is based
on a true story: In the 1980s, Martin Cahill and his gang of
thieves pulled off some of the most daring burglaries in history,
culminating with the theft of a rare and expensive Vermeer
painting.
</P>
<P>
   In each robbery, Cahill acted like a field marshal, planning and
executing some of the best-thought-out crimes of the century. Hence
his nickname.
</P>
<P>
   And he is clever. In one case, he even used the police as his
alibi. The cops sit there helplessly, knowing Cahill has just
pulled one over on them.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the police don't like being played for suckers, and
the Dublin police eventually had a 90-man task force assigned to
catch the slippery Cahill, played by Brendan Gleeson.
</P>
<P>
   In the end it isn't the police who get him but the IRA. I'm not
giving anything away when I say this: Cahill is shot and killed in
the first scene of the movie. The rest is flashback.
</P>
<P>
   In the hands of a Tony Richardson (``Look Back in Anger'') or,
more recently, a Kenneth Loach (``My Name Is Joe''), this story
would have an almost-documentary sense of the street. There is a
long history of English-language films set in urban slums, with
people on the dole, looking for a way to make their lives
meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   But Boorman has overlaid the basic social realism of ``The
General'' with a Hollywood crime caper movie, like ``Topkapi,''
with a little of the police procedural thrown in. And in the end
the fine acting of everyone in his cast is rendered powerless by
the incessant constant intrusion of its director.
</P>
<P>
   The film is shot in gorgeous black and white, but instead of
giving the movie an edge, it gives it the look of a Calvin Klein TV
ad. It is a beautiful film, but its beauty is grotesquely out of
place. It is sort of like watching Sharon Stone smudge her face to
play a welfare mother, but all the time you can't help notice every
hair is in place and the smudges are oh so aesthetically applied.
</P>
<P>
   It would help if the story had some tension to it, but except
for the two set pieces of Cahill's two major thefts, the movie
wanders aimlessly. It is just one episode after another, rather
than one episode making the next inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   One of the film's genuine pleasures is watching Jon Voight as a
police inspector out to bring Cahill down. Voight has aged into an
actor of some surprising depth: The lines have grown heavy on his
face in just such a way that, even before he has uttered a word,
you can see the complexity of his character in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps some day soon Voight will get a role equal to his
immense screen presence. But it is not ``The General.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The General'' is violent and profane as you might expect from
a gangster film, but there is no sex or nudity. 3 stars. &QL;

WHO'S BURIED IN GRANT'S TOMB? A GOOD QUESTION

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first time somebody asked me the inevitable
question _ who's buried in Grant's Tomb? _ I had no idea what the
answer might be. I must have been about 12 and had eyed the great
granite monument every time my family drove along the West Side
Highway into Manhattan from Westchester, where we lived. I had a
vague sense of Ulysses S. Grant, I certainly knew what a tomb was,
but the thought that he might actually be in there was somehow
shocking.
</P>
<P>
   If you had told me that Calvin Coolidge was lying under the
counter of Zabar's, I couldn't have been more disconcerted. It
wasn't so much that the famous man was buried there as that there
was actually a dead body on Riverside Drive and 122nd Street. I
think it hadn't occurred to me that anyone was buried in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But that is precisely where the power of the monument comes
from. It is in essence a mausoleum, preserving the mortal remains
of the general who, at a terrible cost, led the North to victory in
the Civil War. The capacity to stomach horrendous losses and keep
on going was part of Grant's disturbing greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw an open field,'' he wrote, describing the calamitous
consequences of the battle at Shiloh, ``so covered with dead that
it would have been possible to walk across the clearing, in any
direction, stepping on dead bodies, without a foot touching the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Grant turned out to be a splendid writer (his ``Personal
Memoirs'' recently have been reissued by Penguin), his tomb, unlike
the voluble memorials to Lincoln and Jefferson in Washington, makes
a mute appeal. Despite a couple of brief time lines that sketch his
life from his early years through his post-presidential career, it
is tokens of death and war that dominate.
</P>
<P>
   Two circular antechambers display the flags under which Grant
served, along with maps marking key battles. A single quotation,
``Let us have peace,'' is chiseled into the pediment above the
entranceway. The rest is stony silence. But if there is nothing
Grant said to match the grandeur of Lincoln's Second Inaugural, his
tomb is a stark reminder that there might have been no second
inaugural if Grant had not slogged his way to victory at Vicksburg
and at the battle of the Wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   The Lincoln and Jefferson memorials live on the other side of
immortality; there is something enormously comforting about the
luminous marble statues of the men those monuments honor, as if
they were still there, dispensing the wisdom carved so memorably on
the white marble walls. But Grant's Tomb has an undeniable
sepulchral gloom.
</P>
<P>
   There is no statue of Grant, only a hollow at the center of the
main room through which one can gaze down onto his red-brown
granite sarcophagus, and the matching sarcophagus of his wife,
Julia Dent Grant. In the 1930s, a change in the tomb allowed
visitors to descend directly into the crypt where the bronze busts
of Grant's five favorite generals _ McPherson, Ord, Sheridan,
Sherman and Thomas _ ringed the general and his wife, keeping guard
with fierce expressions.
</P>
<P>
   It is the contradictions of Grant and of his tomb that make him
so compelling. When he died in 1885, he was one of the most famous
men in the world. One million people turned out to see his funeral,
60,000 marched in the procession. Though at the time the spot was
miles from the inhabited areas of Manhattan, it was a popular
destination for picnickers and strollers and a place for rallies
and Memorial Day gatherings. Today, though a bustling city exists
around it, with its sweeping view of the Hudson River, the tomb of
her 18th president has got to be one of the least visited places in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   This may be one of the reasons I love going there. Walking
across the vast, empty plaza, I always feel I am approaching an
undiscovered place.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the tomb, inside a little fenced-in area, are a ginkgo
tree and a Chinese cork planted when the monument was completed in
1897 by two Chinese dignitaries, Li Hung Chang, grand secretary of
state, and Yang Yu, envoy extraordinary and minister
plenipotentiary. The quaint effect of these trees, and the
descriptive plaque in English and Chinese, clashes with the garish
mosaic benches that surround Grant's Tomb on three sides. The
result of a misguided attempt in the 1970s to give the site
contemporary appeal, the benches are the most dated thing about the
structure.
</P>
<P>
   I began visiting Grant's Tomb about seven years ago when I moved
to Riverside Drive. I had abandoned a doctorate in English
literature, had just gotten married and within months had taken a
leave from my job to write fiction. My future seemed entirely
insecure and I would often break up a directionless day of writing
with walks through Riverside Park that would end at Grant's Tomb. I
found the idea of Grant comforting.
</P>
<P>
   Grant was always a figure of great tenacity. He spent years
failing at business ventures, working in his father's leather-goods
store in Galena, Ill., until the Civil War found him, at age 39,
and elevated him to greatness. For me, he seemed the patron saint
of late bloomers. That he came into his own just as, and in some
sense because, the country was falling apart, was a perverse but
appealing paradox.
</P>
<P>
   As a general, he was famously patient, biding his time while the
casualties mounted before beginning a counterattack. He waited
until the end of his life to produce a single, and enduring, book,
which he wrote after he had lost his fortune on Wall Street and
been diagnosed with cancer, finishing the work mere days before his
death. He even waited after death, lying in a temporary brick vault
for 12 years while his grand mausoleum was finished. He still
appears to be waiting for historical if not personal resurrection.
He suffers the fate of a man whose greatness in war seems remote to
a society that has been at peace for so long.
</P>
<P>
   Even in his day, it seemed clear he was much better as a general
than as a president. The memoirist Henry Adams refers to him as a
``cave man'' in ``The Education of Henry Adams'' and sees his
presidential campaign slogan, ``Let us have peace,'' as a plea to
be left alone. Even as a general, Grant made stupid mistakes, as
when, in 1862, he attempted to expel Jews from parts of Kentucky,
Tennessee and Mississippi, fearing speculators and war profiteers.
It was an egregious, though momentary, lapse in judgment, and the
order was quickly reversed, though the fact that he must spend
eternity down the block from the Jewish Theological Seminary, where
I went to Hebrew school, seems an appropriate penance.
</P>
<P>
   Far more disturbing was his failure to make the reforms of
Reconstruction stick. His biographer, William S. McFeely, posits
that it was Grant's experience as a man of war that made him
reluctant to send the troops necessary to defeat the Ku Klux Klan
and secure the rights of black Americans, in which he seems
genuinely to have believed.
</P>
<P>
   Grant is a paradox. He was a figure of obscurity who became one
of the most celebrated men in the world. He was central to our
history and yet seems strangely marginal. As a general he was all
action, as president he was a model of passivity. He was a man of
few words who wrote an enormous and lasting book. He was a
Midwesterner who wound up in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Who's buried in Grant's Tomb? It still seems to me a good
question.

`THE AMERICAN CENTURY': A NATION'S LEGACY, ICON BY ICON 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Exhibition notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``The American Century: Art and Culture, 1900-1950,''
which opens Friday at the Whitney Museum of American Art, is the
first half of a two-part, marathon, end-of-an-era survey and a show
of substantial if limited pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   Its 600 or so works are angled and packed into all four floors
of the museum's exhibition space, with roughly a decade's worth of
art on each floor. Paintings and photographs predominate, along
with a smattering of sculpture. A selection of ceramics, furniture,
books, appliances and architectural drawings makes up the
``culture'' half of the equation. Vintage film clips and music
generate atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The result _ organized by Barbara Haskell, curator of prewar art
at the Whitney, and Susan Cooke, an associate curator _ is not,
despite its somewhat proprietorial title, about American aesthetic
imperialism abroad. Just the opposite, in fact. It is designed as a
long trek through the turbulent history of American art at home.
And by the time you've worked your way from Edith Wharton-era
society portraits at the top of the museum to Jackson Pollock
below, you have had a genuine time-travel experience: exhausting,
sometimes diverting, occasionally moving, even pride inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also an experience dictated by the definition of
20th-century American art that the Whitney, the country's
pre-eminent museum devoted to the subject, has been shaping for
nearly 70 years, and it feels constrictive here.
</P>
<P>
   It's a definition with roots firmly planted in European
Modernism. By its lights, an avant-garde, generically and
monolithically conceived, is the arbiter of value. Provincialism,
whatever that means, is anathema. Art is something produced in a
New York studio, not in an Iowa church hall or a sharecropper's
kitchen in Georgia or a tenement bedroom in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Artists and historians have been chipping away at this blinkered
view for 20 years and more. And its uncritical reiteration here _
laid out chronologically chapter by chapter, illustrated by a
no-surprises string of canonical artists and their iconic works _
gives the show and its catalog a staid, intro-level textbook feel,
a bit like material that turns up on educational Web sites. (An
online extension of ``The American Century'' has, in fact, been
heavily promoted by the museum and was developed in collaboration
with the show's chief sponsor, Intel Corp.)
</P>
<P>
   But American art in the first half of the century was an unruly,
multifaceted, undefinable phenomenon, alternately hyped up and
strung out, streetwise and above it all, emerging from a patchwork
of disparate constituencies for whom no national style, modernist
or otherwise, would ever do. And even when tamed and homogenized,
as it is in this show, the vitality of that phenomenon somehow
shines through.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins at the Whitney in the turn-of-the-century
Gilded Age, when a prosperous nation turned its face toward Europe.
The American domestic interiors and society portraits gathered here
have a Continental polish; Robert Henri's 1916 likeness of Gertrude
Vanderbilt Whitney, the museum's founder, is executed with
cosmopolitan flair.
</P>
<P>
   But within genres that often served as pretexts for luxuriating
in pure style, curious things happen. The subject of Thomas Eakins'
painting ``The Thinker: Portrait of Louis N. Kenton'' (1900), with
his pale, pinched face and creased shoes, is resolutely
unglamourized. And the restless young woman in Thomas Anchutz's
``Rose'' (1907) looks like Calamity Jane dressed for a ball; her
passion-pink frock and the frown of vexation on her face don't
match up.
</P>
<P>
   Filmy Impressionist light fills the paintings of John Twachtman,
one of many American artists who absorbed contemporary styles while
in Europe. But the New York cityscapes of George Bellows are gilded
with a plangent, still-warm 19th-century sunset glow. (The Hudson
River School painter Frederic Edwin Church died only in 1900, and
Winslow Homer and Albert Pinkham Ryder were still active at the
time Bellows was doing some of his best work.)
</P>
<P>
   The modern city determined the direction of much American art in
this century. But early on, metropolitan life was self-consciously
new; small-town communal values were still part of the urban mix,
and artists had only recently begun to take the city as their
primary subject.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan's towering architecture turns soft, almost pastoral in
Edward Steichen's early pictures. George Luks painted his Lower
East Side subjects as mugging Frans Hals peasants. And the great
Lewis Hine photographed real peasants arriving _ voyage-stunned,
expectant _ at Ellis Island, as if he understood they were the true
cultural harvest that Europe was sending abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's old rural self-image lingered on in the decorative
arts (Tiffany windows, Rookwood pottery vases), and was distilled
in the early abstract work of artists like Arthur Dove, who worked
independent of European models, and Georgia O'Keeffe, who studied
with the Asian-inspired art educator Arthur Wesley Dow.
</P>
<P>
   And although the Whitney show neglects to pursue the matter,
American vernacular traditions remained vital and found their way,
as they always had, into high art. The sculptor Elie Nadelman was
an early collector of American folk art, and the charming dancing
couple in his ``Tango'' clearly show its influence.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these ingredients come together in certain vital works.
Joseph Stella's ``Brooklyn Bridge: Variation on an Old Theme'' is
one of them. In this painting, by a working-class Roman Catholic
immigrant steeped in European avant-garde styles, a New World
monument to progress is transformed into a folk altarpiece,
floating between sea and sky and illuminated by what look like
vigil lamp headlights.

 NEW YORK: lamp headlights. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stella painted this theme repeatedly; the version at the
Whitney, dated 1939, is a late one and is installed on the museum's
fourth floor, devoted to ``Jazz Age America 1920-1929.'' The
``machine esthetic'' that marked the era, all wheels and
razor-sharp edges, is symbolically ambivalent, as much about lives
ground down as about energy generated. But while many Americans
still looked to Europe for art, Europeans sought a vision of the
future in the mongrelized American city, where amazing things were
happening.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was the Harlem Renaissance, in which black artists
brought a new content to modernism, including traces of vernacular
art, suggested in works as varied as Meta Warrick Fuller's
``Awakening of Ethiopia'' and Archibald Motley's urbane night life
scenes. And jazz, all-American, became a transatlantic force,
pervasive, in the air, as in the sound of Duke Ellington's band,
heard in the Whitney installation.
</P>
<P>
   In the art of the '20s one might trace an American sense of the
visionary. It's there in nature imagery: O'Keeffe's ``Summer
Days,'' with its deer's skull and flowers rising over the desert in
a secular Ascension, could only have come from this country.
</P>
<P>
   But one also finds it in Stuart Davis' ``Lucky Strike,'' an
apotheosis of commodity culture, and Florine Stettheimer's madcap
temple-of-fashion homage ``Spring Sale at Bendel's.'' Finally
Charles Demuth's ``Figure Five in Gold,'' which shuffles commercial
graphics, folk art, Cubism and poetry like a deck of cards, offers
a spiritual emblem for a nation addicted to counting money and
measuring and dividing space.
</P>
<P>
   Money and nature failed in the 1930s when the Great Depression
and droughts set in. The section of the show titled ``America in
Crisis, 1930-1939'' offers no fresh insights into the period, but
the spirit of a time and place still make an impact.
</P>
<P>
   In large part this comes from the exhibition's wealth of
photography, the medium that time and time again manages to bring
``The American Century'' to life. The fact-oriented pictures of
Margaret Bourke-White, Gordon Parks, Eudora Welty, Walker Evans and
Dorothea Lange are in a sense moving exactly because they are so
familiar, unshocking but painful, like a rubbed wound.
</P>
<P>
   But then so much of the work in this section feels extreme.
Figurative art, which is mostly propaganda of one sort or another,
goes right for the gut. Political work is no-holds-barred furious.
Government-sponsored painting is all ``we can if we believe we
can'' uplift. Good-time pictures like Reginald Marsh's ``Twenty
Cent Movie'' feel slightly frantic. And the paintings of Thomas
Hart Benton and Grant Wood in this context make sense; they have
the half-ironic but heart-tugging populist theatricality of films
like ``The Wizard of Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   Against such voices, abstract art, geometric and biomorphic, has
to struggle to make itself heard. And some of its practitioners _
Willem de Kooning, Arshile Gorky and Ad Reinhardt _ who worked on
the Federal Arts Project in the '30s ended up being heard, loud and
clear, in the decade that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that decade, ``War and Its Aftermath: 1940-1949,'' is
strangely reticent, even dull in this telling. Photography, again,
comes on strong, in the combat images of Robert Capa, Walter
Rosenblum and W. Eugene Smith, and in the heat-crazed nocturnal
shots of New York at its downest and dirtiest by the indefatigable
Weegee (Arthur Fellig).
</P>
<P>
   But the big creative bang usually associated with the advent of
Abstract Expressionism is muted. Pollock, de Kooning and Kline,
circa 1950, look innovative, no question. Yet so many dynamic and
contradictory things have happened in American art and culture
before their arrival, including those barely suggested by this
show, that their accomplishments are brought down to size.
</P>
<P>
   One has the impression that at this point the show has simply
run out of steam, but the effect is an interesting one. Suddenly
the conventional picture of American art _ as a string of minor
impulses building toward a single, unifying art that we could
finally, unblushingly, call our own _ is revealed for what it is:
unnatural, unnecessary, defensively conservative and, in a word,
provincial.
</P>
<P>
   That view of American art certainly makes sense at our own
end-of-the-century moment, a time skeptical of received histories,
mistrustful of the politics of the ``important'' and ``great,''
unthreatened by an American art and culture composed of many, many
equal parts. Perhaps such expansive critical thinking will find a
place in ``The America Century: Part II,'' which opens in
September.

 &HT;    Cheap fares aside, Iceland will snow budget, big time
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 25.
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   REYKJAVIK, Iceland _ The most important item visitors will need
here is money. It doesn't matter whether it's the folding kind or
plastic, but if it's cash, it had better be a lot, and if it's the
latter, it better have a roomy spending limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let the cheap airfare fool you,'' warns Bostonian Joe
Steen, 25, who traveled here in February via Icelandair's ``Spring
Break in Reykjavik'' package. ``Iceland is definitely the most
expensive country in Europe. There isn't anything inexpensive about
visiting Reykjavik.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spring Break package _ which includes airfare, two nights'
hotel stay and airport taxes for about $500 _ seemed surprisingly
cheap. (It's even cheaper if you depart Sunday or Monday, but we
wanted to be there for the weekend.)
</P>
<P>
   The real surprise is how much Iceland costs once you get here. A
Big Mac will set you back about $9. A casual cafe lunch can easily
top $25 per person. And the food (primarily fish) isn't even
memorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to go back during the summertime someday, but it's so
expensive,'' says 34-year-old Paul Stokely of Emmitsburg, Md., here
for a week with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Icelandair's best deals run from November to May, the
off-season. Sure, it's cold, but if money is a consideration and
you don't mind putting on a couple (or three or four) extra layers,
take advantage of these deals.
</P>
<P>
   The cheapest packages are billed as four-day trips, but you only
spend three days in Iceland because of flight time. I would have
enjoyed at least a couple of extra days, but that would have
demolished the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Atlanta isn't among Icelandair's gateway cities, which
include New York, Boston, Washington, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Orlando
and Halifax, Nova Scotia. So you have to fly first to one of these
cities and change planes.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you spring for a hotel upgrade (an extra $25-$40 per
night), Icelandair books you into one of its two standard-grade
Reykjavik hotels. These are similar in quality and comfort to
hotels in other European cities, which is to say that the rooms are
tiny by American standards.
</P>
<P>
   My room at the Hotel Esja, a five-minute cab ride ($11) from
downtown Reykjavik, had two twin beds and a shower stall instead of
a bathtub. The beds looked uninvitingly lumpy until I drew back the
covers and realized the lumpiness was a down-filled duvet.
</P>
<P>
   For an extra $21 per day, you have unlimited access to the
hotel's well-outfitted health club and spa, including the services
of a personal trainer and a masseuse. Of course, if you're in
Iceland for only 60 hours, you should be spending much more time
outside the hotel than in it.
</P>
<P>
   There are essentially two ways to see the countryside: take an
organized bus tour or rent a car and strike out on your own. We
tried both, and preferred the latter.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't to say that the tours, offered by various local
companies, are no good. On the contrary, they're perfect for those
uncomfortable with the idea of driving in an unfamiliar country,
navigating by a sketchy map in a foreign language. Driving in
Iceland in the winter, especially, isn't for the faint of heart or
the ignorant of stick shift.
</P>
<P>
   The farther you get from Reykjavik, the worse the roads become
(the major highway is a two-lane road lacking a median or guard
rails). In addition to being narrow, winter's snow-covered roads
occasionally become indistinguishable from the snow-covered
roadsides.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, when I go back, I'll rent a car for the whole trip.
Renting wheels is pricey, to be sure: Our Daihatsu mini-SUV with
four-wheel drive and nail-studded snow tires (a must) ended up
costing a little more than $200 for 24 hours. That included mileage
but not gasoline (another $42). Still, it was worth it for the
pleasure of tooling around unfettered by tour schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Icelandair features several tours and rental car options in its
brochure. But it's best to wait until you arrive, since more
choices _ and possibly better deals _ are available through the
hotels and the tourist information center in downtown Reykjavik.
</P>
<P>
   We signed up for Reykjavik Excursions' popular Blue Lagoon tour
(about $54 per person), which was fine, despite our stuffy guide.
Our biggest complaint was the odd timetable. We felt rushed at the
lagoon, the pinnacle of the six-hour tour, yet we dawdled at a
miserable little aquarium where the fish looked as haggard as we
did after three nights of little sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Conveniently, though, the tour dropped us off at Keflavik
Airport in plenty of time for last-minute duty-free shopping before
our flight back to New York.
</P>
<P>
   You might have more fun and flexibility if you hire a private
tour guide for a custom-tailored tour in a SuperJeep (a monster
all-terrain vehicle), as did Steen and his pals.
</P>
<P>
   Travel brochures will try to convince you that Iceland winters
are mild. In truth, the temperature hovers around freezing, but
wind chill makes it seem much colder. If you go in wintertime,
bring long underwear, woolen socks, hiking boots, thick gloves and
a hat that covers your ears.
</P>
<P>
   Pack dressy clothes if you plan to splurge on dinner at a nice
restaurant. Women also should bring something black and skimpy for
the nightclubs. And don't forget a swimsuit for the hot springs and
heated pools, open year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Summer temps are more comfortable, but even in June and July,
the warmest months, the mercury doesn't rise much above 50 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Icelandair offers a few spring specials, but you'll have to move
fast:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Prices for the ``Midweek Spring Fling,'' a four-day trip
offered a few times in May, start at $399 per person, double
occupancy, including two nights' hotel stay and round-trip airfare.
Airport taxes are an additional $64 per person.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Icelandair's four-day Reykjavik Adventure Package, available
though mid-May, is less restrictive in terms of when you travel but
costs from $499 per person, plus applicable taxes. That's still a
great deal; from June through August the price for the same package
soars to $1,061 per person.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Another Icelandair option is to stop in Iceland on your way to
or from Europe, without additional airfare. For instance, through
April, Icelandair offers a New York-Paris round-trip fare of $282
that permits a stay of up to three days in Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   As mentioned, plastic is a great way to handle your Icelandic
spending, especially as you'll avoid the poor exchange rates and
high commissions charged at hotels. But note that while Visa and
MasterCard are almost universally accepted throughout Iceland,
American Express isn't.
</P>
<P>
   For an Icelandair brochure, call 1-800-223-5500 or view the
company's Web page at www.icelandair.com. You can sign up for
regular e-mailings of special fares through the site's ``Lucky
Fares'' program.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A front separating record warmth over the South from a very
chilly air mass over southern Canada will be active with showers
and thunderstorms. Several weak disturbances will race eastward
along the boundary from southern New England to the Ohio Valley,
with the passage of each low forcing the chilly air farther south.
</P>
<P>
   It will be dull and damp from Connecticut to Illinois. Behind
the front, temperatures will drop as much as fifteen degrees in a
few hours. Very warm air preceding the front in the Middle Atlantic
region and Ohio Valley will give rise to thundershowers. A few
strong storms are possible with hail and damaging winds.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure over the southwest Atlantic will produce bright
and hot weather in the Southeast. The fire danger will remain high
in Florida. A flow of humid air from the western Gulf of Mexico
will sponsor clouds and a few thundershowers in Louisiana and
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Colder air will surge southward into the Texas and Oklahoma
panhandles with drizzle and brisk winds. The snowstorm along the
Front Range will diminish, but heavy snow will persist over the
higher elevations of the central Rockies. A complex storm in
northern Arizona will circulate clouds and mixed showers across
Utah and Nevada. Gusty showers are likely in eastern Arizona and
New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Offshore winds will promote sunny and milder weather in the
Northwest and Northern California. High pressure building southward
from Canada will bring bright but cool conditions to sections of
the border states.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Snow Season
</P>
<P>
   Though it is spring, winter is not over near the Front Range of
the Rockies. Indeed, the two snowiest months at Denver, Colo., for
example, are March and April, with average snowfalls of 12.8 and
9.0 inches. Most of the spring snow falls in a few, big spurts.
With the northward retreat of the jet stream in spring, the
availability of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico increases. When
passing disturbances draw cold air from Canada southward and moist
air from the Gulf of Mexico northward, big snows can result. Over a
foot of wet snow fell Thursday at several locations south and west
of Denver.

 &HT;    Deep into the night, it's a party out of bounds
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 25.
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   REYKJAVIK, Iceland _ I hate to interrupt couples while they're
engaged in mouth-to-mouth saliva exchange, because that's a
delicate moment of intimacy and all.
</P>
<P>
   But these two hadn't come up for air in about five minutes, so I
figured they could use an oxygen break. Intrusive, yes, but I was
performing a public service.
</P>
<P>
   I introduced myself. The girl did likewise. Then she eyed her
apparently very new boyfriend, shrugged and asked him, ``What's
your name?''
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty much the way it goes at a quarter to three on
Saturday night _ Sunday morning, whatever _ in Reykjavik's
nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department provides a helpful bulletin of travel
warnings, alerting Americans to dangers such as outbreaks of dengue
fever or civil unrest in foreign countries. All it says about
Iceland is that Reykjavik can become ``disorderly'' on weekend
nights.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department is being diplomatic.
</P>
<P>
   Always quick to ferret out the latest hot spot, the media lately
has developed a tic for painting Reykjavik as an Arctic Bangkok,
seething with the exotic and the erotic. In truth, it's basically a
small town that marries Euro ultra mod and Old World quaintness,
with residents who display both Continental savoir-faire and
British civility.
</P>
<P>
   Reykjavik's nightlife varies little from that of Miami or New
York _ or Atlanta, for that matter. The clubs are all exploding
with people, mostly twentysomethings and those who wish they were
still twentysomething, lavishly drunk and drunkenly lascivious,
partying like it's 1999. (You knew that was coming.)
</P>
<P>
   That said, clubbing in Reykjavik does possess a certain
piquancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found the female Icelander to be tall, blond, blue-eyed and
very beautiful,'' says Joe Steen, 25, a Boston native who spent a
long weekend in Reykjavik with a few friends. ``We did find the
male Icelander to be a little rude. Why? We don't know, but we came
across a few situations that could've gotten ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Um, take a guess, pal.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, maybe it's the sharply honed Icelandic sense of style
that makes the Reykjavik party scene. Icelanders dress up no matter
what the mercury reads. These are not your
schlepping-around-in-jeans kind of people.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's just that these people are descended from Vikings,
not Puritans. They do not lack self-confidence, as I learned from a
20-year-old Adonis I met at the coat check counter at Nelly's Cafe,
a nightclub in the heart of Reykjavik.
</P>
<P>
   Bjarnie Pordarson was wearing a black T-shirt with short, tight
sleeves designed to accentuate his deltoids. The deltoids were from
his day job, which involves lifting large tubs of fish, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing, Iceland's primary industry, must pay decently, because
going out in Reykjavik is very expensive _ a beer costs about $7,
and no one has just one.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's your favorite thing to do on weekends?'' I inquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexual activities,'' Bjarnie replied, beaming.
</P>
<P>
   Taken aback, I came back with, ``So you pick up girls?''
</P>
<P>
   The two coat check girls giggled and ogled him. He was
ogle-worthy, if totally full of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, they usually pick me up,'' he said in dead earnest before
sliding off into the crowd, presumably to be picked up by some
luscious babe.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Cergol, a 35-year-old filmmaker from New York, found the
Icelandic brand of candor refreshing, if a little disconcerting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Icelandic woman was saying how they're very open
sexually,'' Cergol said. ``It's just a matter of going right up to
someone and talking to them and being open and honest. There
doesn't seem to be the layers of games that I think we're used to
in the States.''
</P>
<P>
   His theory proved itself as the dance floor at Nelly's started
to fill, around midnight, the Reykjavikian witching hour. The room,
roughly the size of a healthy kitchen (as they always seem to be in
A-list nightclubs), was packed with an astonishing number of people
doing that bouncy club dance you do when there's no space to move
horizontally. Three disco balls whirled overhead, reflecting
colored lights onto the matte-black walls and everyone's black
clothes. It was like fireworks going off in a cave.
</P>
<P>
   Only the occasional tune by Icelandic singer Bjork interrupted
the steady diet of American and British pop. Everyone knew all the
words. I would have thought I was in an American nightclub, except
that these white kids were dancing way too well.
</P>
<P>
   Apropos, the DJ kept spinning the aggressively annoying
Offspring song ``Pretty Fly for a White Guy'' every 20 minutes.
Each time, he cut the sound for a few seconds and let the frenzied
crowd fill in. ``Give it to me baby! UH-HUH! UH-HUH!'' everyone
screamed on cue. Clearly, the Offspring needs to play Reykjavik on
its next tour.
</P>
<P>
   By 1:30 a.m. the music was so loud it made my solar plexus ache,
so we decided to roll.
</P>
<P>
   As in Atlanta, the major bars and dance clubs mostly line the
town's main drag, which has three names within eight blocks. Most
of the trendy shops, eateries and bars are on this street, making
it convenient to stagger from one to another.
</P>
<P>
   We wanted to check out Astro, a flavor-of-the-month club, where
clusters of snappily dressed hipsters, too cool to look cold,
waited behind the velvet rope in the 25-degree night air. The men
wore enough hair gel to lubricate the space shuttle; the girls wore
itty-bitty excuses for skirts that left the imagination out of a
job. Their only concession to the climate was thick, flesh-colored
hose, like ice skaters wear.
</P>
<P>
   A bouncer gave us the once-over and decided we weren't fly
enough to make the cut. He didn't trouble to tell us so; he just
looked at us ... then looked away.
</P>
<P>
   Note to self: Next time in Reykjavik, don't wear big green,
down-filled Eddie Bauer parka while clubbing.
</P>
<P>
   Reeling from rejection, we wound up in the classier and calmer
Rex, where we met Margret Baldursdottir, a 25-year-old strawberry
blond femme formidable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Iceland! I hope you have a wonderful time,'' said
Margret, and all around us I could see men who were imagining just
how she could help them have a wonderful time.
</P>
<P>
   Rex is the sort of place where the bartenders are as beautiful
and almost as expensively dressed as the clientele, who all look
like the models in the French edition of Vogue, except less surly.
</P>
<P>
   We introduced ourselves to a girl at the next table in
spectacles and a floor-length ballgown.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I have to tell you that I am very tipsy,''
27-year-old Asta Gardarsdottir started, very tipsily.
</P>
<P>
   We learned that she writes and hosts an Icelandic children's TV
show based on ``Sesame Street.'' Earlier in the evening, she had
been at the station's annual party, which explained her condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight I'm playing adult, I'm not playing with puppets,'' she
said, punctuating every word with an intoxicated nod. ``I'm getting
drunk with my friends. And it's a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, her friend wasn't getting drunk with her. She
was sipping a Diet Coke. Iceland has stringent drunken driving laws
that locals appear to take seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always try to have somebody sober in the car. There
might be six people in the car: five dead drunk, one sober,'' says
Thorstein Henn, 29, a German-born free-lance photographer who now
lives here.
</P>
<P>
   Rex was nice, but it wasn't suited for easy mingling, since
people mostly sit at tables. At 2:30 a.m. we went back to Nelly's
to resume the process of losing our hearing and witnessed what an
hour of drinking and dancing had wrought upon the madding crowd.
</P>
<P>
   A totally wasted blonde who looked young enough to be a
``Dawson's Creek'' extra fell down the stairs. Two boys hauled her
off. A moment later I heard retching noises.
</P>
<P>
   You can tell it's 3 in the morning in Reykjavik by the sound of
beer bottles smashing on the sidewalks. That's when the bars and
nightclubs close, leaving clubhoppers with the choice of going
home, moving on to a private party or simply taking the party into
the frozen streets.
</P>
<P>
   Among the latter, we met a couple of teen girls who had been at
an '80s party at a club and were dressed like Duran Duran groupies.
Acting like them, too.
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing we were Americans visiting Reykjavik for the first
time, Unnur Einarsdottir tugged on my sleeve and implored me to
tell others back home that Reykjavik was a special place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell them the nightlife in Reykjavik is really great,'' she
slurred. ``It's really different.''
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to ask this 17-year-old wild child, ``How is it
different? And how would you know?''
</P>
<P>
   But she was already lolloping down the street, shrieking like a
banshee under the Arctic full moon.

 &HT;    The island's rugged beauty is way beyond the ordinary
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 25.

<P>
   REYKJAVIK, Iceland _ Gazing at this desolate, inhospitable land,
I developed a profound respect for the Vikings who beached their
boats and decided to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why they settled here,'' says New Yorker Bryan
Flynn, who arrived in February. ``What were they thinking? That
they could plant something?''
</P>
<P>
   If they were, they were fooling themselves. There are no trees.
Not a one. Not a surprise, since much of Iceland's surface looks
like a gigantic charcoal briquette, thanks to the plentiful
reddish-black volcanic rock. Small wonder Icelanders call their
country ``the Rock.'' The rest of the island features vast plains,
mountains and glaciers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like you're on the moon,'' Flynn adds. ``It's really
like being on another planet. All you see are rocks. But cool
rocks.''
</P>
<P>
   In summer, the plains turn verdant, and the midnight sun lights
the sky well after bedtime. In winter, though, the snow-dusted land
is barren and the sun travels a shallow arc, setting by 6 and
staying down until after 10 a.m. That's a lot of dark.
</P>
<P>
   The upside of the dark? I got to see the aurora borealis. Yeah,
you've seen pictures. The pictures are great.
</P>
<P>
   But actually seeing it for real, watching those wisps of green
luminescence undulating across the heavens like colossal cosmic
skywriting _ that's some kind of wonderful we don't have in the
South.
</P>
<P>
   The aurora borealis is but one of Iceland's one-of-a-kind
natural attractions that we experienced during our three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
   We soon realized that Icelanders apparently do not feel the
urge, as Americans do, to put up mondo billboards telling tourists
where all the cool stuff is. It's not hidden or anything, but you
have to know where to look. And here are a few things you should
look for:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Gullfoss: Only a road sign assures you that you have indeed
arrived at the renowned waterfalls a few hours' drive from
Reykjavik. Simple wooden steps lead down to a natural ledge from
which you can view the two-tiered falls, each hundreds of feet wide
and together more than 100 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   The lower waterfall plunges into a gorge at right angles to the
higher falls. So much spray fills the air, a rainbow has taken up
almost permanent residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have stared at it for hours,'' says Paul Stokely, 34,
of Emmitsburg, Md., visiting with his wife, Sarah. ``It's
incredible, like the Grand Canyon.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Geysir: A cluster of hot springs and geysers in a lava field,
Geysir took my breath away _ literally. When the geyser Strokkur
(Icelandic for ``butter churn'') erupted from a gently gurgling
pool into a frothy 60-foot plume of boiling water, I gasped
involuntarily. Strokkur repeats the performance every three
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   All around, threads of steam waft from hot pools in the
crumbling volcanic rock, creating a generally postapocalyptic
effect. The pools, some no larger than a manhole, simmer at more
than 250 degrees, as a small sign politely alerts visitors. There
are no fences, just a few cautionary ropes. You fall in and cook
yourself, that's your problem.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Icelandic ponies: To maintain the purity of the breed, Iceland
hasn't allowed importation of horses in 800 years. Barely as tall
as an average person, these ponies are prized for their size and
unique running gait. The ones I encountered on a horse farm a few
minutes outside Reykjavik were endearingly friendly _ although I
suspect they were angling for some sugar cubes or carrots. Several
farms offer guided pony rides.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Blue Lagoon: Fortunately, it has nothing to do with that
Brooke Shields movie. It's not even a true lagoon, but a man-made
pool filled with hot effluent from the adjoining Svartsengi power
plant, less than an hour from Reykjavik.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not radioactive; the plant runs on geothermal heat,
like just about everything else in Iceland. So the water's not only
clean and safe, but said to have therapeutic properties due to its
high mineral content.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds icky, but it's really divine. Think of the best, most
relaxing bath you've ever taken. This is way better. You can swim
(there's a shallow section for people who don't), your skin feels
silky-smooth from the minerals and the water never gets cold.
</P>
<P>
   After paddling around the lagoon for a half-hour, I couldn't say
I felt dramatically healthier, but I didn't want to get out,
despite my tour guide's gesticulations for us to leave. I wanted to
luxuriate in the pale blue, nearly opaque water until I turned into
a giant prune _ or an Icelandic mermaid.

 &HT;    Obscurely hip Iceland: Land of Fire and Ice
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 25.
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   REYKJAVIK, Iceland _ ``Why Iceland?'' everyone asked when they
heard I was headed to this icy chunk of volcanic rock at the edge
of the Arctic Circle.
</P>
<P>
   The best answer came to me at 2 o'clock one morning during my
three-day visit, as I stood, mesmerized and frozen, watching the
aurora borealis perform the world's most fantastic light show.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, I had sacrificed yet more sleep, riveted until
almost 4 a.m. by a very different but equally memorable nocturnal
phenomenon. Reykjavik's nightclubs were swarming with the world's
most gorgeous people, drinking and dancing _ and doing stuff that
goes with that _ in a frenzied revel that would have made Bacchus
blush.
</P>
<P>
   In three nights I managed a total of 11 hours of sleep. And I
didn't care, because it was wonderful, glorious, entrancing, and
I'd go back _ I will go back _ to this remote island of savage,
unearthly beauty populated by savagely beautiful inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Land of Fire and Ice, as it's called, never crossed
your travel radar. It is, after all, way up on top of the globe,
and it doesn't have anything Disney or any towers of Eiffel or any
Roman nude statuary.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it's become a hot spot for young Americans, especially
college spring breakers trolling for an experience beyond the
ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem like an awfully long way to go to party. After all,
you can get drunk anywhere, and beaches come cheap in the States.
</P>
<P>
   But in Iceland the beaches are made of volcanic lava, and they
fringe steamy azure pools of geothermally heated water bubbling
over with swimsuited blondes year-round. At night the same blondes
put on slightly more clothing _ never mind the climate; layers
aren't sexy _ and get jiggy wit' it until breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Never has a place so cold been so heitt (hot).
</P>
<P>
   Icelandair, the country's airline, is doing its part to foster
the travel boomlet by offering discounted airfare-hotel packages to
this costly country. OK, it's still not as cheap as Cancun, but
Cancun is so MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Reykjavik, Iceland's capital and largest city (population:
110,000), is as yet untainted by the likes of Carmen Electra
hosting wet T-shirt karaoke contests _ although American pop music
does rule the Icelandic airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, you can drink the water _ and, even better, most
Icelanders speak at least passable English.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt part of the cachet of visiting here is the uniqueness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the whole thought of going to Iceland, this place
you never thought of going,'' says Bryan Flynn, a 35-year-old
advertising director and stand-up comedian from New York. ``The
funny thing is, I'd been in Amsterdam maybe two weeks before, and
no one cared,'' adds Flynn, who visited here in February with two
college friends. ``But as soon as you say Iceland, they say wow. It
has such a mysterious connotation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's plenty more to Iceland than its blondes, bars and
beer, enough to tempt those who want more out of a vacation than a
thundering hangover and a heinous Visa bill. The breathtaking
landscapes alone will linger in your dreams long after you leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a wild place,'' Flynn says. ``As soon as I got back
I was looking at prices for flights to go back again.''
</P>
<P>
   So was I.

 &HT;    Hit the decks _ to waterproof them seal 'em for summer
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Waterproofing your deck should become an annual rite
of spring to protect against wood rot, splintering and warping.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it was waterproofed last year and there aren't any
visible signs of damage, this is a maintenance project you don't
want to put off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waterproofing is a yearly event because all waterproof sealers
eventually wear off. You want to stop moisture from getting into it
and replace the wood's natural oils,'' said Mark Wetzel, vice
president of sales for Behr Process Corp., a Santa Ana, Calif.,
company that does business in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The project takes about a day and a half, largely because of
drying time. The temperature outside should be at least 50 degrees,
which isn't a problem this time of year in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's too cold outside, it takes too long to dry,'' Wetzel
said.
</P>
<P>
   Supplies needed:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bleach or a mildew stain remover
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pump sprayer
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Oxalic acid
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Stiff push broom or brush
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Linseed oil-based waterproofer
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Natural-bristle paintbrush
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Plastic
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Garden hose
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Face mask
</P>
<P>
   B E F O R E Y O U B E G I N
</P>
<P>
   Cover surrounding masonry, metal, painted surfaces, grass and
plant life with plastic to prevent staining.
</P>
<P>
   What to do:
</P>
<P>
   1 Kill mold and mildew by pouring bleach or a mildew stain
remover into a pump sprayer. Saturate deck with the chemical and
allow to work for 10-15 minutes. Then rinse deck with fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   2 Using a stiff push broom or brush, clean deck with oxalic acid
to remove dead wood cells and tree and leaf stains. Deck should be
saturated and scrubbed hard to activate the chemical. Allow to sit
for 15-20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3 Rinse deck again with water and allow to dry for at least 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
   4 When deck is completely dry, pour waterproofer/sealant into
pump sprayer.
</P>
<P>
   5 Apply sealant until wood is completely saturated, leaving a
wet sheen. The number of passes you make with sealant depends on
the porosity of the wood. Do not allow sealant to dry between
coats.
</P>
<P>
   6 After sealer is applied, back-brush deck to ensure proper
penetration. Allow to penetrate for up to 30 minutes, then remove
excess with clean cloth. Allow deck to dry completely before
walking on it.

 &HT;    Riveting sculptures a family affair
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Visitors strolling through the Atlanta Botanical
Garden might be ``ribbeted'' by the sight of copper amphibians.
</P>
<P>
   Frogs will do that to you. Especially the life-size sculptured
ones. These fanciful creatures are the creation of the Smiths,
namely father Charles and his two sons, Beau and Alexander. Each
sculpted four that will be on display until May 30. This is the
third year the botanical garden has exhibited them.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Smith of St. John's Island, S.C., has been sculpting
full time since 1980, but he didn't do his first frog until years
later. He and his sons have made frogs their trademark, sculpting
about 300.
</P>
<P>
   But they aren't into frogs, per se. They don't collect them, and
Charles Smith only has two life-size one of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love them, but I'm not one of these people who are goofy
about frogs,'' said the senior Smith. ``In the early '80s, one of
my clients kept asking me to make frogs. I just kept putting it off
because I didn't see the relevance of doing frogs.''
</P>
<P>
   His first one was, dare we say, weird looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like something from outer space,'' Charles Smith
recalled. ``It was bigger than the ones nowadays. I consider it the
most valuable one of all.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees frog sculptures as an art medium, sort of like oil
paintings. The amphibians have their own personalities.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Beau Smith, 37, likes to write songs. So the Smyrna
sculptor made his frogs musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a natural theme. It's kind of like a muse playing
music, an inspiration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Smith, 33, did one of a parent frog reading to a
child. The botanical garden will place that one in the upcoming
children's garden, scheduled to open in September.
</P>
<P>
   Although sculpting has become a family business for the Smiths,
it wasn't the elder Smith's first profession.
</P>
<P>
   His background is in science and engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was an artist. I was always into making things. My
father was an engineer. It's sort of a combination of those
things,'' Charles Smith explained.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of his work _ he also does deer, birds and raccoons _
are for the private gardens of his clients. He also does abstract
sculptures and human forms.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of Bellagio, a garden art store on Miami Circle in
Atlanta, were familiar with his work and put Smith in touch with
management at the botanical garden. The first show was held there
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Beau and Alexander Smith started sculpting frogs through
osmosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just something my father did, and it really caught on,''
Beau Smith said. ``It's a neat way to build something that is like
a human being, but you're not locked into representing a human
being. It's easier to build a frog and have the personality come
out.''

 &HT;    Grungy gutters call for clever stopgap ploys
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I try to stay out of gutters whenever I can.
</P>
<P>
   There comes a time, however, when gutters cannot be ignored.
Those without leaf guards need to be cleaned frequently, and even
those with leaf guards eventually will deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   Corrosion in gutters occurs from the inside out, so what looks
like a perfectly good gutter from the ground is a horrifying sight
when you climb onto a ladder and see the damage close up. Usually a
rusted gutter calls for replacement of the entire system _ and
several hundred dollars. But there are temporary solutions that
will take care of the problem until you win the lottery or your
rich aunt dies.
</P>
<P>
   Patching leaks
</P>
<P>
   To repair a leaky section of gutter, you'll need a wire brush,
steel wool or an abrasive scouring pad, a bucket of plastic roofing
cement and a putty knife.
</P>
<P>
   Wash away any accumulated silt or leaves with a hose. Then use a
wire brush to scrub the rusty area, let dry and scrub with steel
wool or an abrasive pad. Spread roofing cement over the leak with a
putty knife and smooth out so the patched section is as level as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   For larger leaks, you may have to get some tin snips and cut a
strip of metal flashing to fit over the damaged area. Bend the
flashing to fit inside the gutter and spread enough roofing cement
around the edges to hold it in place. This won't last forever, but
it will stop the annoying drips until you replace the system.
</P>
<P>
   Removing the problem
</P>
<P>
   Another solution is to replace an entire section of gutter.
</P>
<P>
   The experts at Home Depot recommend these steps:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Remove the screws and connectors from the damaged area. If you
are removing the spikes, slip a 2-by-4-inch block of wood in the
gutter to protect it while you pull out the spike.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cut a replacement section that is 2 inches longer than the
section you remove. Use a spacer block to keep the gutter from
bending while you cut it with a hacksaw.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Spread roof cement or gutter repair compound on the old
section of gutter and to the edges of the new section and set in
place with the up-slope section on top of the down-slope section.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Drill pilot holes and fasten the two sections with rivets. Now
drill pilot holes for the spike and ferrule fasteners, keeping
spacer blocks in place.
</P>
<P>
   This should take care of the problem until the next monsoon.
Meanwhile, I suggest you set up a fund for new gutters or eliminate
gutters altogether. Yes, it's annoying to get rained on when you
walk up the steps to the front door, but think of how many
door-to-door salesmen will get drenched.
</P>
<P>
   Question of the month
</P>
<P>
   Paul Stokes of Atlanta called to inquire about a footing for a
stone retaining wall he is building. Stokes wanted to know how wide
and how thick the footing should be for a 2 1/2-foot wall about 60
feet long.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, let me say that I admire Stokes' ambition.
Building a stone wall is not a simple task, but it can be done well
with planning and patience.
</P>
<P>
   For the footing, most experts recommend poured concrete as thick
as the width of the wall and twice as wide. Your local building
codes may have other requirements, such as starting the footing
below the frost line (6 inches in Georgia). But for a low wall, the
specifications recommended by most experts should be sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   One tip from stonemasons: Begin the wall by building short
sections at each end of the wall. You also should try a dry run
before adding mortar to make sure the stones fit together right.
Or, better yet, just build a dry stone wall. You won't need a
poured concrete footing, and it's a lot easier to correct your
mistakes.Write to us

 &HT;    Bushy-tailed marauders more brazen than usual
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those of us who have seen more than a few Atlanta springs agree
that this year's is as great as they get. No matter what comes
next, we have seen paradise, gained inspiration from its
loveliness. But like any paradise, this one attracts a devilish
intruder from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   In my garden, the squirrel's the one.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the mild winter that ensured that the banana
shrub wouldn't get zapped but would instead produce a big bunch of
little yellow blooms with fragrance mimicking the yellow fruit was
the same winter that allowed the bushy-tailed rats to frolic all
through December and January, getting a head start in February and
roaring into spring with tails flying. They've not rested for a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the middle of January, in fact, that I saw the rodents
move their insults to the highest level ever.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of hunkering down in nests at the top of the neighboring
oaks and pecan trees as they usually do in ``normal'' winter
temperatures, the varmints were taking advantage of the balmy times
to play and plague.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I like to see a squirrel or a group of them spiral at high
speed up and down the trunk of a tree as much as anyone. If they'd
stop there, I could begin to tolerate them. But once they hit the
ground, they stop playing and go to destroying; I've had to put
rocks on top of my bonsai soil to prevent squirrels from rooting
the little trees and shrubs out of their trays. Mere okra-seed-size
rocks no longer deter. Still, I've seen a rock about the size of my
fist tossed off the white pine bonsai, indicating the presence of
an exceptionally strong squirrel or a frightening example of rodent
teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   The list of squirrel victims around the garden always is long,
but it grew longer as the weather warmed. In addition to the usual
upheaval of newly planted perennials and shrubs, several rose
cuttings I stuck in a pot of dirt in December got squirrel-trashed,
as did unfurling ferns, tender and apparently tasty.
</P>
<P>
   One happy discovery in the perennial war on squirrels: My
pansies always get decapitated sooner or later, but this year a
half-barrel of them has remained headed. The container sits under a
metal wind chime. Squirrels likely don't like music. It figures.
</P>
<P>
   Wisteria fared not as well. Usually, it twirls along the railing
on the back porch, blooming as it wishes, going from groups of
tight little burgundy buds to large purple droplets. Well, this
year, some of the blossoms got nipped in the bud stage, as the
railing happens to be a squirrel run. The rodents dashed along,
grabbing buds as they went, recalling their stripping of a
beautifully pregnant tomato bush last summer. (One friend, Woody
Oliver, was so undone by a similar tomato-stripping experience last
summer, he says he's taking some time off from growing food, a
great loss to beggars like me.)
</P>
<P>
   After losing my wisteria buds, I decided to press Buuud into
service as a garden cat. I was hoping he might redeem himself after
failing so miserably to adapt to the woods of McCaysville. (He and
Vincent, after demanding to be outdoor cats, cowered in corners and
closets during their only trip to the North Georgia mountains.)
</P>
<P>
   Out into the garden bounded Buuud. Onto the brick wall he
leaped. Alas, as hard as he tried to be fierce and stealthy, as
resolutely as he wore his game face, he still looked like just
another clean, wary house cat out for an uncertain stroll.
</P>
<P>
   And like any creature whose body language signals vulnerability,
Buuud seemed to invite disrespect. He got it from one squirrel
running atop the wall. The little thug stopped and took a bite out
of the piece of French bread clamped between its teeth. After
chewing furiously, it flicked its tail obscenely, then jumped onto
my balcony, heading for the roof, then into the big oak, leaving
the rest of the bread sitting precariously on the wall. Unwilling
to subject Buuud to more indignity, I brought him in and advised
him that his garden-cat duties were over.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a spring plagued by rampaging rodents, there are
gardeners who think squirrels are cute.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Norris is one of them. In her Acworth garden she has
what she calls bird/squirrel feeders, inviting the rodents to eat
as much as they like: ``I enjoy watching them climb in and out of
my feeders,'' she says, acknowledging that she suffers from a
``squirrel fetish.''
</P>
<P>
   Norris, who got acquainted with some of my family through
reading one of my books, has named one of her squirrels ``Uncle
Buddy.'' She speculates that Buddy is ``up there smiling down at
me'' as she gently tells the squirrels to ``save some seeds for the
birds.''
</P>
<P>
   She may be right, but I'd hope my rural Alabama, food-loving
uncle would think, instead, about a nice Brunswick stew recipe that
calls for a ``fine gray squirrel.''

 &HT;    Dynamic design duo giving women what they want: Color, ease
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 25.
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meet Dana Buchman and Karen Harman. After a decade spent
designing the Dana Buchman label together, this duo lends credence
to the notion that two heads sometimes are better than one.
</P>
<P>
   And two creative minds are necessary, once it's considered how
large is the workload Buchman and Harman share. Besides the
signature collection of $350 jackets and $130 pants, they also
co-design Dana Buchman Luxe ($450 jackets, $250 pants), large and
petite collections, sunglasses and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent appearance at Neiman Marcus in Lenox Square, the
pair pointed out that their partnership is not without the
proverbial butting of heads, but the creative tension works to the
benefit of their collections and their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Do the two ever disagree?
</P>
<P>
   ``We found out it's OK to disagree,'' says Buchman. ``It's part
of the learning process. And, each of us is allowed to change her
mind!''
</P>
<P>
   After a show for 250 customers, Buchman and Harman _ both in
their 40s, both comfort- and cost-conscious _ chatted about their
design approach.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What are American women looking for when it comes to clothes?
</P>
<P>
   Harman:A: ``Items and outfits that make them look and feel
beautiful, modern and feminine. And they want color. This is
especially true of Atlanta women. The sunlight here is radiant.
Women want to dress themselves in these colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Q:How has fashion changed in the past five years?
</P>
<P>
   Buchman:A: ``There's a major shift from tailored suitings to
relaxed pieces. At some offices, a rayon shirt and soft
drawstring-waisted trousers make a great outfit. Jackets are more
sweaterlike. We've even taken the interlinings out of jackets to
make them less constructed. Still, the look has to be polished and
not thrown together. However, jackets are still around, just
softer-looking.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are five classic pieces that a woman should have in her
closet?
</P>
<P>
   Buchman and Harman: A: ``A black pantsuit; a twin set in white
or metallic gray; a white Lycra T-shirt; a long, easy-fitting black
skirt; a pop of color, such as a soft jacket.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Anything special you two are designing for the year 2000?
</P>
<P>
   Harman:A: ``Toward the end of '99, we are coming out with
drop-dead, black-tie party clothes in a package. We call it
Packable Glamour. These will consist of black or white ball gown
skirts with matching camisoles or sweaters in rich metallics that
you fold into a bag and be on your way to a party.''

HIGH-TECH FANTASY SUFFERS FROM TOO EARTHLY SETTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - If you're already spending too much time playing video
games, watch out for ``eXistenZ,'' a futuristic thriller about
players who get lost in a bio-electronic game that plugs directly
into their spinal columns.
</P>
<P>
   This twisted tale of reality and illusion begins at a
test-marketing session, where the new game, eXistenZ, is being
tried out by avid fans.
</P>
<P>
   Players consider the game designer, Allegra (Jennifer Jason
Leigh), the high priestess of their wired world, but
anti-technology rebels are trying to destroy her.
</P>
<P>
   A would-be player (Jude Law) tries to rescue Allegra from spies
and assassins, who are everywhere. While on the run for their
lives, they also have to save Allegra's game. So they plug into the
game world, where they risk losing the separation between reality
and fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``eXistenZ'' comes from writer/director David Cronenberg, who
frequently has explored the links between science and horror,
reality and illusion in starkly gripping movies like ``The Fly,''
``Scanners'' and ``Videodrome.''
</P>
<P>
   Cronenberg infuses ``eXistenZ'' with stimulating ideas about how
bio-electronics could become an addictive mind drug or a path of
liberation. But the ideas are more interesting than the movie
itself. It would have made a better book than it does a picture.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's biggest weakness should be its strength: the game
world itself. The fantasy landscape through which Allegra moves
isn't dramatically different from her reality. If that's the most
imaginative world the game designers could come up with, you wonder
why anyone would want to play it _ much less go to war over it.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh's intensity was better demonstrated in ``Rush,'' ``Short
Cuts'' and ``Last Exit to Brooklyn,'' and Law was stronger in
``Gattaca'' and ``Music From Another Room.'' Cronenberg doesn't put
their passions to effective use in ``eXistenZ.'' Their characters
are more like game pieces than real people.
</P>
<P>
   ``eXistenZ'' is the second movie of the season to blur the
borders between reality and illusion. Although ``eXistenZ'' is
better thought out than ``The Matrix,'' it's not nearly as exciting
a movie experience. It plays too flat.
</P>
<P>
   Cronenberg once combined provocative thinking about technology's
impact on humanity with a pulsating visual story in the nearly
perfect science-fiction horror story ``The Fly.'' But Cronenberg's
directing energy seems to have flattened out, too.
</P>
<P>
   Both ``The Matrix'' and ``eXistenZ'' left me wondering: If
reality is an illusion, why isn't it a better one?
</P>
<P>
   ``eXistenZ'' is rated R for violence and profanity. 2 stars.  &QL;

 &HT;    Bizarre finds a cozy berth in this director's work
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Getting to know David Cronenberg, the Canadian writer-director
of ``eXistenZ,'' his new mind-games-with-computers movie starring
Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law (see review above):
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Yeah, he's the guy who:
</P>
<P>
   1. Gave Marilyn Chambers a bloodsucking armpit (``Rabid'').
</P>
<P>
   2. Had Jeremy Irons play twin gynecologists sharing their
bedside manner with Genevieve Bujold (``Dead Ringers'').
</P>
<P>
   3. Turned Jeff Goldblum into a romantic lead who barfed on his
food before eating it (``The Fly'').
</P>
<P>
   4. Gave cinema its first exploding head in living color
(``Scanners'').
</P>
<P>
   5. Introduced Peter Weller to a bunch of huge insects who talked
out of their butts long before Jim Carrey ever did (``Naked
Lunch'').
</P>
<P>
   6. Cast Conyers (Ga.) native Holly Hunter as a doctor turned on
by car wrecks in a movie that led to a public dissing by Ted Turner
and earned an NC-17 rating (``Crash'').
</P>
<P>
   Consider him the Pedro Almodovar of biological dread.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  How he got interested in video games:
</P>
<P>
   His kids (no surprise). He has two sons, 27 and 19, and a
daughter, 14. ``I look over their shoulder when they play,''
Cronenberg says. ``But I don't have the desire to spend eight or 12
hours trying to get to Level 8. But I am fascinated by the process
and the inventiveness. If a new art form emerges from computers, I
think it will arise from that technology.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hey, David, isn't it weird timing that another virtual-reality
sci-fi flick is also in theaters (``The Matrix'')?
</P>
<P>
   ``It always seems that way,'' he says. ``When I did `Dead
Ringers,' there were suddenly five twins movies. When I did `Naked
Lunch,' there were four movies about writers writing.'' For the
record, he hasn't seen ``The Matrix,'' and yes, everybody keeps
asking him if he has.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What about those freaky, fleshy game pods in ``eXistenZ''?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hold myself responsible for everything in the movie. It's
described in great detail in the script. It's a four-month
collaboration with artists and sculptors and people who can make
silicone skin. They show me models. I say, `It's too thick or too
thin,' or `It's not organic enough.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Why Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jennifer is fearless. You never know what she's going to do,
because she isn't interested in being `a star.' Jude was a real
discovery. I saw him in `Gattaca' and thought he was terrific.
Here's a guy who, for the same reason as Jennifer, the audience
doesn't really know which way he's going to go, what he's capable
of.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Was it this movie Leigh was filming that kept her from going
back to England to reshoot scenes for ``Eyes Wide Shut''?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's correct. She was very cool about that, and so was
Kubrick. He was very gentlemanly with her and she loved him, and he
tried very hard to make it work. But she knew when she left his set
that he wasn't satisfied with one of the scenes and wanted to
reshoot.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Was Stanley Kubrick an influence for you as a filmmaker?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure. By the time I started to see his stuff, my
character as a filmmaker was pretty well formed. But I admired him
as a figure in moviemaking who was renowned for having a mind and
being an intellectual.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What about ``Crash''? Was the controversy a plus or minus?
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely a plus. It was a big success in France and Poland
and Canada. It was really only Ted Turner's problem.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What's next:
</P>
<P>
   The director will chair the panel of filmmakers and actors at
this year's Cannes International Film Festival. (It was at Cannes
that ``Crash'' received a specially created award ``for
originality, for daring and for audacity,'' so Cronenberg will be
right at home.)

 &HT;    Is it real _ or is it a skewed `eXistenZ'?
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any movie with an opening credit that reads ``And Willem Dafoe
as Gas'' should pique your curiosity. But when that movie is also
directed by the unpredictable and brainy David Cronenberg
(``Crash,'' ``The Fly''), then you know it's fasten-your-seat-belts
time.
</P>
<P>
   Which is a pretty accurate assessment of ``eXistenZ,''
Cronenberg's newest nut-case extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   The territory is virtual reality. Sometime in the near future,
video games have become so technically evolved and manifest
alternative realities so terribly potent that a countermovement of
``realists'' has arisen. These realists are dead set against all
things virtual _ especially the inventors of the games. Their
fanaticism suggests the fatwa declared against novelist Salman
Rushdie, an event that Cronenberg, who has returned to writing his
own material for the first time since 1982's ``Videodrome,'' says
was one of his touchstones for the film.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's realists set their sights on supershy ``game-pod
goddess'' Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who after a
botched assassination attempt finds herself on the run with a
novice security guard named Ted (Jude Law). Damaged in the attack
was her game _ eXistenZ _ and to see what condition its condition
is in, she's got to play it with Ted.
</P>
<P>
   If you're already a fan of Cronenberg's creep-genius
moviemaking, then you know some of what to expect: strange
mutilations and mutations; yucky, icky-squishy stuff dripping with
gore, pus and primal fears; matter-of-fact grotesqueries; and a
pitch-black sense of humor. For instance, to play a virtual-reality
game, a player has to be fitted with a bio-port at the base of the
spine. Discovering that Ted doesn't have a bio-port because, well,
he's squeamish about body piercing, Allegra scoffs, ``They do it at
malls. It's like getting your ears pierced.''
</P>
<P>
   Cronenberg creates a Chinese box structure that constantly
challenges us with who's- reality-is-it-anyway twists and
surprises. At the same time, ``eXistenZ'' clearly doesn't take
itself altogether seriously. With its self-consciously arcane
jargon (``You neuro-surged and blew my pod!'') and nasty
body-function absurdities, the movie often seems to be mocking the
filmmaker's own trademark over-the-top conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his intentions _ to crack us up or gross us out _
Cronenberg has never been timid about his cinematic visions.
Allegra could be speaking for him when she says, ``People are
programmed to accept so little, but the possibilities are so
great.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities in ``eXistenZ'' offer state-of-the-art messing
with your mind. Fasten your seat belts and grab hold of your gag
reflex.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and about that ``Willem Dafoe as Gas'' credit. See, if you
can't get to the mall, you can seek out some repulsive backwoods
gas station where they deal in black-market bio-ports and . .
.well, you get the idea. Double yuuuuck.
</P>
<P>
   ``eXistenZ''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law. Directed by David
Cronenberg. Rated R for violence, sexual themes and general
nastiness. 1 hour, 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Welcome to another of David Cronenberg's amazing
nightmares.

   Wild, Wild Hollywood
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Barring a cataclysm, the biggest film of the summer,
and probably the year, will be the extravagantly promoted George
Lucas fantasy ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace.'' But
the film that has stirred almost as much talk is ``Wild Wild
West,'' directed by Barry Sonnenfeld and based on the popular
television series.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which stars Will Smith, Kevin Kline, Salma Hayek and
Kenneth Branagh, opens on July 2. It's a big, sprawling comedy
adventure made by a director whose last movie, ``Men in Black,''
was a huge hit. But the Hollywood spin and rumor machine has gone
into high gear about the movie, and its creators are furious. Rival
studio executives began whispering that the expensive movie was not
only in trouble but that its costs had spiraled to $150 million,
even $175 million. Or more. Every year, it seems, the Hollywood
rumor mill focuses on cost overruns, targeting one film. A few
years ago it was ``Last Action Hero,'' which turned out to be a box
office dud. More recently it was ``Titanic,'' which turned out to
be, well, titanic.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Brothers, which is releasing ``Wild West West,'' says the
cost is a little over $105 million. Asked about the higher figures,
Barbara Brogliatti, a spokeswoman, said, ``It's totally
ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   The studio sorely needs ``Wild Wild West'' to succeed. While
Warner Brothers has had a string of recent successes like ``You've
Got Mail,'' ``Analyze This'' and ``The Matrix,'' these films barely
compensate for losses on flops like ``Quest for Camelot,''
``Soldier,'' ``Wrongfully Accused,'' ``Major League 3,'' ``The
Avengers,'' ``The Postman'' and ``Mad City.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonnenfeld spoke in frustration and anger about the rumors and
articles involving his movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an out-of-control director,'' he said. ``It's a good
movie.'' He added, ``I can now see how easy it was for Joe McCarthy
to get started.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it's Hollywood, there are conspiracy theories about rival
producers' spreading the rumors to damage the film's prospects. All
this sounds bizarre and Machiavellian. But that's life in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Abbie Hoffman's Story
</P>
<P>
   The Yippies are back! Robert Greenwald, a television producer
and director, vividly recalls following the odyssey of Abbie
Hoffman in the 1960's, as just about everyone else did. Greenwald,
who was then a high school student in New York and an undergraduate
at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, particularly remembers
when Hoffman and a circle of friends founded ``Yippie,'' the band
of quintessential revolutionaries whose antiwar theatrics turned
them into counterculture heroes and heroines.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 years later Greenwald explained the antiwar
movement to his grown daughters and their friends, who were
fascinated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them about the Chicago trial, the march on the
Pentagon, the antiwar movement,'' Greenwald said. ``Sure, there
were the externals: the Janis Joplin songs and what hippies wore.
But I realized there was a great hunger in this generation to
capture that sense of excitement when there was a commitment to
issues that you believed in.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of this experience, and meetings over the years with Hoffman
and his former wife, Anita Hoffman, Greenwald has made ``Abbie,'' a
film about Hoffman's sometimes crazy, sometimes serious life. The
movie, to be seen by distributors over the next few weeks, has a
screenplay by Bruce Graham and Robert Ward based on two books: ``To
America With Love: Letters From the Underground,'' by Anita and
Abbie Hoffman, and ``Abbie Hoffman: American Rebel,'' by Marty
Jezer.
</P>
<P>
   The film stars Vincent D'Onofrio as Abbie, Janeane Garofalo as
Anita, who died of cancer last year at age 56, and Jeanne
Tripplehorn as Johanna Lawrenson, Hoffman's companion in his later
years.
</P>
<P>
   Though the movie is funny, it is also a dark exploration of a
man who shrewdly used a clowning style to provoke and outrage. In
1974 Hoffman went underground for six years while being sought by
the FBI on charges of selling cocaine, leaving behind Anita and a
small son, america, who was deliberately named with a lowercase a.
(His son is now an electrician in North Carolina.) For seven years
Hoffman was on the run, finally meeting Ms. Lawrenson, who
protected him. In 1978 he resurfaced as Barry Freed, an
environmental activist in upstate New York. Two years later he
surrendered and served a short prison term. The Hoffmans were
divorced in 1980 but remained close friends.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's later years were darkened by bouts of manic
depression. He committed suicide with a huge dose of barbiturates
in 1989 at age 52.
</P>
<P>
   Several film projects about Hoffman have foundered, partly
because Mrs. Hoffman refused to sell the rights to her book.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was dubious that anyone could capture the love story, the
times, the passions, the humor,'' Greenwald said.
</P>
<P>
   He had the advantage of having met Mrs. Hoffman in the 1970s; at
one point he was even invited to a dinner to meet Barry Freed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was funny, charismatic and really, really smart,''
Greenwald said. ``We spent a lot of time that evening talking about
music _ Phil Ochs, Country Joe and the Fish, Richie Havens.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenwald said he wanted to depict not only the importance of
Hoffman in his time but also his relevance today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abbie was consistent to the end,'' Greenwald said. ``He
believed you had to commit to something beyond your narrow
self-interest, or as he said, beyond greed. And in that sense your
life becomes meaningful. It's a positive message to pass on.''
</P>
<P>
   The film cost about $10 million, with most of the money raised
from some Wall Street hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abbie would have gotten a kick out of that,'' Greenwald said.
</P>

<P>
   An Irish Tale
</P>
<P>
   Since childhood Aidan Quinn has been immersed in his Irish
roots. Although he grew up in Chicago and Rockford, Ill., the
40-year-old actor lived off and on in Dublin and other Irish cities
as a boy. His father, Michael, a college teacher and Irish
immigrant, frequently moved the family back to Ireland when he took
academic sabbaticals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were dominated by both cultures,'' said Quinn, whose film
roles have included ``Legends of the Fall,'' ``Michael Collins,''
``The Playboys'' and ``Blink.'' He added: ``It was a blessing and
curse. Moving back and forth. In one sense, you were always a
stranger in a strange land.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Quinn is seeking to depict the Irish experience through his
role in ``This Is My Father,'' a movie that is very much a Quinn
family experience, too. The film, which opens on May 7, was written
and directed by Paul Quinn, his 39-year-old brother, who is also a
theatrical director. Another brother, Declan, 41, who was the
Oscar-winning cinematographer for ``Leaving Las Vegas'' (1995), is
behind the camera on this movie. A sister, Marian, plays a small
role.
</P>
<P>
   The film chronicles the journey of a bitter Chicago
schoolteacher (played by James Caan) who takes his teen-age nephew
(Jacob Tierney) to Ireland in a quest to unravel a mystery about
his family's past and the tragedy that befell his mother. Quinn
plays a poor farmer, an outsider who was in love with the mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film is hardly a romantic view of Ireland like `Waking Ned
Devine.''' Quinn said. ``It sort of makes you understand why there
have been 800 years of emigration.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn said there were few younger brother-older brother
complications on the film set.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never get away from that completely,'' he said.
``Hopefully, you iron all that stuff out by the time you're a
teen-ager.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually we all had tremendous respect for each other, but we
did disagree,'' he said. ``And if Declan and I had one view, and
Paul had another, Paul would say, `I hear what you're saying, but I
disagree.' In other words, he was the director, it was his film and
he made the ultimate decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, who lives in New Jersey with his wife and two young
daughters, is popular in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a celebrity there,'' he said, ``much more than I am
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he is frequently cast in movies, Quinn said his acting
career had become a bit frustrating as he approached middle age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get offered enough good parts, and this film kind of
spoiled me,'' he said. ``The studio system is difficult and
somewhat disastrous for all actors and actresses unless you're one
of those 10 or 15 stars whose name can green-light a film.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn said that friends like Stanley Tucci and Steve Buscemi
were now writing and starring in their own independent films
because of similar frustration with the lack of interesting roles
in studio films.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to be Zen about the whole thing,'' Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   Does living away from Los Angeles and in New Jersey hurt his
career?
</P>
<P>
   ``It may make a little bit of difference,'' Quinn said. ``But
the trade-off in my sanity makes it worthwhile.''

`POP IMPRESSIONS:' THE CONSUMERAMA OF POP ART  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The most sought-after trophies of the Pop Art era are
paintings, of course, with their big, catchy images of consumer
products and media scenes. But printmaking, too, by the very fact
of its populist, disseminative nature, was an important Pop
activity. A well-rounded reminder of this is the Modern's bright,
snappy show, ``Pop Impressions Europe/U.S.A.: Prints and Multiples
From the Museum of Modern Art,'' whose 90 objects are drawn
entirely from the museum's collection.
</P>
<P>
   The show has a good deal of material _ cocky, brassy, vulgar,
sexy, sometimes impassioned and occasionally witty _ that may
trigger nostalgia in those who were of art-viewing age in the 1960s
and '70s. But what is most interesting is that the exhibition and
its well-researched catalog cover developments in Europe as well as
the United States, placing works by Americans like Andy Warhol, Roy
Lichtenstein, James Rosenquist, Ed Ruscha and Robert Indiana cheek
by jowl with those of artists from abroad: among them Martial
Raysse (France), Dieter Roth and Gerhard Richter (Germany) and
Richard Hamilton and Eduardo Paolozzi (Britain).
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition's organizer, Wendy Weitman, associate curator in
the department of prints and illustrated books at the museum, has
divided the show into five very loose and sometimes overlapping
themes: proto-Pop, mass media, consumer culture, politics and
erotica. As she points out in the catalog, there was ``no one Pop
art''; it developed differently in different countries. Broadly
speaking, in Europe politics was more apt to color the work, while
in the United States, with a milder postwar hangover and an
economic boom that produced a flourishing demand for goods,
artists' imagery was dominated by consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   Black-and-white lithographs by Jasper Johns (``Flag I,'' 1960)
and Robert Rauschenberg (``License,'' 1962) begin the show. Though
pop in portent, they were still influenced by the rough brushwork
of Abstract Expressionism. But working in lithograph ateliers like
June Wayne's Tamarind and Tatyana Grosman's Universal Limited Art
Editions, the two artists furthered the appeal of printmaking as a
medium. Europeans like Daniel Spoerri, Arman and Christo were more
3-D-oriented. Christo's contribution to the show, ``Wrapped Look
Magazine'' (1965), a copy of the popular periodical tightly wrapped
in see-through plastic and cord, was created for a Spoerri project,
a series of multiple objects called MAT (Multiplication d'Art
Transformable). Each of the three MAT series that actually were
released was produced in an edition of 100, the object being to
make artwork affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Spoerri is represented here by a multiple from a different
edition, a wonderful pop-up collage from 1973, mounted on bright
blue board, of the dishes and detritus left after a meal, a
recurring image in his work. The multiple, based on a photograph,
was part of a portfolio made up, long after their disbanding, of
work by New Realists, a French Pop group that included Yves Klein,
Raysse and Arman and whose goal was to bring the real world into
their art.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1960s, mass imagery, already ``discovered'' in the
1950s by Hamilton and Paolozzi, had entrenched itself in American
consciousness. Screen printing, a commercial process, became the
preferred medium for its ease of use and ability to give smooth
registry to multicolor images and photo processes. The mass media
section of the show includes such icons as Warhol's screen print
``Cagney'' (1964), a black-and-white still from a 1930's gangster
movie showing James Cagney menaced by the shadow of a manned rifle
as, gun in each hand, he faces an unseen killer. Unlike Warhol's
later work, this one still has painterly touches, notably the white
streaks left by the squeegee as it pushed ink through the printing
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Sharply contrasting with the Warhol in terms of brilliant color
and elegant finish is Indiana's ``Love'' (1967), a sophisticatedly
geometric logo of that word in saturated hues of red, green and
blue. It is nice to see this old chestnut, originally designed as a
Christmas card for the Modern and redone in more than 20
variations, including one used for an 8-cent United States postage
stamp of 1973 that was produced in a truly mass edition of more
than 300 million.
</P>
<P>
   The universality of Marilyn Monroe's appeal is reaffirmed in
this section by Hamilton's ``My Marilyn'' (1966), an elaborately
worked-over screen print of publicity photographs rejected by
Monroe with ``X'' marks, except for a playfully sexy shot on the
beach. The rejected photos in this poignant montage are meant to
convey the vulnerability of Monroe's life and its final negation,
her suicide in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Warhol and Lichtenstein dominate the liveliest section of the
show, consumer culture. Warhol's ubiquitous Campbell's soup can
adorns a paper shopping bag, the first version of this image to
appear in an edition (of 125-200), sold for $12 at a landmark Pop
show of 1964, ``The American Supermarket.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on display is the shopping bag made by Lichtenstein for
that show, depicting one of his signature cooked turkeys, probably
swiped from a newspaper advertisement. Hitting the spectator right
in the deja vu are Warhol's famous ``S &AMP; H Green Stamps'' (1965),''
Lichtenstein's banal ``Sandwich and Soda'' (1964) printed in color
on clear plastic for a portfolio of work by 10 painters and
Ruscha's big, garish stylization of an auto stop, ``Standard
Station'' (1966), a veritable emblem of the Pop movement.
</P>
<P>
   The imagery seems thinnest in the politics section, maybe
because the complexities of the subject did not lend themselves so
well to Pop stylization. One arresting piece, however, is Jim
Dine's ``Drag _ Johnson and Mao'' (1967), a large etching and
aquatint showing the heads of President Johnson and Mao, the
Chinese leader, wearing makeup and clownish facial adornments,
apparently a comment on Johnson's Vietnam-influenced loss of power
vis-a-vis Mao's iron political grip. A screen print by the British
artist Joe Tilson, ``Is This Che Guevara?'' (1969), impresses with
its striking arrangement of newsprint images of Che's dead face
punctuated by repetitive news clips of him as a Cuban hero.
</P>
<P>
   The erotica section, whose imagery draws from the liberated
sexual climate of the 1960s, concentrates on _ what else? _ women,
from Tom Wesselmann's heavily stylized, hard-edge ``Nude'' (1965),
stressing the nippled white section of a tanned torso, done for the
screen print portfolio ``11 Pop Artists, Volume II,'' to Sigmar
Polke's deliberately fuzzy black-and-white photolithograph,
``Girlfriends'' (1967), based on a provocative newspaper
advertisement for women's clothing and depicting two women, in a
maybe relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Pop may not be every artgoer's dish, but its impact still
resonates. This lively show is valuable for its attempt to explore
how artists connected or collided with the great global consumerama
set in motion during the 60s and their subversive view as a
nonelitist pursuit.

BURTON CHALLENGING GORDON FOR CHAMPIONSHIP
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This could be the year Jeff Burton breaks out. Burton, 31, is in
his fourth year driving for Roush Racing, the high-powered five-car
Ford team owned by Jack Roush.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday at Martinsville, Va., Burton wound up second to John
Andretti, who passed him four laps from the end to take the win.
</P>
<P>
   It was Burton's sixth top-five finish in the first eight races,
enabling him to remain on top in the Winston Cup point standings,
where he leads another Ford driver, Dale Jarrett, 1,239 to 1,154.
</P>
<P>
   With victories at Las Vegas and Darlington, S.C., Burton already
is within one win of his best season in 1997, when he won three
races.
</P>
<P>
   But to win the championship, he must avoid problems like he had
in February when he finished 35th in the Daytona 500. Burton's
Daytona car, though, was much better than that, which is why he is
optimistic heading for the Diehard 500 in Talladega, Ala., on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We qualified 11th and finished third in the 125-mile
qualifier, and then got in a wreck at Daytona,'' Burton said.
``That's why we finished where we did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we felt pretty good about our Daytona effort,'' Burton
said. ``We really didn't get down about it. Daytona is so different
than everything else we do. We just kind of put it behind us and
went to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, when Jeff Gordon won his first Winston Cup title,
anyone who expects to challenge him has to win races and finish in
the top five consistently. Gordon, who is 27, has won three Winston
championships and finished second once. From 1995 through 1998, he
won a remarkable 40 out of 127 races and recorded 86 top fives.
</P>
<P>
   Things may be different this year. Already, Gordon has failed to
finish in two races, equaling the number of his entire 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   If Gordon's consistency breaks down, it could pave the way for
someone else _ like Burton _ to break through. After finishing
fourth in 1997 and fifth in 1998, Burton has an idea of what it
takes to win a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a contender the last two years has made us a smarter
race team in ways we probably don't even realize,'' Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a chance to run against Dale Jarrett and Jeff
Gordon and Bobby Labonte and Rusty Wallace _ everybody that runs up
front every week _ those experiences are irreplaceable,'' Burton
said. ``You learn so much by doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most difficult things for young drivers to understand
is that you don't win a race on the first lap and you don't win a
championship in one race. For example, Andretti, who is 36, won
last Sunday in Martinsville, Va., even though he spun out and lost
a lap early in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the thing that stands out most for me is patience,
understanding that not every race is gonna go the way you want it
to, that every lap is not gonna go the way you want it to,'' Burton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't let those negatives mess up your whole year and get
you so mad that you do things out of anger or emotion,'' he said.
``This is a long, long season and there's a lot of time from race
to race. We've learned to take each race for what it is. If we win
a race, we don't think that just because we've won means we're
gonna win next week. At the same time, if you finish 35th, don't
think that means you're gonna go finish 35th next week.''

BIG PROFITS AND MORALITY MIX ON WALL STREET FOR BUFFETT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WALDO PROFITT   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have been reading the annual report of Berkshire Hathaway
Inc., which I always find an enjoyable way to spend an evening
because a) extensive portions of it are written by Warren Buffett,
and b) it almost always reports a substantial return to
stockholders, of whom I am one of the very smallest.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett, who has been called the most successful investor in
history, has a wry humor, a rare trait among financiers, and an
almost compulsive streak of honesty, which is not necessarily rare
for corporate chieftains, but is something less than universal
amongst the breed.
</P>
<P>
   One of his qualities I find most attractive and amusing is his
unabashed penchant for synergy. For instance, he notes that
Berkshire has the largest net worth of any American corporation,
$57.4 billion, which is not the same as market value but which does
indicate the amount of capital that managers must deploy. To
increase intrinsic value at an average rate of 15 percent a year
will require massive new investment.
</P>
<P>
   So, a few pages ahead in the annual report, Buffett says he
would like to hear from principals of large companies that would
fit comfortably into the Berkshire family. ``We would like to make
an acquisition in the $5 billion to $20 billion range. We will not
engage in unfriendly takeovers. We can promise complete
confidentiality and a very fast answer _ customarily within five
minutes _ as to whether we're interested. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Buffett also uses the annual report and the company's annual
meeting to increase revenues for businesses owned by Berkshire. The
annual meeting will be May 1 to 3 in Omaha, Neb. A coliseum and a
convention center with a combined seating of 19,000 have been
booked.
</P>
<P>
   Stockholders may secure help with plane, hotel and car
reservations from American Express (Berkshire owns 50.5 million
shares).
</P>
<P>
   Chartered buses will make trips to Borsheim's, a purveyor of
fine jewelry, owned by Berkshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``A full line of Berkshire products will be available. ... Last
year we set sales records across-the-board, moving 3,700 pounds of
See's candy, 1,635 pairs of Dexter shoes, 1,150 sets of Quikut
knives and 3,104 Berkshire shirts and hats.''
</P>
<P>
   Dairy Queen, owned by guess who, will be on hand. Last year it
sold about 4,000 frozen delicacies. Borsheim's will be open
especially for shareholders on the Sunday of the meeting. Last
year, the store's volume on that stockholder Sunday ``greatly
exceeded'' volume for any day in its history.
</P>
<P>
   Even in small matters, you can see, Buffett and his partner,
Charles Munger, don't overlook many chances to increase Berkshire's
intrinsic value.
</P>
<P>
   Berkshire either paid or will soon pay $2.7 billion in federal
income tax for 1998. Buffett's reaction: ``Writing checks to the
IRS that include strings of zeros does not bother Charlie or me.
Berkshire as a corporation and we as individuals have prospered in
America as we would have in no other country ... we feel
extraordinarily lucky to have been dealt a hand in life that
enables us to write large checks to the government ...''
</P>
<P>
   Another attractive thing about Buffett is that he is not afraid
to say something critical of business. He expresses particular
sorrow this year at companies and managers who manipulate earnings
to satisfy Wall Street's desires. ``These managers start with the
assumption, all too common, that their job at all times is to
encourage the highest stock price possible (a premise with which we
adamantly disagree). ... When operations don't produce the result
hoped for, these CEOs resort to unadmirable accounting stratagems
...
</P>
<P>
   ``The distortion du jour is the `restructuring charge,' an entry
that can, of course, be legitimate but that too often is used as a
device for manipulating earnings. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``In the acquisition arena, restructuring has been raised to an
art form. Managements now frequently use mergers to dishonestly
rearrange the value of assets and liabilities in ways that will
allow them to both smooth and swell future earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry I won't be at the annual meeting. I'd be happy to make
my meager contribution to Berkshire's cash flow by buying company
ice cream and candy and caps for an opportunity to listen to
Buffett.

 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The landscape of America changed on Thursday. All billboards
advertising cigarettes came down, including a huge vinyl sign in
Times Square promoting Kool Natural cigarettes that slid down
''like an old curtain,'' as The New York Times put it. It was the
successor of a more famous Camel billboard that used to blow huge
smoke rings over the Great White Way.
 &HT;    In Hollywood, a 64-foot-high cutout of the Marlboro Man, who
loomed over Sunset Strip, went into retirement. So did tens of
thousands of billboards across America. In their place,
anti-smoking billboards are supposed to go up.
 &HT;    Some might view this change with nostalgia. Not me. I see the
change as a step toward better American health.
 &HT;    Consider Scripture: ''Do you not know that your body is a temple
of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have received from God?
You are not your own. You were bought at a price. Therefore honor
God with your body (I Cor. 6: 19-20).
 &HT;    My parents were heavy smokers. They paid a dear price for not
honoring God with their bodies. My dad died a terrible death from
lung cancer at the relatively young age of 66, in which each breath
became more difficult over many months. My mother died similarly of
emphysema at age 73. By contrast, my in-laws, who did not smoke,
lived to ages 82 and 90.
 &HT;    Smoking does shorten one's life. By how much? Seven years on
average, reports the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Even people
who started smoking in their teens and stopped in their twenties,
have ''lasting damage,'' says David Rosenbloom of Join Together, of
Boston University's School of Public Health. It IS a destruction of
the temple of the Holy Spirit.
 &HT;    That's not how my dad viewed it, of course. He believed the ads
that smoking made him more manly, deepening his voice. After his
first lung cancer operation, I visited him in the hospital, only to
find him smoking! It truly was a lethal addiction.
 &HT;    The removal of billboards is part of the $206 billion agreement
reached between tobacco producers and 46 states to resolve all
state claims for health costs related to smoking.
 &HT;    Why did the tobacco producers agree to such a huge settlement?
Did they not win a giant battle last year in Congress, defeating a
$500-billion bill proposed by the administration?
 &HT;    Yes, but they lost lawsuits in four states with aggressive
attorneys general who won lucrative multi-billion awards in
compensation for years of higher state health care bills, setting a
precedent that encouraged dozens of other states to file claims,
frightening the tobacco industry.
 &HT;    Mississippi was the first state to win an award. As part of the
deal, cigarette billboards came down last fall, as they did in the
three other pioneering states, Florida, Texas and Minnesota.
Result: Mississippi's cigarette sales have fallen by more than
one-third!
 &HT;    The need for new action became clear last April in a report that
teen smoking had soared by one-third over six years, rising from
27.5 percent in 1991 to 36.4 percent in 1997.
 &HT;    Vice President Al Gore reported last week that 88 percent of
12th graders, 86 percent of 10th graders and 82 percent of 8th
graders who currently smoke cigarettes, smoke the most heavily
advertised brands Marlboro, Newport and Camel. This data is backed
up by a separate survey by the ''Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids,''
which reports that 75 percent of teens had seen tobacco ads vs.
only 31 percent of adults. Kids also remember Marlboro, Newport,
Camel ads.
 &HT;    Therefore, the disappearance of cigarette billboards and an
anti-smoking ad campaign, already begun in Florida and California,
should make a difference. One more answer.
 &HT;    The law prohibiting cigarette sales to minors needs more
rigorous enforcement. For more than a decade, young teens have
conducted sting operations in cooperation with the Allentown, Pa.,
Health and Police Departments.
 &HT;    ''In 1985, 100 percent of the stores sold to 12 to 14-year-olds.
Last June, only 10 percent did so,'' says Barbara Stader, Health
Director. Why? The fines for sales to minors increased from $25 the
first time to $1,000 for a third offense.
 &HT;    Question to church youth groups: why not organize a sting
operation with your Police Departments? You will help save the
lives of your friends.
 &HT;    Florida is going one step further, arresting kids found smoking.
The result? The number of junior high students who smoke dropped
from 18.5 percent to 15 percent; and high school smokers declined
from 27.4 to 25.2 percent.
 &HT;    These are the first declines of teen smoking in the nation since
1980.

   ``You don't want your characters to be perfect,'' said Mark
Bode, looking spiky, disheveled and agreeably imperfect himself in
his Felix the Cat T-shirt, black sneakers, earrings and slouchy,
conspiratorial demeanor. ``You want them to have problems, quirks,
personality. Just as long as they're not normal. Normal isn't very
interesting, is it? You want your characters to have something
wrong with them.''
</P>
<P>
   We are at the Words and Pictures Museum in Northampton, Mass.,
one of three museums in the United States (and the only one in the
Northeast) devoted solely to what the museum calls ``fine graphic
narrative and fantasy illustration,'' i.e., cartoon and comic-book
art in all its caricatured, heavy-metal humor and superhero
permutations.
</P>
<P>
   The balance between perfect and imperfect, funky and artful,
casual and purposeful, is the essence of the museum, which was
founded in 1992 by Kevin B. Eastman, one of the creators of the
Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles.
</P>
<P>
   Housed in a four-story building downtown with cartoon
silhouettes in the windows and a giant gargoyle on top, the museum,
whose full name is the Words and Pictures Museum of Fine Sequential
Art, is half art gallery and half fun house. It has both
traditional galleries with fantasy art displayed like Rembrandts
and grotto-like, kid-friendly work spaces.
</P>
<P>
   But the sense of walking both sides of the street applies
equally to Northampton itself, the very symbol of renascent,
refined New England on the one hand and a beehive of grunge style,
buzz cuts, body piercing and alternative everything on the other.
So you can get a bracing course in cultural dichotomy both inside
and outside the museum.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to take our kids, ages 8 and 12 and more attuned to
the South, where they lived until last summer, than to New England,
for a weekend in Northampton and a trip to the museum, which was
featuring a course in cartooning taught by Bode.
</P>
<P>
   Great artistry doesn't necessarily run in our family. But
Garfield, Calvin and Hobbes, Dilbert, the Far Side and various
too-expensive ``Star Wars'' and ``Star Trek'' graphic novels have
been on their bookshelves forever, and taking a crash course in
cartooning seemed too good an idea to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   We wended our way from our home outside Manhattan, arriving at
the old Hotel Northampton, where mummies and daddies of countless
generations of Smith College students have come to knock down gin
and tonics at the Wiggins Tavern Pub and visit the campus. The red
brick hotel, which is in the middle of downtown and opened in 1927,
is like a snapshot of the more traditional Northampton: musty,
genteel and sedate.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, you can make a beeline from the hotel to the Smith
campus _ with its green groves and Paradise Pond; its three-level
Smith College Museum of Art, with an exquisite collection of
Monets, Homers, Cezannes and van Goghs; its Botanic Garden and
Lyman Conservatory _ and feel as if you were in a New England
college movie circa 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, the whole downtown, with its amiable
clutter of low-scale ice cream parlors and craft shops, outdoor
clothes emporiums, bookstores and coffee shops upon coffee shops,
suggests an impossibly idyllic small town life in the pre-mall,
pre-franchise America.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this analysis goes only so far. If Northampton has
the look, scale, foliage and climate of L.L. Bean country, it also
has the populace of Berkeley or Ann Arbor.
</P>
<P>
   These days it is better known for its large and influential
lesbian community than for the fact that Calvin Coolidge was once
mayor or that Jonathan Edwards used to evoke the plight of sinners
in the hand of an angry God from his pulpit there in the 1700s.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, a comic book museum doesn't entirely fit either
image of Northampton. It is definitely not the Currier &AMP;
Ives/Robert Frost New England. But on the surface, it seems a
little intellectually down market for the hip, engaged, North Face
Northampton of liberal politics and gender-bending.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the museum is something of an institution,
with its own alternative mission. The whole purpose of the museum,
which has 18,000 works in its collection, is to show respect for an
art form and for artists that are often not taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   American comics are usually said to date to 1896, with the
publication of the first newspaper cartoon strip, ``The Yellow
Kid,'' in The New York Journal. Comic books became popular in the
1930s, and many of the superheroes we think of first when we think
of comic books _ Superman, Batman, Captain America, Mandrake the
Magician _ began around that time. Since then comics have waxed and
waned in terms of artistry, popularity and artistic daring, with
the current moment one of the less auspicious ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comic book industry is always a roller coaster,'' Bode
said. ``But it's very scary out there right now. The underground
field is virtually nonexistent; almost all the underground
publishers have gone belly up. And unless you have a movie or toy
figure attached to your comic book, you're not going to get it
published. It's one reason this museum is so important. Even in
good times, it's hard in this country for people to take this kind
of art seriously, and this museum does an unbelievably great job of
doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Professional pride is only one reason Bode cares about this so
much. He is the son of Vaughn Bode, a comic artist and
self-proclaimed ``Pop-Mystic Transvestite and One-Man Band'' whose
comic and erotic figures and use of wild lettering, have inspired
graphic arts and graffiti artists since the 1960s. A Web site with
a glimpse of his work is at www.dross.com/cheechwizard.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn Bode died in 1975 at the age of 33, when his son was 12.
Mark Bode, who is now 36, sees his role at the museum as a way of
carrying on his father's work, part of a mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't look at comic book art as fine art the way they
do in Europe,'' he said. ``I went to a festival in Angouleme,
France, where comic book art takes over the whole city and 100,000
people attend. But we've got this museum here full of incredible
art, and most people don't even know it exists.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``I tell people what I do, and they say: `Wow! You
make a living at being an idiot?' It used to irk me a little bit,
but now I don't worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He met his 16 students, most 7 to 12 years old, at the museum
shop and led them through what looked like caves full of
hieroglyphics and cave paintings to an elevator that took us to a
second-story atrium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Mark Bode,'' he told them. ``I'm a cartoonist. I've been a
cartoonist all my life. My father was a cartoonist before me.''
</P>
<P>
   He began with a few dos and don'ts. First, he said, you need to
draw a lot and there's nothing wrong with tracing. Then you need to
be enterprising in terms of sources. If you want to draw a
motorcycle, get a book of motorcycles to learn from. Then you want
to start building up your own cast of characters, like a family. He
runs through some of his drawings to make the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a parody of the Wizard of Oz,'' he said. ``It's the
Lizard of Oz. He's a little more neurotic. He has more problems, I
guess. You can see the poor Lion here. He's a nervous wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   Then each student got a pad and pencils; it was time for them to
draw an animal. What kind, he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The first suggestion, a scorpion, seemed a little imposing. The
second idea, a frog, made more sense.
</P>
<P>
   They started with two circles for the eyes and added lines for
eyelids. They added a smile that went to the side of the eye and
lips, and they had a face. Next came the frog's lapel (``He's a
fancy dresser''), a bow tie, a squared-off body, shoulders and
arms, cuffs, hands, legs and feet. They added a hat and a balloon
so he could say ``Redeep!'' Voila! Every kid had come up with a
credible frog.
</P>
<P>
   Next came a very feisty kangaroo with boxing gloves and a
pathetic combination of a duck and turtle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This poor guy,'' Bode said sympathetically. ``His mother was a
duck and his father was a turtle. It's unfortunate he came out this
way, but he didn't have a choice. He grew up in a nuclear power
plant swamp, and he's feeling sorry for himself. He's thinking,
`Why did you draw me like this?'''
</P>
<P>
   They added squiggly lines, the universal smelly sign, to make
him more ignominious, then admired their work. Before they were
done, they drew a weird hippie/punk bird with a mohawk, robe and
beer belly; a muscleman with tattoos, a fake arrow through his head
and a Jay Leno chin; a Ninja turtle, and a demented alligator
dentist. My daughter, Emma, came up with his name _ Dr. Decay _ so
she got to keep his original.
</P>
<P>
   The museum itself is a mixed experience. The book shop is kids'
and cartoon maven heaven, with cards, comic books, books on drawing
and the history of cartoons, posters, action figures, magnets,
T-shirts and caps of well-known and obscure comic figures.
</P>
<P>
   It leads to an interesting but modest display of comic books
through the ages, or at least decades, neatly divided by category:
science fiction, underground, alternative, fantasy, western,
funnies, superheroes, suspense. Next is a crash course in world art
from cave paintings to Persian manuscripts to Renaissance
altarpieces, making the case, more or less, that words-and-pictures
art didn't start with comic books.
</P>
<P>
   The main exhibition hall is the formal gallery on the fourth
floor with works by well-known comic and graphic artists' like
Vaughn Bode, Frank Frazetta, Will Eisner, Jack Kirby, Bill
Sienkiewicz and Bernie Wrightson. The work tends more to vivid,
imaginative fantasy or horror art or Vargas pinups than Mickey and
Goofy and is probably more attuned to adults than to children.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those represented are contemporary artists, primarily
from the United States, Britain and Europe. My favorite was the
series of Friendly Dictator trading cards by Sienkiewicz.
</P>
<P>
   You can easily see the whole place in an hour and a half, then
return to the greater Northampton street circus, which seems to
have picked up the moniker Noho, though residents mostly prefer the
less pretentious Hamp as a nickname.
</P>
<P>
   It's not quite nuclear turtle-ducks, but the shops, galleries,
bookstores and eateries and the various variations on body piercing
provide an intriguing menagerie of their own.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who haven't had their fill of culture, there is
always the Beer Can Museum with its collection of 5,500 beer cans
at Ye Ol' Watering Hole, 287 Pleasant Street. But that's another
story. &QL;

   (Religion Commentary)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (Mike McManus is a syndicated columnist whose ``Ethics &AMP;
Religion'' appears in almost 100 newspapers)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York
Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA
WEYDERT at 732-390-4480)  
 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The landscape of America changed on Thursday. All billboards
advertising cigarettes came down, including a huge vinyl sign in
Times Square promoting Kool Natural cigarettes that slid down
''like an old curtain,'' as The New York Times put it. It was the
successor of a more famous Camel billboard that used to blow huge
smoke rings over the Great White Way.
 &HT;    In Hollywood, a 64-foot-high cutout of the Marlboro Man, who
loomed over Sunset Strip, went into retirement. So did tens of
thousands of billboards across America. In their place,
anti-smoking billboards are supposed to go up.
 &HT;    Some might view this change with nostalgia. Not me. I see the
change as a step toward better American health.
 &HT;    Consider Scripture: ''Do you not know that your body is a temple
of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have received from God?
You are not your own. You were bought at a price. Therefore honor
God with your body (I Cor. 6: 19-20).
 &HT;    My parents were heavy smokers. They paid a dear price for not
honoring God with their bodies. My dad died a terrible death from
lung cancer at the relatively young age of 66, in which each breath
became more difficult over many months. My mother died similarly of
emphysema at age 73. By contrast, my in-laws, who did not smoke,
lived to ages 82 and 90.
 &HT;    Smoking does shorten one's life. By how much? Seven years on
average, reports the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Even people
who started smoking in their teens and stopped in their twenties,
have ''lasting damage,'' says David Rosenbloom of Join Together, of
Boston University's School of Public Health. It IS a destruction of
the temple of the Holy Spirit.
 &HT;    That's not how my dad viewed it, of course. He believed the ads
that smoking made him more manly, deepening his voice. After his
first lung cancer operation, I visited him in the hospital, only to
find him smoking! It truly was a lethal addiction.
 &HT;    The removal of billboards is part of the $206 billion agreement
reached between tobacco producers and 46 states to resolve all
state claims for health costs related to smoking.
 &HT;    Why did the tobacco producers agree to such a huge settlement?
Did they not win a giant battle last year in Congress, defeating a
$500-billion bill proposed by the administration?
 &HT;    Yes, but they lost lawsuits in four states with aggressive
attorneys general who won lucrative multi-billion awards in
compensation for years of higher state health care bills, setting a
precedent that encouraged dozens of other states to file claims,
frightening the tobacco industry.
 &HT;    Mississippi was the first state to win an award. As part of the
deal, cigarette billboards came down last fall, as they did in the
three other pioneering states, Florida, Texas and Minnesota.
Result: Mississippi's cigarette sales have fallen by more than
one-third!
 &HT;    The need for new action became clear last April in a report that
teen smoking had soared by one-third over six years, rising from
27.5 percent in 1991 to 36.4 percent in 1997.
 &HT;    Vice President Al Gore reported last week that 88 percent of
12th graders, 86 percent of 10th graders and 82 percent of 8th
graders who currently smoke cigarettes, smoke the most heavily
advertised brands Marlboro, Newport and Camel. This data is backed
up by a separate survey by the ''Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids,''
which reports that 75 percent of teens had seen tobacco ads vs.
only 31 percent of adults. Kids also remember Marlboro, Newport,
Camel ads.
 &HT;    Therefore, the disappearance of cigarette billboards and an
anti-smoking ad campaign, already begun in Florida and California,
should make a difference. One more answer.
 &HT;    The law prohibiting cigarette sales to minors needs more
rigorous enforcement. For more than a decade, young teens have
conducted sting operations in cooperation with the Allentown, Pa.,
Health and Police Departments.
 &HT;    ''In 1985, 100 percent of the stores sold to 12 to 14-year-olds.
Last June, only 10 percent did so,'' says Barbara Stader, Health
Director. Why? The fines for sales to minors increased from $25 the
first time to $1,000 for a third offense.
 &HT;    Question to church youth groups: why not organize a sting
operation with your Police Departments? You will help save the
lives of your friends.
 &HT;    Florida is going one step further, arresting kids found smoking.
The result? The number of junior high students who smoke dropped
from 18.5 percent to 15 percent; and high school smokers declined
from 27.4 to 25.2 percent.
 &HT;    These are the first declines of teen smoking in the nation since
1980.

I LOOK GOOD? WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Thursday, April 29)  
(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's becoming almost a standard part of the American greeting.
</P>
<P>
   This is how it goes: Big ``hi.'' Big hug. Step back, do a quic
scan and exclaim, ``You look GOOOOOD.'' This can be said with a
slight hint of amazement.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the response, ``YOU look good.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a compliment, isn't it? A positive exchange between two
people assuring one another that neither has fallen apart since the
last sighting, in fact has held up remarkably well.
</P>
<P>
   And you can't really challenge a compliment and ask, ``Well,
what do you mean by that?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, you can't help being a little suspect and wondering just
how bad you looked the last time. Or, more to the point, just how
fat you looked the last time.
</P>
<P>
   We know this because, if pressed to elaborate, the greeter will
often follow up by saying, ``YOU'VE lost weight.''
</P>
<P>
   If you protest that no, in fact you haven't, it's just a new
lipstick or maybe taller shoes, they will often tell you that
you're mistaken. You HAVE lost weight. They know.
</P>
<P>
   Then you start wondering if perhaps you went through a large
period and didn't realize it. Maybe it's those dumb black pants
that you know better than to wear with a sweater tucked in. Anyhow,
someone has been noticing and now she's congratulating you for
losing weight you didn't even realize you had gained.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose if we were higher-minded we would be confident enough
to rely on what our mirror tells us and ignore the opinion of
others. But not even a three-way mirror reveals everything. So, we
depend on a regular review from the outside. And then the outer
critic sets off the inner critic.
</P>
<P>
   I recently introduced myself to a stranger who looked me over
and declared that I was a lot thinner than my photograph. Well,
thanks, I said, automatically, and then wondered how a tiny little
mug shot at the top of a newspaper column could imply overweight,
underweight or any weight at all. Is it a thick chin, one big ear?
</P>
<P>
   Still, I was flattered and quietly told myself that had she said
the opposite, ``you look a lot fatter than your picture,'' I would
have walked around hugging friends until I found someone to say,
``You look GOOD.''
</P>
<P>
   Great is different. When someone says, ``You look GREAT,'' it is
getting closer to a true compliment. It means the haircut or the
new suit works or there's been a distinct improvement since last
week when you were down with the flu and your eyes hung off your
chin. Weight-wise, a ``great'' might indicate a whole size drop.
</P>
<P>
   If you are sensitive to these things you will want to know about
a marketing gimmick for a new diet pill. A woman I know was feeling
vulnerable _ probably having what I call a blubby day _ when she
received an envelope addressed to her and inside a newspaper
clipping talking about this great Asian remedy for losing weight.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing new there, but at the top of it, written in
ink, was a personal note saying something like, ``Judy. Try it. It
works.''
</P>
<P>
   What would you think if you were Judy, and feeling a bit
sensitive, and got that in the mail? Would you think, oh, just
another diet scheme? Or would you think, which friend out there
thinks I'm porking up and won't even sign her name?
</P>
<P>
   This woman had a couple hard days, stewing over who she knew who
could be so mean. Bravely, this woman confided in another woman,
maybe thinking she might tip her hand, but that woman reported that
she, too, had received the identical clipping in the mail with her
name on the top.
</P>
<P>
   I called the diet pill people and asked if they were sending
these out and a spokeswoman admitted they were and it was a very
successful campaign. She says it's called a ``personalized ad'' and
the names come off a mailing list. It has nothing to do with
anybody's size.
</P>
<P>
   The moral to this is: If your friend thinks you need to lose
weight, she'll infer it to you personally.

 &HT;    WALESA SAYS 'OVERWHELMING' NATO FORCE NEEDED FOR KOSOVO
 &HT;    With PHOTOS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nobel Peace Prize winner Lech Walesa, the legendary
leader of the anti-communist Solidarity movement who later served
as president of Poland, met Thursday with reporters and editors in
the Cox Washington Bureau. In an hour-long interview on the eve of
the NATO summit here, he talked through a translator about the
conflict in Kosovo. Excerpts:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you agree with NATO's air attacks against Yugoslavia, and
is there a diplomatic solution?
</P>
<P>
   A. I've already won a Nobel Peace Prize and I don't want to lose
it. It is obvious that I am against the use of any military force.
But, there are certain situations in which you don't see any other
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The present tactic adopted by NATO has resulted in the reverse
to what it was intended for (because it has resulted in the forced
exodus of ethnic Albanian refugees). This wasn't really what we
were aiming for.
</P>
<P>
   I think we must adopt a new strategy, ... We must disarm the
people participating in the conflict. Pour some cold water on them.
Make them calm down.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How could this be accomplished?
</P>
<P>
   A. By answering with an overwhelming (NATO) force. ... (Give
Yugoslavia's President Slobodan Milosevic) a deadline: ``If you do
not obey the deadline, we will use all the force available to
attack Yugoslavia. You cannot count on any mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   I also had another rough idea. All the (19) NATO members would
divide Yugoslavia into the number of regions that is equal to the
number of NATO members and each NATO member would be given the task
to put order in the particular region that he will have the
responsibility for.
</P>
<P>
   We would cut off all the supplies. And months later, after (Serb
forces) have really become hungry, we will put huge grills outside
the borders so that they will get all the smoke and all the flavor
and the fumes of the grill without giving them the food. And we
will trade: ``If you hand us the weapons, we will hand you the
sausage in return.'' This is a joke, of course. ... They are
serious issues, I know. But they can be dealt with by different
forms of strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you believe Milosevic should be tried as a war criminal?
</P>
<P>
   A. Whoever goes back to the Holocaust, whoever goes back to
genocide, whoever goes back to ethnic cleansing, is a criminal in
the new era. And there is no mercy on such people. ... (He) must be
brought to court because he constitutes a threat to progress and to
humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Should NATO have taken military action in Kosovo earlier than
it did?
</P>
<P>
   A. Poland cannot question the decisions of the (NATO)
commanders. We will remain faithful allies until the end. ... We
cannot afford for NATO to lose in this conflict. Defeat of NATO in
this conflict would cause a real problem in the world. We have to
win the victory here.
</P>
<P>
   Q. A Russian parliamentary leader said recently that relations
with the United States are the most dangerous they have been since
the Cuban missile crisis. How would Russia and the Slavic world
react if NATO ground forces go into Kosovo?
</P>
<P>
   A. Russia used to be an empire, but is now declining and
becoming a weaker and weaker empire. ... For centuries (it has
been) like this in Russia, that in order to be able to run the
country ... it has always needed a good outside enemy. They have
always had this concept of an outside enemy and that's what has
kept them together.
</P>
<P>
   Now I think they are trying to find an event, an outside enemy,
in order to be able to deal with their domestic problems. So if we
coolly look at things and reflect on them, we can understand their
viewpoint.

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.

<P>
   `ANALYZE THIS,' starring Robert De Niro, Billy Crystal, Lisa
Kudrow and Chazz Palminteri. Directed by Harold Ramis (R, 110
minutes). The title, concept and teaming of these co-stars are all
funny before the lights go down, so think of this comedy as an
offer you can't refuse. Cast as a mobster whose confidence is
shaken, De Niro is hilarious simply by playing his role halfway
straight, in classic goodfella style. His mobster finds just the
right comic foil in Billy Crystal, as the psychiatrist who utters
the immortal: ``When I got into family therapy, this wasn't the
family I had in mind.'' There's a lot more where that came from in
this breezy comic treat (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `CENTRAL STATION,' starring Fernanda Montenegro, Vinicius de
Oliveira and Marilia Pera. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 115
minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless older
woman crosses paths with an orphaned boy. There's plenty of room
for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Salles' film is all in
the telling. As these characters develop a fractious bond, then
embark on a road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's
hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Salles brings great
tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate their journey.
Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance was one of last year's
very best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `COOKIE'S FORTUNE,' starring Charles S. Dutton, Glenn Close,
Patricia Neal, Julianne Moore and Liv Tyler. Directed by Robert
Altman (PG-13, 118 minutes). What a treat. The sweet assurance and
guerrilla wit of Altman's vintage ensemble films make a copacetic
return with a Southern small-town black comedy. Seamlessly made and
completely enveloping, it tells of the machinations set off when a
wealthy old woman (Ms. Neal) outrages her diabolically genteel
niece (Ms. Close) by committing suicide. As the old woman's dearest
friend and the niece's unwitting nemesis, Dutton is rock solid and
appealing. The entire cast works on a single wavelength as Altman
makes the most of a well-woven screenplay by Anne Rapp (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS,' starring Elodie Bouchez and Natacha
Regnier. Directed by Erick Zonca (R, 113 minutes; in French with
English subtitles). In this very special French film about two
freewheeling young women, their turbulent friendship is frayed by
sexual passion and economic realities. The weaker and more
head-turning of the women (Ms. Regnier) falls for the advances of a
rich nightclub owner, while her fiery friend, played with
unforgettable immediacy by Ms. Bouchez, rages against what she
views as imminent disaster. In the process, Zonca shows astonishing
acuity in observing how the women's diverging values affect every
aspect of their lives. A rare and wrenching drama (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `EDTV,' starring Matthew McConaughey, Ellen DeGeneres, Woody
Harrelson, Martin Landau, Jenna Elfman and Rob Reiner. Directed by
Ron Howard (PG-13, 120 minutes). In this good-humored, deceptively
easygoing satire, Howard holds up a fun-house mirror to a world
ruled by voyeurism and specious fame. The subject matter is
familiar by now, but this film about a Trumanesque nobody as
24-hour-a-day television star has a shrewd way of drawing the
audience into its web. Permeated by all the crassness and absurdity
inherent in celebrity-mad culture, and by our collective obsession
with snoopy trivia, it features a fine ensemble cast and a
dependably jokey screenplay by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel. It
helps that most of the principals, in a cast that also includes
Elizabeth Hurley, have played this game for real and act their
roles with a comic vengeance (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ELIZABETH,' the Oscar winner for best makeup. Starring Cate
Blanchett, Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey Rush and Christopher Eccleston.
Directed by Shekhar Kapur (R, 124 minutes). In this lurid costume
drama depicting Elizabeth I as a royal rookie, the impressive Ms.
Blanchett plays the queen as if her principal responsibilities were
being bejeweled, selecting consorts and saying ``Leave us!'' with a
wave of the hand. For all its putative concern with Roman
Catholic-Protestant strife at the start of Elizabeth's reign, this
is historical drama for those whose idea of history is back issues
of Vogue. Intent on spectacle, complete with burning at the stake
and one dance scene reminiscent of ``Saturday Night Fever,'' it
winds up imagining the Queen as a glamorously stressed-out modern
woman afflicted by a super-intense case of having it all (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `GO,' starring Sarah Polley, Katie Holmes, Timothy Olyphant,
Taye Diggs, William Fichtner, Scott Wolf and Jay Mohr. Directed by
Doug Liman (R, 100 minutes). This three-episode demimondaine comedy
borrows truckloads of inspiration from ``Pulp Fiction'' but still
has some flash and personality of its own. Liman, who shot the film
as well as directed it, uses a supermarket as ground zero and sends
a sullen cashier (Ms. Polley) out to make a drug deal. Then he
embellishes this situation fully enough to send his film down the
rabbit hole into neo-Tarantino adventures, some of which (guys go
to Las Vegas, then get into trouble with strippers, gunplay, car
theft and a brake-screeching chase) are a lot more tired than
others. The ensemble cast shows cool comic flair (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `GODS AND MONSTERS,' the Oscar winner for best adapted
screenplay. Starring Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser. Directed by
Bill Condon (not rated, 105 minutes). In a performance that well
deserves to be remembered, McKellen becomes the deliciously urbane
James Whale, depicting the gay ``Frankenstein'' director late in
life. Shaken by the aftereffects of a mild stroke, this Whale finds
his past coming back to greet him just as the present offers new
fascination in the Adonis-like form of the gardener ( Fraser, also
fine), whom Whale finds mowing his lawn. This beautifully acted,
witty and heart-tugging film, from a Christopher Bram book,
imagines what Whale's final days might have been like while shaping
a splendid character study and a droll portrait of closeted gay
Hollywood. Lynn Redgrave provides ballast and comic relief as
Whale's perpetually scandalized housekeeper (Maslin).

<P>
   `HIDEOUS KINKY,' starring Kate Winslet. Directed by Gillies
MacKinnon (R, 99 minutes). Ms. Winslet knew best when she took on
this offbeat, richly atmospheric adventure in the wake of
``Titanic.'' The leading role in MacKinnon's vividly colorful film
offers her a field day. She plays a young hippie mother who brings
her reluctant English daughters to Marrakech, circa 1972. The film,
about the mother's willfulness, the girls' reaction and the sheer
headiness of their surroundings, belongs to the striking subgenre
in which it is baby-boom adults, not their children, who most need
to come of age (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `LIFE,' starring Eddie Murphy, Martin Lawrence, Rick James and
Ned Beatty. Directed by Ted Demme (R, 105 minutes). Though it's
hard to miss the basic unfunniness of seeing two black men
sentenced to life at a Mississippi state prison, this mild-mannered
comedy is more likable than it sounds. If it awkwardly straddles
the line between period piece (it begins during Prohibition) and
comedy, it also keeps the stars kidding their way from youth to
curmudgeonhood. Murphy in particular gives a more substantial
performance than might be expected here. Stick around for closing
out-takes that show (for instance) a cell phone ringing during a
scene set in 1932 (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE MATRIX,' starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and
Carrie-Anne Moss. Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski (R, 120
minutes). The time-traveling story steeped in virtual reality will
be all but incomprehensible to nontechnofreaks. And the film
borrows unapologetically from other sci-fi extravaganzas, with a
big debt to ``The X-Files'' in the paranoia department. But the
storytelling is intricately bizarre and the special effects are
indeed special, notably when it comes to midair martial arts with a
gravity-defying gusto. And Reeves shows that you can look like a
Prada model while behaving like an action hero. One of the main
stars here is Bill Pope, an inventive cinematographer. He and the
Wachowskis provide a couch-potato epiphany: while the characters
seem to be performing marvelous feats, they're often lying
stock-still in the grip of virtual reality (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE' (the Oscar winner for best film, best
original screenplay, best art direction, best costumes and best
comedy score). Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow (the
best-actress winner), Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench
(best supporting actress). Directed by John Madden (R, 113
minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate delight, with an
exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets better as the film
unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm
and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of
his ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,'' dares to imagine
whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic
passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty.
Meanwhile, this tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an
Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving
we enjoy today and has great fun presenting the creation of ``Romeo
and Juliet,'' glitches and all. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a
fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully
realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `SLC PUNK!,' starring Matthew Lillard and Michael Goorjian.
Directed by James Merendino (R, 97 minutes). Maybe only real
experience as an alienated teen-ager in Salt Lake City in 1985
could have led a filmmaker to such a (perhaps deservedly)
overlooked time and place. But Merendino supplies enough absurdist
humor to make sense of the setting. His film follows Stevo
(Lillard), the kind of anarchist who likes making rules, and whose
rebel streak is about as authentic as his blue hair. As the rare
punk who may be headed for Harvard Law School without even trying,
Stevo is glib but entertaining. For all the film's appealing
outlandishness, it's finally as mainstream as its hero proves to be
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `A WALK ON THE MOON,' starring Diane Lane, Viggo Mortensen, Liev
Schreiber, Tovah Feldshuh and Anna Paquin. Directed by Tony Goldwyn
(R, 107 minutes). This evocative 1969 period piece, set on the
brink of Woodstock in a Catskills holiday camp, is as seductive as
the handsome, itinerant hippie who turns its heroine's life upside
down. Thoughtfully conceived and movingly acted, it sweeps a
housewife and mother named Pearl Kantrowitz (Ms. Lane) into a
torrid extramarital romance and then weighs the consequences. With
a tenderness that's unusual for a contemporary American film, it
tells an enveloping tale enhanced by artfully selected
Woodstock-era music. Mortensen may strain credulity as the foxiest
blouse salesman in the Catskills, but he certainly does wonders for
the movie (Maslin).

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Consensus and the luxury of retrospect

can ``great'' also be used to describe art and artists of our
times? Is it simply too soon to say? Is any opinion on the topic

LEIBOWITZ-COLUMN (Littleton, Colo.) - The snow fell all through
Thursday morning, smudging the ink of a thousand scrawled messages,
bending the roses and the carnations beneath its weight. Slush
covered a family of teddy bears. Footprints tracked every which
way. By mid-morning, the park bordering Columbine High School felt
shrouded, even more obscured. As the story of the school does with
each passing day. By DAVID LEIBOWITZ. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BROTHER-SCHOOL (Phoenix) - The brother of an Arizona Cardinals
player is a teacher at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. He
knew and tought since junior high the two kids responsible for the
killings. His classroom is next door to the library so he knows
exactly where things happened when people describle them. The good
news for him is that he is on a monthlong sabbatical. By STEVE
SCHOENFELD. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
OUTCASTS-SCHOOL (Phoenix) - They're the kids whom the athletes, the
popular kids, don't want to deal with and sometimes taunt. Who are
these kids, what do they have to deal with? By JULIE AMPARANO.
Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
KELLY-SCHOOL (Phoenix) - Kelly Fleming was an aspiring songwriter
and author who wrote scores of poems and short stories based on her
life experiences. She was well-liked by teachers and friends at
Desert Sky Middle School in Phoenix before she moved to Littleton
18 months ago. On Thursday she was being eulogized, one of the
vicitims in the Littleton massacre. By LORI BAKER and BRENT
WHITING. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
KIDSGUNS-SCHOOL (Phoenix) - After the mayhem, there is always
hand-wringing. People want to know what went wrong in Littleton,
Colo., or Phoenix, Ariz. What could have been done to prevent the
slaughter of 12 students and a teacher by teenage outcasts, or the
killing of a cop by a 17-year-old gangbanger? One of the answers,
invariably, has to do with guns. How do kids get them? Would
tougher gun-control laws make a differnce? Do guns kill people, or
boys? The argument, as bloody rhetorical as a shootout, ricochets
from the NRA to Handgun Control Inc., from barber shops to talk
shows. By DENNIS WAGNER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
ARM-SCHOOL (Phoenix) - We find out how easy it is for law-abiding
citizens orbad guys to buy high-powered weaponry, explosives, body
armor, etc. inthe Phoenix area. By WILLIAM HERMANN. Story will move
in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SUMMER-MUSIC (Phoenix) - In December, singer and sometime actress
Cree Summer opened for Lenny Kravitz on his European tour. In many
ways, she considers it one of the most terrifying experiences in
her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lights would go black,'' Summer recalls, on the phone from
her home in the Hollywood Hills. ``Like 15,000 people in the
audience think Lenny is coming out. Then here I come, and everybody
is like, `Who the (expletive) is that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   History probably won't repeat itself in Phoenix next week, when
Summer does the honors again for the recent Grammy winner. By RANDY
CORDOVA. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
GENERAL-MOVIE (Phoenix) A small Irish working-class film buried
under all the technical glitz and glamor of a Hollywood epic, John
Boorman's look at famous Dublin criminal Martin Cahill is overlong,
way too pretty and ultimately aimless, despite some excellent
acting by Brendan Gleeson (Braveheart) and Jon Voight. 3 stars. By
RICHARD NILSEN. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
PUSHING-MOVIE (Phoenix) - John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton are
rival air traffic controllers in a comic-drama about how the air
traffic control system is out of control because the control freaks
running it are too apt to crack under the stress. Good point, but
the movie plays like a magazine article, neither dramatic nor comic
enough to make a good movie. 2 stars. By BOB FENSTER. Story moved
in the ``E' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
EXISTENZ-MOVIE (Phoenix) - An action/adventure thriller in which
Jennifer Jason Leigh stars as a computer programmer who creates a
virtual-reality game that taps into theplayers' minds. 2 stars. By
BOB FENSTER. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
AUTO-REVIEW (Phoenix) - The Corvette hardtop is a lighter, tighter,
racier and marginally cheaper version of Chevrolet's brawny sports
car. It's a sportier version, compared with the coupe and
convertible, but its power accessories, comfort features and most
of the price tag remain intact. It's tuned in to drivers primarily
interested in performance, and is available only with a six-speed
stick shift, beefier suspension and a limited-slip differential. By
BOB GOLFEN. Story moved in the ``L'' category. EMBARGOED FOR
SATURDAY, APRIL 24. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana vowed Thursday to escalate allied attacks against sites
frequented by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.

   On the eve of the western alliance's three-day summit here,
Clinton and Solana underscored NATO's determination to step up the
bombing. They spoke after a meeting that set the stage for the
summit that will include not only leaders of the 19 nations in the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization but also officials from 23 other
countries associated with it.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders, initially planning to celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the alliance that was forged at the start of the
Cold War, are now assessing the effectiveness of NATO's first
military operation against a sovereign country. And they are
weighing a possible invasion of Kosovo by allied ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Thursday that it was ``wise and prudent'' for the
alliance to update its six-month-old plan to invade Yugoslavia. The
original plan foresaw an invasion force of up to 200,000 ground
troops, including 75,000 sent into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Solana ordered the update on Wednesday before leaving Brussels
for the summit. Clinton said the update did not signal a decision
to send allied ground forces into Kosovo but was a way of getting
ready to do so if such a decision is made.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton faces growing allied pressure from Britain and France _
as well as some in the United States _ to consider using ground
troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The president said allied attacks that began March 24 will
continue until Milosevic orders Yugoslav forces out of Kosovo, the
1.4 million uprooted ethnic Albanian Kosvars are permitted to
return to their homes, an international security force enters
Kosovo and ethnic Albanians are free to pursue self-government in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Milosevic can accept this outcome or he can watch as NATO
grinds down his war machine and the Serb people he claims to
represent face mounting hardship,'' Clinton declared.
</P>
<P>
   The president pointedly noted that allied attacks since Tuesday
night have targeted a home used by Milosevic and his Serbian
Socialist Party headquarters. Clinton insisted that the attacks are
not targeting Milosevic personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this conflict it would be wrong and unfair not to target
the command and control operations,'' Clinton said, including the
home and the party headquarters in that category. He added that
allied attacks are increasingly focusing on Yugoslav ``facilities
used to incite and direct'' ethnic repression in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Solana, the Spanish diplomat who serves as the chief executive
of the NATO alliance, echoed Clinton's resolve.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance will use the summit to ``signal our determination
to intensify the political and military pressure on Belgrade until
our goals are met,'' Solana said. ``We have the means and we have
the will.''
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said during a meeting with
senators on Capitol Hill that ``we shall remain with this action
and intensify it until we see it through.''
</P>
<P>
   The three leaders spoke as first reports reached the White House
of a possible diplomatic gesture in Belgrade. Former Russian
Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin emerged from a day-long meeting with
Milosevic to report that the Serbian leader had accepted the
concept of a United Nations-controlled ``international presence''
in Kosovo in return for NATO halting the bombing campaign and the
alliance withdrawing troops from Yugoslavia's borders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seemed warily receptive to the development.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is an offer for a genuine security force, that's the
first time that Mr. Milosevic has ever done that, and that
represents, I suppose, some step forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has shied away from dubbing Milosevic a war
criminal, reiterated that the United States would accept the
Serbian dictator remaining in power if he agreed to allied
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he meets those conditions, and the Serbian people are
willing to continue him in power, then I could imagine such an
outcome,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the United States nor NATO has insisted that Milosevic
step down in order to reach an agreement, Clinton noted.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger conceded that
the gathering of allied leaders had become a de facto council of
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had planned a summit that focused a bit on the past and a
great deal on the future,'' Berger said, adding that the summit had
become ``a working meeting of a military alliance in the middle of
a conflict.''

</P>
<P>
   A poll released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center for the
People and the Press found that nearly two thirds of Americans
believe that ground troops will be needed to resolve the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number _ 66 percent _ are worried the fight over
Kosovo will cause U.S. casualties. The figure has risen by 10
percentage points in the past month.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the summit would be the largest gathering of
foreign dignitaries ever in the nation's capital _ surpassing even
the number attending President John F. Kennedy's funeral in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO summit was to have been a triumphant weekend of
diplomatic pomp, glass-clinking and banquets of roasted lamb marked
with speeches commemorating NATO successes.
</P>
<P>
   With tulips, dogwoods and azaleas exploding in hues of pink, red
and white across the city, a planned highlight was to have been the
welcoming of Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, the three new
NATO members that once were aligned with the Soviet Union, the
alliance's vanquished foe.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the gathering takes place in a tense capital blanketed
with heavy security, and the festivities have been recast into more
serious discussions as the alliance confronted the crisis in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Washington braced for limousine gridlock and tight restrictions
in a 100-block downtown security zone, including much of the
National Mall. City schools were to be closed Friday and thousands
of federal workers were given the day off.
</P>
<P>
   NATO leaders are scheduled to hold a three-hour meeting on
Kosovo Friday morning at the Ronald Reagan International Trade
Center, next to the Andrew Mellon Auditorium, where the original
NATO treaty was signed 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, five blocks east of the White House, is to be
attended by the leaders of the 19 NATO countries and military
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are concerned that strains may develop within the
alliance as the war effort drags into a second month and NATO
presses ahead with plans for a ground war, a naval blockade of
Yugoslavia or increased economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Italy and Greece have expressed concern over a U.S. suggestion
to blockade Yugoslavia and step up sanctions to deny Milosevic the
ability to resupply and refuel his military forces.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to decisions on Kosovo, the NATO leaders are
expected to revamp the mission of the military alliance, originally
geared to defend against a Soviet attack.
</P>
<P>
   A new ``strategic concept'' is expected to be adopted, laying
out broad guidelines for dispatching NATO troops around Europe to
areas like Kosovo or Bosnia that threaten stability in the region.

 &HT;    STUDENTS ADVISE CLINTON ON SCHOOL VIOLENCE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ High school students gave President Clinton an
earful Thursday on what adults should do to avert tragedies like
the one in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting down with 30 students at a Virginia suburban high
school, the president conceded that many of the solutions were
``beyond anything government can do.'' A recent White House
conference on violence in schools plus more federal aid for school
counselors and security has not halted the violence, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rampage that resulted in 15 deaths at Littleton's Columbine
High School on Tuesday was the seventh such incident since a
student killed his mother and then nine schoolmates in Pearl,
Miss., 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   In his first extended response to the horror in Colorado,
Clinton visited T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria. A school
of some 2,000 students representing dozens of nationalities and
diverse racial groups, Williams has a large staff of counselors,
plus a hotline for students to report trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Several told Clinton that if violence could erupt at a place
like Littleton, it could anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know, when is the government -- when are you --
going to do something for the other students out there?'' Jonelle
Mitchell, a senior, asked the president.
</P>
<P>
   She praised her school for a system in which students mediate
conflicts among their peers. But she said that other schools
``don't have the resources that we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Other students pointed to families as the root of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that what we're missing are morals,'' Sindy (cq)
Benavides said. ``Mr. President, I think that one thing that my
parents taught me is that, like a tree, you form it when it's
little, and how you form it when it's little, it comes up right.''
</P>
<P>
   One student, John Chuico, asked how it is that information about
how to build bombs is freely published on the Internet. ``What is
our government doing to prevent this ...dangerous information, you
know, so that they don't make bombs and they don't blow people up
and they don't hurt people?''
</P>
<P>
   Another pointed to the murder and mayhem depicted in movies and
in video games.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who spent much of the hourlong discussion
listening, acknowledged that ``we do have more violence among
younger people in America than other cultures.'' He added that
``everyone has to take a hard look at what all the elements of our
society are that contribute to that and what we can do to diminish
it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he called curbs on the Internet too difficult to
administer and chose not to criticize the entertainment industry.
``I don't want to blame the movies or blame the video games,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who only recently emerged from an impeachment battle
involving his relationship with a former White House intern, ducked
the invitation to discuss morality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with that,'' he told the student who called for
parents to stress morals. ``But what happens if all of that still
doesn't work because young people at some point develop a whole
other life? `` the president asked. He said he preferred to stress
the need for ``early warning'' systems, such as school hotlines,
for reporting potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also related the problems of schoolyard taunts and
ridicule to his own experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in what I do and the people I deal with, it's amazing how
much energy is lost and how many things are not done for America
because people in Washington, D.C., at the highest levels of power
and influence, get hurt by what other people say about them --
mean, bad things other people say about them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the president, whose own tirades have been chronicled
by former aides, said he hoped that the students would follow the
T.C. Williams practice of working out their disputes by discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be amazed how many people my age, in very responsible
positions, still can't manage their anger because they never
learned to have a constructive way to talk about it,'' the
president said.

   NATO-CREATION (Washington) _ The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, whose 50th anniversary will be ceremonially
commemorated by the leaders of its 19 member nations here this
weekend, was the brainchild of a portly, rough-hewn former trade
union leader with a grade-school education, the illegitimate son of
a serving-girl. His name was Ernest Bevin, and he was Britain's
foreign secretary. R.W. Apple talks to some of those who were

   KOSOVO-PENTAGON (Washington) _ A month into NATO's war against
Yugoslavia, American cruise missiles destroyed one of President
Slobodan Milosevic's official residences in Belgrade early Thursday
in a direct strike at the core of Milosevic's power. The Pentagon
warned that more attacks were coming. Yugoslavia denounced the
strike as an assassination attempt, while American and NATO
officials denied their intent was to kill Milosevic. They defended
the target as a legitimate attack on the military leadership of
Yugoslavia, if not him directly, effectively a distinction without
a difference. By Steven Lee Myers.

accomplish much. What's needed to have a force ready by July or

signing basing agreements, starting to move equipment. And if NATO
waits much longer it could miss any chance of having a force able
to go in before winter. By Michael R. Gordon.

Vietnam war he had served in. Max Cleland, a young Army captain
lost his legs and an arm when he reached for a loose grenade that
exploded. Chuck Hagel, an Army sergeant, fought and was wounded
alongside his brother. John McCain, a navy pilot, was shot down,
imprisoned and tortured in Hanoi. Now as Congress grapples with
Kosovo, and Vietnam-era words and phrases like ''quagmire' and
''fighting with one hand tied behind the back'' resonate once
again, these Vietnam combat veterans in the Senate and two more _
Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Charles S. Robb of Virginia _ speak with
the special authority of experience. But the vexing questions of
this war have pulled them in different directions. By Alison

 &HT;    STUDENTS ADVISE CLINTON ON SCHOOL VIOLENCE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ High school students gave President Clinton an
earful Thursday on what adults should do to avert tragedies like
the one in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting down with 30 students at a Virginia suburban high
school, the president conceded that many of the solutions were
``beyond anything government can do.'' A recent White House
conference on violence in schools plus more federal aid for school
counselors and security has not halted the violence, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rampage that resulted in 15 deaths at Littleton's Columbine
High School on Tuesday was the seventh such incident since a
student killed his mother and then nine schoolmates in Pearl,
Miss., 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   In his first extended response to the horror in Colorado,
Clinton visited T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria. A school
of some 2,000 students representing dozens of nationalities and
diverse racial groups, Williams has a large staff of counselors,
plus a hotline for students to report trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Several told Clinton that if violence could erupt at a place
like Littleton, it could anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know, when is the government -- when are you --
going to do something for the other students out there?'' Jonelle
Mitchell, a senior, asked the president.
</P>
<P>
   She praised her school for a system in which students mediate
conflicts among their peers. But she said that other schools
``don't have the resources that we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Other students pointed to families as the root of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that what we're missing are morals,'' Sindy (cq)
Benavides said. ``Mr. President, I think that one thing that my
parents taught me is that, like a tree, you form it when it's
little, and how you form it when it's little, it comes up right.''
</P>
<P>
   One student, John Chuico, asked how it is that information about
how to build bombs is freely published on the Internet. ``What is
our government doing to prevent this ...dangerous information, you
know, so that they don't make bombs and they don't blow people up
and they don't hurt people?''
</P>
<P>
   Another pointed to the murder and mayhem depicted in movies and
in video games.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who spent much of the hourlong discussion
listening, acknowledged that ``we do have more violence among
younger people in America than other cultures.'' He added that
``everyone has to take a hard look at what all the elements of our
society are that contribute to that and what we can do to diminish
it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he called curbs on the Internet too difficult to
administer and chose not to criticize the entertainment industry.
``I don't want to blame the movies or blame the video games,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who only recently emerged from an impeachment battle
involving his relationship with a former White House intern, ducked
the invitation to discuss morality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with that,'' he told the student who called for
parents to stress morals. ``But what happens if all of that still
doesn't work because young people at some point develop a whole
other life? `` the president asked. He said he preferred to stress
the need for ``early warning'' systems, such as school hotlines,
for reporting potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also related the problems of schoolyard taunts and
ridicule to his own experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in what I do and the people I deal with, it's amazing how
much energy is lost and how many things are not done for America
because people in Washington, D.C., at the highest levels of power
and influence, get hurt by what other people say about them --
mean, bad things other people say about them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the president, whose own tirades have been chronicled
by former aides, said he hoped that the students would follow the
T.C. Williams practice of working out their disputes by discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be amazed how many people my age, in very responsible
positions, still can't manage their anger because they never
learned to have a constructive way to talk about it,'' the
president said.

 &HT;    ARMY SOLDIER REFLECTS ON THE COMING BATTLE: ``IT'S NOT A NICE
THING''
 &HT;    EDs: AP Photo of Hoover is available.
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RINAS AIR FIELD, Albania _ As he prepares to launch the U.S.
Army's most lethal anti-personnel rockets into Kosovo, Staff
Sergeant Robert Hoover sometimes thinks about the Serb soldiers in
his target zone.
</P>
<P>
   And about the ethnic Albanian refugees in Kosovo that the Serbs
might be holding as human shields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes sir, it's not a nice thing,'' said Hoover, 29, of Twin
Falls, Idaho, the fire direction chief for an MLRS (Multiple Rocket
Launch System) mobile launcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have confidence that the right people above me will make
the right decisions,'' said Hoover, who fights his battles from a
computer terminal inside the cab of his launcher.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover belongs to Charley Battery, 1/27 Field Artillery that
flew in about four days ago from Badenhausen, Germany. His launcher
is a big green military truck with what looks like a giant
cigarette pack resting on the flat bed. Inside the box are six
rockets, each about 13 feet long without their warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Charley Battery's job here is to serve as the remote-control
bodyguards for the slow-flying 24 Apache helicopter gunships when
they start attacking Serb tanks and guns -- which could begin
within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Apaches are easy to spot on enemy radar. If the American
commanders get intelligence of a Serb anti-aircraft crew getting
ready to shoot down an Apache, it will be Charley Battery's
responsibility to ``suppress'' those Serbs before they can get off
a fatal shot.
</P>
<P>
   In case anyone needs a translation of the military verb ``to
suppress,'' it means anything from scaring their pants off to
blowing them into little pieces. With an MLRS, it's likely to be
the latter.
</P>
<P>
   To Charley Battery, it really doesn't matter, so long as the
Apache and its two-man crew flies back to this base unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, Charley Battery has been practicing to
help protect the first attacks of the Apaches on Serb tanks,
artillery guns and troops concentrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rehearse battle drills of what our assigned mission will
be,'' explained Charley Battery's executive officer, 1st Lt.
Cecilio Coleman, 31, of Virginia Beach, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Based on how MLRS mobile launchers functioned during the Gulf
War, the launcher crew moves almost at the last minute to a forward
firing position. That's where Charley Battery will await a radioed
``fire mission'' from an operations officer somewhere at a battle
headquarters in the rear. The crew takes a reading on a Global
Positioning System (GPS) satellite to set its firing position.
</P>
<P>
   It may be only a few minutes before the ``fire mission'' is
ordered. Once this happens, crew members including Hoover will
punch in the coordinates of the target and adjust the altitude of
the desired blast.
</P>
<P>
   But there will also be hours of tedium when the battle is
unfolding and the command center cannot identify any targets for
the MLRS. ``We take every possible precaution to minimize any
collateral damage,'' said Capt. Martin Downie, a U.S. Army
spokesman for ``Task Force Hawk'' commander, Lt. Gen. John Hendrix
.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the shots fired by the 1/27 Field Artillery in the first
few days of Apache attacks are likely to be MLRS rockets. During
the Gulf War, these fired at targets out to about 30 miles.
</P>
<P>
   For targets further out, the MLRS units here are also capable of
firing a longer-range and more accurate weapon called the Army
Tactical Missile System, known by its phonetic acronym
``Attack-Ems.'' The latest version of ``Attack-Ems'' is a guided
missile that carries 950 cluster bomblets and shoots out to a range
of more than 180 miles.
</P>
<P>
   By putting Hoover and Coleman on display for a hoard of media,
the Army was increasing the psychological pressure on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic's frontline soldiers and officers.
Army officers said privately that they believe that Milosevic and
many in the top military command are regular followers of CNN, BBC
and other Western news outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Especially since Wednesday's neatly choreographed arrival of the
first Appache helicopters, the U.S. military appears to be stepping
up its psychological warfare campaign to soften up the crews of
Serb air defenses. This parallels what happened before the start of
the ground war in the Gulf, when the U.S. forces dropped leaflets
over front-line troops that helped to encourage mass surrenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some of the best equipment in the world, and the best
people,'' said Hoover, one of a half-dozen soldiers chosen by
senior commanders to present the human face of ``Task Force Hawk''
strike force to journalists. ``We come here to do a mission, and
we're going to do it to the best of our ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are capable of firing any time,'' said Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   (Cox Newspapers Foreign correspondent Joseph Albright was a pool
correspondent with an Army MLRS unit during Operation Desert Storm
in Iraq in 1991.)

UNH'S BOWES RETIRES; MCDONNELL NAMED TO POST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.H. _ It started with a 16-14 win over Boston
University Sept. 23, 1972, and it ended Nov. 14 with a 9-7 win over
Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   University of New Hampshire football coach Bill Bowes called it
quits Thursday after 27 years at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   At a Whittemore Center press conference announcing his
retirement, athletic director Judy Ray also announced that
offensive coordinator Sean McDonnell was the new head coach.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell, 43, played defensive back under Bowes and graduated
in 1978. He has been an assistant at Hamilton College, Boston
University, Boston College and Columbia, and returned to UNH as an
assistant in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Bowes said he long ago set a goal for himself: if he could
afford to do it, he would retire at age 55. Thanks to UNH's
retirement plan, Bowes said, he could afford it and now plans to
spend much more time with his family and pursuing interests such as
golf and fishing than being a football coach allows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked my tail off all my life and I turned 55 and I want to
be able to smell the roses a little bit,'' Bowes said. ``That's
something I always patterned my life around. When I got to that
certain age, I was going to slow down and that's one thing you
can't do in this profession, you can't slow down. It's not fair to
the school or to the program.''
</P>
<P>
   He told Ray and president Joan Leitzel of his plans last summer,
turned 55 in October, and went through the recruiting season and
the start of spring practice to make sure of his decision.
</P>
<P>
   He has no doubt it's the right move, he said Thursday. He told
his team of his decision Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Bowes played tight end at Penn State and graduated in 1965.
After a year as a graduate assistant at Penn State, he spent two
years as an assistant coach under Joe Yukica and then moved with
him to Boston College. Bowes returned to Durham in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats went 4-5 in each of his first two seasons and then
posted a winning record in 21 of the next 23 seasons. Two years
ago, UNH was 5-6 and last year the Wildcats were 4-7.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, UNH was 176-106-5 under Bowes. His teams contended, and
contended well, without the financial resources and facilities of
many of its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't bothered that he is going out on a couple of teams with
losing records, Bowes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never considered myself as one who had a huge ego,'' Bowes
said. ``If I had a huge ego, I might have considered that. Last
year our record wasn't the greatest, but I don't think we were a
bad football team. We came within 1 point of UMass and they won the
national championship. In spite of the record, it was an exciting
year with Jerry Azumah and what not. I'm not going to leave the job
with any remorse. I had enough winning seasons over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray called it a ``happy/sad'' day. She was happy for Bowes, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I struggled through the meeting with the students this
morning,'' Ray said. ``It got harder with the coaches. He's just
such a wonderful person. People wouldn't agree all the time, but
like Sean says, he's tough and he's not approachable some times.
But when you look at all his qualities, it makes it real difficult
to have those qualities leave the institution. It's tough.''

PORTUGAL THROWS MASTERPIECE, BUT SOX FALL, 1-0 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The Red Sox may not hit, but at least they're quick
about it.
</P>
<P>
   In nearly less time than it took manager Jimy Williams to
concoct a lineup in which the occupants of slots 3 through 9 had no
home runs this season, the Red Sox fell, 1-0, to the Detroit Tigers
and lefthander Justin Thompson, who got last-inning help from
Tigers closer Todd Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of the game _ 1 hour 49 minutes, the shortest Sox game
in at least two decades, according to the Elias Bureau statmen,
whose records on such matters only go back to 1981 _ was tribute,
too, to the exquisite pitching of Sox starter Mark Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal set down 19 straight Tiger batters, only to throw a
first-pitch fastball to Dartmouth's Brad Ausmus that Ausmus drove
over the right-field wall in Tiger Stadium with two outs in the
eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just try to make sure you don't make a mistake to beat
you,'' said Portugal, a loser for the first time in three starts
despite giving up just three hits and no walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``With two outs, I thought Ausmus would take a pitch. I tried to
get ahead of him. I was trying to keep him in the big part of the
ballpark, so I threw him a fastball away, but he went out and hit
the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this park has a history of being friendly to balls hit
over the right-field fence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox initiated little action hostile to Thompson, who had
a no-hitter until Damon Buford beat out a ball that he topped in
front of the plate to start the fifth. Thompson didn't allow
another hit until Donnie Sadler hit a ball off his fists into right
field for a bloop single to open the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Tigers manager Larry Parrish went to the bullpen for Jones.
Williams, whose 13th different lineup in 15 games was an
all-righthanded affair featuring Lou Merloni at first, Sadler in
left, and Creighton Gubanich making his big-league debut behind the
plate, countered with Reggie Jefferson to bat for Darren Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson hit a smash, but right at shortstop Deivi Cruz, who
turned a double play, and Jose Offerman tapped out to second to end
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit it hard, but as soon as I looked up, I saw it was right
at him,'' Jefferson said. ``Four feet either way, and he has no
chance for it. But he got to him so quick, I could see I had no
chance. That's what happens when you can't get a break.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox sent only 28 batters to the plate Thursday, one over the
minimum. Mike Stanley, who went hitless in two at-bats and is now 0
for 18, walked to start the second, but the next two batters,
Buford and Merloni, struck out, and Gubanich popped to second.
</P>
<P>
   Gubanich hit into a double play to erase Buford in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   No Red Sox runner advanced as far as second base on a cool, damp
day conducive to pitching, especially with the wind blowing in.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, it seems, it could be 85 degrees with gale-force
winds blowing out from home plate, and the Sox still wouldn't hit.
After opening the season with four straight games of 10 or more
hits, the Sox have reached double digits just once in the last 11
games, and are batting .205 in that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has grown progressively worse. They scored three
runs in three games here, winning only by a 1-0 score Tuesday night
behind Pedro Martinez. They've scored two or fewer runs in seven of
their last eight games, a stretch in which they've gone 2-6 and
batted a collective .197. Only three times in those games have they
had as many as two consecutive hits in an inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling thunder, they're not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that in the time I've been here, this has never
happened,'' said Jefferson, who has been with the team since 1995
and couldn't recall a time when essentially everyone stopped
hitting at the same time. ``It's odd, too, because we have some
pretty sound hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, we're definitely not going to be the '27 Yankees, but
we shouldn't be scuffling this bad.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a name for such a phenomenon: It's called the no-Mo
effect. Take away Vaughn, the team's only legitimate slugger _
Nomar Garciaparra hits home runs, but he's not your prototypical
basher _ and there's a ripple effect that hasn't taken long to
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra has two singles in his last 13 at-bats. John
Valentin didn't have a hit in 10 at-bats in Detroit, and is 0 for
his last 15 overall. The rookie, Trot Nixon, is buried on the bench
with an 0 for 21 hanging on him. Stanley has two RBIs in his last
11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Nixon, these are all proven hitters. None of them are
seeing much to hit these days. There's no Vaughn in the heart of
the lineup to keep pitchers honest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we look at it as though we're in a funk,''
Valentin said. ``I think the way our team is set up, we're going to
be pitched differently. Knowing that, we still are professionals,
we still have to hit the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know what these guys feel, but from my
perspective, I think we're going to hit. But this is a different
team this year. We're going to have a lot of battles like this.
We've got more young guys playing. This is a new experience for
them. We're asking them to hit, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Give it time, Portugal said bravely, the hitting will come.

   WASHINGTON _ A month into NATO's war against Yugoslavia, U.S.
cruise missiles destroyed one of President Slobodan Milosevic's
official residences in Belgrade, and the Pentagon and NATO vowed to
launch more attacks at the core of his power and control.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia denounced the strike as an assassination attempt, but
U.S. and NATO officials denied that the attack was a deliberate
attempt to kill Milosevic. They defended the target as a legitimate
assault on the military leadership of Yugoslavia, though not on him
directly, effectively a distinction without a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at the White House with NATO's secretary general,
Javier Solana, on the eve of NATO's 50th anniversary summit,
President Clinton said the alliance had an obligation to pursue the
power structure that Milosevic uses to command the forces that have
driven hundreds of thousands of Albanians from the province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this conflict,'' the president said, ``it would be wrong
and unfair not to target the command and control operations as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic and his family were not in the residence, Yugoslav
officials said, when four cruise missiles fired from warships in
the Adriatic Sea struck with thunderous blows about 4 a.m. in
Belgrade. By Thursday afternoon, Milosevic appeared on Yugoslavia's
state-run television at a meeting with Viktor Chernomyrdin,
Russia's newest envoy to the Balkans, at another presidential
residence nearby, called Beli Dvor, or White Palace.
</P>
<P>
   The images from that meeting juxtaposed those of the destruction
at Milosevic's villa on Uzicka Street in Dedinje, an exclusive
section of the Yugoslav capital where many diplomatic compounds are
situated, including the residence of the U.S. ambassador.
Yugoslavia's former leader, Josip Broz Tito, lived in the villa,
and his mausoleum is on the grounds, though evidently far enough
away that it was not damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes on Thursday strikes came just one day after NATO
forces blasted a 23-story office tower in Belgrade that housed the
political parties of Milosevic and his wife, as well as several
radio and television stations, including one owned by their
daughter. These attacks signaled an expansion of NATO's efforts to
undercut the political and economic pillars that Milosevic has
relied on in more than 11 years of rule.
</P>
<P>
   The air assault continued with new ferocity Thursday, the 30th
day of NATO's bombing campaign. The Yugoslav news agency, Tanjug,
reported new missile strikes around Pristina and villages in
southern Serbia. NATO aircraft again attacked a bridge in
Yugoslavia's second largest city, Novi Sad, after discovering
workers trying to repair damage from two previous strikes. [Updates
as warranted)
</P>
<P>
   ``We are targeting the head of this military regime on the one
hand,'' the Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said Thursday.
``We're trying to cut that off and break the central nervous
system, the central command and control system of the regime. And
we're also attacking the feet of the regime on the ground in
Kosovo, the feet that are being used to stamp out, or attempt to
stamp out, the Kosovar Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the United States and its NATO allies agreed to review
contingency plans for the possible use of ground forces to rout
Yugoslav forces from Kosovo, the Pentagon offered one of its most
detailed assessments to date of the damage being inflicted on
Yugoslavia's military and police forces.

ACTIVISTS PROTEST BARRING OF 11 CHINESE DISSIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Democracy activists Thursday slammed Hong Kong for
barring entry to 11 Chinese dissidents, accusing the local
government of political censorship and of undermining Hong Kong's
autonomy from mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   The exiled dissidents, including Harvard University student Wang
Dan, leader of the 1989 student movement in Beijing's Tiananmen
Square, had applied to attend a seminar here next month on reform
movements in China.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 democracy activists and local university students
marched to the office of Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa
Thursday, waving banners and shouting slogans. Ten of the barred
dissidents, including the long-jailed Wei Jingsheng, live in exile
in the United States. One lives in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have every reason to be concerned over this erosion of
freedoms of expression and cultural exchange that Hong Kong has
enjoyed over the years,'' declared Albert Ho, a Democratic Party
legislator and one of the organizers of next month's conference.
``Hong Kong's reputation as a free, international city is now
tarnished _ a warning bell has been sounded.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference will mark the 80th anniversary of the May 4th
student movement and the 10th anniversary of the June 4th massacre
in which hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of demonstrators were
killed by Chinese troops.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong officials denied there had been pressure from Beijing
to reject the applicants, and said the decision was based on
established policies.
</P>
<P>
   Ho said if that were true, ``it's even more deplorable that
government is doing something to fetter its own discretion'' and to
avoid irritating Beijing at any cost.
</P>
<P>
   Dissident Wang Dan, whom Beijing branded the ``most-wanted''
student leader after the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown, said in a
telephone interview from his Somerville home that he was ``very
disappointed'' to be barred from Hong Kong. Wang, who was
imprisoned six years, but paroled on medical grounds to the United
States before President Clinton visited Beijing last year, is
subject to reimprisonment if he returns to mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   Wang said Hong Kong's refusal to allow him to visit made him
``worried about the future of Hong Kong under `one country, two
systems.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, when Britain returned Hong Kong to China after 156
years of colonial rule, Beijing's Communist leaders promised to
abide by ``one country, two systems,'' an arrangement allowing Hong
Kong to keep its ``capitalist system and way of life'' for 50
years. Hong Kong was guaranteed autonomy in all matters except
defense and foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   China made it clear before the handover, however, that Hong Kong
could not be used as a base for ``subversive activities'' that
promote the overthrow of China's Communist system. The Hong Kong
Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Democratic Movements in China,
which is sponsoring next month's seminar, is considered subversive
by Beijing, but has been allowed to continue operating.
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Tam, a spokesman for the Hong Kong Immigration Department,
said visa approvals are based on ``the intention of a visit,
whether the person is coming to Hong Kong as a visitor and not to
work, if such person is an undesirable . . . and also if the person
has any previous record as a criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Many mainland dissidents are considered ``subversives'' and
criminals under Chinese law. But Hong Kong and China have separate
criminal codes, and a convict in China is not necessarily a
criminal here, nor would he or she automatically be denied a
visitor's visa, Tam said. Tam denied that there was a lifetime ban
on any dissident or a blacklist, saying anyone could reapply.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-Beijing legislator Tsang Yok-sing defended the government,
saying it had to consider ``stability'' and possible disruptions
caused by visiting activists. Conference organizers said the
dissidents had no intention of causing trouble or staying for June
4th memorial demonstrations in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Ho said the Alliance had been given hope by immigration
officials in three meetings that at least some of the visas would
be granted. Several of the dissidents had been here before the
handover. ``There was no reason other than political
considerations'' to keep them out now, Ho said.
</P>
<P>
   In the months before the 1997 handover, several mainland exiles
left Hong Kong for fear they might not be safe or able to advocate
for democracy here. Prominent labor activist Han Dongfang has
remained, but China revoked his citizenship so he cannot enter the
mainland to organize trade unions.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the handover, Boston-based Chai Ling, another
leader of the 1989 Tiananmen movement, visited Hong Kong, but has
not tried to return since.
</P>
<P>
   The rejection of the 11 visa applications is believed to be the
first time since the handover that mainland dissidents have
attempted to visit Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Cheuk-yan, a Frontier party legislator, criticized the
timing of visa rejections; they were announced just after Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji left Canada, saving Zhu embarrassment over the
incident while in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said the alliance would invite dissident Wang Dan's mother,
who became a vocal advocate for her son when he was in prison, to
attend the conference on his behalf. It will be up to Hong Kong
immigration officials whether to allow entry to Wang Linyun, a
researcher at Beijing's Revolutionary History Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clear political censorship, and it will tarnish the
image of Hong Kong,'' Lee complained. ``Maybe they don't care about
image anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators Thursday delivered a protest letter to Tung _ plus
two tickets and an invitation to their May conference.

650 ADDITIONAL SEATS SOUGHT FOR FENWAY FOR ALL-STAR GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Red Sox want to install about 650 new seats at
Fenway Park for the All-Star Game to accommodate the expected flood
of media and fans.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the Red Sox say the extra seating, which must be
approved by the city, would be used only for the All-Star Game, and
that there will be no attempts to sell the seats for any other
games or to make them a permanent addition to the 33,871 capacity
of the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to do what we can to accommodate the demands
being placed on the smallest park in the major leagues by a lot of
media representatives, Major League Baseball, and, at the same
time, accommodate our fans, who will want to be there,'' said Dick
Bresciani, the Sox' vice president of public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the additional seating would be used only by the media.
It would consist of prefabricated boxes that would be lifted on to
the roof _ two each on the first base and third base sides of the
stadium. The two boxes would adjoin, providing seats for about 150
reporters at both locations. Even with the extra seats, some 100 of
the 700 reporters expected to attend will be confined to seats and
televisions in the interview room at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Red Sox want to install sets of bleachers at
two gaps in the current layout of the stadium _ along the first
base line at the so-called Canvas Alley, which provides access to
the field for the machinery used by the ground crew, and in right
field, at the gap in the seating between the grandstand in right
field and the bleachers in center field.
</P>
<P>
   Those bleachers would provide seating for a total of 350 fans.
</P>
<P>
   The necessary request for permits was filed with the city
Inspectional Services Department Thursday, city officials said. The
permits, which are under review, would allow the Red Sox 90 days to
assemble, install, and remove the seating, and restrict the use to
the All-Star Game, according to Julie Fothergill, a spokeswoman for
the department.
</P>
<P>
   Only three All-Star Games after 1960 have been played before
fewer than 40,000 people. Two of the previous small crowds _ 39,071
in 1990 and 38,359 in 1962 _ were played at Wrigley Field in
Chicago. The third was at Fenway Park in 1961, when 31,851
attended.
</P>
<P>
   The smallest attendance in history at an All-Star Game was in
1936 at Braves Field in Boston, when 25,556 attended, according to
the A. Bartlett Giamatti Research Center at the National Baseball
Hall of Fame and Museum.

ROBERT B. LUICK, AT 87; LAWYER, ADVISER TO MAJOR FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Robert B. Luick, 87, of Belmont and East Dennis, a
longtime Boston corporate lawyer and adviser to several major area
companies, including the former Continental Cablevision and Ionics
Inc., died Thursday after a long illness.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Luick, born in Belmond, Iowa, earned his undergraduate and
law degrees at the University of Minnesota and a master's in
business administration, cum laude, from Harvard in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   After four years as an attorney and assistant to the president
of New England Mutual Life Insurance Co., Mr. Luick joined Sullivan
&AMP; Worcester in Boston as a partner in 1943 and moved to an
of-counsel position in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   During his 56 years with Sullivan &AMP; Worcester, Mr. Luick helped
build the firm from a half-dozen lawyers to more than 150, and
pioneered a new speciality for the firm advising several Route 128
start-up technology companies in the post-World War II era.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was 40 or 50 years ahead of his time in concentrating on
these entrepreneurial companies in his practice, and he was as much
a business counselor as a legal counselor,'' said Lee Dunham,
managing partner at the firm. Mr. Luick was known there as an
unfailingly kind and gentlemanly mentor, as well as a tenacious
negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Luick assisted Boston cable television entrepreneur Amos B.
Hostetter when Hostetter founded Continental Cablevision in 1963
and served for two decades on its corporate board. Continental,
which became the third-largest US cable firm, was bought by US West
in 1996 in an $11 billion stock-and-debt transaction and is now
part of MediaOne Group.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948 Mr. Luick prepared the incorporation papers for Ionics
and began five decades as a director and legal counsel to the
Watertown company. Ionics is now the world's largest builder of
desalination plants and also produces AquaPure brand drinking water
and ultrapure water for high-tech manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an outstanding lawyer and, more important, an
outstanding human being with steadfast, solid judgment,'' Ionics
chairman and chief executive Arthur L. Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Luick also served as a director of Associates for
International Research, Delta Engineering Corp., Meta Software,
Mueller Corp., Setra Systems, and Stratford Realty Co., and was a
mentor to dozens of high-tech entrepreneurs in the area.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Longwood Cricket Club in Brookline and the
Mashantum Tennis Club in Dennis, Mr. Luick played tennis up to the
last year of his life. He frequently spoke to classes at Harvard
Business School, where last year he cochaired his 60th class
reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Luick, who was married for 51 years to the late Evelyn G.
Pelletier, leaves four daughters, Elisabeth A. of Belmont, Susan
Luick Good of Cambridge, Sarah H. of Boston, and Nancy Luick Bryan
of Greensboro, N.C.; a sister, Marian L. Richard of Pompano Beach,
Fla.; and four grandchildren.

DEAD WHALE HAD BROKEN JAW, SUGGESTING IMPACT WITH VESSEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dead right whale undergoing an autopsy on a Wellfleet, Mass.
beach had a fractured right jaw, scientists discovered Thursday,
providing the first evidence that the endangered animal could have
been struck by a boat.
</P>
<P>
   Ship strikes are the leading human-induced cause of death among
right whales, the world's most endangered whale species.
</P>
<P>
   However, federal officials in charge of the autopsy stressed
that the broken jaw could have resulted from a collision with
another whale or other causes, and might not have been a fatal
injury. They say it might take weeks to figure out what killed the
animal, nicknamed Staccato.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't rule out ship strike. I can't rule out disease. I
can't rule out anything,'' said Douglas Beach of the National
Marine Fisheries Service after crews spent two days cutting open
Staccato's carcass to look for clues to her demise.
</P>
<P>
   Even a single dead right whale worries biologists because only
about 300 of the animals remain, but Staccato's death was
particularly painful because she had borne six calves over the past
25 years, making her one of the species' most prolific breeders.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the National Marine Fisheries Service was eager to
study Staccato, paying to have her carcass towed ashore from five
miles offshore. But the autopsy has so far produced ambiguous
results, including tongue ulcers that could indicate a virus that
is fatal in some whales.
</P>
<P>
   Staccato's carcass was reported floating off Wellfleet's Great
Island on Tuesday.

   Literary critic  &UR; Sven Birkerts &LR; , a professor at Mount Holyoke

   ``If you are holding the thing and talking into it,'' Birkerts
told the weekly, ``then the line of intimacy or connection goes to
the person you're talking to, and it kind of eliminates the
physical space that you're in, and it kind of insults the other
people in that space. It's hard to put a finger on, but I'm aware
of it as an insult.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Birkerts, ``The people who use them adopt a body
language of extreme secrecy and intimacy. It gives the impression
to the person on the street that `something really important here
is happening that I'm not a part of, that it's so important that it
can't wait for him to be in a quiet place,' and that makes what I'M
doing seem really trivial.''
</P>
<P>
   When people talk on cell phones, he said, the place with which
they're connected ``is brought into the picture. It's like this
collapsing of all geographies into one place. ... It has,

environment.''

BRITAIN TO TRAIN NEW ARMY FOR SIERRA LEONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Britain's military role in Africa, a relic of
its colonial past, has been revived with London's decision to train
a new army for the tiny West African country of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   After nine years of brutal civil war in the former British
colony, the government of Prime Minister Tony Blair has concluded
that greater foreign intervention is needed to rescue the country's
elected leader, Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, from defeat by one of Africa's
most ruthless rebel groups. Widespread defections to the rebels
have left the government's army in tatters.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for sending British officers to help train Sierra
Leoneon troops, Britain has pressed Kabbah to begin negotiations
with the United Revolutionary Front (RUF), whose rebels have earned
a notorious reputation for savagery by mutilating civilians. And
Britain has urged Kabbah to take the difficult step of integrating
the rebels into the new army.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates are slamming Britain for providing a
future role for the rebels. They say it is hypocritical for the
government that jailed the former Chilean president, Augusto
Pinochet, for alleged war crimes is now encouraging an African
government to make peace with some of region's most vicious war
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is neither morally nor politically valid to jettison
justice on the grounds that we have to achieve reconciliation,''
said Ian Levine, the United Nations representative for Amnesty
International.
</P>
<P>
   But others say Britain, in particular, deserves credit for
taking action at a time when the US and other western powers have
been withdrawing from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brits are stepping forward because they are sensing that
there is not much support or leadership coming out of Washington,''
said Chester Crocker, the former US assistant secretary of state
for African affairs. ``The alternative is you sit on your hands and
let the men with the guns dictate.''
</P>
<P>
   After independence from Britain in 1961, Sierra Leone was
plagued by decades of mismanagement and civil conflict. It plunged
into civil war in 1991 after an insurgency backed by rebel leader
Foday Sankoh. And it has since been plagued by a series of military
coups. The contest has been largely over control of the country's
lucrative diamond trade. On Monday, Kabbah, Sierra Leone's first
democratically elected president, met with Sankoh for peace talks
in Togo. Sankoh is facing a death sentence in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's deputy foreign minister, Tony Lloyd, said that the
only hope for longterm stability in Sierra Leone requires a deal
with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   He said that a number of donor nations from Europe, the US and
Asia, agreed at a UN-based conference to back a two-track policy
for Sierra Leone: support a Nigerian-led military offensive against
the rebels while pressing for negotiations on a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The fear of Sierra Leone descending into further chaos leaves
``unpalatable decisions'' for those trying to prevent it, Lloyd
acknowledged. But he added that any attempt to ``rebuild the
shattered country'' will require integrating into the new military
``perpetrators of acts of terror and acts of horror.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain's growing role comes amid new reports of atrocities by
the rebels. A spokesman for a West African peacekeeping force
battling the insurgents said that 125 civilians were massacred last
week in the town of Songo, 25 miles east of the capital, Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1990s, a number of attempts at bringing
stability to the country have foundered.
</P>
<P>
   A Nigerian-led West African peacekeeping mission, known as
ECOMOG, failed to defeat the rebels or to shield Kabbah from a May
1997 coup that forced him into temporary exile. Last year, a
British-backed mercenary company, Sandline, drove the coup plotters
from power and restored Kabbah to power.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, meanwhile, rebounded with a major offensive in
January that raised doubts in Washington and London about the
prospects of their defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by dissident army officers, the rebels seized control of
the country's largest diamond mines and marched into Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   A UN investigation reported that between 3,000 and 5,000 people
were killed during the offensive. At least 2,000 of them were
civilians, according to the UN.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is shocking that there is a place at the table for Foday
Sankoh,'' said Reed Brody, the director of advocacy for the New
York-based Human Rights Watch.

ANALYSIS: NO TIME TO WASTE IN PREPARING FOR GROUND TROOPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ After four weeks of inconclusive airstrikes
against Yugoslavia, talk at NATO has increasingly turned to ground
troops to evict Yugoslav forces from Kosovo and secure autonomy for
the province and its Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   But unless NATO starts assembling ground forces soon, the
alliance may not have a credible threat of a land attack before the
onset of winter.
</P>
<P>
   For now, as the allies gather in Washington for a grand summit
marking NATO's 50th anniversary, there is broad agreement within
the organization that the bombing needs to continue, in the
lingering hope that it will eventually force Slobodan Milosevic,
the Yugoslav president, to meet NATO's demands.
</P>
<P>
   But what if several more months of bombing raids do not compel
Milosevic to withdraw his forces from Kosovo? While NATO's military
commanders have insisted that airstrikes are delivering a punishing
blow to the Yugoslav military, they have never guaranteed that air
power alone can deliver a victory.
</P>
<P>
   And what if the air campaign produces more cases of ``collateral
damage,'' the military's antiseptic term for the accidental bombing
of civilians, and public support for protracted bombing begins to
wane?
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, allied nations are talking of ground troops as a
way to bring the war to a speedy close. Nobody at NATO is eager to
rush into a land war. But if the alliance decides to turn to ground
troops, military experts say, they should go in before the weather
begins to worsen in September and October. Clear skies and
unhampered air power would be needed to protect the troops. It
would also be best if Western troops did not have to endure a
winter war.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to quiet the criticism in Congress that NATO lacks a
backup plan for using ground troops, the Clinton administration
said Wednesday night that it favors ``updating'' the options allied
military planners developed last summer for sending ground troops
into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. would certainly support as a prudent measure any
updating of the assessments of the use of ground troops in a
permissive and non-permissive environment,'' a White House official
said.
</P>
<P>
   But informal planning is at best a small step and one that is
unlikely to seriously worry Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   To make the vague talk of combat troops credible, the alliance
needs to start actual military preparations immediately, like
deciding which NATO members would contribute troops, mobilizing and
training reserves, persuading nations in the region to make their
ports and airfields available and then shipping troops and weapons
to the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Although it might seem strange that it would take the allied
nations so long to prepare for conflict in the heart of Europe,
NATO has its own procedures and diplomatic rituals in addition to
the practical and logistical considerations necessary to engage
tens of thousands of troops.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States prepared for the 1991 Persian Gulf war,
it began to send huge numbers of troops and weapons to the region
even before the generals worked out a military plan to evict Iraqi
soldiers from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   While in principle there is no reason that allied nations could
not start preparing troops now for a possible mission in Kosovo,
NATO does not generally work that way.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many military preparations are unlikely to be made
before allied nations formally instruct Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO
commander, to prepare a plan for a ground combat operation, and
then debate the strategy and approve it.
</P>
<P>
   Such a process has not even begun.
</P>
<P>
   The blessing of the entire 19-member alliance would be needed to
approve and implement a plan to engage ground troops in the
conflict. So far, NATO has agreed to send a peacekeeping force of
28,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the political decision to send combat troops into Kosovo
is made, getting forces to the Balkans could take six to eight
weeks, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The logistics would not be easy. Albania, which is already being
used a base for Apache helicopters and multiple-rocket launch
systems, is willing to serve as the staging ground for an attack.
But its port, airfields and roads are poor and its terrain
mountainous.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia, a non-NATO nation where 12,000 troops for a potential
British peacekeeping force have already been deployed, would be
more suitable. But that would mean aligning political support from
its government and from Greece, whose port at Salonnika would be
crucial. Neither is yet willing to support a land attack.
</P>
<P>
   Though the difficulties are formidable, there are powerful
reasons why NATO might at least want to have an option to use
combat troops.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it would strengthen the allies' negotiating
leverage in trying to work out a settlement. Milosevic's strategy
is to try to ride out NATO's air war in the hope that the alliance
will crack. But that would be harder to do if the allies made clear
that they had other military options.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the option to use ground forces might also be useful
if airstrikes eventually lead Yugoslav forces to retreat.
Paramilitary units operating in Kosovo, some NATO officials worry,
could launch a final spasm of violent reprisals against any ethnic
Albanians remaining in the province as Yugoslav forces withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   Without substantial forces on the ground in the Balkans, NATO
could only look on from the sidelines, much as America and its
allies watched from the southern side of the Euphrates as Iraqi
forces attacked Iraqi Shiites immediately after the war in the
Persian Gulf in 1991. The alliance could ultimately win a military
victory through air power but end up suffering a moral defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, using ground troops to impose a peace settlement
against disorganized Yugoslav resistance might be the only way to
bring a decisive end, a point top British officials have
underscored in recent days.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Clark has contended that the bombing may succeed in
breaking the will of the Milosevic regime, diplomats say he has
also told allies that there are no guarantees. As an Army officer,
could hardly be expected to believe differently.
</P>
<P>
   Another Army man was also careful to emphasize the limits of air
power in forcing foreign dictators to bend to the will of the
United States. Just before the Persian Gulf war, Gen. Colin Powell,
who at the time was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told
Congress that he was not about to rely exclusively on air power to
evict Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   And Powell offered that view even though he had far more air
power at his disposal than Clark and the foe he was fighting was
vulnerably situated in the open desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can hunker down, one can dig in, one can disperse to try
to ride out such a single-dimension attack,'' he said. ``Such
strategies are designed to hope to win; they are not designed to
win.''

PIPPEN HIT WITH DWI CHARGE 

</HEADLINE>

By S.K. BARDWELL 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Houston Rockets star Scottie Pippen was arrested and
charged with driving while intoxicated early Thursday, hours after
after turning in one of the worst performances of his career with
the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Houston police officer Ross McCammon said he pulled Pippen's
Mercedes over at 1:20 a.m. after seeing his car drive south in the
northbound lanes of a major downtown Houston street.
</P>
<P>
   After talking with Pippen, McCammon suspected him to be
intoxicated, and called a member of the DWI Task Force to the
scene, said HPD spokesman John Cannon.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen failed a field sobriety test and was arrested. He was
taken to the downtown police station, where authorities said he was
videotaped and refused a Breathalyzer test.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pippen, 33, was alone in his Mercedes, Houston Police
Department spokesman Robert Hurst said Pippen's brother was in a
car with friends who pulled over when they saw Pippen being
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Hurst said after police made sure Pippen's brother was sober and
legally licensed, he was allowed to drive Pippen's car away, rather
than having it towed and impounded.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen was charged with misdemeanor DWI and bail set at $500. He
was released from the city jail just before 7 a.m. after posting
bond, police said. He is scheduled for an initial court appearance
on April 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not intoxicated when arrested after the game last night,
and I'm confident the evidence will support me in the end,'' Pippen
said in a statement released through the Rockets' media office late
Thursday. ``I have no further comment and am going to let my
attorneys handle this matter in the appropriate way.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston criminal defense lawyer Rusty Hardin said he spoke with
Pippen after his release Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and the people who were with him adamantly deny that he was
intoxicated,'' Hardin said.
</P>
<P>
   Hardin said he knows little about the case and declined to say
who was with Pippen or where he was before he was arrested
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   However, patrons of The Jones Bar downtown said Pippen was there
after the game Wednesday, along with Charles Barkley and Matt
Maloney.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen left town Thursday with his team for a West Coast road
trip. The Rockets play the Los Angeles Clippers Friday and the
Phoenix Suns on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the Rockets lost 109-95 to the Dallas Mavericks
in Compaq Center, with Pippen contributing only four points, making
just two of his eight shots in 31 minutes of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what happened. I'm with him 110 percent,'' Barkley said
Thursday. ``If everybody's kids grew up to be as successful as
Scottie Pippen, the world would be a better place.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said: ``I don't think it's
appropriate for us to comment. We don't have the details.
Commenting on those things is unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``People did that to me and assumed things. It's not fair. I'm
not going to do that to anybody,'' Tomjanovich said, referring to
his own arrest for DWI in West University Place in the summer of
1994.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Tomjanovich, who also was represented by
Hardin, were dismissed a few days after being filed, when
prosecutors said they had insufficient evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen was arrested in Chicago in January 1994 after a police
officer checking on Pippen's illegally parked car noticed a loaded
.380-caliber semiautomatic handgun in the car. The charge was later
dismissed when a judge ruled the officer had no probable cause to
look in the car.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen was charged with misdemeanor domestic battery in May
1995, after being accused of grabbing his fiancee, Yvette Deleone,
and shoving her. The case was dismissed when Deleone declined to
testify.

BARRETT TO HEAD LAHEY CLINIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Minn.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Dr. David Barrett has been named chief executive of
the Lahey Clinic in Burlington, succeeding Dr. John A. Libertino,
who will return to his surgical practice full time.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, 57, is chief of urology at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn., where he has practiced for 25 years and was part
of the elite medical team that treated Jordan's King Hussein before
his death in February from lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett's appointment is effective Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Libertino, a practicing urological surgeon, said he wanted to
focus on his medical practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work 100 hours a week doing both clinical medicine and
administration,'' said Libertino, who has been chairman and CEO of
the Lahey Clinic for five years. ``I still have the second-busiest
surgical practice at the Lahey Clinic, and 100 hours a week is just
too much to sustain for any more than five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Libertino, 59, will remain as vice chairman of Lahey's board of
trustees and chairman of its department of urology. He said the
management change does not signal any shift in Lahey's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   After the clinic dissolved its merger with Dartmouth Hitchcock
Medical Center in New Hampshire in 1997, Lahey embarked on
expansion of its physician group practice throughout eastern
Massachusetts. The Lahey Clinic has 500 physicians at 40 sites,
including its flagship hospital in Burlington, and has been
recruiting more. It recently succeeded in wooing a team of liver
transplant surgeons from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lahey has always differentiated itself from its competitors by
being a physician-focused organization,'' said Ellen Lutch Trager,
a health care consultant with Brown Rudnick Freed &AMP; Gesmer, a law
firm in Boston. ``But in a fiercely competitive market like Boston,
Lahey needs to secure its future by developing strategic
alliances.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lahey Clinic last year managed well financially, earning
$2.2 million on operating revenue of $389 million in fiscal year
1998, ended Sept. 31. In the first five months of its 1999 fiscal
year, Lahey earned $400,000 on revenue of $168.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, a urologist, said he would continue to practice
medicine while at the helm of the Lahey Clinic. He received his
medical degree from Wayne State University in Detroit and a
bachelor's degree from Albion College in Michigan.

SOFTWARE FIRM SETTLES Y2K SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In what appears to be the first legal settlement of
its kind in Massachusetts, a software firm agreed to resolve
allegations against it over the computer problem known as the ``Y2K
bug.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few such suits have been resolved in other states to
date, out of 61 cases tracked by a national litigation group.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of complaints is expected to increase
dramatically as lawyers and companies wrestle with the question of
just who should pay for the billions of dollars that it will
eventually cost to stave off widespread system problems at the
start of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's likely to be substantially more litigation concerning
responsibility for Y2K-type issues,'' said Gary Greenberg, an
attorney at Goldstein &AMP; Manello in Boston, the plaintiff's attorney
in the local suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future you're going to be dealing with losses or
damages, but for now these suits are about ways to minimize those
losses,'' Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   His case, a class-action complaint, was brought by Qual-Craft
Industries Inc., a Stoughton construction tools maker. Filed in
Norfolk Superior Court last June, the suit alleged that software
maker RealWorld Corp. of Manchester, N.H., wrongly failed to
upgrade certain accounting software products to make them
Y2K-compliant.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the settlement, approved by a judge April 16,
RealWorld agreed to provide certain free upgrades and other
discounts worth an estimated $915 to each of 40,000 business
customers whose software might not have functioned through the date
change to Jan. 1, 2000. Users have until September to claim the
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Like others' software, many of RealWorld's programs used just
the last two digits of each year to keep track of the date. Those
programs might misinterpret Jan. 1, 2000, and cause computer
systems to crash or malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Many corporations are spending large sums to review and fix code
written by their own programmers. But for smaller companies, the
problem often lies with software purchased from outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   In its case, Qual-Craft bought programs from RealWorld in 1995
to keep track of accounting and order-processing functions, then
learned they might crash at the end of December.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at RealWorld said the older programs weren't worth
fixing and instead suggested Qual-Craft buy its latest programs.
Kurt Mueffelmann, RealWorld's chief executive, said in an interview
Thursday that any effective fix to the old programs would have
required users to buy new hardware as well _ in which case they
would be better off buying RealWorld's newer, Y2K-compliant
products.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, it was better for the company to settle the case
rather than spend the time and legal fees needed to dispute it at
trial. ``If we were to go through with the whole litigation, we
would have taken our eye off the business ball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the settlement could cost RealWorld as much as $55
million, which Mueffelmann described as several times the
privately-held company's total revenue. It has 97 employees.
</P>
<P>
   But Mueffelmann said the firm would remain in business to sell
new products. ``What can we do except focus on our newer
products?''
</P>
<P>
   RealWorld was represented by Boston firm Bingham, Dana LLP.
Qual-Craft was also represented by New York firm Milberg, Weiss,
Bershad, Hynes &AMP; Lerach, best-known for bringing similar
class-action suits. Nationally, the firm has also brought many of
the 61 cases related to Y2K issues tracked by the Federation of
Insurance &AMP; Corporate Counsel in Walpole.

 &HT;    Georgia governor signs tougher vehicular homicide law
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov. Roy Barnes signed ``Heidi's Law'' DUI legislation
Thursday, as the father of the bill's namesake stood at his side.
</P>
<P>
   The law that toughens penalties for drivers convicted of
homicide by vehicle was named for Heidi Flye, the Cumming mother
killed with her two young daughters last summer when her car was
hit by a drunken driver. It takes effect May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Flye described DUI as a crime that often leads to
devastating consequences and ``wrecks the lives of those left
behind.'' He called for expanded use of a car ignition interlock
device that prevents a car from starting when it detects alcohol on
the driver's breath.
</P>
<P>
   Under Heidi's Law, those convicted of a second DUI would have to
have the device on their vehicle if they seek to drive during the
first six months of probation. It also requires a 12-month
probation of anyone convicted of DUI, regardless of jail time.
</P>
<P>
   Flye called the ignition interlock device the ``last and most
effective line of defense'' against drunk drivers and predicted
they eventually could be installed routinely by car manufacturers.
``I probably won't live to see it,'' Flye said. ``But drunk driving
could be virtually eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   Heidi's law also:
</P>
<P>
   _ Gives judges compete leeway to set or deny bail in homicide by
vehicle cases.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bars those with a second DUI in five years from obtaining a
limited driving permit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Raises the minimum sentence for first-degree homicide by
vehicle from two to three years.

N.H. SENATE VOTES TO REPEAL BAN ON GAY ADOPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ In another sign that New Hampshire's political
culture is changing, the Senate voted Thursday to repeal a law that
bans homosexuals from adopting children or serving as foster
parents.
</P>
<P>
   The repeal passed the more conservative House earlier this year,
and Gov. Jeanne Shaheen has said she will sign it.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire, whose ban which took effect in 1988 amid what
critics call an ``AIDS hysteria,'' is one of only two states with a
law preventing gays and lesbians from adopting children. Florida is
the other.
</P>
<P>
   Several states, however, including Arkansas and Utah, have
effectively banned gay adoption by administrative rules.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire, like many states, does not have enough foster
parents to help all the children in search of homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a shortage of foster parents in this state. We are
denying these children a family,'' said Sen. Katie Wheeler, a
leader in the fight to repeal the ban. ``Due to the ignorance,
prejudice and discrimination of those members of the 1988
legislature the foster children of New Hampshire have suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler said that before the ban, there was ``not one single
incident or complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the six Senate proponents of the ban chose to speak. In
debates that led to the ban, however, some lawmakers cited Biblical
prohibitions against homosexuality. Others suggested that gays
sought to adopt children in order to prey upon them.
</P>
<P>
   ``One member of the House, a House which has gay and lesbian
members in it, actually stood up and looked at them and said that
homosexuals are predators, pedophiles and perverts,'' Sen. James
Squires said of the 1988 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Ending the ban would be yet another sign that even a Granite
State can change said Rep. Raymond Buckley of Manchester, House
Minority Whip. Last year the legislature passed civil rights
legislation. Democrats in control of the Senate for the first time
in 86 years. The state's first female governor is in office.
Chances are good that this spring, New Hampshire will finally join
the other 49 states and adopt a Martin Luther King holiday. Talk of
an income tax no longer taboo.
</P>
<P>
   Several senators spoke in very personal terms during the debate
that preceded Thursday's 18-6 vote. One said he and his wife could
not adopt a child without banning a gay sibling from their home.
Another said he would face the same problem if a gay nephew were to
come for a visit.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rick Trombly, a lawyer whose representation of a gay men's
club became a campaign issue last year in his race with a
Republican challenger, said that he too, was a target of the ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can sit down with you as an equal, we can have dinner, but
under the law of the state of New Hampshire, I cannot help those
special children in need,'' Trombly said.
</P>
<P>
   It took 11 years of work for gay rights advocates to erase what
Buckley called called a state symbol of hate by repealing the ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``This, I think, is a quantum leap from the days of old in New
Hampshire when people who were different in some way didn't feel
that they had a home here,'' Buckley said.

SKULL AND FOSSILS FOUND IN ETHIOPIA PROMPT MISSING-LINK DEBATE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Digging beneath a sere plain in Ethiopia, paleontologists have
found a skull and other fossils of what they say is a new prehuman
species, possibly the long-sought connecting link between apelike
ancestors and the human family.
</P>
<P>
   Near the site, other scientists discovered the earliest known
traces of stone tools used to butcher animals. Judging by cut marks
on some ancient antelope bones, humanlike creatures gathering long
ago beside a shallow lake used chipped stones to slice meat and
other stones to crack leg bones to get at the nourishing marrow.
</P>
<P>
   This probably was the work of members of the new species, the
discoverers of both sites say; but, in any case, the butchered
bones are strong evidence that the first toolmakers were able to
feast increasingly on meat, which could have influenced the course
of human evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Both finds, which are being reported in Friday's issue of the
journal Science, were dated to 2.5 million years ago, in the middle
of a shadowy but pivotal period in human prehistory. The fossil
record for hominids, human ancestors and their close kin, is
frustratingly sparse between 3 million and about 2 million years
ago. Yet this was the time when hominids took up toolmaking and
evolved from the small-brained, apelike australopithecines into the
first members of the Homo genus.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery team, led by Berhane Asfaw, an anthropologist with
the Rift Valley Research Services in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, named
the new species Australopithecus garhi (garhi means ``surprise'' in
the language spoken by the Afar people in the region where the
fossils were found).
</P>
<P>
   ``This species is descended from Australopithecus afarensis and
is a candidate ancestor for early Homo,'' the scientists concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristics of the skull, teeth and limb bones seemed to
mark the species as a descendant of A. afarensis, which lived from
3.7 million to 3 million years ago and are famously represented by
the ``Lucy'' skeleton from Ethiopia. Even earlier species of
australopithecines, found in Kenya, have been dated back to 4.2
million years. The hominids are thought to have split from the ape
lineages more than 5 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The A. garhi had a projecting apelike face and small braincase,
similar to the Lucy species. But its teeth were much larger, which
was what most surprised paleontologists about the fossils.
</P>
<P>
   ``This combination of features has never been seen before,''
said Tim White, a paleoanthropologist at the University of
California at Berkeley and co-leader of the discovery team, ``and
that's why we named a new species.''
</P>
<P>
   Other skeletal remains at the site included leg and arm bones of
what probably, but not certainly, was another member of the new
species. From this evidence, scientists said, the individual was
slightly less than 5 feet tall and had long legs and a human gait,
but long, apelike forearms. It was more evidence of the species as
a possible direct ancestor of the Homo genus.
</P>
<P>
   As often happens in response to new discoveries in the
contentious field of early human origins, other paleontologists
differed in their interpretations of the findings. Bernard Wood of
George Washington University in Washington said it was too soon to
assess the place of the new fossils on the family tree.
</P>
<P>
   In another Science article, Wood was quoted as saying, ``At this
point it's impossible to tell what's ancestral to what.''
</P>
<P>
   Ian Tattersall, a specialist in hominid fossils at the American
Museum of Natural History in New York, said, ``It probably is a new
species, but it's difficult to say exactly where it fits into human
evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Walker, a paleoanthropologist at Pennsylvania State
University, said the fossils were an important start to filling in
the million-year gap in knowledge of hominid evolution in East
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   To him, the new species ``looks like an afarensis with big
teeth,'' Walker said. ``But it has a lot of primitive features, so
if it is ancestral to Homo, a lot of evolution had to take place
rather quickly'' to arrive at the first Homo species around 2
million years ago. The transition to much larger brains began with
Homo erectus, about 1.7 million years ago. Modern Homo sapiens are
thought to have emerged less than 200,000 years ago.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some other scientists questioned whether A. garhi was a better
candidate as a Homo ancestor than A. africanus, a species that
emerged about 2.8 million years ago and apparently lived mostly in
South Africa. The place of africanus on the family tree has long
vexed paleontologists.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said one thing was clear: the new fossils were definitely
not africanus specimens.
</P>
<P>
   Although the butchered bones were found in sediment layers
corresponding to the A. garhi fossils, White said, ``We cannot yet
conclusively link the new species with the butchery or the more
modern limb proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   But the proximity of the cutmarked antelope bones to the hominid
fossils is strong circumstantial evidence that these were the
toolmakers and hearty meat eaters. Two years ago, paleontologists
announced the discovery of 2.5 million-year-old stone tools
elsewhere in Ethiopia, but missing was any clear associations with
hominid fossils or animal butchering.
</P>
<P>
   J. Desmond Clark, a University of California archeologist on the
team, said there was ``absolutely no shadow of a doubt'' that the
antelope bones were evidence of early stone-tool use. ``You can
clearly distinguish these cut marks from the kinds of marks left by
carnivores,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   The archeologists were not surprised by the absence of any tools
at the site. It is bereft of stone from which to make tools.
Presumably, Clark said, the hominids had made their stone tools
elsewhere and traveled with them as they visited good hunting
places. This particular site, a desert now, was a grassy plain by a
lake 2.5 million years ago and must have attracted prey for the
hominids.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Clark said, the new findings indicate a ``great
cultural breakthrough'' in which hominids gained the means to
change their diet with more meat and the knowledge of the
nutritional benefits of marrow. These were probably factors in
subsequent increases in hominid brain sizes.
</P>
<P>
   In their journal report, Clark's team wrote, ``The combined
evidence suggests that behavioral changes associated with lithic
technology and enhanced carnivory may have been coincident with the
emergence of the Homo clade from Australopithecus afarensis in
eastern Africa.''

SHAREHOLDER QUESTIONS GIFFORD'S ROLE AT MERGED BANKBOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A prominent BankBoston Corp. shareholder raised
questions Thursday over plans for chief executive Charles K.
``Chad'' Gifford to take the reins of the combined Fleet-BankBoston
in two years, saying it was unwise to enshrine someone early in the
top slot.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Isaacs, a retired vice chairman of BayBanks Inc., which
BankBoston acquired in 1995, told shareholders at BankBoston's
annual meeting that the new company needed flexibility, not
rigidity, in its management plans.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to a rapidly consolidating financial services world,
Isaacs said senior executive slots at combining companies changed
often and rapidly _ a scenario BankBoston and Fleet should allow
for should they decide to make any acquisitions in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why decide now about something two years out when things are
changing?'' asked Isaacs. He declined to say how many shares he
owned.
</P>
<P>
   Under BankBoston's $15 billion agreement to combine with Fleet
Financial Group Inc., Gifford will hold the No. 2 position in the
new company under current Fleet chief executive Terrence Murray.
When Murray retires at the end of 2001, Gifford will assume the top
job.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers speculate that Gifford may opt not to head the
new bank, despite provisions that make it tough to remove him. One
BankBoston shareholder said Gifford could be written out of any new
contracts if the combined company makes acquisitions before Gifford
becomes chief.
</P>
<P>
   But BankBoston dismissed such talk. ``He wants to run the new
company,'' said Peter J. Manning, head of mergers and acquisitions.
``He has no intention of not doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleet originally wanted to set aside a block of shares for
potential acquisitions before the merger with BankBoston is
finalized, but BankBoston vetoed the proposal. The combined
company, to be the nation's eighth-largest bank, will have $160
billion in assets after divestiture _ up to $40 billion less than
the $150 billion to $200 billion Murray has said a bank needs to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford does not yet have a contract with the new Fleet Boston,
although lawyers have agreed in principle on salary, bonus, stock
options, and change-of-control payment _ a severance package should
Gifford not take the top job or relinquish the post early. The
contract will be finalized in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Under a temporary arrangement, Gifford is entitled to a sum
equal to three times his annual salary and his highest annual bonus
of the past three years as well as an unspecified pension payout
should he be ousted in the three years following the merger's
close, according to a BankBoston document filed with securities
regulators last month. Gifford earned $869,231 in base pay last
year, up 9 percent from 1997, but saw his bonus slip 24 percent to
$1.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual provision, Fleet has pledged to amend its charter
to require a supermajority of 75 percent of the combined bank's
22-member board, or 17 members, to alter the succession plans.
Industry observers say the provision is designed less to ensure
that Gifford has the top job and more to boost employee morale at
BankBoston, where Gifford is highly regarded. Doubts among staffers
that Gifford could take over the new bank could torpedo successful
integration of the two companies, analyst Nancy A. Bush of Ryan,
Beck &AMP; Co. said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, once Gifford takes the reins, only a 50 percent board
vote is needed to oust him.
</P>
<P>
   As president and chief operating officer under Murray, Gifford
will oversee most of the new bank's core business lines from the
outset. Murray will handle strategy, including mergers and
acquisitions, staffing, and financial issues.
</P>
<P>
   For the new company, Fleet originally wanted a 30-member board
packed with Fleet representatives, but it settled for 12 slots to
BankBoston's 10.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ There was a deserted quality to Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's offices last Friday afternoon, several hours
before the Sabbath. It magnified the sense that Netanyahu,
surrounded by bodyguards, is alone at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed impeccably as always, the most formal man in an informal
country, Netanyahu looked coiled and wary as he received a reporter
from behind his desk. He does not trust the press, which in Israel
is uniformly hostile to him, and in these days of relentless
campaigning, he is reluctant to take a break.
</P>
<P>
   It is four months since Netanyahu's government was dissolved
prematurely and he was forced into a tight race for re-election on
May 17. In the streets, Netanyahu, who is nicknamed Bibi, is still
held in passionately high regard by many admirers of his
tough-talking Zionist stance, especially working-class Sephardic
Jews and Russian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   But his circle of political allies has shrunk. And his small
clique of advisers, like him, exudes a strong air of us against the
world, even though Netanyahu trails his main rival, Ehud Barak, by
only a couple of percentage points. That is because opposition
tactics, driven by ``antipathy, if not hatred for me,'' rely on
``character assassination,'' Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if Netanyahu's world view has collided with his
self-image: Like Israel, he too is surrounded by the ``circle of
hatred'' he often describes. And it is not without reason. On the
right, in the center and on the left, there are many Israelis
hoping he becomes a fluke of history. Even if he wins, he will have
a hard time stitching together a stable government.
</P>
<P>
   Tall, robust and aggressively self-confident, Netanyahu, 49, is
a galvanizing force. ``Like any leader that matters,'' he said,
citing Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, he leaves few people
``neutral or indifferent.''
</P>
<P>
   Those devoted supporters who chant ``Only Bibi'' until they are
hoarse see him as ``the last real goalkeeper on the Jewish national
soccer team,'' said Ari Shavit, a writer for the newspaper Haaretz
who specializes in analyzing Israelis' strong feelings about
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Those who reject him, according to the prime minister, do so not
because he failed as a leader, betraying allies and principles in
the interest of political self-preservation. That is his critics'
view.
</P>
<P>
   In the prime minister's view, they demonize him largely because
they still hold him accountable for the assassination of former
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. In Netanyahu's words, because they
see him as ``the culprit who did him in, who done him in.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu led the opposition Likud Party when Rabin was murdered
by a fanatic right-wing Israeli in 1995, after political opposition
to the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord negotiated in Oslo
escalated into vicious incitement against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody had to be guilty,'' Netanyahu said. ``Guilty twice.
Not only for the assassination but guilty of the collapse of the
messianic dream of peace that developed after Oslo. It clearly
didn't work. Buses were exploding in Israel. There were more
casualties from terror than happened in the previous 10 years. The
dream was in danger, and then the bearer of the dream was
assassinated and somebody had to be responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Many, in fact, do still believe that Netanyahu behaved
irresponsibly in the months before Rabin's assassination, presiding
over virulent rallies, such as one in which Rabin's image, in
Gestapo uniform, was burned. But current attacks on Netanyahu focus
rather on the supposed failures of character he demonstrated as
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that opposition is quite fresh and drawn from firsthand
experience. Two of his former Cabinet members _ former Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and former Science Minister Benny Begin
_ are running against him. And two others have joined the
leadership of opposing parties _ former Finance Minister David Levy
with Barak, and former Finance Minister Dan Meridor with Mordechai
in the new Center Party.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his critics, including Barak, describe Netanyahu as
quick to betray his right-wing convictions in the name of ambition.
</P>
<P>
   But the prime minister, in contrast, presents himself as a man
of unyielding principle whose government was undone by a
``collusion'' between the self-interests of the right and left.
Although he never believed in the Oslo accord, he swore during his
last campaign to uphold it as an international agreement, he said.
When he signed the most recent peace memorandum, at the Wye
Plantation in Maryland in October, he was doing just that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right attacked me on Wye,'' he said. ``They said not that
I wasn't keeping my word, but that I shouldn't have kept my word
because it was only campaign rhetoric. So you had here this
incredible alliance between the right, opposed to peace, and the
left, which was supposed to give me a safety net for peace, all
basically colluding to bring down a government which went for
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Party, which had promised to hold a ``safety net''
under Netanyahu's government, withdrew its promise when he froze
compliance with the Wye agreement late last year. Citing
Palestinian violations of the accord, Netanyahu refused to withdraw
Israeli troops from additional land in the West Bank, and he has
been criticized by the Palestinians and the Americans for
stonewalling the process.
</P>
<P>
   Defiantly denying that he bears the responsibility for the
freeze, Netanyahu said he is ready to move forward at any time _
if, he said, the Palestinians take the appropriate steps toward
cracking down on terrorism. But, Netanyahu said, Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, is unwilling to move the process ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's basically sitting on the sidelines waiting for the
elections,'' Netanyahu said. ``Arafat and the Palestinian Authority
have made only a modest effort to hide the fact that they'd like to
see Barak and a compliant Israeli government.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said he believed that Arafat was suppressing terrorist
activity during the election campaign because he understood that an
act of terrorism would push the issue of security to the forefront,
helping Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if that did not portend a spate of terrorism in the event
of his re-election, the prime minister said: ``Quite the contrary.
He'd know that he has to negotiate with a firm government that's
willing to give him things _ not on the scale of Labor _ provided
he kept his side of the bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said he believed that Arafat had matured from ``a
great practitioner of terror for many decades'' into ``not doing
that anymore.'' But Netanyahu indicated that he was reluctant to
trust him as a partner in peace, and that he remains distrustful of
the Palestinians' acceptance of Israel and of their motivations at
the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does he eternally want to see not only the establishment of a
Palestinian state but ultimately to view it as a base for the PLO
doctrine that calls for the ultimate destruction of Israel?''
Netanyahu asked. ``I can't tell you that or read his heart. I can
tell you that in the Palestinian leadership a small part has
generally made its peace with Israel in the fullest sense of the
word. But a considerable part use the peace as an interlude, a step
to the ultimate goal of seeing the dissolution of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that attitude is obstructionist and lacks the spirit
necessary for peacemaking. But Netanyahu believes tough skepticism
works best at the negotiating table, and said he would lead Israel
toward a final settlement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I envision is the Palestinians having all the power to
govern themselves, and none of the powers usually associated with a
sovereign state,'' he said. ``What concerns us the ability to
import weapons freely and to make military pacts with regimes like
Iraq, Iran.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Partly reared and wholly educated in the United States,
Netanyahu runs an ethnic government, writer Zeev Chafets jokes _ an
ethnic American one. Yet he is seen here as having put the close
Israeli-American relationship at risk over the stalled peace
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, however, said the longtime relationship is based on
``people to people'' rather than government to government ties, and
that his disagreements with the Clinton administration echo those
that his predecessors _ from David Ben Gurion to Yitzhak Shamir _
had with former American presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu declined to sketch his vision for the composition of a
governing coalition if he wins. He said it would be ``our old
coalition plus anyone else who wants to join based on our
principles.'' The old coalition, though, minus those who fled,
would leave him with an unstable, minority government.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't Netanyahu, then, need to form a unity government with
Labor? The prime minister said he would welcome Barak into his
government only ``if he changes his principles.'' Barak, on the
other hand and despite speculation to the contrary, said it was
highly improbable that he would ever take Netanyahu into his
Cabinet if he wins.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is trying hard to campaign on what he sees as his
economic successes, infuriated that Israelis are paying more
attention to a minor, two-point rise in unemployment than to the
``miracle we've been performing here.'' He referred to a growth in
the stock market, to halving the deficit, to privatizing
inefficient state industries, and even to the fact that Israelis
log more hours per capita on cellular phones than any other people.
</P>
<P>
   He did not mention what many Israeli industrialists consider his
key failing: that the paralysis in the peace process has slowed
direct foreign investment and trade with the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   During the interview, Netanyahu looked uncharacteristically
drained and red-eyed, although not too tired to suggest a stage
direction: ``he said with a wry smile.'' It was the end of a day
that included another type of interview, with the Israeli police,
who were investigating bribery accusations involving his foreign
minister, Ariel Sharon.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Netanyahu, a wall of bookshelves was fully stocked and
organized by category _ biographies of world leaders, studies of
terrorism, volume after volume of Bible interpretations. Closest at
hand was ``Self-Portrait of a Hero,'' an anthology of letters
written by Netanyahu's oldest brother, Yonatan, who was killed in
the hostage rescue operation in Entebbe, Uganda, in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, which was Memorial Day here, Netanyahu, in another
uncharacteristic move, canceled media coverage of his visit to his
brother's grave on Mount Herzl.
</P>
<P>
   He decided he wanted to go alone.

HAL GILL: AN UNLIKELY SUCCESS STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ OK, so it's not the Montreal, Toronto, or
even Chicago of the South. Hockey down here remains a quirky fit, a
bauble in the curiosity shop, all the more so because the 'Canes
will vacate Greensboro Coliseum after this season and move into
their new rink in Raleigh in the fall. It was a franchise forged on
a farewell. How close would any fan want to get?
</P>
<P>
   But success can be spawned in some unlikely places.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Gill is proof of that.
</P>
<P>
   Gill, the Bruins' towering second-year defenseman, was the 207th
pick in the '93 draft, giving him about as much chance to make the
NHL as a Chilean nanny has of winning a $197 million lottery. He
spent his formative hockey years playing for Nashoba Regional High
School, one of some 600 students from the towns of Bolton, Stow,
and Lancaster. Just as Greensboro is to the NHL, Nashoba is to the
powers of Massachusetts high school hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at going to schools better known for hockey, like
Acton-Boxboro and St. John's (Shrewsbury),'' recalled Gill, before
suiting up against the Hurricanes in the opening game of the
Bruins' first-round playoff series. ``But my brothers went to
Nashoba, and I wanted to play football _ I just wanted to do what I
wanted to do. And I thought, `Hey, if I'm going to make it, I'll
make it no matter where I go.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons why the 24-year-old Gill has gone on to
become such a key component to the Boston defense. It helps to be 6
feet 7 inches and 240 pounds, and it helps even more to be such a
mobile and agile block of granite willing to work at getting
better. But Gill also arrived in the Hub at a perfect time, when a
new coach (Pat Burns) had no preconceptions (read: misgivings)
about what a No. 207 draft pick might bring to the dance, and when
a new assistant coach (Jacques Laperriere) was there to program him
with a few decades of Montreal-honed defensive data. There was also
the general plight of the franchise, the Bruins just having
finished dead last in the Original 26.
</P>
<P>
   Gill was big, young, and willing. The Bruins were down, out, and
wanting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing with Jacques is positioning,'' said Gill. ``If
you're in good position to start with, then you don't have to be
catching up the whole time. It's anticipation: read the play and
try to be in the right spot. In other words, you don't want to be
in the corner thinking, `Oh, hey, I need to be in front of the
net.' Jacques's big on that kind of thing, and he's also always
reminding me to keep it simple out there. If the only play is to
bang it off the glass _ and a lot of time that's your only option _
then that's what you do. Just make the simple play.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Gill's transition from playing four years at
Providence College to suiting up nightly for the Bruins has been so
seamless, it is almost taken for granted that he is behind the blue
line almost every time the opposition's top player is on the ice.
When the Bruins play Pittsburgh, he's out there whenever Jaromir
Jagr, arguably the best player in the game, rolls over the boards.
He was back there, captain Ray Bourque at his side, just about
every time the 'Canes Keith Primeau, the 6-5, 220-pound power
pivot, jumped into the play _ a matchup that should last through
this best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a more straight up-and-down player than Jagr is,'' said
Gill. ``You've got to try to keep guys close by him, not let him
use his speed, and he's not someone you can line up and kill. Jagr
is always looking for the play out there. Primeau is more strength
and speed, but in a straight line, more north-south. Maybe he
doesn't have Jagr's moves, but they both like to get down low and
make things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Rarely does the enemy get down low on Gill's watch. The rare
time he hasn't anticipated the play, he often can cover his mistake
with his valley-of-the-jolly-green-giant reach. With a quick ho,
ho, ho, the puck is usually cleared from harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   From the backwoods of Nashoba Regional to the forefront of the
Boston defense. Even for Gill, there are times that seems like an
incredible reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, sometimes it's hard to believe,'' he said. ``But it's
never something where I go, `Wow, this is amazing.' It's more like,
`Wow, this is good stuff.' It's what I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The big kid from the little school now laughs to himself when he
attends a hockey clinic and routinely gets quizzed by parents about
how their own Billy, Johnny, or Genevieve isn't progressing in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll say to me, `What's wrong? He's playing all season _
he's in this league, that league, going to this camp, that camp . .
. why's he not getting better?' '' said Gill. ``I know, as a kid,
if there was a sport, I played it, whether it was baseball,
football, basketball _ absolutely everything _ I was out there
playing it and having a great time. But these kids who are all
hockey all the time, geez, give 'em a break. If you're playing one
sport your whole life, how do you get excited about it? Maybe when
you're in college, or if you make it to pro, then it's a different
story, because you're more mature.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as a kid, I think the most important thing is to be out
there having fun _ go out and play. If it's not fun, you won't get
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal Gill brought his game to Greensboro, an unlikely success
story in an unlikely place. But somehow it all fit.

MILESTONE FOR BUSH: CIA COMPLEX TO BE NAMED FOR FORMER PRESIDENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When George Bush walked into the troubled CIA in
1976, he feared he was kissing his political career goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   The secretive agency was under siege in Congress, and just to
get Bush's nomination to be director of central intelligence
through the Senate, President Ford pledged not to consider him as a
vice-presidential running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every friend I had in politics felt this would be the
dead end, the absolute end of any politics in the future for me,''
Bush said in an interview this week. ``And I kind of thought that
maybe was true ... That happily proved to be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush would become the only CIA director later to be elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the sprawling CIA complex in suburban Virginia will
be named the George Bush Center for Intelligence. He is so admired
there that a CIA official said: ``It will be like Elvis has
returned.''
</P>
<P>
   The move to name CIA headquarters for Bush was approved by
Congress in legislation introduced by Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who
was director of legislative affairs in Bush's White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, now retired in Houston, recalled his tenure at the CIA _
although it lasted just under a year _ as ``one of the biggest
challenges in my life ... one of the most interesting and rewarding
assignments I ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Then as president, Bush became the ultimate consumer of
intelligence material. His White House day usually began with a
briefing by a CIA officer. Some 60 percent of the material covered
issues not in the daily press, said John L. Helgerson, CIA deputy
inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   To protect the confidentiality of the eight- to 10-page report,
typewritten and marked ``Top Secret,'' Bush and a handful of aides
would read the document, ask questions and then give all copies
back to the agency representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very security conscious,'' said Charles Peters, who
gave Bush the early-morning intelligence briefing several times a
week throughout Bush's 12 years as vice president and president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I ever missed a day,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always thus. Agency veterans who gathered Thursday at
CIA headquarters to recount the Bush era said President Reagan
rarely received the intelligence briefing personally.
</P>
<P>
   During the Reagan presidency, one former CIA analyst said, the
written briefing was left with an aide, and Reagan ``read it
whenever he wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also was disturbed, the analyst said, when he would see a
CIA briefing paper lying unattended on staffer's White House desks
in the Reagan era.
</P>
<P>
   Peters conceded that the ``PDB'' _ or presidential daily brief _
did not correctly foresee every turn in international affairs. He
recalled that early in Bush's presidency, the report ``confidently
predicted'' re-election of leftist Daniel Ortega as president of
Nicaragua a few days before he was defeated by the pro-U.S.
challenger, Violeta Chamoro.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, Peters said, the CIA brief would differ from what
other government agencies were telling Bush. In the Persian Gulf
War, he said, the CIA doubted that as much Iraqi armament had been
destroyed in the opening air attacks as the Defense Department
contended.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very frank,'' Helgerson said _ whether the agency had
gotten something right or ``blown it.'' Bush was equally frank,
Helgerson said, when his own assessment of an international
development had been wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Bush arrived at the CIA in January 1976, after serving as U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, chairman of the Republican
National Committee and head of the U.S. mission in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morale was shot,'' Bush said, because of what he once called
``a handful of abuses'' and by House and Senate investigations
ramrodded by ``young, untutored, disrespectful'' congressional
staff members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had got ourselves really wrapped around the axle,''
Helgerson recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, also a former congressman, worked to calm congressional
criticism and to stem any residue of CIA abuse with what Helgerson
called ``controlled, sensible openness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The high regard in which Bush is held in this agency and
around town regarding his handling of intelligence is not just the
way he did it as president,'' Helgerson said. ``It was what he did
for us when he was here.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hedley, who also briefed Bush when he was vice president
and is now a CIA retiree, recalled: ``The morale boost was not
insignificant.''
</P>
<P>
   Helgerson said Bush not only ``got things back on track'' in
Ford's final year but for the next four administrations as well. He
said Bush gave detailed briefings to Jimmy Carter, who defeated
Ford in the 1976 election. Over the next three elections, Bush
became vice president and then president and, after his own defeat
in 1992, made certain that President-elect Clinton was made aware
of the importance of intelligence resources.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he retains high admiration for the cloak-and-dagger
side of the agency as well as for ``the very dedicated people who
never get their names in lights, never get to sit at the head
table.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not all James Bond and Miss Galore, if you will,'' Bush
said.

NEW PRE-HUMAN FOSSIL MAY BE EARLIEST TO USE TOOLS, EAT MEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sitting around a freshly-killed antelope by the edge of a large
lake, some of our earliest ancestors were using sharpened stone
tools to carve meat from the bones and to extract the marrow about
2.5 million years ago _ far earlier than any evidence for such tool
use has ever been seen before.
</P>
<P>
   These earliest-known, small-brained tool users may have been
embarking on an evolutionary journey that led directly to us, their
discoverers say. By learning to use sources of meat that other
primates could not, they may have set the stage for increasing
intelligence and a rapid spreading of their kind around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The new discoveries of animal bones with distinct markings from
the butchery carried out with stone tools, and some bones of the
ancient butchers themselves _ a never-before seen species that may
have been one of our direct ancestors _ were all found in the Awash
basin of Ethiopia and are being reported in the current edition of
the journal Science. The new finds could help to rewrite the tree
of human evolution, the researchers said, although it is still too
soon to say exactly how.
</P>
<P>
   The new finds may represent a kind of ``missing link'' between
early human ancestors of the genus Australopithecus, best know from
the famous ``Lucy'' skeleton found in 1978 by Donald Johansen, and
modern day humans of the genus Homo.
</P>
<P>
   Reconstructing the complex evolutionary process that led to
present day humans ``is all putting the pieces of a puzzle into
place,'' said Tim White, an anthropologist at the University of
California at Berkeley who led the 13-nation team of scientists
that made the discoveries. ``This is a major piece.''
</P>
<P>
   The earliest previous widely-accepted evidence of tool use dated
from about 1.8 million years ago. While others had made earlier
claims of possible tools from a similar age, the new finds for the
first time provide unambiguous evidence not only for tools, but for
exactly how they were used and for what purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The fossilized, butchered bones, when examined though a
microscope, provide ``incontrovertible evidence for human
modification of the bones,'' said J. Desmond Clark, another
Berkeley anthropologist who was part of the team. ``It's very
different from the marks left by carnivores such as hyenas.''
</P>
<P>
   With this discovery, the scientists have finally been able ``to
actually find the smoking gun, . . . the signature of those tools
on the bones themselves,'' White said Thursday in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, because of the close proximity of the bones of an
early human ancestor, the team has provided strong evidence of
exactly who was using the tools, which consisted of sharp flakes of
stone for carving, and large round stones for crushing bones. The
fragmentary bones of this ancient tool user have been given the
name Australopithecus garhi _ from an Ethiopian word for
``surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   The new species fills an important gap in the fossil record of
human ancestry in a region that has produced a longer record of our
forebears than anyplace else on Earth. Fossils found in the rift
valleys of East Africa extend all the way back to about 4.4 million
years ago, and include direct human ancestors less than 2 million
years old, but there had been a major gap in this record in the
critical period between 2 and 3 million years ago _ a period when
large brains and the use of tools were thought to have evolved.
</P>
<P>
   With this find, White said, Ethiopia's Middle Awash region,
where these fossils and may of the others have been found, ``has
become the world's most important single site for studying human
origins and evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the region is a harsh desert, but 2.5 million years ago
it was a grassy plain at the edge of a large lake full of catfish,
crocodiles and hippos. The plains themselves were populated by
herds of grazing antelope, predatory saber-toothed cats and hyenas,
and various now-extinct species. Among these fearsome competitors,
the relatively short, small-brained, large-toothed primate could
successfully compete only by its wits, by finding a new way of
using available resources.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that these 4-foot creatures were actually hunting
the large animals that they butchered, White said. Most likely,
they were scavengers, finding ways to extract meat from carcasses
abandoned by large cats or hyenas. The stone tools that have been
found at the site are suitable for processing a carcass _ cutting
through tough hides to get at the meat, and smashing the bones to
get the marrow _ but not suitable for hunting large game.
</P>
<P>
   But that put these animals into a position of ``competition with
the hyenas. All of a sudden, they're competing with very dangerous
animals,'' White said. With the combination of new food sources
that allowed their growth and spread, and dangers that may have
required great ingenuity to escape, ``perhaps that stands behind a
very rapid process of evolution,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear, the researchers say, whether this new
hominid is really a direct ancestor of modern humans, or perhaps
simply the beginning of another evolutionary line that later went
extinct. Only much more painstaking excavation at this Awash site
and others like it can answer such questions, and the arduous work
will continue this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The fossilized bones at the site were encrusted with minerals
identical to the surrounding stones, making it incredibly difficult
to locate the bones of interest. Just extracting a few fragments of
skull, leg and arm bones from the site required seven weeks of work
by a team that included 40 scientists from 13 nations.
</P>
<P>
   But such labor is well worth it, White said. ``To understand
where we came from, this is the only way to find out.''

DUTCH GOVERNMENT AND EL AL CRITICIZED FOR RESPONSE AFTER CRASH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ More than six years after an Israeli cargo plane crashed
into an apartment complex near Amsterdam, killing 43 people, an
official investigation sharply criticized the Dutch government and
the Israeli airline El Al Thursday for slow and inadequate
responses after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   A parliamentary commission, which began work six months ago,
published its conclusions Thursday in a 400-page report.
</P>
<P>
   The group said that local and national health authorities
consistently underestimated health complaints from rescue workers
and from residents of the area who were exposed to toxic smoke from
the burning wreck and apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   It also said it was incomprehensible that El Al did not respond
immediately to repeated Dutch requests for all the cargo documents.
It took El Al almost six years to provide satisfactory answers to
concerns about the cargo, and only this year, during the inquiry,
was the full cargo list revealed.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings in the Dutch Parliament, which included six weeks
of public sessions earlier this year, dominated the Dutch news.
Because of the foot-dragging over the cargo and the missing
evidence like the cockpit voice recorder, numerous conspiracy
theories were developed and suspicions were raised of a cover-up.
Investigative journalists, for example, wrote but never proved that
the voice recorder was taken from the wreck by Israeli security
personnel at the site.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry has debunked some of the theories, including the
notion that dangerous explosives and lethal weapons were on board
the Boeing 747 as it took off from Amsterdam's Schiphol airport on
the second leg of its flight from New York to Tel Aviv, Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not comment on the cargo, which burned in its
entirety. But it did say that cargo papers were now complete and
that there were no indications of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   After the crash, in October 1992, El Al described the freight as
perfumes, electronics and machine parts. But last year, following
Dutch news reports, the airline admitted that the cargo had
included chemicals used in making sarin nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the accident, metal fatigue in an engine mounting
which caused two engines to drop off, was established early on. But
the hearings here have pointed to other malfunctions. Airport
employees testified that El Al, while keeping tight security, was
casual and even negligent in the maintenance of its planes.
</P>
<P>
   The sessions also revealed flaws in the Dutch government
bureaucracy. The report said that after the crash, civil servants
failed to pass on crucial information to government ministers,
including the fact that the plane's ballast included carcinogenic
depleted uranium.
</P>
<P>
   Several government ministers did not provide Parliament with
accurate information and were lax in addressing public concerns,
the report said. Some of the report's strongest criticism was
reserved for the minister of health.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that, contrary to the government view, there was
a direct link between health complaints and the crash.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 people have reported physical complaints and
sleeping problems, but the government never deemed a full study
necessary. The report, however, linked the ailments to the sulphur
dioxide, metals, dioxins, asbestos and depleted uranium released
during the fire.

NATO TO STEP UP STRIKES ON SERB CONTROL CENTERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
and BENNETT ROTH 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Allied leaders insisted Thursday that they do not
intend to mount a ground invasion of Kosovo but will press ahead
with an intensified NATO air campaign that targets facilities used
as control centers by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
other Serb military and political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The comments followed a NATO missile attack Wednesday on one of
Milosevic's homes in Belgrade, an event that Yugoslav government
officials described as a a criminal attempt to assassinate the Serb
leader.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, however, U.S. and allied officials scoffed at the
claim, calling the strike that damaged one of Milosevic's two
primary residences a legitimate military action designed to take
out Yugoslav ``command-and-control systems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not targeting President Milosevic or the Serb people,''
Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon emphasized in his daily
briefing for reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He said the two-story villa that was destroyed was in effect ``a
command-and-control facility,'' complete with underground military
bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the military and security forces are run out of a
variety of residences, office buildings and other facilities
throughout the country, particularly in the Belgrade area,'' Bacon
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all interconnected with the political (Socialists)
party as well. And we have always said ... that the price is going
to be high in terms of degradation and damage to the military and
security structure, and this is one example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in a joint appearance at the White House with
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, also stressed that the allies
are not trying to kill Milosevic but would continue to focus
attacks on any ``key facilities used to direct and incite the
campaign of `ethnic cleansing''' of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by
Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also denied that allied plans to update a blueprint for
a ground invasion of Kosovo put together last fall is a precursor
to committing ground troops to battle against Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Solana has ordered U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme
commander, to revise the assessment of what size force it would
take to drive Milosevic's army and paramilitary units out of the
Serb province.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support the secretary general's position to update the
assessment. It's only prudent,'' Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But he emphasized that he believes the air campaign alone will
be enough to accomplish NATO's objectives of driving the Serbs out
and seeing to it that Kosovar refugees are allowed to return to
their homes under the protection of international security force.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton was speaking to reporters, the Russian Itar-Tass news
agency reported that Milosevic had agreed, in talks with Moscow
envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin, to accept the presence of an
international peacekeeping force in Kosovo. If true, it could
amount to a diplomatic breakthrough in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, however, sounded skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is an offer for a genuine security force, that's the
first Mr. Milosevic has done that, and that represents, I suppose,
a step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The Itar-Tass report said Chernomyrdin, on a peace mission to
Belgrade, had drawn up a document with Milosevic that calls for
``an international presence in Kosovo'' with Russian participation
and under United Nations control. But Yugoslav officials said it
also called for the pullback of NATO forces now deployed in
Macedonia and Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, reacting cautiously, said that any security force would
have to have ``the confidence of the people who live there and will
have to operate in a way that protects all the people there,
including the Serb minority.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said later that the allies would not
accept any agreement on a security force that does not include
NATO-led troops as a key element.

SCHOOL SHOOTING PROMPTS FLURRY OF ACTIVITY ON GUN-CONTROL
LEGISLATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL D. TOWLE 
and JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Colorado school shootings prompted a flurry of activity on
gun-control legislation Thursday in Washington and Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and some members of Congress said
they are preparing a package of measures to keep firearms away from
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is far too easy for a disturbed young person to get his
hands on a gun or a bomb and channel their anger into carnage,''
said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ``Let's not kid ourselves. It's
not possible to confront the epidemic of violence in our schools
without dealing with guns.''
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, pro-gun legislation now pending in the Texas
Legislature could be shot down in the aftermath of the Colorado
massacre, several lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of the legislation was voted out of committee on
Tuesday, the day of the school shooting, the mood is beginning to
shift, said the chairman of the House panel that decides when bills
go to the floor for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timing is terribly, terribly important,'' said Rep. Barry
Telford, D-DeKalb, the Calenders Committee chairman. ``I'm
beginning to hear, because of this tragedy, some real concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, some lawmakers urged a deliberate response to the
Littleton, Colo., shooting rather than simply pushing gun-control
measures previously rejected by the Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Irving, said he would
expedite House legislation to set up a national panel of experts to
study teen-age gun violence and make recommendations to educators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Professional understanding through a very thorough, systematic
process is the thing that is critically needed here, not a quick
political statement,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   But Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder, speaking at a Justice
Department briefing, urged quick legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that one of the positive things that would come
out of this very tragic event in Littleton would be the passage of
the legislation that we will be proposing,'' Holder said. ``The
vast majority of the American people support reasonable
restrictions on the possession of guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposals that the administration is expected to send to
Congress within two weeks would:
</P>
<P>
   _Require companies selling weapons at gun shows to perform the
same background checks gun shop owners must perform.
</P>
<P>
   _Prohibit juveniles who have committed violent crimes from
possessing handguns.
</P>
<P>
   _Stiffen penalties for adults who sell or give handguns to
juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   _Require gun makers to install trigger locks on the guns they
sell.
</P>
<P>
   _Impose a three-day cooling-off period before a handgun can be
transferred to a purchaser.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Frost, D-Dallas, said he was not sure that
tightening gun-control laws would make schools safer. But he said
he would reintroduce legislation _ the Safe Schools Act, killed in
committee last year _ that would provide $175 million to hire law
enforcement officers to patrol schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to look at the different options,'' said Frost, who
will speak today to students at Arlington High School and Sam
Houston High School, about the Colorado shootings. ``We need to
talk about counseling and police in the schools and a whole range
of issues. You can't just focus on gun control.''
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Telford, the calendars committee chairman, stressed
that he is a gun-rights supporter.
</P>
<P>
   But he said legislators have expressed concerns about a bill
that would lower the age limit to 18 for concealed weapons
licenses, provided the applicant is a member of the armed forces,
the state militia or National Guard, and another bill allowing
concealed weapons on college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you had youngsters involved so heavily in this tragedy
in Colorado, it has a lot of the members very nervous,'' Telford
said.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills are the work of Rep. Suzanna Hupp, R-Lampasas. Hupp,
who ran on a pro-gun agenda after her parents were slain in the
1991 Luby's massacre in Killeen, said lawmakers should be expanding
gun rights, not restricting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This knee-jerk reaction that we are seeing of certain groups
asking for more gun control is ludicrous,'' she said. ``I am
suggesting that perhaps we should consider allowing our teachers
and administrators to carry concealed (weapons) if they so choose.
Our schools are supposed to be gun free zones. Where has that
gotten us?''
</P>
<P>
   Another pending bill would, with certain exceptions, shield the
firearms industry from lawsuits by governmental entities, including
cities, counties and hospital districts. It passed the Senate, but
the bill's fate in the House is unclear. A similar measure in
Florida was postponed in the wake of the Colorado massacre.
</P>
<P>
   ``We operate on emotions, unfortunately,'' said state Rep. Bill
Carter, R-Fort Worth, a leading force behind the state's
conceal-and-carry law. ``We will see an overreaction, I think, to
the Colorado incidents for the wrong reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, a gun restriction measure _ requiring instant
background checks for weapons sales at guns show _ got the backing
of Gov. George W. Bush the day after the Colorado massacre.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, sponsored by state Rep. Debra Danburg, D-Houston, was
defeated in committee, but the lawmaker said she would try to
resurrect it.

STUDY QUESTIONS GENE INFLUENCE ON MALE HOMOSEXUALITY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Calif., Md., Ontario)   (jw) 
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Underscoring the difficulty scientists face in finding genes
that underlie complex human behaviors, a team of researchers are
reporting Friday that they have been unable to confirm a widely
publicized study linking male homosexuality to a small region of
one chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in behavioral genetics say the new report, which appears
in the journal Science, does not invalidate the notion that genes
influence sexual orientation, which many scientists believe is the
case, on the basis of other types of studies. Nor do the new
results completely rule out the possibility that a gene or genes
for homosexuality lie on the chromosome in question, the
X-chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   But the failure to replicate the earlier study is typical of the
zigzagging course of research efforts to ferret out genes that
influence complicated traits, or that contribute to illnesses with
a behavioral component, like schizophrenia, manic depression,
alcoholism and hypertension.
</P>
<P>
   And since the question of whether homosexuality is innate is
politically charged, the new findings will very likely revive
discussion of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In the new study, a team of Canadian researchers tried to
replicate work by Dean Hamer, a geneticist at the National Cancer
Institute. In a 1993 study of 40 pairs of homosexual brothers,
Hamer reported that in 33 of the pairs _ more than would be
expected by chance _ an area on the bottom half of the X-chromosome
was identical, indicating that one or more genes in that region,
called Xq28, could be connected to the brothers' sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   In men, the X-chromosome is inherited from the mother. It pairs
with the Y-chromosome to form the so-called sex chromosomes, the
last of the 23 pairs of chromosomes that appear in all cells of the
human body.
</P>
<P>
   A second study by Hamer's laboratory, published in 1995, also
found evidence for such a link, though the effect seen was smaller.
</P>
<P>
   But the Canadian researchers, who studied 52 pairs of homosexual
brothers, concluded that their results ``do not support an X-linked
gene underlying male homosexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel these findings need to be taken seriously,'' said Neil
Risch, professor of genetics and statistics at Stanford University,
who performed the statistical analysis of the data for the new
study and is a co-author on the paper. ``If there is an effect
there, it is pretty small.''
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists greeted the new findings with interest and
caution. Dr. Kenneth Kendler, the Banks distinguished professor of
psychiatry at Virginia Commonwealth University, said none of the
studies so far was large enough for scientists to reach a firm
conclusion about whether such a gene is present on the
X-chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are now three reports that produce data relevant to this
question,'' Kendler said, ``one strongly positive, one modestly
positive and one strongly negative. Does this new report show
conclusively that there is no evidence? No, that is too strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Detecting genes that influence complicated traits is a
formidable task, he said, and current technology is limited.
``Fifty years from now we're going to look back at this and say we
were toddlers stumbling around in a playpen,'' Kendler said. ``This
is a raw science at this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also a highly contentious one. As news of the research
spread this week, Hamer, the author of the original report, and the
Canadian investigators offered conflicting interpretations of the
results.
</P>
<P>
   Hamer contended that the Canadian team, led by Dr. George Rice
at the University of Western Ontario, did not find the gene linkage
because the families of the brothers they studied were not
representative of those likely to have an X-linked gene, as
indicated by the number of homosexual relatives on the mother's
side. The researchers, Hamer said, identified 182 families, but
only obtained DNA from 48. These families ``were not a random
subset,'' he said, and had the others been included the gene
linkage might have been found.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, Hamer contended in a telephone interview, shows
only ``that not every case of male homosexuality is linked to the
X-chromosome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the question of whether there is a gene on the
X-chromosome will be ultimately resolved by either finding the gene
or not finding the gene,'' Hamer said.
</P>
<P>
   Rice responded in an e-mail that selection of the study's
participants was ``totally random.'' He said that only 48 families
were included because ``we could not get blood samples from the
rest.'' And the researchers said the families in their study were
``not very different'' from those studied by Hamer.
</P>
<P>
   David Smith, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign in
Washington, the largest national gay and lesbian lobbying group,
said that although studies indicated there was a biological basis
for sexual orientation, the evidence was still inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the final analysis,'' Smith said, ``we don't believe these
studies should have a significant influence in the public policy
debate on whether to treat gay and lesbian people fairly and
equally, whether they conclusively prove a `gay gene' or not.''

 &HT;    Cox buys cable TV cluster in Virginia
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta-based Cox Communications has agreed to buy
Media General's cable television division for $1.4 billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, expected to close late this year, gives Cox 260,000
customers in Northern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The Media General cable customers are in Virginia's Fairfax
County, the city of Fredericksburg and parts of Stafford and
Spotsylvania counties.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications is one of the 10 largest cable television
companies, with about 3.8 million subscribers. Cox already has more
than 450,000 cable television customers in Virginia, located in the
Hampton Roads area on Virginia's coast and in the Roanoke area.
</P>
<P>
   The move fits into Cox Communications' strategy of offering a
range of broadband communications products in large metropolitan
areas, said Amy Porter, a Cox Communications spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   This part of Northern Virginia is growing fast and has lots of
upper-income residents who are more likely to subscribe to the
advanced media products Cox offers in its larger markets, Porter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Porter said Cox research showed the Northern Virginia
communities had more home PCs than most communities and a higher
number of people with Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond standard cable television, Cox Communications products
include high-speed Internet access, digital cable television and
digital phone service. Media General offered cable television and
high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises, a privately held media
conglomerate, controls both Cox Communications and The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.

AUTHORITIES IN TEXAS SEEK MOTHER OF TWO SLAIN TODDLERS 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGETOWN, Texas _ Investigators Thursday searched for the
mother of a boy and girl whose bodies were found dumped in a rural
creek bed earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Attention turned to the mother, 22-year-old Tina Marie
Cornelius, who is sought for questioning but has not been named as
a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The mother, apparently single, has lived in the Austin-Round
Rock area with the children for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The small children, whose identities eluded authorities until
Wednesday evening, have been identified as Amanda Lee Miller, 3,
and Dominick Logan Cornelius, 2. Autopsies revealed the girl was
suffocated and the boy killed by a blunt blow to his skull.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's unusual for a woman to have two children missing and
not be able to find her,'' said Texas Department of Public Safety
spokesman Mike Cox.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we're trying to find her, to make sure she's OK, to
see if she knows anything about where the children might have been
or anything like that. That's what's critical right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Linda Bunte, head of the Williamson County sheriff's
criminal investigation unit, and Cox said authorities have not
issued any arrest warrants or identified any suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are concerned that the mother ``might be in
danger,'' Bunte said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking for the mother ... because her children are
dead,'' Cox added. ``We are not calling the mother a suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius was last seen by relatives a week ago and was driving
a 1990 white Pontiac Grand Prix with a Texas license plate of ZPC
70M, Bunte said.
</P>
<P>
   She said it was a day-care center in Austin that helped
investigators identify the children and mother, after seeing
sketches of them and descriptions reported in the media. Day-care
workers said the last time they had seen the three was April 14.
</P>
<P>
   It has proved the first big break in the case since the little
bodies were discovered Monday afternoon in Brushy Creek near the
farming town of Hutto.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they have been in contact with several family
members, some of whom live in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first and most important call received was from the
day-care center,'' Cox said. ``Someone at the day-care center
snapped on the type of diapers they had on. That's what led to the
initial information.''
</P>
<P>
   Both children were wearing Mickey Mouse pull-up diapers, his
blue and hers pink.
</P>
<P>
   Bunte said the day-care workers noticed no signs of trouble with
the mother or children last week.
</P>
<P>
   A search of records so far shows no reports of abuse to child
protection workers, said Marla Sheely, spokeswoman for the Texas
Department of Protective and Regulatory Services.
</P>
<P>
   Bunte said authorities are now trying to re-create the last days
before the bodies were found and the mother disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The mother had worked at several occupations, most recently as a
dancer at a south Austin strip club called Expose, according to The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   A dancer, who identified herself only as Joy, and several other
employees of the club told The Associated Press that Cornelius had
worked there for about three weeks. Joy said she had not seen
Cornelius in more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she was going away and was going to leave her kids
with some friends for the weekend,'' Joy said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cornelius had moved from the Austin address on her driver's
license, perhaps several times within the area, said DPS
spokeswoman Tela Mange.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking for anyone who has seen this woman, who has
seen these children, who has seen these two together,'' Cox said.
``If they can call and tell us that `yes they were at such and such
a convenience store buying a six-pack' or whatever, that's what we
need right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the children had two different fathers who are
thought to live outside the state. Reports conflicted as to whether
the fathers had been located, informed or questioned about the
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said the children were positively identified Wednesday by
relatives escorted by a sheriff's deputy to a funeral home in
Taylor where the bodies were sent after undergoing autopsies in
Fort Worth.

EFFORT TO FUND EDUCATION FOCUSES ON PROPERTY TAXES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N. H. _ In joyless votes taken just minutes apart, New
Hampshire's House and Senate Thursday passed similar tax bills to
pay for public schools. Legislators will now meet in a conference
committee to hammer out their differences, bringing the state a
step closer toward resolving a crisis that has dominated politics
for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today marks a milestone in our efforts to resolve the
school-funding issue,'' said Gov. Jeanne Shaheen. The state supreme
court gave lawmakers until April 1 of this year to replace the old
system of funding schools, which relied heavily on local property
taxes. The deadline passed without a plan.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers cautioned, however, that Thursday's developments
do not represent a major step forward. The bills that passed were
seen by many as at most a temporary fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desperate people in desperate times do desperate things,''
said Sen. Edward Gordon by way of explaining why most of his
colleagues were voting for a plan they neither liked or thought
fair.
</P>
<P>
   Others worried that the Thursday's agreement, if it were the
basis of a final agreement, might not sustain a court challenge
because it does not raise enough money. Still others fear that the
court will frown on provisions in both bills that would soften the
blow for property-rich towns that would otherwise see tax bills
skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be sure when I vote for something, that we are not
going to go down an unconstitutional road again,'' said Sen.
Beverly Hollingworth, an income tax proponent.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills rely heavily on a statewide property tax and
increased taxes on business. The Senate version calls for the state
to pay $841 million of the estimated $1.4 billion cost of public
education. The House bill raises $808 million.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to meet that deadline has led Wall Street to warn that
the state's credit rating is in danger of being downgraded. With
money to operate schools due to run out by July most of the state's
teachers have now received pink slips.
</P>
<P>
   The political environment continues to be chaotic, but most now
expect some kind of legislative agreement, and a vote, within the
next week.

 &HT;    Charter investigating allegations, questions CBS reporting
methods
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Charter Behavioral Health Systems said Thursday it's
conducting an internal investigation of charges made by the CBS
News program ``60 Minutes II'' about practices in the
Alpharetta-based company's psychiatric hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Charter said its inquiry is standard company practice when
patient care allegations are reported. And the company, which
operates 91 psychiatric hospitals in 32 states, repeated earlier
assertions that CBS News may have violated North Carolina and
federal laws in reporting the story.
</P>
<P>
   The hourlong segment Wednesday alleged dangerous conditions,
falsification of medical records and lack of employee training in
Charter hospitals. The program also alleged injuries and deaths in
Charter hospitals. Charter officials stood by earlier statements
that patients' safety, privacy and well-being are the company's
primary concerns. The company also said it does not condone
violations of policies, including falsifying records, and would
take disciplinary actions if it found violations.
</P>
<P>
   The program, anchored by Ed Bradley, based much of its reporting
on a hidden camera worn by a social worker, Terrance Johnson, who
worked for eight weeks in a Charter hospital in Charlotte. Johnson
was not paid by the network, CBS News said.
</P>
<P>
   ``60 Minutes II'' went to great lengths to protect patient
confidentiality, obscuring patients' faces, changing their voices
and appearance, Bradley said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Network spokeswoman Kerri Weitzberg added: ``We proceeded very
carefully every step along the way in reporting this story. We are
confident that we operated fully within the law.''
</P>
<P>
   But Charter attorney Steve Petrovich said that with the use of a
hidden camera and microphone, ``Charter believes that (Johnson)
invaded our patients' confidentiality and intruded on their
privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited North Carolina law protecting patient confidentiality
and patient medical records, and protections for psychiatric
patients and their treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Charter, citing confidentiality concerns, filed a motion for a
temporary restraining order in Federal District Court in Charlotte
late Tuesday to keep the program from being aired. Judge Graham
Mullen denied the request.
</P>
<P>
   But Mullen also expressed concern that laws may have been broken
in the gathering of the information for the report. Mullen said he
would refer the matter to the U.S. attorney's office to look into
whether federal mail fraud laws were violated.
</P>
<P>
   The media's use of hidden cameras has not been settled in the
courts, said David Hudson, an attorney with the First Amendment
Center in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a greater amount of (legal) protection for publication
of material than the acquisition of it,'' Hudson said. ``We really
need to have some guidance on how much protection there is.''
</P>
<P>
   A North Carolina jury two years ago ordered ABC to pay $5.5
million for using a hidden camera in an investigation of Food Lion
supermarkets. The award, reduced to $315,000, is under appeal.

 &HT;    Georgia-Pacific profit rises sharply
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia-Pacific Group beat analysts' expectations and
reported a sharp increase in first-quarter profit Thursday, boosted
by a rise in prices and shipments of building products.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific Group, which excludes the Atlanta-based
company's timber business, posted net income of $99 million for the
first quarter, or $1.13 a share, from the year-ago profit of $4
million, or 4 cents a share. The year-ago figure included $12
million in charges for early retirement of debt.
</P>
<P>
   First-quarter revenue grew to $3.35 billion, a 5 percent
increase from $3.19 billion one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific was expected to earn $1.02 a share, based on a
survey of analysts by First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The company is benefiting from an exceptionally strong housing
market, which is boosting sales of its gypsum wallboard, plywood
and oriented strand board. Meanwhile, the company's pulp, paper and
packaging businesses were mixed but are recovering from slumping
prices last year caused by the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Profit more than doubled at Georgia-Pacific's
construction-materials unit, which makes lumber, plywood and other
types of panels. The unit had a profit of $248 million, compared
with $103 million in the year-ago period. Georgia-Pacific also made
money distributing such materials, a business that had a loss a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings at the company's packaging unit rose, but profits fell
about 70 percent for pulp and paper operations because of low
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Georgia-Pacific's timber business reported a drop in
first-quarter net income. Timber Co. earned $46 million, or 53
cents a share. A year earlier, Timber Co. posted net income of $50
million, or 54 cents a share, including a $2 million charge for
early retirement of debt.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue declined 4 percent to $139 million, compared with $145
million in the year-ago period.

 &HT;    Net.B(at)nk in black for 4th quarter in row
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Net.B(at)nk on Thursday announced its fourth straight
profitable quarter and met analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The Alpharetta-based, Internet-only bank posted net income of
$691,000, 9 cents per share, compared with a loss of $151,000, or 2
cents per share, for the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   Net.B(at)nk shares are up 10 percent the past five days, 540
percent for 1999. The stock hit a 52-week high of $249 April 14.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Keane, an analyst with BancBoston Robertson Stephens, said
earning are not the top priority for Internet banks _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their job right now is to try to market and get out there and
get customers,'' Keane said. ``27,000 accounts _ that's a huge
number. That's up 10,000 in four months. That's huge growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Net.B(at)nk said customer accounts, which grew by 3,000 in March
and are up 2,400 so far in April, now total 27,000. That number is
up from 17,400 at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Since opening in October 1996, Net.B(at)nk (www.netbank.com) has
attracted customers because of a unique business model that lets it
offer traditional banking services more cheaply than most because
it is based solely on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   D.R. Grimes, chief executive officer, attributed the growth to a
sixfold increase in the company's marketing spending. Net.B(at)nk's
$3.6 million marketing budget paid for ads on 60 Web sites and in
national newspapers. The company also started mailing brochures to
people who pay their Internet service provider by credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Customer deposits now exceed $332 million, up from $128.7
million in the year-ago period. Net.B(at)nk has $526.5 million in
total assets, up from $163.5 million at the end of the first
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   If Net.B(at)nk grows at its current pace, Grimes said it could
have more than 50,000 accounts by year's end. Grimes said
Net.B(at)nk increased its percentage of checking and money-market
account customers from 50 percent of the bank's total accounts in
September to 66 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Customers who conduct their checking transactions at the site
tend to be more frequent visitors than those with certificates of
deposit accounts. They also tend to be longer-term customers,
Grimes said.
</P>
<P>
   Net.B(at)nk's per-share numbers do not reflect its previously
announced 3-for-1 stock split, which happens May 14.

COMMENTARY: SECRETS OF THE WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The train pulls in and the refugees are herded out. Then they
are sold to waiting merchants, into slavery. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Slavery, not forced labor or some such euphemism. Slavery, do
you hear _ branded, flogged, raped, tortured into renouncing their
religion, and then put to work for their owners. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They were captured and sold in Sudan by government soldiers and
militia. Relatives who escaped capture starve: the regime will not
allow food to reach them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A friend asks why, after writing often about human rights, I
oppose the war against Serbia, ruled by a dictator. I do not put
dictators into two groups _ one to oppose, the other to strengthen
because they are customers. The one word for Slobodan Milosevic and
all dictators, whatever their religion or country, is: killer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I oppose the war because it has been mismanaged, misplanned,
politically, diplomatically and strategically slovenly and
amateurish _ adding up to disaster for the victims. This air war
allowed Milosevic to drive Albanians out of Kosovo. It gave him
information that should have been top secret _ that the United
States would not send in ground forces. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The only way it has helped human rights is to make more
disgusting the icy Western attitude to other huge human rights
crimes, as the massacres and slave trains in Sudan. They could have
been stopped without war.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now two roads are open to recoup what our leaders lost in
Kosovo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We can send in hundreds of thousands of troops _ without
illusion. The dictator will exact as many NATO lives as he can and
his goal will be to spread the war throughout the Balkans, and
beyond.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Or we can negotiate out. But then we must use the years
afterward to strengthen the Serbian democratic-minded opposition
against the dictator, with a smidgen of the financial investment of
the Kosovo war, and little of Serbian and Kosovar blood.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And without forgetting Yugoslavia, the West could remember that
in Asia and Africa are human rights violations amounting to
genocide. Even in peace, the West now struggles for human rights
only where its trade interests are not risked.  &QL;

<P>
   China's president was pleasant in Beijing to America's president
about easing the pain of Tibet, 50 years a captive nation. He lied
to a man who longed to be lied to. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As crackdowns in Tibet and China increase, and knowledge of
Beijing's nuclear-weapon espionage is uncovered, Washington
campaigns to give China the economic benefits of the World Trade
Organization.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unsaid is that Beijing's membership would formally wipe out any
effort to use the only human rights tools we have in China. Those
tools are linking trade with easing persecution and warning allies
we will exact economic reprisal if they then double-cross us by
sopping up our China trade. We would rank people as important as
bananas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We ignore Sudan. Why? Oh, come on. For 16 years, the ruling
Arabs of the North have been at war against Southern Sudanese,
mostly Christian or animists, and all, you know, black.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We could help the victims by positioning monitoring stations in
the territory they still control, sending food directly to them,
overflying the government blockade, by treating Khartoum as an
enemy economically, and its prey as an ally.
</P>
<P>
   American moral honor is upheld by some among us _ the students
working on the Campaign of Conscience for Sudan, the Center for
Religious Freedom of Freedom House, and a few legislators.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This capsule comes from Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan: More Southern
Sudanese have died from guns, bombs and starvation than all the
victims in Bosnia, Kosovo and Rwanda combined _ at least 1.9
million. About 2.6 million face starvation because of genocidal
withholding of food, and 4.3 million were driven from their homes _
the largest displaced population in the world.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elie Wiesel, supportive of NATO in Kosovo, asked President
Clinton publicly why we had not been involved in Rwanda. Clinton
said he would do his best to make sure there was not another
Rwanda. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sudan had slipped his mind. So has his overdue obligation to
appoint presidential members of the commission against religious
persecution, passed by Congress. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Slaves. The number in Sudan can roughly be estimated _ tens of
thousands. Only owners take precise slave-counts.

 &HT;    Portman firm sells asset to pay debt
 &HT;    By Sallye Salter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AMC Inc., the firm created in John C. Portman Jr.'s
huge debt restructuring in 1995, has paid off $8 million in debt
through the sale of its stake in a San Francisco mixed-use office
complex and is seeking an extension of a $93.1 million mortgage due
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The financial actions of AMC, which owns the large downtown
Atlanta trade mart complex developed by Portman, were disclosed in
a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. While
AMC's stock is not publicly traded, it is required to file with the
SEC because some of its debt is traded in the public market.
</P>
<P>
   Architect-developer Portman had acquired a minority interest in
Embarcadero Center through his participation in creation of the
landmark San Francisco complex in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   That interest was among the assets Portman transferred to AMC
when the firm was formed to allow Portman creditors to exchange
debt for ownership interests in AMC. Portman is chairman and chief
executive officer of AMC.
</P>
<P>
   The $8 million debt _ which had the highest repayment priority
of AMC's debt _ was incurred to obtain working capital to keep the
complex operating during Portman's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Funds for the payoff came in late 1998 when Boston Properties, a
real estate investment trust, acquired Embarcadero Center.
</P>
<P>
   In the sale, AMC received an unspecified amount of cash plus
partnership units, valued at $22.2 million, in a Boston Properties
affiliate. AMC then sold a portion of the units to FBCC, a
Dallas-based firm that is part of the Hunt family business
organization and is AMC's largest shareholder. From that firm, AMC
received $7.4 million _ $4.5 million in cash and $2.9 million in
exchange for debt.
</P>
<P>
   AMC's remaining debt totals $281.7 million. The company said it
has requested, but not received, a one-year extension of the $93.1
million mortgage on the Atlanta Gift Mart due July 31. The lender
is Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
   The company owes $181.6 million in mart bonds due July 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year ago, AMC hired Victor Capital Group of New York
to pursue a capital restructuring, refinancing or sale of the
company or some of its assets.
</P>
<P>
   A mart refinancing package, consisting mainly of bonds and bank
debt, was circulated on Wall Street this spring.

 &HT;    How can you tell when your kid is headed for real trouble?
 &HT;    By By Christine Evans and Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It was everywhere this week _ the sound
of parents worrying about their kids. The clothes they wear. The
music they worship. The games they play. Alienation and isolation.
Cliques. Outcasts. Peer pressure. And, of course, guns.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Tuesday's school shootings, an unimaginable
rampage by two black-clad students that left 15 dead and many more
wounded at an entirely normal public high school tucked into the
suburbs in Littleton, Colo., parents whispered with furrowed brows
around breakfast tables and water coolers. How do you know, they
asked one another, if your kid is in trouble?
</P>
<P>
   Not stay-out-late, graffiti-on-the-wall,
talk-back-and-dress-funny trouble. Real trouble.
</P>
<P>
   How far is too far? Where is the line between fun and frenzy?
When is a trenchcoat a portent of doom?
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you tell?'' asked Randy Stafford, a psychologist at the
alternative Gold Coast Community School in West Palm Beach. ``You
have to listen very, very carefully. You have to take every
opportunity you have to talk to your child. Sure, people are busy.
But the car is a very good place. Make good use of the car. Let
your kids listen to their music in the car, and then ask questions
about it. `What are you listening to? Why do you like it?' But
don't interrogate them. Don't judge them. Use it as a springboard,
a sort of communication trampoline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Start talking, and keep talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Details about the two suspected shooters in the Littleton
tragedy are still spilling out, amid the tears and the sudden snow
and the hundreds of police interviews that have turned the town
into a chilly, confusing place with too many questions and precious
few answers. They were 17 and 18. They wore black trench coats,
black lipstick, black trousers. At the bowling alley, they were
seen flashing the Nazi salute. And after they killed 12 students
and one teacher, they turned their guns and killed themselves.
</P>
<P>
   There were, it seems, so many warning signs; there usually are
in cases like this _ children rarely suddenly ``snap,'' turning
from good to bad in a single breath overnight. But here and across
the country this week, people who teach and counsel and study
children had two pieces of advice for parents worried about some
aspect of their children's behavior: Don't panic. And don't clam
up.
</P>
<P>
   Find out more. Calmly.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Stafford says, ``When you talk to some kids who
identify themselves as Satan worshippers, some of them have only a
very general, superficial knowledge. They may have five books at
home on this stuff, but they haven't read any of them. So when
parents say their child makes devil signs, this kind of thing, I
say, `Tell me more. Is it really a significant part of their
lives?'''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Tonya Aultman-Bettridge of the Center for the Study and
Prevention of Violence: ``Parents should know how the child is
doing in school and pay attention to complaints about their
behavior. They shouldn't panic and call a psychologist the minute
they see him wearing a Marilyn Manson T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big difference between listening to a type of music
and building pipe bombs in the basement.''
</P>
<P>
   The center is affiliated with the University of Colorado at
Boulder, just 32 miles from the site of the shooting spree at
Columbine High School in Littleton. Center researchers studying
youth violence have identified a number of ``risk factors'' that
might contribute to over-the-edge behavior.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a child might be at risk if he or she keeps
constant company with friends who provide a negative influence _
the notorious ``bad crowd'' _ or if their parents cannot properly
supervise them. Doing poorly in school can be another factor
(parents should watch for a sudden and deep decline in grades), and
so can living in a neighborhood where firearms are readily
available.
</P>
<P>
   Research also shows that in children, remarkable acts of
violence _ such as Tuesday's mass shootings _ often are preceded by
smaller, less remarkable violent acts. Killing animals, for
instance. Often, an at-risk youth is significantly depressed and
angry as well; perhaps he has threatened suicide; perhaps he
bullies others; maybe he drinks and abuses drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this is common sense. But there's no formula, cautions
Aultman-Bettridge, ``no easy way, no one thing you can look at and
say, this child is going to be violent.'' And parents should take
care not to grow overly alarmed by the usual signs of teen-age
rebellion or discontent, or, certainly, styles of dressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most kids who have tattoos on their arms and bandanas on their
heads and wear a certain type of clothes are just kids,'' says Eric
Gorovitz, legal director for the Pacific Center for Violence
Prevention in California. ``There are some kids who are violent who
wear these clothes as well, but it's terrifying to say if somebody
has a tattoo, you'd better worry.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are clues.
</P>
<P>
   And parents, and anybody else on hand, should watch for them.
</P>
<P>
   At Boca Middle School, for instance, teachers, parents and even
the principal can glean clues from the organizers that students
keep to set goals and chart progress in school. In the normal
course of a school week, parents and teachers take a look at the
organizers to see how a child is doing, and the principal, Dick
Reed, regularly looks them over to check reading logs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take a look at what he or she is writing, and the doodlings
and drawings,'' Reed says, keeping an eye out for violent lyrics,
gang symbols, drug-related sketches, or ``the portrayal of a lot of
death.'' If there is something really wrong, ``there ought to be
some signs in there.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, says Janet Hibel, president-elect of the Palm Beach
County chapter of the Florida Psychological Association, parents
should pay particular attention to electronic leisure time, such as
video games. If your child is in the bedroom, with the door closed,
the lights off, whooping it up at the action on screen, this might
be simply a normal display of enthusiasm for a game that is fun.
Or, it might be something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents should not have a benign acceptance of these games as
just entertainment,'' Hibel says. ``They really need to sit down
and talk about what is being gratified in their child as they play
these games ... Are they getting gratification out of harming or
killing somebody? Are they deriving a sense of superiority by
identifying with the aggressor or violent hero? Are the games
giving them a sense of identity they're not getting in a healthy
way on the outside?''
</P>
<P>
   But again, she says, don't panic. Be observant, not alarmist.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the parent is looking for is a balance in the child's
life. So, yeah, they have these games but they have other things in
their lives, too, some other way of obtaining healthy
gratification. And the other point is, can they talk about what
they're getting? Can they say it's fun? Can they understand it's a
fantasy world?''
</P>
<P>
   In other words: Do they live in the real one?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at the whole child,'' says psychologist
Stafford. ``Are they doing well in school? Are they connected to
family members? Do they have a job? Are they part of a social
activity, sports, clubs? Are they isolated or are they connected?
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking, that's pretty good information.''

CLINTON ATTEMPTS TO CALM STUDENTS IN WAKE OF SHOOTINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. _ T.C. Williams High is not Columbine High, and
Alexandria, Va., is not Littleton, Colo. But the deadliest school
shooting spree in US history has left a trail of fear among
students coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, President Clinton tried to restore a certain degree of
calm during a visit that was beamed to 12,000 schools across the
country by Channel 1, a national classroom cable network, and on
CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in orange plastic chairs arranged in a circle in the
school library, Clinton told the 30 T.C. Williams students who
joined him for the discussion, ``On balance, our schools are still
the safest place our kids can be in most communities under most or
all circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Clinton and and the students struggled to understand
why Tuesday's school shooting, which ended with 15 dead and dozens
injured at Columbine High, happened, and what could be done to make
sure it never happens again.
</P>
<P>
   Because the students presumed to be the killers, both of whom
died of self-inflicted wounds, learned how to make explosives via
the Internet and may have targeted athletes and minorities, some
students wondered aloud whether easy access to such material on the
Internet was the culprit, or whether it was racism, or violent
movies and videos, or the accessibility of guns, or lapses in
guidance at school or home that would turn a good child bad.
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton: ``We don't know all the facts about what happened
in Littleton, but one of the things that's come out of this that's
really made an impression on me is that the young men who were
involved in this horrible act apparently felt that they were
subject to ridicule and ostracism, and they were kind of social
outcasts at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``But their reaction to it was to find someone else to look down
on. And, apparently, they were very prejudiced against
African-Americans and Hispanics, and observed Adolf Hitler's
birthday, and otherwise reacted to that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added, ``They had the wrong reaction to the fact that
they were dissed. Hey, look, everybody gets dissed sometime in
life. Even the president; sometimes especially the president.''
</P>
<P>
   The students meeting with the president were all conflict
mediators at the school, or enrolled in an advanced placement
government class. Their school district has placed a high priority
on school safety, including establishing a zero-tolerance policy on
weapons and drugs, instituting anger-management programs, promoting
peer-conflict mediation, and offering a hotline that students can
call anonymously to report potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   But such efforts to reduce the chances of school violence campus
have not completely erased their anxiety, especially since
Littleton has become only the latest in a series of school
shootings that occurred in places like Paducah, Ken., Jonesboro,
Ark., and Springfield, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``When is there going to be a change?'' Jonelle Mitchell, a
senior, asked Clinton. ``I mean, there's been a lot of acts of
violence in the schools recently...As a student, I need to have
that guarantee of safety, and truthfully, I really don't feel safe
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mitchell said she feels safer in her school than she would
in some others, she asked: ``I want to know when is the government,
when are you going to do something for the other students out
there'' who attend schools with fewer resources to combat school
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the government published a booklet on school safety
last June, after the Springfield shoting, to help adults detect
early warning signals to head off school violence. He also said his
administration hosted the first-ever White House conference on
school violence last year, and he plans to send a new crime bill to
Congress next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times we forget that a small crack can cause a big
problem'' said student Luisa Soaterna. ``There are things which
occur in life, or things that you hear when you're walking down the
hallway and we just think nothing of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students said a lack of diversity at the Littleton high
school may have triggered the violence or, at the very least,
negative racial attitudes. ``The racism should stop, because the
racism leads to bad things, like what happened in Colorado,'' said
student Sindy Benavides. ``Racism cannot produce anything good.''
</P>
<P>
   Another student, Tyler Cotrone told Clinton tougher gun-control
laws also are needed. ``I know we already have a waiting period on
how long you can get guns or whatever, but I think we need to take
some other action to make regulations on weapons and other guns, so
that they don't fall into the hands of the wrong people, and this
sort of thing doesn't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was planning legislation to try to ``strike a
better, proper balance between making it harder for people who are
violent to get guns and misuse them, without interfering with the
constructive role'' of guns for recreational use.
</P>
<P>
   One student warned Clinton not to seek ``the easy answer,'' such
as restricting the rights of students by requiring them to wear
school uniforms or carry clear backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be careful that we ensure people's security without
running high school like a prison system,'' said the student,
Patrick Egan. ``I'm really worried that in the wake of a disaster
like this, then the first thing people are going to say is, `Oh,
they're kids, their rights don't matter. You can just take them
away, take away their freedom of speech, take away their freedom to
be a person.' And I just hope that that doesn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Responded Clinton, ``I think that's a point well taken.''

WHAT IS GREAT ART? DEPENDS ON WHOM YOU ASK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ ``Great'' is a word we easily apply to
athletic performance, bargain prices, a new hairstyle or piece of
clothing. Occasionally, we even use it to describe art.
</P>
<P>
   Most of this year, the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth has been
showing works by two men almost universally acknowledged as the
greatest artists of the first half of the 20th century: Henri
Matisse and Pablo Picasso. Even those who don't care for their art
concede their innovation, influence, prodigious output and
technical mastery _ or, at least, concede that a lot of people who
know a lot about art consider Matisse and Picasso great.
</P>
<P>
   Consensus and the luxury of retrospect provide a comfortable
platform for calling something ``great.'' But can ``great'' also be
used to describe art and artists of our times? Is it simply too
soon to say? Is any opinion on the topic little more than
speculation?
</P>
<P>
   Or is it possible that the present doesn't deserve description
in such terms? Maybe greatness abides in the past because, to
paraphrase Norma Desmond, ``Art is great; it's the artists that got
small.''
</P>
<P>
   Plainly, not every era in every part of the Western world has
borne witness to greatness: The Dutch, for example, are recognized
for their artists of the baroque period, for one in the late 19th
century (van Gogh) and for one in the early 20th century
(Mondrian). And that's about all.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the Western world, plenty of people resent terms
such as ``great'' and ``important,'' particularly in their
superlative forms, because they represent Western chauvinism and
ranking and the imposing of a hierarchy they perceive as unfair or
meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, a number of observers simply look around at the
multiplicity of what is happening _ the endless variety of media
and techniques, ranging from painting to video to performance art _
and helplessly throw up their hands. They say there's no basis for
comparison: It's not as if you're judging which artist in
16th-century Florence painted the sweetest Madonna and Child.
</P>
<P>
   They'll nit-pick over exactly what constitutes greatness or
importance: Influence on other artists? The number of museum shows?
Inclusion in Janson's latest ``History of Art?'' The price
someone's work fetches at auction?
</P>
<P>
   They'll complain, too, about the hype: Is greatness connected to
how often an artist is mentioned in glossy magazines? Or the
politics: Is someone being touted because a cadre of curators and
dealers has a stake in their career?
</P>
<P>
   Generally, those willing to name names do so after they've
defined the terminology to their satisfaction. And then they talk
in subjective terms of whom they most admire _ not in objective
terms of greatness.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, though, they supply us with some names of
artists who are of consequence in our time. It's a mixed bag, with
only a few distinguishing features.
</P>
<P>
   One is that none is what you might call a whippersnapper.
</P>
<P>
   The other is that they've demonstrated a commitment to their own
visions and a well-informed disregard for trends. Regardless of
what you think of their art, there's a word for that, too:
integrity.
</P>
<P>
   GERHARD RICHTER (German, born in 1932)
</P>
<P>
   Known for: Painting in at least two distinct veins _
photorealism and abstraction _ and compiling a vast archive of
images Richter calls his ``atlas.''
</P>
<P>
   Chosen by: Michael Auping, chief curator, Modern Art Museum of
Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   An artist's influence is one way of evaluating greatness, Auping
says, and based on influence, he chooses Richter.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than any other artist living today, Richter seems to
encapsulate in his work a lot of the contradictions inherent in
late-20th-century art,'' Auping says. ``He paints abstractly and,
simultaneously, realistically and maintains a certain integrity in
both. He is a formalist, but he also engages political content.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his own way, he would be a kind of postmodern Picasso.''
</P>
<P>
   JACOB LAWRENCE (American, born in 1917)
</P>
<P>
   Known for: Series of small paintings on cardboard of events and
individuals in African-American history.
</P>
<P>
   Chosen by Janet Tyson, art critic, Fort Worth Star-Telegram
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Lawrence's greatness _ what I would call his heroism _
lies in his humility and integrity. Here is an artist who came to
renown for small pictures, in marked contrast to what art
historians have come to view as important American art of the
mid-20th century. Also, much 20th-century art is about art and the
artist, but Lawrence turns his focus outward toward humanity.
</P>
<P>
   That's not saying Lawrence isn't aware of art issues and art
history: I thoroughly enjoy his ``After Vesalius'' group of
drawings, based on anatomical studies by the Renaissance scientist.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not as fond of Lawrence's more recent paintings. They're
larger and more brightly colored than his well-known early series.
But they testify to the artist's commitment to interpreting human
experience _ and I have to respect that.
</P>
<P>
   FRANK GEHRY (American, born in 1929)
</P>
<P>
   Known for: The Guggenheim Mseum in Bilbao, Spain, and other
innovative structures
</P>
<P>
   Chosen by Aaron Betsky, architecture curator, San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art
</P>
<P>
   Without hesitation, Betsky names Gehry, whose shimmering,
undulating titanium-clad museum in Bilbao has been called the
greatest building of our era.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire him because he does what artists do best,'' Betsky
says. ``He makes objects that make us look at our world in a whole
new way. He crystallizes and clarifies an urban environment we
otherwise might not notice or understand because it is so chaotic
and complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he does so in beautiful and voluptuous forms.''

New Criterion''
</P>
<P>
   Kramer picks Balthus with some reluctance because, as he says,
``We don't have any really great artists at the moment _ unless
they've managed to conceal themselves from public attention. So the
choices are limited to people who are less than great.''
</P>
<P>
   Kramer concedes that the sometimes macabre sexual undercurrents
in Balthus' work are not every viewer's cup of tea. But he is ``a
marvelous draftsman,'' Kramer says. ``He also is a very
deliberately traditional artist who has been totally independent of
trends and fashion and gone entirely his own way _ which one has to
admire, whether they admire the results or not.''

   RICHARD SERRA (American, born in 1939)
</P>
<P>
   Known for: Taking huge slabs of steel and propping them against
one another.
</P>
<P>
   CLAES OLDENBURG (American, born in 1929)
</P>
<P>
   Known for: Public artworks in the form of binoculars, lipstick
and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Chosen by Marianne Stockebrand, director of the Chinati
Foundation, Marfa
</P>
<P>
   Stockebrand chooses Richard Serra and Claes Oldenburg because
``each in his own way is absolutely of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Serra's sculptures have gone through many powerful stages of
development, she says, noting his early torn rubber pieces, his
works made of lead (splattered in its molten form and allowed to
harden where it landed) and his massive slabs of steel.
</P>
<P>
   Serra was also chosen by Ken Baker, art critic of the San
Francisco Chronicle. Baker notes that Serra's immense, dark slabs
of steel, precariously balanced or standing in people's way,
provoke as much hostility as they do admiration.
</P>
<P>
   But ``his work reminds us that life is lived through the body,''
Baker says. ``When you're in the presence of his work, you
comprehend things in the most immediate physical way. It's not a
theoretical experience at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Serra's starkly beautiful abstract forms,
Oldenburg and his wife, Coosje van Bruggen, re-create objects from
everyday life on a monumental scale, endowing them with elements of
engaging bombast: There is something about encountering a gigantic
horseshoe _ like the one in Marfa, which Oldenburg made to honor an
old military horse _ that makes life seem sweeter and a bit less
serious.

<P>
   SIGMAR POLKE (German, born in 1941)
</P>
<P>
   Known for: Radically crude images executed in a wide range of
media
</P>
<P>
   ROBERT RAUSCHENBERG (American, born in 1925)
</P>
<P>
   Known for: Pioneering a number of major art forms, including
photo-transfer, a process of transferring photos onto metal,
plaster, cloth, canvas, and other materials.
</P>
<P>
   Chosen by: Gabriella Fanning, publisher of ``Art on Paper'' and
``Art Byte''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one deeply involved in the contemporary art world can
adequately make such a judgment,'' Fanning says. ``However, if I
change your question to `Which living artist would you most like to
have in your collection?' I could answer.''
</P>
<P>
   She cites Polke, whose pictures incorporate kitschy materials
and are loaded with irony, as an artist who captures her
imagination. A picture might be painted on fabric usually reserved
for a cheap tablecloth. It could be marked with abstract gestures
and human body parts, often crudely rendered, all floating and
overlapping in a seemingly random way that suggests narrative
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always has demonstrated a continuity with the past while
constantly innovating _ recently even working with computer
imaging,'' Fanning says.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Rauschenberg has been so influential and has meant so much
to artists from the '60s through today. His early works,
especially, are innovative and have great expressive depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Rauschenberg was also picked by Fort Worth artist Vernon Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you define importance in terms of influence, then I'd pick
Robert Rauschenberg,'' Fisher says. ``He still is underrated. But
there's a whole list of artists, like Joseph Beuys, you wouldn't
hear about if it weren't for him. There's a whole list of
movements, too _ pop, process art, performance, installation.''
</P>
<P>
   BRUCE NAUMAN (American, born in 1941)
</P>
<P>
   Known for: Installations mixing lights, sound and strange
objects.
</P>
<P>
   BETYE SAAR (American, born in 1926)
</P>
<P>
   Known for: Intricate assemblages made of found objects
</P>
<P>
   ANN HAMILTON (American, born in 1956)
</P>
<P>
   Known for: Installations made of materials that change and decay
</P>
<P>
   SAM GILLIAM (American, born in 1933)
</P>
<P>
   Known for: Pioneering painting on unstretched canvas
</P>
<P>
   Chosen by Kenshasha Conwill, director, Studio Museum in Harlem
</P>
<P>
   Conwill names four and refuses to narrow her selection. One
reason is that she doesn't consider art a competition. Another is
that, to the extent that she believes in greatness, she believes
it's best determined in retrospect, after an artist is dead. But
her diverse group has some common threads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of these artists has some degree of international
recognition, which gives their work force and influence,'' she
says. ``But their work also has an emotional dimension that I
respond to.
</P>
<P>
   ``And each follows their own muse. Their work is honest and
authentic. They've steadily worked on ideas that engage them, and
pursue them with an integrity that has a sort of moral dimension.''

THE DAY REALITY BIT THE TOY DEPARTMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the newspaper business, they don't call us the toy department
for nothing. To locate our workplace, first take the escalator to
the top of the building, bypassing electronics, household goods,
cosmetics, jewelry, furniture, and also Dennis Rodman's favorite,
women's lingerie.
</P>
<P>
   And then, once you've escaped the real world, there we are,
totally isolated from reality.
</P>
<P>
   Could I possibly interest you in the Nine-Toed Deion,
battery-operated, complete with fake limp, mechanical doll?
</P>
<P>
   The real world is forced to deal with a Slobodan Milosevic.
About as bad as it gets for us is George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, however, there does come an occasional time when
not even the toy department can sequester itself from tragedy, from
violence, or from natural disasters. Even the normal isolation the
jock kingdom enjoys, including the media who report on that
kingdom, can be instantly shattered, so great is the emotional
impact.
</P>
<P>
   Such, of course, was the case in Denver this week, when the
city's major-league baseball team, the NBA team, and the hockey
club all immediately postponed games. In the case of hockey, an
entire playoff series was rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The governor of Colorado didn't make this request of the teams,
nor the Denver mayor. This involved owners, and mainly jocks,
acting on their own feelings. Even players from those visiting
teams in Denver requested not to play, saying they were in shock
and grief over what happened at Columbine High School in Littleton,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Sports does serve as a reality escape, but none of us can run
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the most trying of times, professional sports has almost
always provided the one constant hideout. President Roosevelt asked
major-league baseball to continue to play with makeshift rosters
during World War II, citing a national morale boost.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, the games go on, as long as a stadium or an
arena is still standing.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, what happened this week near Denver caused a
nagging personal question to resurface. For nearly four decades, I
have wondered how in the name of decency could the late Pete
Rozelle have ordered NFL teams to take the field on Sunday, Nov.
24, 1963?
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier in Dallas, President John F. Kennedy had been
shot and killed. When NFL games kicked off around the country that
weekend, it touched off an obvious controversy. Commissioner
Rozelle made a decision he would later admit haunted him forever.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to creating positive public relations for the NFL,
Rozelle was known as a master. But this?
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete would say many times after that how much he considered it
a mistake,'' said Tex Schramm, a close friend of Rozelle's, and the
Cowboys' longtime president and general manager. ``But truthfully,
I thought he had made the right decision because it was an
alternative for a nation in grief. Jack Ruby, however, erased any
positive that could have come out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Schramm, Rozelle contacted John Kennedy's confidant
and friend, Pierre Salinger, to ask for advice on playing the
Sunday games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salinger had been on a State Department trip to the Far East
and was returning when he called Pete on an air phone,'' said
Rozelle. ``He told Pete in his opinion Jack would want the games
played that Sunday. Salinger recommended Pete go ahead and play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were at Cleveland. ``We flew in there and more than
one player was worried what might happen since we were representing
the city of Dallas,'' said Schramm. ``But then when we got the news
on what Ruby had done \Rshooting and killing Lee Harvey Oswald\S,
the whole stadium was in a mental fog anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rozelle, of course, was wishing NFL teams had not been on
the field. The toy department received a national black eye that
day. Reality bit us.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, however, no praise is necessary, or really deserved,
for decisions made by that chapter of the jock kingdom. Those
postponements were from the heart. Even the toy department has one.

CHINESE TRUST'S DEBTORS MUST SETTLE FOR 20 CENTS ON THE DOLLAR,
COURT SAYS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In another blow to foreign banks, a Chinese court
said Thursday that it expected to salvage only $783 million in
assets from one of China's largest and most troubled state
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Guangdong International Trust and Investment, or
GITIC, has been in bankruptcy since October, when it capsized under
$4.3 billion in debt. At a meeting of creditors Thursday in
Guangzhou, the provincial capital of Guangdong, the bankruptcy
court said that foreign and Chinese banks had lodged $5.66 billion
in claims against GITIC and three subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Although GITIC's creditors have been steeling themselves for
heavy losses since the bankruptcy, the banks now face the
likelihood of recovering less than one-fifth of their original
loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing,'' said T.K. Chang, a lawyer at Coudert
Brothers in Hong Kong, who attended the meeting as a representative
of South Korean banks. ``Previously, we would have gotten about 60
cents on the dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Chang based that estimate on an earlier assessment of GITIC's
finances, in which the company was reported to have $2.6 billion in
assets and $4.7 billion in liabilities. Since then, however,
GITIC's liabilities have edged up while the quality of its assets
has deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors are watching GITIC's bankruptcy proceedings as
a test case of how China will deal with its financially troubled
corporate sector. Although GITIC is so far the only investment
trust company to be forced into bankruptcy, several others have
defaulted on loan payments.
</P>
<P>
   Another major state-owned company, Guangdong Enterprises
Holdings, has suspended payments on $2.9 billion in debt while it
overhauls its operations with the help of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
Executives who represent the creditors said Goldman would complete
its proposal within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``China's attitude toward foreign lenders has hardened over
time,'' said Gordon C. Chang, a bankruptcy lawyer in the Beijing
office of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &AMP; Garrison. ``I think China
is seeing how hard it can push.''
</P>
<P>
   The court gave several reasons for its inability to extract more
money from GITIC, most stemming from its disastrous real estate
ventures. Several of GITIC's hotels and office buildings are losing
money, while the company is fighting lawsuits over numerous
unfinished development projects.
</P>
<P>
   After delivering its bad news, the Guangzhou Provincial People's
High Court appointed a nine-member steering committee to sort
through claims from 540 creditors, 175 foreign and 365 from
mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   The steering committee includes Citibank, a unit of Citigroup;
UBS of Switzerland; two Japanese banks, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and
Sakura Bank; Hong Kong's Hang Seng Bank, a unit of HSBC Holdings,
and two Chinese banks, the Bank of China and the Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese court promised to give equal treatment to foreign
and domestic creditors. ``All debts, whether on the mainland or
outside the country, will be equally compensated,'' said Li Qi, the
deputy judge.
</P>
<P>
   But that failed to quell fears about equal treatment among
foreign banks. Chang of Coudert Brothers noted that all the banks
on the steering committee had registered their loans to GITIC with
the government. But other creditors did not seek approval, and
Chang fears they may be left empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only depend on the steering committee,'' he said.
``We're focusing, out of a lack of choice, on the fairness of the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest bad news from GITIC comes at a time when fears about
a debt crisis in China have subsided a bit. China's prime minister,
Zhu Rongji, said recently that he did not foresee a rash of
bankruptcies among state-owned companies. Beijing seems determined
to save other failing companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there will be further liquidations,'' said Ted
Osborn, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Hong Kong, which
represents creditors of Guangdong Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   But other experts warned that foreign bankers should not make
any assumptions. Like GITIC, the finances of Guangdong Enterprises
have become shakier as more information has seeped out. Chang of
Paul Weiss predicted that even if the company was not liquidated,
the banks could wind up taking heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is doing something good,'' he said. ``They're putting
their financial sector on a commercial footing. But predicting the
future is inherently difficult.''

REP. MCCARTHY SEES `MORAL OBLIGATION' TO CURTAIL GUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A nurse turned congresswoman, whose bid for
Congress was ignited by the crackle of gunfire, Thursday said the
Capitol Hill forces that have consigned gun-control bills to
legislative limbo have been changed by the Colorado school
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by Senators Edward M. Kennedy, whose two brothers were
slain by gunmen, and Dianne Feinstein, who became mayor of San
Francisco after a 1978 City Hall assassination, Representative
Carolyn McCarthy vowed to press a floor fight to defy the powerful
gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not willing to wait another year,'' said the New York
Democrat, whose husband was killed and son wounded by a gunman in
the 1993 Long Island Railroad shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not willing to wait any longer until there's another
shooting,'' McCarthy said. ``I happen to believe Congress has a
moral obligation to stop this. I happen to think that we can do
something about this. I'm tired of people saying, `What can you do?
We can't do anything.' I don't believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   As the National Rifle Association announced plans to scale back
its annual meeting in Denver next week, lawmakers in two states
abandoned pro-gun bills, legislators in a third state sought to
hasten a measure designed to restrict access to guns, and
gun-control forces said their fortunes on Capitol Hill may be
brightening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thursday, there was a shift in the gun debate that in my 15
years fighting for gun control I have never seen,'' Senator Charles
Schumer, a New York Democrat, said at a Capitol news conference.
``When the NRA and pro-gun state lawmakers are retreating on their
long-held views, it proves conclusively that there has to be
additional laws to protect innocent people from gun violence.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to its members this week, NRA President
Charlton Heston and Wayne LaPierre, the group's executive vice
president, said it was scuttling plans for expositions, seminars,
and other ``festive ceremonies'' out of respect for the families of
victims and the community in Littleton, Colo., just miles away from
the NRA convention site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our spirits must endure this terrible suffering together, and
so must the freedoms that bring us together,'' Heston and LaPierre
wrote. ``We must stand in somber but unshakable unity, even in this
time of anguish.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, some gun control measures have been advanced by
high-profile tragedies. The Gun Control Act of 1968, barring the
imports of certain weapons, followed the assassinations of the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert F. Kennedy. And President
Bush banned imports of assault-style weapons in 1989, the year
after a gunman killed five children in a Stockton, Calif.,
schoolyard.
</P>
<P>
   But the current GOP-led Congress has been less receptive to
gun-control measures, and no substantial gun legislation passed
last year in the wake of several school shootings, including the
highly publicized killings in Jonesboro, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy said she met this week with House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, an Illinois Republican, and urged him to allow a floor
debate on her bill that would require handgun trigger locks, hold
adults criminally liable if a child uses their gun to commit
violence, and help trace guns used in juvenile crime.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Hastert said Thursday that the speaker has yet
to review the legislation and has not taken a position on it. But
McCarthy said she will petition the bill onto the floor, if she is
thwarted in efforts to move it through House committees.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, in Colorado to speak with victims'
families and school officials, said there should be a reasoned and
nonpolitical approach to curb a culture of violence. ``We have more
youth violence in these last 10 years than at any time in our
history,'' Reno said. ``We must renew our efforts, not just in
connection with this terrible tragedy, but with what we do about
guns in the hands of young people _ young people who do not know
how to safely and lawfully use them.''
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman said the legislative efforts by
gun-control lawmakers mirror some proposals embraced by President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said the Colorado slayings
should spur passage of a packet of gun-control measures the
administration will send to Congress in several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the environment is there,'' Holder said. ``I think all
the public polls always show that the American people _ the vast
majority of the American people _ support reasonable restrictions
placed on the possession of guns.''

COMMENTARY: GIVE THE AIR WAR A CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is said that a camel is a horse designed by a committee. It
may not be pretty but it gets the job done, especially in the
desert.
</P>
<P>
   By that standard, NATO's air war over Yugoslavia is a military
strategy designed by a 19-member alliance. It's also not pretty,
but its very weakness could be a strength.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing the Yugoslavs from 15,000 feet is the only military
strategy that all 19 NATO members, the U.S. Congress and the
Russians can agree upon as tolerable in Yugoslavia today. While
there are many obvious downsides to war-from-15,000-feet, it does
have one great strength _ its sustainability. NATO can carry on
this sort of air war for a long, long time. The Yugoslavs need to
remember that.
</P>
<P>
   While it is true that NATO will never liberate Kosovo from the
air, there is still a chance that this sort of sustained
bombardment can achieve our basic objectives _ which are to compel
Slobodan Milosevic, either tacitly or by negotiation, to enable the
return of the Kosovo Albanians to their homes, with self-rule,
protected by an international peacekeeping force that would patrol
a fence between Albanians and Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   But if NATO's only strength is that it can bomb forever, then it
has to get every ounce out of that. Let's at least have a real air
war. The idea that people are still holding rock concerts in
Belgrade, or going out for Sunday merry-go-round rides, while their
fellow Serbs are ``cleansing'' Kosovo, is outrageous. It should be
lights out in Belgrade: Every power grid, water pipe, bridge, road
and war-related factory has to be targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, we are at war with the Serbian nation (they
certainly think so), and the stakes have to be very clear: Every
week you ravage Kosovo is another decade we will set your country
back by pulverizing you. You want 1950? We can do 1950. You want
1389? We can do 1389 too. If we can frame the issue that way,
Milosevic will blink, and we may have seen his first flutter.
</P>
<P>
   Will this strategy halt the barbarism still going on in Kosovo?
No. The war to prevent the refugees from being thrown out of
Kosovo, or abducted, was lost the first week _ when NATO and the
Clinton team bombed the Yugoslavs without having either adequate
ground or air power in place to deter them, and without
understanding Milosevic's capabilities or his intentions. That was
a strategic blunder for which the Kosovars have paid dearly.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is how best to reverse that, without the U.S.
and NATO becoming so enmeshed in the Balkans that it will weaken
their ability to operate anywhere else, and strain their cohesion
as never before. The only way is a merciless air war.
</P>
<P>
   What about ground troops? NATO should begin planning for a
ground war, as the British and French are urging, both because it
might influence Milosevic to blink sooner rather than later, and
because it would inject some realism into the debate about this
subject. The U.S. public and Congress need to understand just what
would be involved in a ground war. Invading Kosovo means owning
Kosovo. A ground war would likely require going all the way to
Belgrade and end up making both Albania and Macedonia, from which
any invasion of Kosovo would be staged, U.S. protectorates.
</P>
<P>
   Be advised, these are weak, tribalized states that can fall
apart in our hands. Albania is non-country country. It is a country
where police estimate that more than half the cars on the road were
stolen from somewhere else in Europe, where everyone has a gun at
home and where just two years ago the whole banking system was
based on pyramid schemes and three-card monte. The Wall Street
Journal recently quoted an unemployed worker in Tirana as saying,
``It would be better if Milosevic bombed here, and we could all go
as refugees to Italy and Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   That is just one reason that, for now, we must stick to a
strategy that at least holds out the hope of achieving our
objectives without NATO ending up owning the Balkans. Because
nothing would do more to sap public support for American
internationalism than America's taking over history's oldest
hornet's nests.
</P>
<P>
   Give war a chance. Let's see what months of bombing does before
we opt for weeks of invasion, where, if we win, we get to occupy
the Balkans for years. Let's make Kosovo Milosevic's Vietnam, not
ours. (BOX)

   GENEVA _ The rate of growth in world merchandise exports fell to
3.5 percent last year, only one-third of its 1997 growth rate of
10.5 percent, mainly because of the Asian economic crisis, the
World Trade Organization said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The organization said in an annual appraisal of global trade
trends that export growth could slow further in 1999, depending
largely on what happens in the United States, the strongest
industrial nation. Many expect American growth to slow later this
year, which could reduce exports to U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
   The study said that part of 1998s decline in export growth
reflected lower commodity prices, including a 30 percent drop in
the price of oil. Other commodity prices fell 20 percent in 1998,
said Patrick Low, the World Trade Organization's chief economist.
</P>
<P>
   The report said 1998 was the first time since World War II that
commodity exports represented less than 20 percent of all exports.
Many developing countries are still highly dependent on the exports
of commodities, particularly food, and a continuing decline in
world prices on such raw products has widened the disparity between
rich and poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   Trade performance in 1998 varied widely among regions. Exports
increased 3 percent from North America, while imports there rose
10.5 percent. Increases up to 10 percent in exports and imports
were recorded in Latin America and some Eastern European countries.
</P>
<P>
   Western Europe was the only region where the growth rate in
imports did not fall from a year earlier. It remained at 7.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Imports into Asian countries fell over all by 8.5 percent last
year, and by double that in the once-booming economies of Hong
Kong, Malaysia, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Low said at a news conference that signs of improvement in Asian
economies could mean that exports to Asia increase in 1999. ``But
if we see too sharp a slowdown in the United States and Western
Europe,'' he said, ``then this will definitely threaten to swamp
whatever happens in Asia.''

EUROPE PHONE DEAL: CLEARLY, A WORK IN PROGRESS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The chief executives of the former telephone monopolies
in Germany and Italy outlined their shared vision for a global
telecommunications giant Thursday, but could not explain how they
would increase efficiency, conquer cultural barriers, penetrate the
U.S. market or share management in their $82 billion merger.
</P>
<P>
   As Ron Sommer, chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, and Franco
Bernabe, chief executive of Telecom Italia, held a news conference
to provide details of the biggest merger in European history, the
full range of challenges in the hastily arranged deal became clear.
The executives said they did not even have a name for their new
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be neither Deutsch nor Italian, and it will be written
with a `c,''' Sommer said, mixing German with English.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone companies reached a deal Wednesday that amounts to
a Deutsche Telekom takeover of Telecom Italia, which has been
looking for ways to thwart an unwanted $65 billion takeover from
its main domestic rival, Olivetti. Undaunted, Olivetti is
proceeding with its takeover attempt and will try to convince
Telecom Italia shareholders it is the better choice.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sommer and Bernabe depicted their merger as a smart
strategic move that made long-term sense, it was not Telecom
Italia's first choice. The Italian phone company had first tried to
stop the Olivetti bid by taking other steps that would have made
Telecom Italia too expensive to buy, but it failed to get enough
shareholder support and began negotiating intensively with Deutsche
Telekom only in the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Neither executive could explain in detail where billions of
dollars in savings from reduced costs could come from. The merger
also faces suspicion from the Italian government, which dislikes
the idea that 40 percent of the merged company will be owned by the
German state.
</P>
<P>
   The new company would have 100 million customers in 26 countries
around the world, dwarfing AT&AMP;T and ranking second in revenue only
to the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. But the value of
greater size did not impress the shareholders of either Telecom
Italia or Deutsche Telekom Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The German company's share price fell 2.2 percent, to 35.30
euros, or $37.41, and Telecom Italia's shares dropped by
seven-tenths of a euro, to 9.84.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the deal gives both companies some advantages. The
companies said they expected pretax savings of $636 million by
2000, growing to $1.06 billion by 2003. In fixed-line services,
networks would be consolidated and purchasing and product
development pooled. In wireless phone service, network planning and
monitoring would be consolidated and handset prices reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is more complicated. As joint chief executives,
Bernabe, 50, and Sommer, 49, will share management responsibility,
but about all Bernabe could say about the division of labor was,
``When Ron goes skiing, I'll work, and vice versa.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because the new company would be incorporated in Germany, labor
would be represented on its supervisory board, and the job of
chairman would rotate annually between Germans and Italians. The
combined company would operate dual headquarters in Rome and Bonn.
</P>
<P>
   Sommer said mobile phones would be the ``big driver'' of growth
for the combined company, which would have 21.6 million
subscribers, making it by far Europe's largest provider. The
companies gained a million new subscribers in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they were unable to say how the companies would deal with
the remaining 40 percent of shares in Telecom Italia's mobile phone
unit that the company does not own.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have bloated work forces, holdovers from the days
when they were, in effect, state bureaucracies. Yet both executives
insisted their vision was not about cutting jobs, but creating new
ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not a declining industry,'' Bernabe said. ``We are an
industry full of opportunities. We have efficiency problems, but
this is not a story about job rationalization.''
</P>
<P>
   The mechanics of the merger, which the companies hope to make a
tax-free stock swap, also face significant regulatory scrutiny. Yet
both executives emphasized how little overlap the companies have _
only five countries.
</P>
<P>
   Stickier will be the issue of existing alliances, including
Global One, a Deutsche Telekom venture to sell corporate
telecommunications services together with France Telecom and the
Sprint Corp. France Telecom executives have publicly expressed
anger at Deutsche Telecom over the Telecom Italia deal, and have
already told Deutsche Telekom it must quit a fixed-line venture,
Wind, that the French and German companies operate in Italy with
the national energy utility, Enel.
</P>
<P>
   But Sommer said the new merger was ``not intended against
existing partners,'' like France Telecom. Indeed, he said, it could
be an ``enhancement'' of ties like Global One. Telecommunications
industry analysts have said that the German-Italian merger probably
meant the end of Global One.
</P>
<P>
   The German and Italian companies also know that the biggest
blank spot on their map is the United States, the world's leading
telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is our next area of expansion,'' Bernabe
said. ``This merger is clearly designed to increase competition in
the world, not to reduce competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Sommer, asked whether he was talking with Sprint executives,
because of reports that the companies might consider Sprint an
attractive acquisition target, replied: ``I'm on the board of
Sprint. I talk with them all the time.''

TOBACCO LITIGATION CONTRIBUTES TO 54 PERCENT DROP EARNINGS BY RJR
NABISCO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Japan)   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its final quarter as an international tobacco and food
company, the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. reported Thursday that its
first-quarter earnings fell 54 percent because of costs to settle
tobacco litigation and declining cigarette sales.
</P>
<P>
   Profit from operations fell to $83 million, or 24 cents a
diluted share, compared with $179 million, or 52 cents a share, in
the quarter a year earlier. Analysts expected RJR to earn 28 cents
a share, according to the First Call Corp., which tracks company
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose 6.9 percent, to $4.22 billion, aided by higher
cigarette prices.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in first-quarter profit reflected costs of RJR's share
of the $206 billion settlement the tobacco industry reached with 46
states in November, as well as falling demand for cigarettes
related to a price increase that began last fall. Still, the profit
was far better than the company recorded in the fourth quarter of
last year, one analyst noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry went through the most troublesome quarter in
history, both as a result of planned changes to the dynamics of the
U.S. tobacco industry because of the settlement and a difficult
international environment,'' said Martin Feldman, an analyst at
Salomon Smith Barney. ``But RJR more than doubled what it made in
the fourth quarter of 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, RJR's chairman and chief executive, Steven F.
Goldstone, said that the company would sell its international
tobacco division to a Japanese buyer for $8 billion and spin off
its domestic tobacco division. That would leave only its Nabisco
shares under the company's control, and RJR would be renamed
Nabisco Holdings Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The company's largest shareholder, Carl Icahn, has challenged
the plan, saying the food business should be spun off instead and
nominated an alternate board of directors. Shareholders are to vote
on the competing plans at the company's annual meeting next month.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic tobacco sales were $1.65 billion in the quarter, up
40.3 percent from $1.18 billion in the first quarter of 1998.
Volume was lower, though, falling 14 percent, which management
attributed to the higher prices. The entire cigarette industry's
sales declined 10 percent in the quarter, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   RJR's market share slipped as well, by nearly one full
percentage point, to 24.57 percent. Its higher-priced brands had
varying results, with Camel increasing its share slightly, to 5.23
percent, but Winston falling to 5.32 percent, from 5.65 percent in
the corresponding period in 1998. The company blamed ``heavy
competitive discounting and promotion'' for the decline.
</P>
<P>
   International tobacco sales continued to suffer, falling 31
percent compared with sales in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The company said its Nabisco Foods division showed improvement,
even though worldwide sales rose just 1 percent, to $1.85 billion.
Cookie and cracker sales increased 4 percent, with the company
crediting promotions for cookies like Oreos, Teddy Grahams and
cheese-flavored snacks like Cheese Nips for the growth.
</P>
<P>
   Profit, however, fell 15 percent, to $121 million, which the
company attributed to brand promotions and the cost of improving
its sales force.

THE SQUATTERS HAVE THEIR DAY, SHAKING VENEZUELA
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By LARRY ROHTER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Until a few weeks ago, Elena Vasquez and
her six children lived in a single cramped rented room here. But
now she and thousands of other poor Venezuelans, inspired by their
new president's promises of social justice, have seized vacant
buildings and plots of land, upgrading their own housing while
setting off a passionate national debate about property rights.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vasquez's family is one of 34 that have taken over the
Edificio Inmacolata, a nine-story government-owned apartment
building on the edge of downtown that has sat abandoned, she said,
for six years.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of neighboring buildings are furious, and there have
been calls for the police to evict the squatters. But she is more
impressed by the fact that her one-bedroom apartment has
electricity and running water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a miracle, and I feel so relieved to finally have
four walls and a ceiling above my head,'' said Ms. Vasquez, 33, a
restaurant cook and single mother who earlier had lived in a
cardboard shack under a bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means you don't have to worry about the rain, you have
security, and no one can come and abuse you,'' she added. ``So I
feel like a queen right here in the middle of Caracas.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Hugo Chavez was elected president of Venezuela in
December, similar land invasions have been taking place all over
this country. Estimates of the extent of the phenomenon vary, but
officials suggest that in the first three months of 1999, some
10,000 families have moved onto sites including a ranch owned by a
state governor, apartment buildings here in the capital and even a
provincial airport.
</P>
<P>
   The seizures have sent waves of panic through the business,
professional and intellectual classes that are a distinct minority
of Venezuela's 23 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, a former army paratrooper who in 1992 led an
unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the democratically elected
government, has assembled a Constituent Assembly to draw up a
replacement for the current constitution, and his critics fear that
he intends to erode property rights in the new charter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The repeated invasions of rural and urban properties that have
taken place and continue to occur are a source of deep
preoccupation on the part of the citizenry,'' said Francisco
Natera, president of the Federation of Chambers, the country's
leading coalition of business and professional groups.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to halt this ``deterioration of the rule of law,''
he added, is to ``restore these properties and goods to their
legitimate owners.''
</P>
<P>
   As Chavez's government points out, land invasions are not new to
Venezuela. Many of the working-class neighborhoods that cling to
the dusty hillsides overlooking the towering apartment and office
buildings of Caracas began their existence decades ago as
``ranchos,'' or squatter settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela experiences a surge of land invasions every five years
immediately before and after elections, as the poor test the
resolve and the campaign promises of new presidents. But
``normally,'' said a diplomat here, ``the response is to call out
the bulldozers and the National Guard to trash the place, and then
everyone leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, however, was elected on a platform that pledged a social
revolution and redistribution of the country's wealth, and the
millions of Venezuelans living below the poverty line are his main
political base. So since taking office on Feb. 2, he has taken a
much more sympathetic approach to the plight of squatters than any
of his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to send in troops,'' Chavez said on a visit to a
squatter settlement in mid-March. ``I will not rest until every
human being who lives in this land has housing, employment and some
way to manage his life.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Critics of the government portray the issue as one of
sovereignty, claiming to have detected foreign influence and
support, especially that of the Movement of the Landless in
neighboring Brazil, in the wave of land invasions.
</P>
<P>
   They also say the policy has encouraged poor people in Colombia,
Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Peru to migrate illegally to
Venezuela, and express fear that the pace of land takeovers will
accelerate as word spreads throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Chavez has adamantly refused to rescind his
government's hands-off policy. In a speech on March 25, he referred
scornfully to businessmen and politicians ``who want me to send in
troops and police to shoot machine-gun rounds at these people,''
adding defiantly, ``I'm not going to massacre them, so send me to
jail if you want.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not really invaders, they are people who have been
excluded,'' he said in the televised remarks. ``The majority are
women, single mothers who have been abandoned by irresponsible
fathers. Let's go talk to them. They're not monsters, they're
clamoring for justice, and we should give them justice.''
</P>
<P>
   To reduce political tensions and solve the problem, Chavez has
suggested a census of squatters, to distinguish those who are
really landless from the opportunists, and a program to resettle
them elsewhere, mostly on government land in rural areas. But local
authorities around the country have criticized that step as simply
an encouragement to additional land invasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``To conduct a census and to offer houses or apartments to the
invaders implies support for the continuation of this illegal
practice,'' said Antonio Ledezma, mayor of Caracas from an
opposition party and president of the Venezuelan Association of
Mayors.
</P>
<P>
   The government's approach, he added, can only be regarded as ``a
stimulus to resentment'' between classes that could lead to ``a
social convulsion, a war among the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Even many residents of neighborhoods that began as squatter
settlements but later had their status legalized appear to support
that view. They recognize that the country suffers from an acute
shortage of affordable housing, but assert that they should not be
forced to pay the price of years of official neglect and
inefficient policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on permanent guard here against any invasions,'' said
Mireya de Fernandez, a teacher and community leader in Tamaquito, a
working-class area on a hillside in western Caracas. ``We don't
want any newcomers settling here because our situation is one in
which we already do not have enough water, schools and sewers to
serve the existing population.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the Edificio Inmacolata, the squatters maintain that
Chavez _ ``the president of the poor,'' as they call him _ approves
of their desire to better their living standards. They say that
they have painted and cleaned up the building, and that they will
make other improvements if they are allowed to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not asking that anything be given to us free,'' said
Yahaira Rojas, a seamstress and mother of three who said that
three-quarters of her monthly salary of $175 had been going to rent
before she moved in. ``We want to pay. We've been trampled for so
long, but we are convinced that our Chavez will help us and find a
good solution.''

CLINTON TALKS WITH HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ABOUT COLORADO ATTACK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JENNIFER DAY 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton met with a group of suburban high
school students Thursday to discuss the Colorado shooting and what
can be done to prevent such incidents, including possible
gun-control legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Controlling the availability of guns was the administration's
focus a day after two students opened fire with semiautomatic
weapons on a rampage through Columbine High School in Littleton,
Colo., on Tuesday, killing 13 and wounding 23 before killing
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters
Wednesday the most positive thing that could come from the massacre
would be momentum to pass ``reasonable restrictions placed on the
possession of guns.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a culture of having a right to own weapons and a right
to use them, and a big hunting culture. I grew up in it,
participated in it and enjoyed it very much,'' the president told
students at T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every little thing I have tried to do, from passing the Brady
bill to passing the assault weapons ban, all these things were met
with violent opposition as if I was trying to destroy the American
way of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``And all I was trying to do is keep more people alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Manown, a spokesman for the National Rifle Association,
which has lobbied strongly against gun-control legislation, said it
was not ``appropriate for us to engage in a political debate at
this time'' and declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho and an NRA board
member, said the Colorado gunmen broke several existing gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's looking at it in a deeper sense as to what drives kids to
do something so horrible,'' spokesman Will Hart said. ``There's
quite possibly a bigger issue at stake than legislation or gun
control could ever mend.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control legislation the Clinton administration would like to
see passed includes:
</P>
<P>
   Prohibitions on youths who have been convicted of serious crimes
from ever being allowed to possess a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Requirements for gun manufacturers to equip every gun with
trigger locks.
</P>
<P>
   Reauthorization of the Brady Law that would require a three-day
wait before purchasing a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Instant background checks for those who make purchases at gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Penalties for adults who allow minors easy access to guns.
</P>
<P>
   Funding for expansion of a program that allows law enforcement
officers to track and shut down sources where youths illegally
obtain guns.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., whose husband was killed and her
son injured by a gunman who opened fire on a commuter train, pushed
legislation she introduced last year to make it more difficult for
children to get guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough is enough,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's meeting with the students, which was broadcast live
to 12,000 schools nationwide, he reassured the youths that schools
are still safe, touted the benefits of peer mediation and pushed
for funding for more after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   The president also drew a comparison between Serbian aggression
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and the aggression the two
gunmen in Colorado took against fellow classmates who had ridiculed
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had the wrong reaction to the fact that they were
dissed,'' Clinton said. ``Look, everybody gets dissed sometimes in
life _ even the president _ sometimes especially the president.''

US NINTH IN FUNDING   TO COMBAT AIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a percentage of national wealth, the United States ranks
ninth in the amount it donates to combat AIDS worldwide, the United
Nations' AIDS agency said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   US contributions toward AIDS control amount to only $17 for
every $1 million of the nation's gross national product, an overall
measure of national wealth. By contrast, Norway spends $93 per $1
million of GNP and the Netherlands $92.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the annual US contribution fell by $2.5 million
between 1996 and 1997, the most recent data available.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers come from the most comprehensive financial
accounting done in the 20-year history of the global AIDS epidemic,
done in collaboration between UNAIDS, a UN agency, and researchers
at the Harvard School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   The project identified $549 million in AIDS donations from all
sources in 1996, half of it from governments.
</P>
<P>
   Overall funding for AIDS control has fallen far behind the pace
of the global epidemic, which is ``expanding three times faster
than the funding to control it,'' said Dr. Peter Piot, executive
director of UNAIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people infected with the AIDS virus more than
tripled between 1990 and 1997, said the UNAIDS analysis. But money
to fight AIDS in developing nations, where 95 percent of infected
individuals live, rose only 66 percent between 1990 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donor nations must realize that their substantial investments
toward improving conditions in developing countries will be
effectively obliterated unless more is invested in fighting AIDS _
the single greatest threat to global development today,'' Piot
said.
</P>
<P>
   The amount allocated to fighting AIDS amounts to less than one
percent of donor countries' budgets for fostering economic
development.
</P>
<P>
   But that amount actually fell by $2.5 million from the previous
year, the UNAIDS report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the number of dollars, the US looks really
good, but when you put it in terms of economic capacity, it's a
pretty paltry showing,'' said Mary Pat Kieffer of the
Francois-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights at
Harvard, an analyst involved in the two-year effort to compile
global AIDS funding data.
</P>
<P>
   Spending on AIDS prevention is not always concentrated on areas
where the epidemic is spreading fastest. Only one-quarter of global
spending is devoted to sub-Saharan Africa, the most severely
affected region.
</P>
<P>
   Within Africa there are enormous disparities, ranging from a
high of $37 million on AIDS prevention in Uganda _ where strong
government support has turned the tide of new infections _ to a low
of less than $4 million in Nigeria, which has one of the region's
highest rate of AIDS virus infections.

MISSILE PAYS A CALL ON MILOSEVIC, BUT HE WAS NOT AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ NATO sent a missile into the bedroom of
Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, early Thursday morning,
but insisted it was nothing personal.
</P>
<P>
   Three missiles devastated the elegant 1936 villa in the wealthy
Dedinje district at 15 Uzicka Street, the most famous address in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   An eclectic two-story building of white stucco, with columns and
rounded windows that its original owner described as a little
Hollywood in inspiration, the villa was built as a private house
and finished in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   Tito appropriated the house for himself in 1944, after taking
power in Belgrade, and Yugoslav leaders have lived there since
then, making it an official residence.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is a charred ruin. One entire side wall of the structure
is blown away, all the windows are broken, and many trees in the
surrounding parkland have been uprooted.
</P>
<P>
   There are gaping holes where the missiles pierced the walls,
flares of soot shoot from the arches of the empty window frames,
and chunks of concrete and broken glass are scattered over the
lavish grounds.
</P>
<P>
   NATO may have intended its missiles as a message to Milosevic,
who has not been sleeping at the house in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Tito, who is associated with the house more than any of his
successors, is buried in a sort of mausoleum 200 yards away in what
is known as the House of Flowers, a glassed-in structure where he
used to run the government in the summertime. Serbian television
gave no indication of any damage to the House of Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Yugoslav officials were livid in Milosevic's name.
They accused NATO of trying to assassinate the leader of a
sovereign state, and said the other missiles, which hit at about
3:15 a.m., had struck the living and dining rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has been avoiding the house ever since a
little-reported missile attack on a nearby building housing his
presidential guard, in which as many as 30 people are said to have
been killed, Serbian officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, for its part, claimed that the building was a vital link
in the military command system of Yugoslavia and that the strike
had nothing to do with Milosevic or its symbolic importance to the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   But this building was no radar station, and some Serbs reacted
with anger and incredulity.
</P>
<P>
   A Serbian photographer said: ``This is simply demagoguery.
Whether one likes Milosevic or not, this is outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Serbian journalist with the magazine Vreme said: ``This
building is part of our cultural heritage. Yesterday Tito lived
there, and today Milosevic does, but tomorrow it will be Pera
Pric.'' That is the Serbian form of John Doe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If NATO wants to pretend now that it's hit at the heart of the
repressive regime and not the Serbian nation, it's not true,
because they've only done this after a month of hitting civilian
targets,'' the journalist said.
</P>
<P>
   The journalist, who asked for anonymity, bemoaned the regular
trashing of Belgrade's cultural history, saying, ``When people come
to visit Belgrade, I can't show them a building more than 200 years
old, because every 50 years somebody bombs and blows them away.''

 &HT;    AT&AMP;T ups ante for MediaOne
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell and Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AT&AMP;T has thrown a $62 billion bid on the table for
MediaOne _ $8.6 billion higher than the offer made weeks ago by
Comcast.
</P>
<P>
   With MediaOne, AT&AMP;T would become America's leading cable
provider with access to one-third of the nation's homes _ including
540,000 served by MediaOne in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning move is aimed at giving AT&AMP;T direct connections to
homes, detouring around lines owned by regional phone companies
such as BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the deal would allow the New York-based giant to
offer all manner of communications _ including local phone service,
long-distance, television and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The bidding war for MediaOne is yet another dramatic sign of
consolidation in communications and media businesses. AT&AMP;T is the
nation's largest phone company, with one-half of the $90
billion-a-year long-distance business.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T last month completed purchase of Tele-Communications Inc.,
which had been the nation's second-largest cable company. TCI had
virtually no presence in northern Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, MediaOne is the largest cable provider and has
spent hundreds of millions of dollars upgrading its system to
handle high-speed Net access, as well as television and phone
service.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne in metro Atlanta is offering a local phone service
competing with BellSouth. But the service is limited to places
where the costly upgrade has been made.
</P>
<P>
   By late Thursday, Comcast had not responded to the AT&AMP;T bid.
Officials at MediaOne, who had agreed to Comcast's proposal, would
say only that they were reviewing the AT&AMP;T bid.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever buys MediaOne will be part of a trend that is global:
consolidation. The AT&AMP;T offer came on the heels of an $80 billion
deal between the national phone companies of Germany and Italy.
Earlier this week, BellSouth announced it was buying 10 percent of
Qwest Communications, a company that specializes in high-speed
data.

U.S. AGENCY CRACKS DOWN ON INTERNET INVESTIGATORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Iowa)  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government on Thursday began cracking
down on the deceptive practices of a proliferating number of
private investigators who advertise on the Internet that they can
inexpensively provide confidential details about bank accounts and
telephone records.
</P>
<P>
   In the first civil case of its kind, lawyers at the Federal
Trade Commission accused a Colorado couple of violating the law by
posing as bank customers to trick banks into providing confidential
information. The couple, James and Regana Rapp, had advertised on
their Web site that their company, Touch Tone Information Inc.,
could obtain bank records, non-published telephone numbers and
financial assets.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said that Touch Tone Information, one of
scores of investigative agencies that glean confidential
information under false pretenses, had employees make hundreds of
telephone calls in which they falsely claimed to be either a bank
customer or relative. The Federal Trade Commission Act makes it
illegal to use such deceptive trade practices.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp acknowledged in an interview Thursday that he and his
employees had tricked many banks and other institutions into
providing confidential information. Touch Tone's Internet site
advertised that for $100 it could obtain information within 10 days
about a bank account _ $200 for a stock account. It also said it
could obtain telephone toll records and unlisted numbers and
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp said that as a result of the lawsuit, he had removed his
Web site and would stop the practice of posing as a customer of the
institution that he was trying to get information from. He said
that the trade commission's action would curtail only a small part
of his investigations business and complained that it would only
hurt victims _ clients such as mothers seeking payments from
dead-beat dads and other government agencies that he said had
employed him to track down assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a dead-beat dad or a neglected spouse,'' Rapp said,
``you don't have to worry anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Commercial Web sites run by private investigators have
flourished in recent years, advertising the ability to find a wide
array of public and confidential information _ like telephone
records and credit and bank accounts _ for lawyers, spurned spouses
and burned business partners. Some of the information they sell is
available in public records, but other information can be obtained
only by deception or bribery, privacy experts say. Although law
enforcement officials in some states like Connecticut and
Massachusetts have prosecuted investigators who illegally obtain
information by pretending to be either a bank customer or relative,
the federal government has moved more slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Many privacy experts say that as long as law firms and big
businesses are largely insulated from government prosecution
because the laws are narrowly written, the deceptive practices of
investigators like the Rapps will never be curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FTC cannot stop this practice because there is a lot of
value for this data, and people will continue to pay for it,'' said
Evan Hendricks, editor of Privacy Times, a Washington news letter
that covers privacy issues.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the FTC said the case was filed as a warning to
both the information brokerage industry and the bigger fish _ the
firms that retain the investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to send a message to others that this kind of
deception and invasion of privacy is unacceptable,'' said Robert
Pitofsky, chairman of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's lawsuit is part of a broader policy agenda promoted
by Pitofsky to address privacy issues and the Internet. Earlier
this week, the commission announced a proposal for new rules aimed
at protecting the privacy interests of children on the Internet by
generally requiring operators of Web sites to obtain parental
consent before soliciting information from children under 13.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has asked Congress for the authority to seek civil
penalties against brokers who obtain sensitive financial
information about individuals under false pretenses. In its case
brought Thursday, the agency sought forfeiture of Touch Tone's
profits and an injunction against any future deceptive practices by
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, who heads the House banking committee,
recently introduced legislation that would make it a crime to
knowingly deceive a financial institution to obtain confidential
information. But the proposal would also raise the burden of proof
for civil cases, which has created some concern at the FTC.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Justice Department have said that they believe
they implicitly have authority to make criminal cases under federal
wire fraud laws.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the laws on the issue are far from clear.
</P>
<P>
   Orson Swindle, a member of the FTC, dissented from the agency's
decision to file a lawsuit against Touch Tone on the ground that he
did not think the Federal Trade Commission Act or the agency's
guidelines on the law prohibited the Rapps' conduct.

 &HT;    Slower profits won't sidetrack Intel, execs say
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Intel Corp. has used its mastery of microprocessor
technology to build the world's largest, richest and most powerful
computer chip company.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Santa Clara, Calif., company's senior
management told Wall Street analysts that it retains its old magic
despite the seismic changes that are undermining profits in its
main market, the personal computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   The old magic has a new Internet theme to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to be the building block supplier to the Internet
economy,'' said Chief Executive Craig Barrett.
</P>
<P>
   That means developing faster and more powerful processor chips
for desktop computers that use the Internet and for server
computers than run Internet Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   But Intel's Internet strategy also is reaching into new areas.
The company revealed that it has formed the Intel Data Services
Division, which will create a global network of 10 or more service
centers located in the United States, Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Each center will have 2,000 or more server computers and cost
between $50 million and $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The centers will essentially become information processing
centers for electronic commerce and will speed up smooth and global
Internet electronic commerce around the globe, Intel promises.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett stressed that his company doesn't expect its core
market, the personal computer business, will dwindle, however.
Intel, he said, is simply building on its core business and
expanding into related markets with high growth opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intent is to make sure that networked bits (information)
will be shaped and shipped primarily by Intel silicon and Intel
services,'' said Intel Chairman Andrew Grove.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's new strategy probably means more competition for
companies like Motorola Inc. and Lucent Technologies Inc., among
others, that traditionally have devoted more of their businesses to
designing and selling chips to the communications business.
</P>
<P>
   As they spelled out new business opportunities at a meeting with
analysts in New York, Intel officials minimized concerns that
falling prices for personal computers will hurt the average prices
they can get for its processor chips.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is pushing hard at developing high-end chips for
engineering workstations, network server computers and high-end
notebook computers. Its most expensive chips sell for more than
$3,600 each. That helps balance the effects of its low-end Celeron
chips, some of which cost less than $70 each, on the company's
average product prices.
</P>
<P>
   What that means, analysts said, is that the trend toward
low-cost consumer computers probably isn't a sizable business
threat to Intel in the near-term future.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going in the right direction,'' said Venu Reddy, an
analyst with Waddell &AMP; Reed Investment Management Co. in Kansas
City. ``It looks like they are going to be the dominant platform
for computing for the next decade.'' But Intel doesn't intend to
stick with just computer chips. It intends to dominate a whole new
market, communications chips, where it has not been a player in the
past. Intel officials said the pending acquisition of Level One
Communications will give them a leg up to become leaders in selling
new kinds of communications processors that will be used to build
new kinds of networks that seamlessly tie voice and data
communications together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC was bound to evolve into a communications device,''
said George Balaschak, president of Boston Capital Advisors Inc.
``This is a natural extension of Intel's involvement with the PC. I
think Intel will do extremely well in making communications chips.
I think they can dominate.'' Barrett said he expects to see both
the communications chip business and the data services business
becoming multibillion-dollar industries within the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   He also hinted that two of the company's design centers in
Austin _ a joint venture design project with Analog Devices Inc.
and its StrongARM embedded processor project _ could lead to Intel
chips being sold to makers of next-generation cellular phones and
other hand-held communications devices.
</P>
<P>
   Intel officials said they expect their Austin design center will
grow to several hundred workers over time.
</P>
<P>
   Intel recorded $6.07 billion in profits on record revenue of
$26.3 billion in 1998 as the chipmaker pushed production of
high-performance, and high-price, chips that power engineering
workstations and network server computers. At the same time, Intel
engaged in a cost-cutting campaign that slashed its manufacturing
expenses on its low-end Celeron processors.

COMPAQ CHAIRMAN FACES THE STOCKHOLDERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Benjamin Rosen, the Compaq Computer Corp. chairman who
has taken the company's reins after ousting its chief executive,
faced stockholders who were alternately pleased and angry in a
spirited annual meeting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a question-and-answer session after the meeting's formalities
were concluded, Rosen listened patiently to everything from
accusations of illegal insider trading to suggestions that the
company merge with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   A request that the Houston-based computer maker sell shares of
its pending AltaVista Co. spinoff to current Compaq stockholders at
the offering's initial price drew enthusiastic applause but no
commitments from Rosen.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very complicated to do,'' Rosen said. ``Present plans
are to have a public offering of a minority stake reflecting the
value of the company, but the details of how that offering is (to
be) done have not been defined yet. But we certainly hear what you
are requesting.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Rosen's first appearance before stockholders since
Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq's chief executive since late 1991, and
Chief Financial Officer Earl Mason resigned on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen, along with board members Robert Ted Enloe and Frank
Doyle, have formed a three-member ``office of the chief executive''
to run the company.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq reported profits of 16 cents a share on Wednesday, a
penny over the estimate given in the April 9 earnings warning that
presaged Pfeiffer's departure. Before the warning, analysts had
expected Compaq to have profits of about twice that figure.
</P>
<P>
   Several shareholders complimented Rosen on ``cleaning house,''
but one asked, ``What took the board so long?''
</P>
<P>
   ``From what you have said, this was going on for five
quarters,'' the shareholder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This board has a serious responsibility, and the board cannot
act capriciously, or act on a single data point,'' Rosen said. ``On
the other hand, a board can't do as they did at IBM and Digital,
where red flags were flying after five and six years.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen repeated the declarations given to analysts and the press
over the last several days that he, Enloe and Doyle are studying
all facets of the company and will take ``whatever action is
necessary to address the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said again that his goal is to ``re-energize'' Compaq.
Rosen told reporters after the meeting that Compaq has become too
bureaucratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bureaucracy gets in the way of making decisions quickly,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen also heard from several shareholders _ including one who
flew in from Tokyo _ who were upset over sales of large amounts of
stock by board members and senior executives in February. Shortly
afterward, Compaq's stock began a tumble that has reduced its price
by more than half.
</P>
<P>
   The sales have inspired several shareholder lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen said the sales were approved by the company's lawyers, and
were made in a narrow window during which the company's officers
may sell shares. He told reporters after the meeting that the sales
were related to stock options and were considered part of the
executives' compensation package.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one shareholder called on members of the board and
senior executives to say whether they would express their
confidence in the stock by doing some ``insider buying.'' Only one
executive raised his hand.
</P>
<P>
   The standing-room crowd _ which spilled into two overflow rooms
on Compaq's northwest Harris County campus _ was most enthusiastic
about the idea of getting AltaVista shares at a cut-rate price.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders at the meeting proposed being allowed to buy stock
in AltaVista's spinoff at the initial price, before it hits the
market _ which could happen as early as this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Initial public offerings of Internet stocks have hit the market
at many times their opening prices. Under the proposal, current
Compaq shareholders would be able to buy shares at the opening
price, before market forces took effect.

ADMINISTRATION PLAN WILL OFFER KOSOVO REFUGEES PERMANENT RESIDENCE
IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A White House plan to bring 20,000 refugees from
Kosovo to the United States will make all of them eligible for
permanent legal residence, a senior administration official said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He said the administration expects that many of the refugees
will choose, after the war in Yugoslavia ends, not to go back to
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian-American groups and some private refugee organizations
reacted angrily on Thursday to the relocation plan, arguing that
while it is a humane offer, it sends a signal that the United
States does not expect the refugees will be able to return to
Kosovo any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   The relocation plan, announced Wednesday by Vice President Al
Gore in a speech at Ellis Island in New York harbour , would screen
Kosovo Albanians who have fled to refugee camps in Macedonia to
find 20,000 who have family in the United States or who are at risk
because of illness. Gore said the refugees would not be granted
political asylum. ``We anticipate their return to Kosovo,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But an administration official involved in planning the
relocation program said on Thursday that the refugees would be
accepted into the United States under a law that each year provides
about 75,000 refugees from around the world with federal housing,
health and job-assistance benefits. After 12 months, they would
have the option, under the law, of accepting a green card, which
confers permanent resident status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, the refugee program is used when it is clear
that the situation at home isn't resolvable,'' said the
administration official, who spoke on the condition that his name
not be used. ``We are going to try to create conditions in Kosovo
for these people to return, but the choice will ultimately be
theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   The relocation plan, a repackaging of another much-criticized
White House proposal to fly tens of thousands of Kosovo refugees to
the naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, grew out of President
Clinton's decision that the Albanian refugees under U.S. care
should not be confined in a prison-like camp, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president himself realized that it just isn't right for
these people to be so isolated from their loved ones and others
that they might need,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also grew out of a desire in the White House to relieve
pressure on the Macedonian government, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Macedonians have been alarmed by a flood of about 130,000
ethnic Albanian refugees who have been pushed out of Kosovo by the
security forces of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Slav majority in Macedonia has frequently come into conflict
with the ethnic Albanian minority, which makes up about one-third
of the population. Fearing that the ethnic Albanian refugees from
Kosovo will join forces with their ethnic Albanians, the Macedonian
government has alternately closed its borders, harassed the
refugees and cooperated with international groups building refugee
camps.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, it has complained bitterly to the United States
and Western Europe, demanding that the refugees be flown away to
third countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some basis to the Macedonians' concern,'' said the
administration official. ``It is a very new government. The last
thing we want to do is create another Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   At present, about 17,000 refugees from Macedonia have been sent
to 11 countries, with about 10,000 going to Germany. The White
House did not know on Thursday if those countries are offering the
same permanent resident status to Kosovars as planned by the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Refugee groups have criticized the relocation of Kosovo refugees
to third countries, saying that it split up families and that some
refugees did not want to leave the region. Television pictures two
weeks ago showed weeping refugees boarding a plane for Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said its new program will be voluntary,
carefully coordinated with refugee groups and that it is not
intended to change the basic goals of NATO's war against the
Milosevic government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a small part of a larger strategy to get people back
to their homes and that is the point of the military operation,''
said David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council.
``This is designed to give the Kosovars a number of options. No one
will come that doesn't want to. All will have their return flights
paid, so they can go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Albanian-Americans who are raising money to help the refugees
said on Thursday, however, that they do not think the White House
has thought through the consequences and symbolism of the
relocation program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed because this stuff all supports
Milosevic's plan for ethnic cleansing,'' said Avni Mustafaj,
director of the Kosovo Relief Fund, a New York group that raises
money for the refugees. ``It gives some people relief, and for that
we are glad. But once you start sending people out of the region,
the odds of them returning become smaller and smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   Some human-rights groups were critical of the program because,
they said, it appeased the Macedonian government's mistreatment of
refugees and because it sends a signal that Washington accepts
ethnic cleansing as an accomplished fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The signal we are sending to Milosevic is a disaster,'' said
Holly Burkholter, advocacy director for Physicians for Human
Rights, a Boston group that has eight monitors in the Balkans.
``This program is minuscule in comparison to the problem, and its
humanitarian usefulness is eclipsed by the political signal it
sends _ that we don't expect these people to be able to come home
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States Committee for Refugees, a group that defends
the rights of refugees worldwide, was less critical on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration deserves credit for showing flexibility,''
said Bill Frelick, senior policy analyst for the group. ``It
switched from the Guantanamo plan for immediate evacuation and is
putting together a voluntary plan that will look for family
connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Frelick said that it is unlikely that many of the refugees who
do enter the United States under the administration plan will want
to go back to burned and looted homes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A team of officials from Washington will fly to Macedonia this
weekend to begin setting up the selection process for refugees,
according to the White House. There are about 500,000 people of
Albanian descent in the United States, about half of them in the
New York metropolitan area. A large percentage of the Kosovo
refugees are expected to settle there.

 &HT;    Reno urges Americans to address violence
 &HT;    By C. Patrick Cleary
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLDEN, Colo. _ U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno Thursday used
the killing rampage at Columbine High School to urge the nation to
deal with the culture of violence crippling America's youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had more youth violence in the last 10 years than in
previous history,'' Reno told a battery of television cameras at
the Jefferson County Courthouse on Thursday. ``We must not be
complacent.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno steered clear of talking about the mass killings or any
details of the help the U.S. Justice Department is providing to the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she talked about the inspiration she has witnessed
since coming to Denver on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Reno suggested Americans stop youth violence through initiatives
that deal with the way guns get into the hands of youth, and the
values parents instill in their children.
</P>
<P>
   Reno warned the nation not to politicize the tragedy. Instead,
she encouraged those locally and nationally to work together to
solve the problems.
</P>
<P>
   The events of this week will not be remembered by the students
of Columbine as only a tragedy, said Reno, who met with some
students on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students and the community don't want to be known for
tragedy,'' she said. ``They want to be known as the school that
overcame adversity and tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a message self-described high school ``stoner'' Josh
Neilson said he and the athletes he used to not get along with have
come to an understanding about the last couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to talk about our differences,'' he said. ``But that
has changed now. We need to be together.''

RALLY BACKS MONTENEGRO-SERB LINK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia _ Feeding a growing tension between local
police and the national Yugoslav Army, 10,000 people filled the
heavily-guarded central square of Montenegro's capital Thursday to
demand the republic show solidarity with its sister republic of
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The rally, one of a series of anti-NATO demonstrations, was as
much a denunciation of the fragile government of Montenegrin
President Milo Djukanovic as a call to end the bombing. Djukanovic
has striven to maintain his authority over Montenegro through the
republic's police force, despite moves by the army to take control
away from the police. Many here fear the dispute could result in
civil war in the republic, which with Serbia makes up what is left
of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cannot be allowed that the police in Montenegro are
equipped and trained for conflict with the Yugoslav Army,'' Momir
Bulatovic, a close ally of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
said at the rally. Bulatovic lost to Djukanovic in last year's
presidential election in Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way is to take the police under control of our army.
They've got to obey or they won't exist,'' he told the cheering
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegrins have held anti-NATO rallies since the bombing began
last month. Thursday's protest was significant because of the
presence of Bulatovic, who is prime minister of Yugoslavia under
Milosevic and traveled from Belgrade for the event. The
pro-Milosevic camp is growing in Montenegro, threatening the
stability of the republic, whose government leans toward the West
and has declared neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Djukanovic is in real trouble now,'' said a middle-aged man at
the rally, who would not give his name. ``We gathered here in large
numbers. It's just a matter of time before he loses his position.''
</P>
<P>
   Bulatovic called the Montenegrin leader a ``puppet of the United
States,'' and the crowd screamed ``Traitor! Traitor!'' every time
Djukanovic's name was mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of supporting the Army, Djukanovic is creating his own
defense force,'' said Zoran Zizic, deputy chairman of Milosevic's
Socialist Party. ``There is no way to have two armies in
Montenegro. When this is all finished, we shall know who was right,
who was wrong, who was faithful, and who was not.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration was heavily guarded by both army soldiers in
riot gear and local police, and both forces lined the streets
leading to the rally, weapons at the ready.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators carried posters that said ``Target,'' and others
displayed images of the cross-shaped NATO symbol twisted into a
Nazi swastika.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly man approached by an Italian journalist leaped from
his perch at the base of a statue when asked his opinion of the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are spies! You are bombing us!'' he said, shaking his
finger in the reporter's face.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav Army has demanded that the Montenegrin police
surrender authority to them, but the police have refused. The most
recent confrontation was at the Croatia border, where several
hundred soldiers closed the border pass this week.
</P>
<P>
   The crossing reopened Thursday after negotiations between the
Montenegrin government and the police, but both the army and the
police are still watching over it in an uneasy standoff.

HARPER ITCHING TO BE IN ACTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The white towel is usually a dead giveaway.
If the towel is draping his bald dome like a bonnet, Derek Harper
is preparing to sit 48 minutes on the Los Angeles Lakers bench.
</P>
<P>
   After four straight games of that hooded posture, all part of
coach Kurt Rambis' campaign to rest him for the playoffs, Harper is
getting antsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt,'' he said, ``but you can't do it without
being put out there. . . . It's his decision, he says I need rest,
and all I can do is rest.''
</P>
<P>
   This is new territory for the 16th-year veteran, who has been
healthy and ready to play for most of the last week, despite the
official explanation that he had a sore right foot. He played just
seven minutes off the bench last week at Portland and has played
zero minutes in the four games since.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Rambis is starting Derek Fisher at point guard and
giving big minutes to rookie Tyronn Lue, trying to determine which
two-man combination the Lakers will use in the playoffs. So Harper,
who went to the bench after shooting 27 percent in his previous 10
games, sits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm more tired than anybody else,'' he said. ``I
guess the concern is me being 37 and having 15 years under my belt.
I think they're supposedly looking out for me, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not convinced of it (needing to rest), but I'm not going
to question what he wants to do as a coach,'' he added. ``And
obviously he wants to experiment and do some other things and try
some other people and all those things. If that's the case, then so
be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet one concern, health, begets another _ rust. Harper worries
he'll lose his rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you turn water on and off during the playoffs,''
Harper said. ``I'm not superhuman. I can't just turn it on when the
playoffs start. . . . I don't think you can be sharp just sitting
through games. So whatever (Rambis') thinking is, hopefully it'll
work.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The results: Rambis appears to be leaning toward a
combination of Harper and either Lue or Fisher for the playoffs,
but neither has distinguished himself.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher has started the past five games, shooting 28 percent,
averaging 3.6 points and 3.2 assists in 24.8 minutes. He has just
three assists in his past three games after combining for 17
against Portland and Utah last week.
</P>
<P>
   In the same span, Lue has averaged 7.4 points and 2.4 assists in
22.8 minutes and is shooting 39 percent. He played most of the
fourth quarter and all of overtime in the Lakers' comeback win at
Golden State on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hold the Rice: Since returning from a bout with tonsillitis
four games ago, Glen Rice is shooting 31 percent (18 for 58) and
averaging just 13.3 points. In the past two games, he's 8 for 33
(24.2 percent), including 3 for 14 from 3-point range.

`DURANGO' IS WARM AND FUZZY BUT NOT GREAT THEATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hallmark Hall of Fame presentations go well with pancakes. The
syrup flows freely and sweetly, and, unlike Saturday mornings in a
large household, it never seems to run out.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's 201st installment in the H.H. of F. body of work is a
worthy representative of this sticky genre. ``Durango'' takes us
back to 1939 in County Kerry, Ireland, where fields are dewy,
cheeks are rosy and accents are lilty. Mark Doran, a young man with
destiny writ large on his forehead, wants to get the best of a
greedy merchant named Vestor McCarthy, who has managed to keep
cattle prices _ and the local population _ depressed.
</P>
<P>
   Doran's bold idea is a 40-mile cattle drive to another town
where the
</P>
<P>
   market isn't monopolized by one individual. The route is
arduous, but Doran believes the trip will be worth it to get a fair
price _ and to get McCarthy's goat.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, McCarthy (Ian McElhinney) won't take the prospect of
financial ruin lying down. And so the stage is set: good vs. evil,
right vs. wrong, honor vs. treachery. We know the drill.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and what would a heroic Irish tale be without a love story?
Doran wants to marry Annie (Nancy St. Alban), the beautiful
daughter of the curmudgeonly Fergus Mullaney (Patrick Bergin), who
supports Doran's cattle drive but doesn't fancy losing his daughter
to the lad.
</P>
<P>
   The story is based on an experience that Irish author John Keane
remembers from his boyhood in the town of Listowel. He wrote a
novel about it seven years ago to remind himself of the event, and
of its importance to a small town of poor, courageous people.
</P>
<P>
   But Keane's story, or at least its translation to the small
screen, is so knowable that it's actually a little surprising when
all of the trite plot developments unfold as expected. Indeed, the
only surprise in ``Durango'' is that it's not a western. (The name
comes from the western-themed tavern that waits at the end of the
cattle drive.)
</P>
<P>
   When a story is this familiar, the writing and the performances
had better be off the charts. But not so. Walter Bernstein's script
sparkles here and there, but it ultimately fails to bring any depth
to the characters, many of whom are supposed to be just that _
colorful characters _ yet don't get enough time to establish
themselves. Thus, even the wonderful Brenda Fricker, as Doran's
feisty Aunt Maeve, is left trying to pour her considerable talent
into a shallow vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Shallow is the best summation of ``Durango.'' Matt Keeslar
gamely holds the story together as the principled and determined
Mark Doran. And George Hearn is amusing as an unconventional
Protestant clergyman. But the ``Durango'' story is the same
young-leader-coming-of-age saga that the A&AMP;E Network has been
telling all this month in its ``Horatio Hornblower'' series.
Frankly, ``Hornblower'' does it much better, with more engaging
stories and more thoughtful performances.
</P>
<P>
   Still, viewers who like lush scenery, uncomplicated stories and

NATO EXPECTED TO REJECT MILOSEVECH PEACE OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration and NATO allies were
poised to reject an offer Thursday by Yugoslavia's embattled
president, Slobodan Milosevic, to permit the United Nations to keep
peace in Kosovo if NATO forces stop pummeling his country.
</P>
<P>
   Former Russian prime minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, who met
throughout the day with Milosevic in Belgrade, told reporters the
Yugoslav leader had agreed in principle to ``the possibility of an
international presence led by the UN'' if NATO calls off its
five-week air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The talks came the morning after the NATO airstrikes hit home
for Milosevic, as cruise missiles ripped into one of his
presidential mansions in Belgrade, blowing apart his living room,
dining room and bedroom. Milosevic and his family were not in the
house when the missiles struck.
</P>
<P>
   Early this morning, air strikes hit the Serbian state television
(RTS) building, taking all channels off the air, residents said.
``The RTS building has been hit,'' said one witness. ``There is
smoke everywhere and there are people inside the building.''
</P>
<P>
   The developments unfolded as NATO agreed to formally reassess
the prospect of deploying ground troops to drive Serb forces out of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But US and NATO officials saw little more in Milosevic's
apparent agreement with Chernomyrdin, Russia's envoy to the
Balkans, than the first signs of hope that the Yugoslav president's
defiance may be dissolving amid the NATO assault.
</P>
<P>
   Barring major changes to the Milosevic offer, administration
officials said privately, the 19-nation NATO alliance is expected
to reject the plan because it contains two highly unacceptable
elements: barring armed troops from serving on a security force in
Kosovo and granting control of the peacekeepers to the UN rather
than NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the offer also raised suspicion in the White House
that Milosevic, who often feigned peace overtures before the NATO
bombing raids began, was engaging in a diplomatic ploy to score
public relations points and divide NATO on the eve of the
alliance's 50th-anniversary summit, which opens Friday in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, in a statement issued by his office after the
Chernomyrdin meeting, said: ``Yugoslavia and Russia are firmly
determined to jointly work for a peaceful resolution of the
problems in Kosovo, and that can be achieved only through political
means.''
</P>
<P>
   But the statement made no reference to permitting an
``international presence'' in Kosovo. And the statement reflected a
continuation of Milosevic's provocative rhetoric, as he ``condemned
the aggression of NATO ...and stressed that it must be stopped
without further delay.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking to reporters in the Rose Garden Thursday
afternoon, said he had just learned of Chernomyrdin's comments and
had no additional information. ``If there is an offer for a genuine
security force, that's the first time that Mr. Milosevic has ever
done that,'' Clinton said. ``That represents, I suppose, some step
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments earlier, Clinton had assailed Milosevic's ``reckless
tyranny'' and warned him to accept peace on NATO's terms or ``watch
as NATO grinds down his war machine.''
</P>
<P>
   There were these other developments on the 30th day of NATO air
raids aimed at halting the alleged genocide, rape and forced
expulsions by Serb forces that have driven 1.4 million ethnic
Albanians from their homes in Kosovo:
</P>
<P>
   --American and British officials reiterated their opposition to
invading Kosovo with ground troops, although they endorsed the NATO
move to assess the possibility of mounting such an attack.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said a study last year
determined that NATO would need as many as 75,000 troops to invade
Kosovo and at least 200,000 to fight all the way to the Yugoslav
capital of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not favor the deployment of ground troops into a hostile
environment in Kosovo,'' said Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright.
</P>
<P>
   --The Pentagon said NATO has damaged all four major routes from
Serbia into Kosovo, cutting the ability of Milosevic's forces to
supply ammunition, fuel and other supplies to the troops that are
carrying out the campaign of ``ethnic cleansing'' in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Though the supply flow has been cut in half, the Pentagon said,
Serb troops are ``still responding to political guidance and still
conducting operations.''
</P>
<P>
   --The European Union agreed to ban the shipment of oil to
Yugoslavia, beginning next week. NATO warplanes already have
destroyed most of Yugoslavia's oil refineries.
</P>
<P>
   --NATO is considering air drops of food and other supplies to an
estimated 850,000 Kosovars who are homeless in Kosovo and unable to
reach refugees camps in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   --A senior commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army was killed
and four rebel soldiers were wounded in battles with Serb forces
along the border between Yugoslavia and Albania.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, Chernomyrdin said he and Milosevic did not discuss
many details of ``the international presence'' in their proposed
peace pact for Kosovo. ``What kind of international forces they
will be or from which countries, this is yet to be discussed,''
Chernomyrdin said. ``The main thing is that Russia take part.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he supports Russia's inclusion in a NATO-led
peacekeeping mission involving armed troops. Of the NATO demands
for a ceasefire, Clinton said Thursday, ``We want all the people of
Kosovo restored to their homes, free of the hostile presence of Mr.
Milosevic's forces, protected by an international security force,
enjoying liberty and self-government.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, appearing with Clinton at
the White House, said NATO ``will not be divided'' and will
demonstrate its unity during the three-day summit. ``Let there be
no doubt NATO will see this through to the end,'' Solana said. ``We
have the means, and we have the will.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a senior Yugoslav government official assailed the
NATO attack on one of Milosevic's homes as ``a criminal act without
precedence _ an assassination attempt against the president of a
sovereign state.''
</P>
<P>
   US and NATO officials denied they were specifically targeting
Milosevic, the mastermind of alleged war crimes against ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, who represented 90 percent of the province's
population of 2 million before the siege began.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon described the raid as a part
of NATO's effort ``to cut off the head'' of the Serb military by
destroying ``the central nervous system, the central command and
control system, of the regime.''

STUDENTS INTENDED TO BLOW UP SCHOOL, SHERIFF SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Bomb squads on Thursday found a large
home-made bomb made from two propane tanks and a gasoline canister
at Columbine High School, leading the sheriff here to conclude that
two students were out to ``destroy the school'' on Tuesday when
they launched a murderous rampage that left 15 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery also heightened a growing belief that the two
young men who stormed the school firing shotguns and tossing pipe
bombs before taking their own lives had help from others in
planning for the attack, said the Jefferson County sheriff, John P.
Stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were going to burn the school up,'' said Stone, adding
that at least 32 explosive devices and several weapons have now
been found at the scene. The authorities have conducted interviews
with several students at the school who belonged to the group
informally known as the trench coat mafia, to which the two dead
youths belonged, and some members have been given polygraph tests.
So far, there have been no arrests, an investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to piece together the students' motivations and the
extent of preparations for the assault, the investigators have
seized hand-written notes and a short videotape that the two boys,
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, made last fall for a video
production class. Some students have described the video as a
macabre preview of the attack in which trenchcoat-clad students gun
down others who take the role of popular athletes at the school,
though the school district here declined on Thursday to make any
comment on such a video.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators also said on Thursday that they believed at
least some of the weapons used in Tuesday's attack may have been
stolen, although they are not sure when. The pair were armed with
shotguns whose stocks had been sawed off, a semiautomatic rifle and
pistol and a handgun.
</P>
<P>
   As local sherriff's department officers and federal law
enforcement officials carried out an investigation they estimated
could take weeks, the mourning for the dead continued for another
day.
</P>
<P>
   Under a spring storm that alternated between snow and rain,
students came to the school grounds on Thursday to be together and
leave offerings at makeshift memorials that have grown 2{ feet high
with flowers in places. But many also questioned whether they would
ever want to set foot inside Columbine High again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our friends died in there,'' said Dave Beadey, a 17-year-old
junior. ``Even if they cleaned it all up, you'd always know that
you were sitting in a place where people got killed. They should
just tear it all down and put up a new school someplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   The superintendent of the Jefferson County School District, Jane
Hammond, said on Thursday that the high school would remain closed
for the rest of this school year, and that school officials were
trying to find a place where Columbine's nearly 2,000 students
could finish the year. Students and teachers alike, Dr. Hammond
said, had implored them to find a place where they could all do so
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want them separated into different settings,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The horrific assault Tuesday continued to prompt sorrow and
soul-searching around the nation, but it also seemed to have
inspired threats of copycat incidents that led the authorities at
schools in at least three states _ California, Texas and
Pennsylvania _ to issue warnings or evacuate schools on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In Wylie, Texas, just northeast of Dallas, a ``profane and
threatening'' statement was found written on a wall of the
intermediate school, the police there said, prompting nearly all
parents to take their children out of the school.
</P>
<P>
   In Pleasant Hill, Calif., about 25 miles east of San Francisco,
College Park High School was evacuated and a bomb squad called in
after a package resembling a bomb was discovered on school grounds.
</P>
<P>
   And in Newtown, Pa., Council Rock High School will be closed
Friday because of ``unsubstantiated rumors circulating in the high
school that contained the threat of potential violence,'' the
principal, David Yates, said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado Springs, Colo., about 60 miles south of Denver, four
teen-agers were charged with trespassing after they arrived at
school in trench coats and masks in an apparent prank.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb found in the kitchen of Columbine High School on
Thursday was made from two 20-pound propane tanks similar to those
used with household grills, along with a gasoline-filled cannister,
which could have caused ``an extensive amount of damage'' had they
been detonated, Sgt. Jim Parr of the Jefferson County Sheriff's
office said at a news briefing Thursday night. And Parr held out
the possibility that still more explosive devices could be found as
investigators conduct an ``inch by inch'' search of the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say that all the bombs are out of the
school,'' he said. ``It's a very large building.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Thursday, Stone said that so much explosive material
had been found that the authorities believed there was a good
chance that other people were involved in the deadly attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's drawing suspicion out here that they would have time to
put as much ordnance in that school as they did without some
help,'' the sheriff said.

LEVINE DREAMS UP SUCCESS STORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The perfect Hollywood climax to Ken Levine's
career would be sharing a seat in the Dodger Stadium press box next
to his idol, Vin Scully.
</P>
<P>
   Levine seems to be the kind of person who could make it happen.
He's not only written his own ticket around these parts but
directed them as well. That's his OTHER job.
</P>
<P>
   The 49-year-old Woodland Hills native and Taft High and UCLA
grad has been hired by KXTA-AM (1150) to co-host the weekend
Dodgers ``Game Day'' shows when the team is on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Which might not seem like much. But with Levine's career
successes, it will be. Levine fell in love with baseball by
listening to Scully's calls as a kid and parlayed that into a
major-league play-by-play career of his own.
</P>
<P>
   In the TV world, Levine is better known for his scriptwriting,
directing and creative consultant work on award-winning shows like
``MASH,'' ``Cheers,'' ``Frasier,'' ``Wings'' and ``The Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   But fans of the Baltimore Orioles, Seattle Mariners and San
Diego Padres will also recognize his voice. For the last eight
years, he did play-by-play for those teams.
</P>
<P>
   Could the Dodgers, who have more than doubled their TV games
this year while allowing Scully to ease off on his schedule, be
Levine's next radio and/or TV broadcasting stop?
</P>
<P>
   It makes too much sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's such an unbelievable dream, I almost try not to think
about it,'' Levine admitted. ``I not only got interested in
announcing but in writing from listening to Vin Scully. To announce
the Los Angeles Dodgers is almost beyond my thinking. It's like
wanting to date Cindy Crawford.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially now that she's married and expecting a kid. And
Levine is happily married as well.
</P>
<P>
   Levine has made himself known to Dodgers personnel since 1988,
when he took a break from his sitcom writing to pursue a dream of
becoming a baseball play-by-play man. The Dodgers would allow him
to come down into the press box to pick up game information and
he'd take it up to the general-admission level and call the game
into a tape recorder to practice.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of years in the minor leagues, Levine caught on
with the Orioles for the '91 season. They wanted him back full
time, but it would mean having to move his family back East when a
lot of his writing work continued out here.
</P>
<P>
   That provided the basis of a book called ``It's Gone . . . No,
Wait a Minute . . .: Talking My Way Into the Big Leagues at 40.''
Astute fans of ``The Simpsons'' might also remember when he wrote
himself _ or his voice _ into an episode as the play-by-play man
for the Springfield Isotopes and got to scream: ``Topes win . . .
Topes win!''
</P>
<P>
   Levine worked full time with the Mariners in '92 and then part
time for them the next two seasons. In '95, Padres president Larry
Lucchino, who knew him from the Orioles, hired him to do a handful
of weekend games when Jerry Coleman had assignments for CBS Radio.
</P>
<P>
   But when CBS Radio lost the game rights to ESPN Radio this
season, Coleman went back to a full schedule with the Padres. And
Levine, in essence, was written out of their sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he's done a screenplay called ``Satisfaction'' that
he's trying to get produced. It's a romantic comedy set against the
backdrop of a Bakersfield radio station _ a place he's also worked
in his radio DJ career that started at KMPC in the late '60s and
included stops at KABC and KFI. Angelenos might also remember him
when he went by the name ``Beaver Cleaver'' from his FM days.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Levine has been directing shows like ``Lateline'' with
Al Franken, ``Just Shoot Me,'' ``Dharma and Greg,'' ``Becker,''
``Brother's Keeper,'' ``Encore, Encore'' and ``Conrad Bloom.'' His
real baby was the Nancy Travis sitcom ``Almost Perfect,'' which he
and writing partner David Isaacs created.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Levine's TV projects obviously made it big. Others have
had marginal success. Still others didn't make it out of the first
season. That's TV.
</P>
<P>
   But in baseball broadcasting, Levine's career has been almost
perfect.
</P>
<P>
   And, if truth be told, he's already had one chance to sit with
Scully in the press box. When Levine wrote for the KMPC sports desk
in 1969, the station's sports director, Steve Bailey, arranged for
Levine to meet Scully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I introduced myself and asked if I could watch him work,''
Levine said. ``He said, `Sure, come in the fourth inning after
Jerry (Doggett) finishes the third.' So I go in at the half inning,
and Vin waves me in and I sit in the chair next to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'M sitting in the booth next to Vin Scully. And there was
a great play where he makes the call, `He's out at the plate!' . .
. and I just had chicken skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years later, Levine is still pinching himself. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES &QL; 
Bryant Gumbel's closing remarks on the current installment of HBO's
``Real Sports,'' a series that picked up three national Emmy awards
at Wednesday night's ceremony: ``When two well-known athletes left
the stage last week it forced a lot of us media folks to do
something heretofore unthinkable and totally unwarranted, and that
was to put Wayne Gretzky and Dennis Rodman in the same thought. For
Rodman, that's social climbing. Because while one man defined
professionalism, the other not only lacked it entirely, but took
perverse pride in it. As much as one went out of his way for the
sake of the team to fit in, the other took the same pains to stand
out. That Gretzky was so conspicuously good, brought out the best
in those who covered him. That Rodman got so much coverage for just
being conspicuous doesn't speak highly of any of us. Predictably,
while one exited with honor, the other left in the kind of dishonor
he long courted. And therein lies some modern lessons for young
athletes looking to cultivate one of our divergent definitions of
character. As Dennis Rodman and Wayne Gretzky clearly proved, you
can be a character and enrich only yourself or you can show some
character and enrich us all.'' &QL; 
__ Fred Wallin and Peter Vent start venting on their new
sports-talk show weeknights from 6 to 7 p.m. on KVTA-AM (1520)
starting Tuesday.!dlim!WHAT CHOKES!dlim!__ Ted Turner's latest
verbal scud at Rupert Murdoch was at the National Association of
Broadcasters annual meeting in Las Vegas. Responding to the fact
Murdoch's Fox network has been pulling back advertising time from
its affiliates, Turner said: ``We will not do that at Time Warner.
We will not screw you and lie to you. . . He's getting you because
he's losing on his regional sports networks and he's got to pay
Kevin Brown's salary from somewhere.'' &QL; 
__ Deeply infected with Lupica Syndrome, Sports Illustrated
back-page sellout Rick Reilly-Stamos appeared on ``The Late Late
Show with Craig Kilborn'' Tuesday. Booked as a guest with nothing
really to promote except himself, Reilly had that talk-show banter
down and really acted sheepish when the equally swishy Kilborn
sprung some outtakes of Reilly's latest beer commercial _ a spot
which then actually ran in full during the commercial break in the
interview. &QL; 
__ The Angels should be kicking themselves for allowing Orange
County based KIK-FM (94.3) to take games bounced by KRLA-AM (570)
when the Lakers take precedent. Valley folk have a better chance of
picking up affiliate KSJB-AM (600) out of North Dakota. &QL;

SECOND DRAGGING DEATH TRIAL WILL REMAIN IN JASPER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD STEWART 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ The trial of a second white man accused of
dragging a black man to death will remain in Jasper, a state judge
ruled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection for the capital murder trial of Russell Brewer
Jr., 32, will begin May 17, state District Judge Monte Lawlis
ruled. Testimony will probably start on June 7, the first
anniversary of the brutal murder of James Byrd Jr., 49, who was
dragged almost three miles behind a pickup truck along back country
roads.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's attorney, Doug Barlow of Beaumont, gave Lawlis 11 hours
of videotaped news reports and stacks of newspaper articles about
the crime and the trial earlier this year of Bill King, 24, who was
sentenced to death. Trial for a third defendant, Shawn Berry, 24,
has not been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's girlfriend, Tammy Perritt, and brother, John Brewer,
were visibly upset about the ruling. John Brewer rushed from the
courtroom. Perritt sat with tears in her eyes, waiting for a chance
to spend a few moments with Brewer in a courthouse jury room before
he was taken to the county jail.
</P>
<P>
   John Brewer, 27, later issued a short statement he had written
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brewer family is totally devastated over the death of Mr.
James Byrd Jr. Our deepest sympathies and all of our prayers go out
to his family and his loved ones, as well as the King and Berry
families each and every night,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly do not understand why a change of venue was not
granted,'' he said as he began to sob.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep in mind I am his brother _ to be honest with the whole
world, I myself do not care where it is at. As far as I am
concerned this is my brother, Lawrence Russell Brewer, (and he) is
still an innocent man until proven guilty.''

COLORADO SCHOOL MASSACRE ALTERS COURSE OF DEBATE OVER GUNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Calif., Fla., Ill., Kan., Mo., Neb., N.M., Okla.,

 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ With gun manufacturers already on the defensive over
lawsuits, outrage over the nation's worst high school shooting in
modern history is altering the gun debate, bolstering the political
power of the gun-control advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Colorado, where three bills long advocated by the gun
lobby were expected to become law within days, Colorado state
legislators hastily withdrew two of them on Thursday and Gov. Bill
Owens unexpectedly promised to veto the third.
</P>
<P>
   And Mayor Wellington Webb of Denver has asked the National Rifle
Association to cancel its national meeting here, scheduled to start
April 30. Spurning a forecast $18 million in spending by the
conventioneers, the mayor said on Thursday, ``We don't want you
here.''
</P>
<P>
   In California on Thursday, the Assembly unexpectedly voted to
approve a bill intended to curb handgun trafficking, limiting sales
to one handgun per person each month.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida on Wednesday, the House unexpectedly tabled a bill
designed to prevent localities from suing gun manufacturers. In
Arizona on Wednesday, Gov. Jane Hull vetoed similar legislation.
And in Illinois, Gov. George Ryan urged state legislators to pass a
bill that would require adults to store guns at home with trigger
locks or in locked cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   The gun industry remains a powerful lobby in state governments
around the country. And it is likely that at least some of these
measures will be resurrected when the publicity surrounding the
shootings here subsides down.
</P>
<P>
   But the reaction marks a break in the momentum that the rifle
association and similar groups, which in recent months have sought
the passage of laws that would allow citizens in some states to
carry concealed weapons. The horror and revulsion brought on by
Tuesday's tragedy has also derailed efforts by the gun lobby in
some state legislatures to stop cities from passing tougher gun
laws. Moreover, it may give new vigor to proponents of lawsuits
against gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing out of this tragedy is that legislators are
listening to their constituents, and not the NRA,'' said Joe
Sudbay, state legislative director for Handgun Control Inc., a
Washington-based group.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that his office has deployed eight people to help its
lone receptionist field a deluge of calls after the Littleton
shootings, Sudbay said, ``Around the country, the same thing is
happening _ people are just fed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago _ well before the massacre at Columbine High
School _ Missouri voters defeated in a referendum intended to lift
the state's constitutional ban on concealed weapons. Even though
the rifle association outspent its opponents by nearly a 5-to-1,
voters rejected the idea, 52 percent to 48 percent. Political
analysts attributed the defeat to a large turnout of middle-class
Republicans from the suburbs of St. Louis, a constituency that in
the past the rifle association could rely on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun lobby has been losing influence over the past number
of years, so they have focused their energies on state
legislatures,'' said Sudbay, adding that no state has liberalized
concealed permit laws since 1996. ``Since January, concealed
weapons bills have been defeated in Nebraska, Kansas and New
Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy is now sharpest in Colorado, where grieving
residents are driving by a large billboard in which Charlton
Heston, the president of the rifle association urges passersby,
``Join me.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Rep. Diana DeGette wrote one of the convention's
featured speakers, Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, asking him to
cancel his appearance in Denver. Referring to the shootings in
Littleton, she wrote, ``Your appearance and the controversy
surround the NRA would throw salt into those wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasting angry demonstrations, state Sen. Pat Pascoe of
Denver urged the rifle association to ``cancel it totally, go
somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not welcome,'' Pascoe said. ``This shouldn't add to
the torture of the families.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, the rifle association has announced that it will
scale back the three-day event to one day, and will cancel all
seminars, luncheons and exhibitions by vendors and gun makers.
</P>
<P>
   Heston and Wayne LaPierre, the organization's executive vice
president, sent a letter out to members explaining that the steps
were taken, ``to show our profound sympathy and respect for the
families and communities in the Denver area in their time of great
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dietrick, a member of the rifle association from Colorado
who lobbied hard for the three bills this season, said, ``This was
supposed to be a happy event, now it can't be.
</P>
<P>
   Dietrick said the organization's bylaws required holding an
annual meeting, adding, ``We have got members from all over the
country who have purchased non-refundable tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   John Velleco, a spokesman for Gun Owners of America, a
Virginia-based group allied with the NRA, said on Thursday,
``Unfortunately, there are going to be politicians who are going to
climb over the bodies of the victims and pursue an agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last month, Colorado has also witnessed sharp debate
over the bills, which would have loosened restrictions on permits
for concealed weapons, would have banned local lawsuits against
weapon manufacturers and would have pre-empted local ordinances on
firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Concealed guns may go anywhere,'' was the page one headline on
an article in the Denver Post last month after the House approved a
bill intended to loosen restrictions on permits for concealed
weapons.

 DENVER: concealed weapons. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After public protests, another front-page article appeared three
days later with a headline that said, ``Protests knock schools off
weapons bill.''
</P>
<P>
   And days later, the sponsor of the bill, Rep. Doug Dean, was
challenged to a debate on the steps of the state capitol here by
Dennis Murphy, the fire chief in Springfield, Ore., who responded
to high school shooting last spring in which a student killed two
classmates and wounded 23.
</P>
<P>
   In unincorporated Jefferson County, which embraces Littleton and
where the two youths lived and went to school, there are no local
ordinances restricting the use of guns. Federal law bars most
firearms sales to minors. State law bars carrying firearms into
schools, unless for educational purposes.
</P>
<P>
   While many Coloradans have reacted to the Littleton massacre by
calling for tighter gun controls, some say the shootings bolster
their arguments for concealed weapons permits.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you make places like school off limits to the honest
carrying people, those who have gone through the background checks,
the training, you create a killing ground for those who are
inclined to do so, they know there is no resistance,'' said
Dietrick. A solution, he said, would be to allow a few trained
adults _ the principal and some teachers _ carry handguns at
school.
</P>
<P>
   But in today's climate, some politicians are finding they must
back off that position.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, for instance, Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota said
that the shootings in Littleton illustrated the need for ``conceal
and carry'' laws, or more gun permits for law-abiding citizens.
``Had there been someone armed in this particular situation, in my
opinion, it may have stabilized,'' Ventura said.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, responding to a large outcry, he issued of
statement saying, ``I believe that, except for uniformed police
officers, a school is no place for weapons, and that the carrying
of concealed weapons in schools is not the answer to this terrible
problem.''

AT&AMP;T BIDS TO BECOME BIGGEST CABLE PROVIDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.
Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling (888)
603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT and SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bidding to become the largest cable television provider in the
United States, AT&AMP;T Corp. made an unsolicited offer Thursday to
acquire MediaOne Group Inc. for about $58 billion in cash and
stock.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is trying to break up a deal announced last month in which
MediaOne agreed to be acquired by Comcast Corp. for $53 billion in
stock. AT&AMP;T has already won the support of Amos Hostetter, whose
family is MediaOne's biggest shareholder with about 13 percent of
the company.
</P>
<P>
   If AT&AMP;T, already the nation's biggest long-distance telephone
carrier, succeeds in its bid for MediaOne, it will have grown from
no presence in the cable television market to the nation's largest
cable company in less than a year. Last June, AT&AMP;T agreed to
acquire Tele-Communications Inc., the No. 2 cable company, for
$31.8 billion; that deal was completed last month.
</P>
<P>
   With TCI, AT&AMP;T now offers cable service in 10 of the 20 biggest
U.S. markets. If AT&AMP;T acquires MediaOne, almost three-quarters of
the combined company's subscribers will be in 15 of the top 20
markets, missing only Phoenix, Cincinnati, Tampa, Houston and
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, a combined AT&AMP;T-MediaOne would serve about 16 million
cable television subscribers and would be in markets covering about
27 percent of the nation's roughly 100 million homes. The company
would also be poised to serve millions of additional homes through
affiliates and partners. That raised concerns among some consumer
advocates Thursday that such a behemoth could stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   Since C. Michael Armstrong, a former IBM executive, took over as
AT&AMP;T's chairman in 1997, he has been trying to build a
comprehensive portfolio of voice, video and Internet communications
services that AT&AMP;T can offer to consumers in a single bundle. Just
as important, he has been looking for ways for AT&AMP;T to reestablish
the direct links into the homes of U.S. consumers that the company
lost when it was forced to shed its local telephone business in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   With its move into the cable television industry, which also
includes a troubled partnership with Time Warner Inc., AT&AMP;T is
getting set for a showdown with the Baby Bell local phone giants
for the ears and eyeballs of U.S. consumers. At least one of the
Bells could win regulatory approval to compete in AT&AMP;T's core
long-distance market this year, and AT&AMP;T plans to counter that by
offering consumers integrated packages of local, long-distance,
wireless, Internet and television service.
</P>
<P>
   If AT&AMP;T acquires MediaOne, the remaining independent cable
companies, like Cox Communications, would be faced with a titan in
their midst, even though cable companies do not generally compete
directly against one another.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne did not return a phone call from a reporter Thursday
night. Comcast declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T believes it can have a dominant role in the consumer
market,'' said Brian Adamik, an analyst for Yankee Group, a
technology consulting firm in Boston. ``We are moving to a duopoly
in the consumer market between AT&AMP;T and the Baby Bells.''
</P>
<P>
   Salvatore Muoio, who runs an investment firm that bears his
name, called the bid ``a terrific move for AT&AMP;T because by owning
systems outright, they control their own destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T is buying cable companies so they can offer local phone
and Internet service,'' Muoio said. ``Otherwise the local phone
companies could begin offering long distance while AT&AMP;T did not
have the ability to offer local phone and Internet service.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If you can't do everything, you are going to lose
market share in your core business, without taking it in new
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   If AT&AMP;T's bid for MediaOne succeeds, it would be a setback for
Comcast, the Philadelphia-based cable company that has been
competing with the telephone companies to offer high-speed access
to the Internet. As the only two industries that have
communications cables passing almost every house and business in
the United States, cable and telephone companies have been
positioning themselves to grab a share of each other's businesses.

EXISTENZ IS CONSISTENTLY ENGAGING AND FUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the the more obvious movie trends to take shape thus far
in 1999 are films that, in one way or another, play with the idea
of computer-generated, alternate realities.
</P>
<P>
   Already in the multiplexes is ``The Matrix,'' which supposes
that our current late-20th-century reality is actually only the
computer animation of some future race of malevolent machines.
</P>
<P>
   And coming in late May is ``The 13th Floor,'' about a pair of
visionaries who create ``a living, breathing simulation of 1937 Los
Angeles in a computer chip.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, there's David Cronenberg's latest offering,
``eXistenZ,'' which is the name of a role-playing computer game of
the future that can be downloaded directly into the human body.
</P>
<P>
   More precisely, the game is fed into a ``bioport'' _ a small,
permanent spinal jack embedded in the back _ so that the body's
nervous system, metabolism and energy provide the game's power
source.
</P>
<P>
   Cronenberg's story _ which he says was inspired by the plight of
Salman Rushdie _ is about the designer of the game (Jennifer Jason
Leigh), who goes on the lam to escape a band of
assassination-minded, anti-technology extremists.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by a worshipful devotee (Jude Law), she moves from one
tight situation and double-cross to another, at the same time she
and her companion move in and out of the eXistenZ game.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, they (and we) have no idea what is
computer-generated and what is real, and the story steadily works
to a climax of criss-crossed, illusion-and-reality scenes that
ultimately leaves the entire movie open to reinterpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone expecting ``The Matrix'' here is likely to be
disappointed. ``eXistenZ'' has an imaginative effect or two, but
the movie is not carried by its visuals in quite so spectacular a
way. It's basically a low-tech rendering of a high-tech subject.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the premise is solid, the script is clever and
well-thought-out, and the movie is consistently engaging and fun.
At exactly 90 minutes, it doesn't wear out its welcome, and it
never gets bogged down in pretension like the other Cronenberg
epics of the '90s _ ``Naked Lunch,'' ``M. Butterfly'' and
``Crash.''
</P>
<P>
   The cast strikes just the right note of alienated weirdness,
with some inspired cameos from Ian Holm, Willem Dafoe and
Christopher Eccleston. Law provides a sympathetic audience
point-of-view, and Leigh has never carried off a lead role with
more command and assurance, or with less reliance on her usual
mannerisms.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, the film is fueled by that distinctive blend of
horror, eroticism and technology-run-amok that we've come to expect
from the Canadian master of macabre. Love him or hate him,
Cronenberg is one of the cinema's true originals, and a trip to his
spooky world is always a harrowing, thought-provoking experience.
</P>
<P>
   eXistenZ. Directed and written by David Cronenberg. Cast:
Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law, Ian Holm, Willem Dafoe. Dimension
Films. 90 minutes. Rated R for sex and violence.

NFL VIP LENDS WEIGHT TO MOVE TO `SAVE THE PATS' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- National Football League commissioner Paul Tagliabue
will blitz Boston Friday as part of a campaign to keep the New
England Patriots in Massachusetts. But it appears the team will
stick with its stadium deal in Hartford, backed by $374 million in
taxpayers' money, unless the Bay State can top it _ quickly.
</P>
<P>
   That will be difficult, people familiar with the situation say.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran stood firm in his
stance against the state buying land around the team's current
stadium in Foxborough and leasing it back to owner Robert Kraft. He
also remains opposed to using using taxpayer money to finance any
part of a new facility other than public infrastructure, such as
roads and lighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no change in position,'' Finneran said. ``It's the
exact position we've had for three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Both provisions were part of a bill agreed to last year by Kraft
and Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham under which Kraft would
have spent $250 million to build a new stadium in Foxborough.
Finneran effectively killed that bill, opening the door for
Connecticut to lure the Patriots with what has been called the
sweetest stadium deal ever in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Finneran said Thursday he would not scramble
against a deadline to get the House to consider a local stadium
plan to rival Connecticut's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a budget ahead of us . . . education, the economy, and
health care and taxes, all of which have a higher priority in the
eyes of ordinary citizens, ordinary taxpayers,'' Finneran said.
``We'll move but at a pace that's appropriate. There won't be undue
delay, but there won't be undue haste.''
</P>
<P>
   Timing could be a significant stumbling block to any efforts put
forth by the NFL and a civic group headed by former Democratic
National Committee chairman Paul Kirk to secure the team's future
in Massachusetts before the league votes on the Patriots move at
the end of May.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of his preliminary accord with Connecticut, Kraft
has until May 2 to decide whether to commit to the Hartford
proposal. Despite environmental and logistical problems with the
site there, he is expected to go forward, people familiar with the
situation say.
</P>
<P>
   Then the move must be approved by NFL owners, who are set to
vote during their next conference in Atlanta, from May 24-26. Eight
out of 31 owners must vote against the move to derail the project.
League sources say there do not appear to be enough votes at this
point to stop Kraft from leaving.
</P>
<P>
   But that could change if the league comes up with a solid plan
to keep the Patriots in Masschusetts, the country's sixth-largest
TV market. That is the opening that local business leaders and
Tagliabue hope to exploit.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue is scheduled to meet with the Greater Boston Chamber
of Commerce executive committee at BankBoston headquarters and
later will head to the State House to speak with Finneran and
Governor Paul Cellucci, who addressed about 200 people rallying
outside the Bulfinch building to keep the team from moving.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci joined the crowd in chanting ``Save the Pats'' but
added a dose of reality to the last-minute hopefulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have an uphill battle,'' Cellucci said. ``But we do
have a second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Spread out before him, Patriots fans held signs that read
``Don't be Conn-ed'', ``The Boston TEAm Pahty'' and ``Send Finneran
to Connecticut and keep the Pats.'' Some in the crowd wore suits
and ties. Others painted their faces and wore football jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   Former Patriot Peter Brock took to the podium to urge those
inside the State House to ``leave their personal agendas and their
games behind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A rally with a couple hundred people singing on or off key is
not new information upon which to commit taxpayers funds to
private, profitable businesses,'' Finneran said, adding, ``I would
think there would probably be 20,000 citizens on the steps of the
State House to articulate a different point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the NFL passed a new financing rule under which it
could offer a loan to help build a Massachusetts stadium and the
business community could offer support to bridge small funding
gaps.
</P>
<P>
   But all of that would pale in comparison to the Connecticut
deal, under which the state would build a stadium and
infrastructure like roads. Kraft would build a hotel and health
complex, reaping profits from all of it.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft has remained silent in the face of this intense wave of
NFL involvement and media attention. But those close to the
situation say that while he may want the team to stay in
Massachusetts, he would be hard pressed to pass up the Hartford
deal.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he may be willing to move in 2003, a year later than
currently contemplated, rather attempt a stadium deal in Foxborough
or Boston to which he would have to contributed hundreds of
millions of his own money.
</P>
<P>
   Said one person close to the team, ``Their $374 million one year
later is still better than $250 million one year earlier.''

HOUSE REPUBLICANS GIVE UP EFFORT TO MAKE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN
SOCIAL SECURITY
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders in the House have abandoned the
idea of making fundamental changes in Social Security before the
next election, just as the top Republicans on the House Ways and
Means Committee are putting the final touches on a plan to base the
retirement program partly on private investments.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican House members said they had been told by
their party's leaders in meetings and private conversations this
week that trying to overhaul the Social Security system would
create a serious political risk for Republicans without any
likelihood of reward.
</P>
<P>
   The chances were already remote that Congress and President
Clinton could agree on comprehensive Social Security legislation
before next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who have met with the party leaders said they had
been told that polls commissioned by the party indicated that among
people who felt very strongly about Social Security one way or the
other, many more were skeptical about the Republicans' plan than
felt favorably toward the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans said they were also told that there was little
point in taking the political risk of voting for changes in the
most popular program created by the government when there was
little likelihood that the Senate would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   One of the chief sponsors of the private investment plan, Rep.
E. Clay Shaw Jr., chairman of the Ways and Means Committee's Social
Security subcommittee, said on Thursday that he and his cosponsor,
Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, chairman of the full committee,
recognized the obstacles and would not try to advance legislation
without the support of their party's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to dive into an empty swimming pool and neither
is Bill Archer,'' said Shaw, R-Fla. ``We're not going to move a
bill that the House is not going to embrace.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said he understood why the party leaders, including Speaker
Dennis Hastert, Rep. Dick Armey, the majority leader, and Rep. Tom
DeLay, the whip, were wary. ``The Democrats have used this is a
club against us for decades, and they have been damn good at it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Shaw said, he and Archer believe they have developed a
good plan and will announce the details anyway in the hope that the
leaders' minds will be changed by an outpouring of public support.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview, Archer said he felt compelled to offer
a plan because, ``I don't see any movement on Social Security, and
I feel this debate needs a shot in the arm.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no urgent reason to overhaul Social Security now. By
current estimates, it will remain solvent without changes until
2034.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, when Republicans began talking about using the
budget surplus to finance tax cuts, Clinton replied with the
assertion that the issue was whether to use the surplus to give tax
breaks to the wealthy or to shore up Social Security. This stance
played well in last November's election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union Message this year, the president
outlined a proposal to strengthen Social Security by using most of
the budget surplus over 15 years to pay down the national debt and
by having the government invest part of Social Security tax
revenues in stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who have been burned time and again when they have
tried to tinker with the popular Social Security program, then
began to search for proposals that would fit their ideological
predilictions. They countered with two plans.
</P>
<P>
   For the short term, they offered legislation that would allow
Social Security taxes to be used only to reduce the national debt
or to finance an overhaul of the retirement system. It was blocked
on Thursday when Senate Republicans could not get the 60 votes
necessary to clear the parliamentary hurdle of cutting off debate.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the Republicans began working on a measure to
allow people to divert some of their Social Security taxes into
private retirement accounts that they could invest in the financial
markets. Such a measure has long been a dream of Republicans who
want to keep the government out of people's lives as much as
possible and who believe many retirees get a bad deal from the
public retirement program.
</P>
<P>
   In that vein, Archer and Shaw developed a plan that would
include a tax cut to give workers money they could invest. The
plan, which has been certified by Social Security actuaries as
sufficient to keep the system solvent for at least 75 years, would
guarantee workers retirement benefits no smaller than what they
could expect under the current Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan has come under fire from the left and right. The
White House and liberal Democrats object to making the retirement
program partly private. They believe it would be the first step
toward breaking the longstanding social compact under which each
generation pays taxes to support retirement benefits for the
previous generation.
</P>
<P>
   Many conservative Republicans object to parts of the plan that
would require retirees to turn their investment accounts into
annuities, mandate a portfolio of 60 percent stocks and 40 percent
bonds and leave little or nothing in most retirement accounts to be
bequeathed to heirs.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, William V. Roth Jr., R-Del., who is chairman of
the Finance Committee, has told colleagues that he has no intention
of moving Social Security legislation this year.

NFL VIP LENDS WEIGHT TO MOVE TO `SAVE THE PATS'

<P>
   BOSTON -- National Football League commissioner Paul Tagliabue
will blitz Boston Friday as part of a campaign to keep the New
England Patriots in Massachusetts. But it appears the team will
stick with its stadium deal in Hartford, backed by $374 million in
taxpayers' money, unless the Bay State can top it _ quickly.
</P>
<P>
   That will be difficult, people familiar with the situation say.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran stood firm in his
stance against the state buying land around the team's current
stadium in Foxborough and leasing it back to owner Robert Kraft. He
also remains opposed to using using taxpayer money to finance any
part of a new facility other than public infrastructure, such as
roads and lighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no change in position,'' Finneran said. ``It's the
exact position we've had for three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Both provisions were part of a bill agreed to last year by Kraft
and Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham under which Kraft would
have spent $250 million to build a new stadium in Foxborough.
Finneran effectively killed that bill, opening the door for
Connecticut to lure the Patriots with what has been called the
sweetest stadium deal ever in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Finneran said Thursday he would not scramble
against a deadline to get the House to consider a local stadium
plan to rival Connecticut's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a budget ahead of us . . . education, the economy, and
health care and taxes, all of which have a higher priority in the
eyes of ordinary citizens, ordinary taxpayers,'' Finneran said.
``We'll move but at a pace that's appropriate. There won't be undue
delay, but there won't be undue haste.''
</P>
<P>
   Timing could be a significant stumbling block to any efforts put
forth by the NFL and a civic group headed by former Democratic
National Committee chairman Paul Kirk to secure the team's future
in Massachusetts before the league votes on the Patriots move at
the end of May.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of his preliminary accord with Connecticut, Kraft
has until May 2 to decide whether to commit to the Hartford
proposal. Despite environmental and logistical problems with the
site there, he is expected to go forward, people familiar with the
situation say.
</P>
<P>
   Then the move must be approved by NFL owners, who are set to
vote during their next conference in Atlanta, from May 24-26. Eight
out of 31 owners must vote against the move to derail the project.
League sources say there do not appear to be enough votes at this
point to stop Kraft from leaving.
</P>
<P>
   But that could change if the league comes up with a solid plan
to keep the Patriots in Masschusetts, the country's sixth-largest
TV market. That is the opening that local business leaders and
Tagliabue hope to exploit.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue is scheduled to meet with the Greater Boston Chamber
of Commerce executive committee at BankBoston headquarters and
later will head to the State House to speak with Finneran and
Governor Paul Cellucci, who addressed about 200 people rallying
outside the Bulfinch building to keep the team from moving.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci joined the crowd in chanting ``Save the Pats'' but
added a dose of reality to the last-minute hopefulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have an uphill battle,'' Cellucci said. ``But we do
have a second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Spread out before him, Patriots fans held signs that read
``Don't be Conn-ed'', ``The Boston TEAm Pahty'' and ``Send Finneran
to Connecticut and keep the Pats.'' Some in the crowd wore suits
and ties. Others painted their faces and wore football jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   Former Patriot Peter Brock took to the podium to urge those
inside the State House to ``leave their personal agendas and their
games behind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A rally with a couple hundred people singing on or off key is
not new information upon which to commit taxpayers funds to
private, profitable businesses,'' Finneran said, adding, ``I would
think there would probably be 20,000 citizens on the steps of the
State House to articulate a different point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the NFL passed a new financing rule under which it
could offer a loan to help build a Massachusetts stadium and the
business community could offer support to bridge small funding
gaps.
</P>
<P>
   But all of that would pale in comparison to the Connecticut
deal, under which the state would build a stadium and
infrastructure like roads. Kraft would build a hotel and health
complex, reaping profits from all of it.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft has remained silent in the face of this intense wave of
NFL involvement and media attention. But those close to the
situation say that while he may want the team to stay in
Massachusetts, he would be hard pressed to pass up the Hartford
deal.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he may be willing to move in 2003, a year later than
currently contemplated, rather attempt a stadium deal in Foxborough
or Boston to which he would have to contributed hundreds of
millions of his own money.
</P>
<P>
   Said one person close to the team, ``Their $374 million one year
later is still better than $250 million one year earlier.''

 &HT;    Police uncover propane-tank bombs in aftermath of shootings
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ This shell-shocked town had fresh snow and
fresh worries Thursday, as police found two powerful propane-tank
bombs in the Columbine High School kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery renewed suspicions that Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold, the two boys who gunned down 12 students and a teacher on
Tuesday, may not have acted alone in planning and preparing their
deadly melee. Police also said the newly found bombs showed the
boys may have wanted to burn their school down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a strong suspicion because of the amount of ordinance
that they had some assistance,'' Jefferson County Sheriff John
Stone said. ``The evidence supports that these individuals not only
were on a shooting spree, but also were intent on destroying the
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 70 investigators split into several teams scoured the
sprawling school building about midday when they came upon the
devices in the kitchen. The two, 20-pound propane tanks _ similar
to those used on barbecue grills _ would have made a massive
explosion, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, police believe the two boys, who wore black trench coats
and laughed as they fired upon their victims, were the only
shooters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no evidence that anyone else was involved,'' said
sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis. ``But we're not ruling out
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   As the officers worked on what may turn into a weeklong
investigation inside the building, Columbine students and others
continued gathering in Clement Park, near the school campus.
</P>
<P>
   An overnight blanket of snow seemed to add a new layer of
solemnity to the site, where makeshift memorials of flowers,
stuffed animals and hand-written posters and cards grew into
massive piles. Tents were erected to cover the memorials, which
drew hundreds of students and other onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them simply stood silently, heads bowed, some sobbing as
drops of melting snow spattered hand-scribbled notes, pink and blue
ink running down poster board and pages torn from school notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   At one of the tents, someone pounded 13 small crosses into the
ground, four painted pink for the female victims, nine painted blue
for the males. To the side, lying on the ground, were two black
crosses, apparently for the shooters.
</P>
<P>
   The pile of flowers, balloons and heartbroken notes atop a red
Acura Legend belonging to 17-year-old Rachel Scott, one of the
victims, also grew dramatically, literally covering the vehicle. A
small teddy-bear was attached to the driver's side mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Columbine's students called a private meeting with their
teachers late Thursday, one more sign of their need to talk, hug,
and simply share their emotions as they struggled to make sense of
the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   School officials were scrambling to find a building where they
could move the 2,000 students for the remaining three weeks of the
term.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students are saying they want to be back together with
their teachers,'' said Jefferson County Superintendent Jane
Hammond. ``We are committed to keeping them together.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno visited Denver on
Thursday, meeting with top officials and pledging federal support
for their investigation. She also spoke to students upset by the
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association, which had an annual meeting
scheduled in Denver in the near future, announced it would scale
back its meeting from three days to one, although some Denver
groups called on the group to cancel the meeting completely.
</P>
<P>
   All over Denver, the main question was why the suspected
shooters chose to vent their anger in such a terrible fashion.
</P>
<P>
   After releasing statements of condolence Wednesday, their
families remained in seclusion, their neighbors saying little.
</P>
<P>
   Media reports said Harris' father was retired from the military.
Klebold's father was a geophysicist who worked for oil exploration
companies for years, but lately had run a mortgage management
business from his home, a sprawling, $500,000 property on five
acres outside of town.
</P>
<P>
   Klebold's mother once worked with deaf, blind and disabled
children, while friends said his father favored gun control and
likely wouldn't have owned any weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Several students gave more details about videos the pair made in
a class at school. In at least one of the videos, they apparently
wore trench coats and carried guns, an eerie foreshadowing of their
tragic rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Cory Hardison, 18, a Columbine senior who knew the suspected
shooters, said the videos were tongue-in-cheek, not taken seriously
by other students or faculty. The boys got in trouble once for
using profanity in a video, but the guns were apparently never an
issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police also confirmed that a note was found at Harris' home, but
would not reveal the contents or even the general tone.
</P>
<P>
   Harris' Web page, taken off the Internet by his provider in the
wake of the killings, reportedly contained seething anger, dark
images, demonic drawings and references to death.
</P>
<P>
   Students also said Harris wrote poems with disturbing themes in
his creative writing class.
</P>
<P>
   Police continued to defend their handling of the rampage,
insisting that a small SWAT team was in the building within 20
minutes, while the school's assigned resource officer fired on the
suspects within minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But the family of slain teacher Dave Sanders wondered whether he
might have been saved by faster police action. Sanders reportedly
shouted the first warnings in the school cafeteria that likely
saved dozens of lives, then stayed in the school warning more
students when he had the chance to escape.
</P>
<P>
   He was eventually shot in the chest, collapsing in a science lab
where a group of terrified students ripped off their shirts to
staunch his wounds. He remained in the room for some three hours,
despite frantic calls placed to police operators via cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is that my dad was left there, was still alive and
wasn't helped,'' said Sanders' adult daughter, Angie.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end, Sanders asked the students with him to pull his
wallet from his pocket so he could look at pictures of his wife and
children, Angie Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   Such images are likely to stay etched in the minds of the
students and the victims' families for the rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Even veteran authorities have been shaken by the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the most devastating things I've ever seen,'' said
Jefferson County District Attorney David Thomas, who toured the
school before the bodies were removed. ``One of the kids still had
a pencil in his hand. It's just something I wish I could erase from
my mind, but I don't think I can.

`HIDEOUS KINKY' MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER WITH A NARROWER FOCUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coming off both a best actress Oscar nomination and the biggest
movie hit of modern times, one would think ``Titanic'' star Kate
Winslet would be taking advantage of her fame with one A-level
movie project after another. Yet, like co-star Leonardo DiCaprio,
she's been lying low.
</P>
<P>
   And now here she is in ``Hideous Kinky,'' a low-budget, art
house adaptation of an obscure novel by Esther Freud in which she
plays a not-especially sympathetic English hippie hanging out in
'70s Morocco with her two young daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the modest budget aside, it's an interesting project,
and an often fascinating and scary movie. Indeed, with a somewhat
more probing script than the one provided by director Gillies
MacKinnon's brother Billy, this might have been something truly
special.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1972, it's the story of Julia (Winslet), the estranged
mistress of a noted poet, who has somehow ended up in the hippie
mecca of Marrakech with her two daughters, 6-year-old Lucy (Carrie
Mullan) and more dissatisfied 8-year-old Bea (Bella Rea).
</P>
<P>
   When we join them, the family has been in Morocco for about a
year. They live in near poverty on the backstreets of the city, but
are reasonably well-adjusted to their environment and constantly
expect a support check from the children's father.
</P>
<P>
   The script follows Julia's episodic adventures over several
months as the family becomes attached to a Moroccan street
performer (Said Taghmaoui), make several hitchhiking journeys
around Morocco and to Algeria, and find themselves in one
vulnerable _ even dangerous _ situation after another.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the movie is filled with wonderful little moments
of revelation, and the exotic visual splendor of North Africa _ all
which is exquisitely reflected in the wide eyes of the children,
who are perfectly cast and completely natural.
</P>
<P>
   Winslet brings off a delicate, detailed character study of a
naive and courageous young woman in pursuit of spiritual
enlightenment, and trying to embrace the esthetic of the
counterculture even as it battles with her own maternal instincts.
The performance speaks whole volumes about the hard core of the
'60s generation.
</P>
<P>
   Director MacKinnon (``The Playboys,'' ``Small Faces'') also
projects just the right ambivalent attitude toward Julia and her
quest. He seems to admire her, even while he realizes her hippie
naivete is doomed to frustration, perhaps disaster, and the risks
she's taking with her children are insane.
</P>
<P>
   His soundtrack is littered with American rock songs _ the
Jefferson Airplane, Crosby, Stills &AMP; Nash, America _ but the
juxtaposition of images makes them come off less as cheerful
nostalgia than as a sad, wistful ode to an impractical lost dream
of limitless freedom and possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is so powerful in so many ways that it's painful that
it doesn't go all the way. But it's also filled with holes (an
explanation of the title, for instance) and the kind of gaps in
character development that are usually evidence of script problems
and a massive, last-minute re-editing job.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a movie that might have been better served by
narrowing its point of view to that of the two children _ as Jean
Renoir did in ``The River,'' a curiously similar film about the
coming-of-age of two British girls in India.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the perspective is scattered, confusing and finally
tiring. But had we experienced this world _ Morocco, the hippie
'70s, Julia's quest _ entirely through the innocent eyes of Bea and
Lucy, this might have been considerably more than another good-try
art film.
</P>
<P>
   Hideous Kinky. Directed by Gllies MacKinnon. Screenplay by
Billy MacKinnon, from the novel by Esther Freud. Cast: Kate
Winslet, Said Taghmaoui, Bella Riza, Carrie Mullan. 99 minutes.

 &HT;    Team Petty on fast track
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLADEGA, Ala. _ Halfway through the 1994 Winston Cup season,
John Andretti was losing his ride in the sponsorless No. 14 car
when he heard that Richard Petty might be looking for a driver. So
he went up to Petty in a track garage area and applied for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to the King for about 15 minutes and he said, `Well,
just come on down to Level Cross, and we'll talk some more.' And I
looked at him and asked, `Well, where's Level Cross?' And the guy
next to me hit me. He said, `Be quiet; I'll tell you where it's at
later.'''
</P>
<P>
   Andretti laughs about his naivete now. ``Level Cross is about
the smallest little town you could ever know,'' he said, ``but
anybody in racing should know where Level Cross is because it's
where the King is from.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the smallest little town just south of Greensboro, N.C.,
is where Petty, modern stock-car racing's King, hung his crown.
It's been a decade since there was reason to remember the address.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Andretti is helping put Level Cross back on the map.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti snapped a personal 57-race winless streak last weekend
at Martinsville Speedway. He put Petty Enterprises in victory lane
for the first time since October 1997, snapping a string of 42
races.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Hensley drove the team's Dodge to victory in the
truck-series race on Saturday, making Petty Enterprises the first
team to win a Winston Cup and truck event at the same speedway with
different drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The team's timing has been incredible: Two weeks ago, Petty
Enterprises cut the ribbon on its 20,000-square-foot addition and
kicked off a 50th anniversary celebration.
</P>
<P>
   What's happened since: Petty has had seven NASCAR entries _ four
Winston Cup, two Truck Series, one Busch Grand National _ in five
different races and has recorded two wins, four top-fives and six
top-10s.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti won last weekend in the No. 43 Pontiac. Kyle Petty, who
did not have a top-10 finish all last season, already has three
this year in the No. 44 Pontiac. Adam Petty, Kyle's son, has been
impressive in his Busch series debut.
</P>
<P>
   Small steps but solid ones. Kyle understands better than any of
the Pettys.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time Petty Enterprises was the yardstick for
Winston Cup racing,'' Kyle said. ``We were the Hendricks and the
Roushes of the day. To be honest, we kind of fell off that in the
'80s. Now, we're trying to get caught back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty Enterprises was once at that top level because Richard was
the most successful driver of his era. Seven years after his
retirement, he still holds records for career wins (200), career
poles (126), wins in a season (27), consecutive wins (10), most
years leading the circuit in wins (seven) and a bunch of others.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Petty stayed in his car too long and did not
groom a replacement driver. His last pole was 1978. Between 1984
and his last year, 1992, he went 199 races without a win. He even
left Petty Enterprises in the mid-'80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anytime you have anybody who's had as much success in
a sport as Richard had, it's a hard, hard thing to give up,'' said
Robbie Loomis, Andretti's team manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby Allison went through it, and now Darrell Waltrip. They
love the sport so much. As we get older, our reactions are not the
same, we can't physically do the things we used to do, our mind's
not quite mentally as sharp. We have more wisdom and knowledge, but
a lot of times the other things outweigh it. I think Richard would
tell you he probably drove three or four years longer than he
needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Loomis joined Petty Enterprises in November 1988, missing the
King's best days and experiencing the downslide. He realizes that
the climb back to respectability is going to take more than a good
weekend at Martinsville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I told the guys in the shop, the win was great for us; it
shows what we can do,'' Loomis said. ``I want to get to feel like
(Jeff Gordon's crew chief) Ray Evernham on Mondays, and it's just
no big deal because you've done it so many times.''
</P>
<P>
   Andretti is quick not to put too much weight on one victory. He
isn't even optimistic about this weekend's DieHard 500 at Talladega
Superspeedway, given the team's problems with restrictor-plate
racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you win, it's such a great feeling,'' Andretti, who
has won twice in slightly more than five Cup seasons. ``I don't
know that it's a relief, because it all starts back at zero the
next week. But your zero's a lot closer (to success) because it
just happened for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Andretti is a big part of the Petty equation. This is his second
time with Petty. He left in 1995, joining a new Kranefuss-Haas
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I got a better opportunity,'' he said. ``I was very
new to NASCAR, I didn't know the names of the people and the
personalities that well, it was a new team that felt like they had
the funding and the personnel to really do it right. They kept
raising the money.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was a bad fit. His next job, with Cale Yarborough, ended
with sponsor problems. He finally asked Petty for his old job back.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I would have stuck around, we would be that much further
down the road,'' Andretti said. ``They would have been working with
the same guy for this whole duration. You can change people within
the team, but changing drivers is such a big change, it just
doesn't happen overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, they could have fooled NASCAR.

MISSILE PAYS A CALL ON MILOSEVIC, BUT HE WAS NOT AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ NATO sent a missile into the bedroom of
Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, early Thursday morning,
but insisted it was nothing personal.
</P>
<P>
   Three missiles devastated the elegant 1936 villa in the wealthy
Dedinje district at 15 Uzicka Street, the most famous address in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   An eclectic two-story building of white stucco, with columns and
rounded windows that its original owner described as a little
Hollywood in inspiration, the villa was built as a private house
and finished in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   Tito appropriated the house for himself in 1944, after taking
power in Belgrade, and Yugoslav leaders have lived there since
then, making it an official residence.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is a charred ruin. One entire side wall of the structure
is blown away, all the windows are broken, and many trees in the
surrounding parkland have been uprooted.
</P>
<P>
   There are gaping holes where the missiles pierced the walls,
flares of soot shoot from the arches of the empty window frames,
and chunks of concrete and broken glass are scattered over the
lavish grounds.
</P>
<P>
   NATO may have intended its missiles as a message to Milosevic,
who has not been sleeping at the house in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Tito, who is associated with the house more than any of his
successors, is buried in a sort of mausoleum 200 yards away in what
is known as the House of Flowers, a glassed-in structure where he
used to run the government in the summertime. Serbian television
gave no indication of any damage to the House of Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Yugoslav officials were livid in Milosevic's name.
They accused NATO of trying to assassinate the leader of a
sovereign state, and said the other missiles, which hit at about
3:15 a.m., had struck the living and dining rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has been avoiding the house ever since a
little-reported missile attack on a nearby building housing his
presidential guard, in which as many as 30 people are said to have
been killed, Serbian officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, for its part, claimed that the building was a vital link
in the military command system of Yugoslavia and that the strike
had nothing to do with Milosevic or its symbolic importance to the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   But this building was no radar station, and some Serbs reacted
with anger and incredulity.
</P>
<P>
   A Serbian photographer said: ``This is simply demagoguery.
Whether one likes Milosevic or not, this is outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Serbian journalist with the magazine Vreme said: ``This
building is part of our cultural heritage. Yesterday Tito lived
there, and today Milosevic does, but tomorrow it will be Pera
Pric.'' That is the Serbian form of John Doe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If NATO wants to pretend now that it's hit at the heart of the
repressive regime and not the Serbian nation, it's not true,
because they've only done this after a month of hitting civilian
targets,'' the journalist said.
</P>
<P>
   The journalist, who asked for anonymity, bemoaned the regular
trashing of Belgrade's cultural history, saying, ``When people come
to visit Belgrade, I can't show them a building more than 200 years
old, because every 50 years somebody bombs and blows them away.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nearby, the old royal palace, the Beli Dvor, or White Palace, is
a ceremonial residence, where Milosevic and others before him
normally meet guests, but do not live.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has put the Beli Dvor off-limits as a target, in part
because a Rembrandt borrowed from the National Museum is on the
first floor. But the residence destroyed on Thursday is also listed
on the Yugoslav register of protected cultural sites.
</P>
<P>
   Goran Matic, a Serbian government minister of the Yugoslav
United Left Party of Milosevic's wife, Mira Markovic, did not try
to contain his anger at a news conference. ``NATO committed a
criminal act without precedence _ an assassination attempt against
the president of a sovereign state,'' Matic said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and other Western officials called the building a
presidential command post and legitimate military target.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic himself is not a target,'' said the White House
spokesman, Joe Lockhart. ``The command and control center is.''
</P>
<P>
   But the spokesman for the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry, Nebojsa
Vujovic, said the building had no military utility and challenged
NATO to find ``one wire or one button.''
</P>
<P>
   Vujovic asked, ``Are their next targets child-care centers?''
</P>
<P>
   About 24 hours earlier, NATO had destroyed an office building
housing the offices of Milosevic's party as well as the radio and
television studios and transmitters of stations belonging to their
daughter, Marija, and their friends. That attack was seen as the
beginning of a targeting of the regime itself and its most notable
associates.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern Serb town of Krusevac on Thursday, about 125
miles from Belgrade, Zivadinka Damjanovic, the director of a home
for the elderly, was furious about the attack on the residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO showed its real position when they destroyed the
president's house,'' she said to a group of reporters visiting the
town. ``This was not his house, but an official one, and it was
built long before him.''
</P>
<P>
   Damjanovic said the attack only proved that NATO is being
disingenuous about the stated war aims. ``The point is destruction,
and not any kind of humanitarian protection or intervention,'' she
said. ``It's very obvious they want to occupy us and destroy us as
a people.''
</P>
<P>
   The villa, built by a wealthy engineer named Alexander Acovic,
was completed in 1936. His nephew, Dragomir Acovic, is currently
the president of the Serbian Heraldic Society and something of a
monarchist.
</P>
<P>
   According to Acovic, the Nazis seized the house in 1941 when
they occupied the country. Tito confiscated half of it in 1944 when
he came to Belgrade, forcing Acovic's uncle to sell the rest to the
state in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   The building is said to have one of the best air raid shelters
in Belgrade, which was apparently part of the original design.
Dragomir Acovic has said that on April 6, 1941, when the city was
bombed, the government held a cabinet meeting in the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Serb state television led its evening news with the building's
destruction. A commentator called the attack ``the drop that spills
the glass of condemnation by the largest part of justice-loving
humanity.'' It also cited the disapproval of Viktor Chernomyrdin,
the former Russian prime minister who is now serving as President
Boris Yeltsin's special Balkan envoy.
</P>
<P>
   With more fervor than realism, perhaps, the commentator asserted
that the destruction of the villa ``will no doubt start the
momentum of the resistance of the world to NATO's criminal
machinery.''

U.S. CONFIRMS IT WILL KEEP DEADLY VIRUS CELLS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton's decision to retain samples of smallpox virus
in the United States is likely to lead to more scientific
cooperation and biological research with Russia at a time of badly
strained relations, administration officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the White House announced Thursday that the
president, acting largely on the advice of independent scientific
advisers, had decided to delay the planned destruction of the
samples of the deadly virus in June because he feared the disease,
apparently eradicated, might revive naturally or be spread by a
terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   The White House stressed that the decision was motivated solely
by national security and scientific considerations, and on the
president's conclusion that retaining the virus was ``the best way
to reduce the loss of life in the event of an outbreak,'' said
David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the administration hoped that the reversal of its
previous support for destruction would open up possibilities for
joint research with Russia, the only other nation known to have
smallpox stocks and a fervent opponent of their destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly hope to have a cooperative relationship with the
Russians on this issue, and we have been working together to
strengthen security at their facilities and on many other projects
of mutual benefit,'' Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he added, the administration is ``looking forward
to working with the Russians and others at the World Health
Assembly to build an international consensus on how best to handle
this issue.'' The World Health Assembly, the governing body of the
World Health Organization, is to meet in May to consider destroying
the remaining samples.
</P>
<P>
   The last known outbreak of the disease occurred in Somalia in
1977. Smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980, and in 1996 the
assembly recommended the destruction this June of the remaining
stocks, which are held under tight security at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and at the Russian State
Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology in Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   David Heymann, executive director of communicable diseases
division of WHO, said the agency would have no official comment
until the issue was presented to the assembly. But he added,
``We're happy to know at least where the United States stands.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of the assembly's 191 members appear to favor
destruction of the virus, sentiment for retention has been
building. At a meeting in January, only five of the nine committee
members favored immediate destruction. Two supported keeping the
stocks indefinitely; two favored keeping the stocks for five years
and then reviewing the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Zelicoff, a senior scientist at the Sandia National
Laboratory Center for National Security and Arms Control, who
strongly advocates retaining the stocks, attributed the waning of
support for destruction to what he called ``the growing threat of
bio-terrorism and the enormous advances in microbiology in the past
five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Zelicoff said that Thursday's announcement opened up
``tremendous joint research possibilities with the Russians, who
are way ahead of us in smallpox research.'' He spoke Wednesday
night to Lev Sandakhchiev, the director of the institute where
Russia's stocks are stored, and reported that the Russians were
``excited and encouraged'' by the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Sandakhchiev has pressed for retaining the stocks. He has also
proposed that his lab, a leading center of antiviral work and once
the heart of the Soviet germ-warfare program, be transformed into
an international research center to counter biological terrorism.
In an interview in January in Moscow, he said all he lacked was
money.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said they had not yet decided how much new
research the administration would finance, or what kinds. The White
House has secured $120 million in the current budget to fight
biological terrorism. And the administration is seeking $30 million
in the coming year's budget for new vaccines against such
potentially dangerous agents as smallpox and anthrax, which it
suspects may have found their way into the arsenals of several
rogue states.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Mahy, the director of viral and rickettslike diseases at
the National Center for Infectious Diseases in Atlanta, said the
president's decision would enable his scientists to do more work on
virus stocks. At present, Mahy said, only six scientists do
research on smallpox. Their annual budget, he added, is just under
$500,000, or about 1 percent of the $40 million spent annually on
research.
</P>
<P>
   But Donald Henderson, a former White House science adviser who
led the campaign to destroy the virus, said he doubted that much
new research would be done. ``I'll wager over the next five years
you'll see no work whatsoever,'' he said, ``except in the Russian
laboratory, where smallpox was weaponized. You can draw your own
conclusions about that.''

 When Age Bias Rears Its Head
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Ilana DeBare &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I've been working as a software quality assurance
engineer on a contract basis. I do a good job and have a good
reputation. However, I am middle-aged and wear hearing aids and
sometimes experience subtle discrimination because of this.
</P>
<P>
   I recently had one interview where the manager asked me
point-blank how old I was _ and then, seeing the look on my face,
said ``Oh, never mind.'' Then he looked at my hearing aids and
started to question whether I could work in an environment where I
had to communicate with other people. I handled his questions with
grace and dignity, but inside I was seething. Should I lodge a
formal complaint? And how should I handle such situations in the
future?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  It's illegal for employers to ask about age or
disabilities in a job interview. But face it: Many of us walk
through life carrying blatant or subtle prejudices. And sometimes
these prejudices surface in the hiring process.
</P>
<P>
   Your best strategy is to anticipate such issues and defuse them
in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a visible difference like a hearing aid, people are going
to notice it,'' said Kitty Wilson, director of ProMatch, a
Sunnyvale organization that helps unemployed professionals find
work. ``They may never ask about it, but you can be sure it's on
their mind. So you should be prepared with whatever you need to
defuse it.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, you could point to your hearing aids during the
interview and say, ``I imagine you may be wondering about these.''
Then explain how the aids allow you to function perfectly normally,
and note that you got high marks for communication and teamwork
from your former employers.
</P>
<P>
   On the age issue, many high-tech employers fear that older
workers will lack energy or cutting-edge skills. So make sure you
address these underlying stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Particularly in Silicon Valley, one of the big issues is
always energy,'' said Susan Gould, a Palo Alto career consultant
and author of the book ``Free Agents.'' ``It's important to
demonstrate energy and to acknowledge that you understand that's
what is demanded of you.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all looking to the future. Now for the past: What should
you do about those illegal, offensive questions in your recent
interview?
</P>
<P>
   Legally, you have the right to file an age or disability
discrimination complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission or a similar state agency. But that would consume huge
chunks of time and energy that might be better spent on your job
search. And in a small community like Silicon Valley, it could tar
you as a ``troublemaker'' in the eyes of other potential employers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I'd try a polite call or letter to someone at this
company _ perhaps the human resources director or a recruiter with
whom you had a positive connection.
</P>
<P>
   Mention the offensive remarks, and say you were concerned that
the hiring manager might not have been seeing a full picture of
your abilities. If you still want to work for this company, ask
them to keep you in mind for future positions.
</P>
<P>
   If the HR folks are any good, they'll realize that this hiring
manager is a big fat lawsuit waiting to happen. They may call him
on the carpet. They may initiate some companywide training on how
to conduct effective (and legal) job interviews.
</P>
<P>
   And they may even call you back when other jobs open up _
hopefully, jobs that would report to a different manager.
</P>
<P>
   401(k) Deposits
</P>
<P>
   Q: &LR;   &LR; My company has a 401(k) retirement plan. The company seems
to deposit my money at very random dates that don't correspond with
my paycheck deductions. Is this legal?
</P>
<P>
   A: Federal pension law requires employers to transfer 401(k)
money into workers' retirement account within 15 business days
after the end of the month that the money was withheld from their
salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had money withheld from your paycheck on March 15, they
would have until April 15 to put that money in trust,'' said
Constance Hiatt, a pension law expert with Hanson Bridgett Marcus
Vlahos &AMP; Rudy in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The law encourages employers to transfer 401(k) money more
quickly, if feasible. But many companies take several weeks to make
the transfer. Yours is probably one of them _ which would be why
your 401(k) deposit dates don't correspond with the dates of your
paycheck deductions.
</P>
<P>
   Single-Paycheck System
</P>
<P>
   Q: My employer owns two medical practices, one as a sole
proprietor and the other as a corporation. They're both in the same
office. Some employees treat patients for both practices but only
get paid by one of the practices. Does this break any labor laws?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no law against one company handling payroll for
another company, or issuing one paycheck that covers work done for
several firms.
</P>
<P>
   And the risks here are mostly on the employer's side _ not the
employees.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, an employer could run into legal trouble if
payroll taxes or workers' comp premiums aren't being correctly paid
by both companies, according to Jamie Johnson, an employment lawyer
with Brobeck Phleger &AMP; Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   For employees, the question is whether they're getting paid for
the total number of hours they put in. If so, this single-paycheck
system isn't hurting them.
</P>
<P>
   And, according to Johnson, it may actually be working to their
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an example: California state disability insurance must be
withheld from the first $31,767 of employees' paychecks. If workers
earn a single paycheck of $40,000, SDI is withheld from only the
first $31,767 of that money. But if a worker earns two separate
paychecks of $20,000 each, SDI would be withheld on $40,000 worth
of income _ more than is necessary. The state would refund the
extra payments at the end of the year, but in the meantime the
worker would receive smaller paychecks than he or she is entitled
to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It actually may be benefiting the employees if they're being
paid through one employer,'' Johnson said.

BANK EXECUTIVES CHARTING THE INTERNET STRATOSPHERE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Pa., Texas)  (rk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The quickest way for a chief executive to bolster his company's
stock price, it appears, is to announce a connection to the
Internet. In recent weeks, the banking industry has become
accustomed to such announcements _ and with the associated
stock-trading frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   The stocks of little-known regional financial companies like
Florida Banks Inc. of Jacksonville, First Sierra Financial Inc. of
Houston and the Patriot Bank of Pottstown, Pa., have jumped as much
as 300 percent in a single day after the companies publicized their
intentions to provide banking services over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who bought in before the announcements are mostly
sitting on paper profits. Among the buyers have been executives and
directors of Florida Banks, First Sierra and Patriot Bank who
purchased shares in the four to six weeks before each company
announced its Internet plans.
</P>
<P>
   The executives say that while they are enthusiastic about the
Internet plans, their recent stock purchases were not timed to take
advantage of an Internet premium. And few, if any, of the insiders
have cashed in so far by selling stock.
</P>
<P>
   In buying shares shortly before announcing their Internet
ventures, however, the executives raise questions that are relevant
to a large number of companies today. At a time when any corporate
press release with the the word ``Internet'' in it seems to move
stock prices, corporate America might need to take a broader view
of what is considered material information to investors.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission defines materiality as
anything a typical investor would need to know to make an informed
decision. Securities laws prohibit people who are in a position of
fiduciary responsibility and who have access to material, nonpublic
information from trading on that knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not at all clear whether the executives in these
instances ran afoul of those rules. In a legal sense, materiality
cannot be judged solely by whether an announcement causes a stock
price to move.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, it seems, have quite another view.
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm for Internet banking can be linked directly to
the stock performance of Net.Bank Inc. and the Telebanc Financial
Corp. These two companies, which say they do all their business in
cyberspace without the burden of brick-and-mortar branches, have
captured the fancy of investors in large part because they have
already demonstrated the ability to generate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Telebanc, for example, is expected this year to earn $2.6
million, or 15 cents a share, double its profit last year. Those
earnings would be even higher without a huge advertising budget by
Telebanc intended to attract customers, said Henry Blodget, who
tracks the company for Merrill Lynch and is recommending its
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Blodget says the attraction of Internet-based banks is that they
are not limited to serving customers in areas where the bank has
branches. Like other Internet service businesses, the banks aim to
pass the savings along in the form of higher interest rates on
deposits.
</P>
<P>
   The public has enthusiastically responded to the stocks, if not
the online bank accounts, pushing Telebanc shares up to $104.50
from $34 at the beginning of the year and less than $8 last
October. Similarly, Net.Bank shares closed Thursday at $182.4375,
up more than 500 percent since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising, then, that investors seem to have jumped
on any bank's decision to reach out over the Internet. On April 13,
when Florida Banks announced that it would begin offering Internet
banking services in the third quarter, its shares soared from about
$8, where they had been trading for most of the previous year, to
as high as $37.75, closing at $31.25. They have since declined,
closing Thursday at $11.8125, 47 percent higher than before the
Internet announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Just three weeks before the announcement, four insiders bought
9,000 shares of Florida Banks at about $7 each. The purchases,
totaling $63,500, increased each person's holdings by 1 percent to
20 percent. Though the purchases were relatively small in terms of
the company's $63 million market value, they accounted for as much
as half of the trading in the stock March 22-24.
</P>
<P>
   Should the insiders have been allowed to buy stock when an
announcement about their companies' Internet plans was looming?
</P>
<P>
   T. Edwin Stinson, the chief financial officer of Florida Banks,
who was one of four officials who bought shares, said the news was
important but not entirely new. Florida Banks' plan for Internet
banking was outlined in the company's prospectus for its initial
public offering last July, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were extremely surprised by the reaction'' of the stock,
Stinson said. The main reason the company issued the press release,
he said, was because it had signed a final agreement with a service
provider that would allow the formal startup of the Internet
service, and it wanted to get the news out before discussing it at
an investment conference that week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Florida Banks also draws a strong distinction between its
strategy and Telebanc's. ``We don't want to service commercial
customers that are not in the geographic markets that we are in,''
Stinson said. ``We didn't imply that we are trying to be an
Internet bank.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock purchases were made ``because the stock was trading
below book value,'' Stinson said, referring to the net value of the
company's assets and liabilities. Some of the company's directors
had been lamenting that the shares seemed appreciably cheap, and
``none of us benefited at all'' since none of the shares have been
sold, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks before First Sierra Financial, an
equipment-leasing company, announced that it would establish ``the
first Internet-based business-to-business bank,'' its chief
executive and a director bought 50,000 and 29,600 shares,
respectively, at about $9 each.
</P>
<P>
   The purchases each represented about a day's average volume in
the shares, which trade on Nasdaq. After the announcement on April
14, First Sierra's shares jumped as high as $30 and have since
settled at $14.50.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas J. Depping, the chief executive, points out that the
company's share price had started to move up after First Sierra
reported strong first-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been consistently buying shares since November,'' shortly
after their price fell to $9 from $33 amid a downdraft in
speciality finance shares, Depping said. A large block of stock
became available in mid-March, prompting his decision to buy more,
he said. The decision ``really had very little to do with the fact
that we were working on an Internet bank,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Joni S. Naugle, chief operating officer of Patriot Bank, said
she, too, was surprised at the market reaction to Patriot's April
12 introduction of ``Virtual Access Internet Banking'' service.
</P>
<P>
   The company's shares, which had traded around $9.50 for two
weeks, jumped as high as $18.75 on the news. Roughly a month before
the announcement, Ms. Naugle and another company executive bought
1,000 shares each, while a director bought 7,400. Each paid about
$10 a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purchases were not related at all'' to the anouncement,
Ms. Naugle said. ``Insiders have been buying because the stock is
on sale,'' trading roughly at book value, and they did not sell
shares when the price jumped. Since then, the price has returned to
its previous level, closing Thursday at $10.
</P>
<P>
   That is probably because, once investors read Patriot's press
release closely, they might have noticed that while Patriot was
adding Internet banking services _ including the ability to
transfer funds and pay bills online _ it was not becoming an
Internet bank.
</P>
<P>
   Similar services have been offered by big financial institutions
like Citibank for more than a decade. But to date, only a small
portion of Citibank's customers use the service regularly.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson for investors, of course, is that not all Internet
connections are equal.

 &HT;    The gang's not here
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLADEGA, Ala. _ Sunday's DieHard 500 will kick off the 30th
anniversary of Talladega Superspeedway. For the first time in three
decades, however, the Winston Cup race will contain one glaring
omission _ a driver from Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s and '80s, Alabama left an indelible mark on the
world of stock car racing. NASCAR legend Bobby Allison of Hueytown,
Ala., tied with Darrell Waltrip for third with 84 career Winston
Cup victories, founded the Alabama Gang nearly 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The founding members were Allison, his brother Donnie, Red
Farmer and Neil Bonnett. Bobby Allison was the only one to win a
Winston Cup championship, in 1983, edging Waltrip in the final race
of the season. Yet, Allison and the Alabama Gang combined to win
112 Winston Cup races.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than a half-decade after the deaths of Bonnett and
Davey Allison, Bobby's son, who was considered a second-generation
driver of the Alabama Gang, Sunday's race will be run without an
in-state driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a very good feeling,'' Donnie Allison said. ``We
prided ourselves on being pretty good race-car drivers from
Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Allison isn't the only one concerned about the absence.
John Andretti, who was born in Bethlehem, Pa., but who usually
lists Indianapolis as his hometown, tried to persuade Talladega
officials to let him represent Alabama in this weekend's race.
Andretti wanted to list Talladega as his hometown, and he would
have been an honorary citizen of the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Alabama Gang was a big deal when I was growing up,''
Andretti said. ``They've been a big part of NASCAR and what got the
sport here. It was more to say thanks for all that they did to help
me enjoy such a great sport. I believe in tradition. I wanted to do
it out of respect. I even talked to Bobby Allison, and he said it
sounded like a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   But Talladega officials turned down the request.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were certainly thrilled that he would consider doing
that,'' track spokesman Rick Humphrey said. ``But when the idea was
proposed to us two weeks ago, we had three guys still trying to get
rides for the race. We didn't want to do something that could be
perceived as a lack of loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Winston Cup season opened at Daytona in February, three
Alabama natives were still behind the wheel. Steve Grissom, a
native of Gadsden, started the season in the No. 91 Chevrolet of
owner Joe Falk. Gary Bradberry of Chelsea opened his second Cup
season in the No. 78 Ford of owner Jim Wilson, and Mike Harmon, a
short-track specialist from Birmingport, was supposed to drive for
longtime owner Junie Donlavey.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon's sponsor fell through during Daytona's Speed Weeks.
Donlavey elected to use a variety of more experienced drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Grissom, a former Busch Grand National champion, failed to
qualify for two of the first four races, including the Daytona 500.
He didn't finish higher than 36th in the others and was fired March
13 by Falk after failing to qualify at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Grissom, 36, was a relief driver for injured Jimmy Spencer at
Bristol two weeks ago and helped lead the No. 23 Ford to a
17th-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Grissom isn't happy about not driving at Talladega, where
Alabama drivers have won 10 of 59 Winston Cup races.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to go to any Winston Cup race without Alabama being
entered,'' Grissom said. ``Here, there's a little extra to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradberry, a former ARCA standout, failed to qualify at Daytona
for Triad Motorsports, a team being helped by Hut Stricklin, a
former Winston Cup driver from Calera, Ala., who is still looking
for a ride this year. Triad Motorsports hasn't entered a race since
Daytona and seems close to folding.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Allison, who co-owns the Busch car driven by Hueytown's
Jimmy Kitchens, doesn't know what the future holds for Alabama's
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope, somewhere down the road, somebody can come back and
put a smile on the faces of everybody in Alabama.''

 &HT;    Who's hot in NASCAR racing? Dale Jarrett
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dale Jarrett hasn't gone this long into a season
without a victory since 1995, when he didn't get his first win
until the 17th event at Pocono. Although he's winless in his first
eight starts this year, Jarrett has been one of Winston Cup's most
consistent drivers, finishing in the top 10 in all but two events.
Going into Sunday's DieHard 500 at Talladega Superspeedway, Jarrett
has six top 10s in a row, including an eighth-place finish last
week at Martinsville, after starting 31st. Jarrett trails Winston
Cup leader Jeff Burton by only 85 points.
</P>
<P>
   WHO'S NOT?
</P>
<P>
   After an eighth-place finish at North Carolina Speedway in
February, veteran Geoffrey Bodine said the outing wasn't a
``fluke.'' Sorry, Geoffrey, but it seems to have been. Bodine, who
turned 50 on April 18, is 32nd in points, 640 behind Burton. Only
Jerry Nadeau, Ricky Rudd, Ricky Craven and rookie Elliott Sadler
have fewer points among drivers with at least eight starts. Since
North Carolina, Bodine's average finish in six starts is 31st,
including 38th at Martinsville last week.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS UP
</P>
<P>
   To veteran Darrell Waltrip, who returned to the lead lap at
Martinsville for the first time since he finished 25th in the
road-course race at Watkins Glen, N.Y., last season. Waltrip
avoided all the wrecks that caused 10 cautions at Martinsville, but
he did fall a lap down to the leaders during the race. He was able
to regain that lap, however, after making an air-pressure
adjustment and finished 12th, his best effort in 25 races. Waltrip
climbed to 28th in points, only 43 out of the top 25, where he
needs to be to earn a non-chargeable provisional start. ``We've got
enough on us without people saying things about us, so if they'll
just give us a chance, we'll get it there,'' Waltrip said. ``We
can't do it overnight. We're racing a first-year team against guys
that have been doing this for several years now, and I'm proud.''
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   To NASCAR, which has done little about addressing the escalating
costs of racing. Only eight events into the Winston Cup season,
Bill Elliott and Ricky Rudd already are hinting that the days of
owning their own cars are numbered. It's no coincidence that the
four remaining independent teams _ Elliott, Rudd, Brett Bodine and
Dave Marcis _ are struggling. At 21st, Elliott's the highest-ranked
owner/driver in the points standings, while Bodine (25th), Rudd
(35th) and Marcis (43rd) are falling behind. None of those teams
has been a factor in a race this season.
</P>
<P>
   TIP SHEET
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup rookie Ken Bouchard will debut in the No. 84 Chevy
and attempt to qualify for Sunday's race. Rookie Stanton Barrett
failed to qualify in the Beau Petty-owned car at the Daytona 500. .
. . Burton, who finished last in the season's first IROC event at
Daytona, will start from the pole in the series' second race
Saturday (1 p.m., ESPN) at Talladega. Dale Earnhardt, who won the
Daytona race, will start last. According to IROC rules, the
finishing order from the previous race is reversed at the next
event. Earnhardt leads the IROC standings with 21 points, while
Bobby Labonte and Mark Martin are tied for second with 19. . . .
Ernie Irvan and Rich Bickle had the fastest laps at 125.815 mph _
an official track record _ at this week's Pontiac testing at
Richmond. Rookie Buckshot Jones was third at 121.45
</P>
<P>
   DID YOU KNOW?
</P>
<P>
   Robbie Loomis, crew chief for the No. 43 Pontiac of John
Andretti owned by Richard Petty, is one of five active crew chiefs
who have won a Winston Cup event with at least two different
drivers in the 1990s. Andretti won last week's Goody's Body Pain
500 at Martinsville, Va., and Loomis won one race each in 1996 and
1997 with driver Bobby Hamilton. Other crew chiefs (and their
current drivers) with wins in the 1990s with two or more drivers
are Paul Andrews (Jeremy Mayfield), Jimmy Makar (Bobby Labonte),
Larry McReynolds (Mike Skinner) and Robin Pemberton (Rusty
Wallace).

 &HT;    Eyler joins team
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Skip Eyler, a former crew chief for Mark Martin and
Chad Little, has rejoined Roush Racing as crew chief for Kevin
Lepage.
</P>
<P>
   Eyler, who started the season with Dick Trickle, will join the
struggling No. 16 Ford team after Sunday's DieHard 500 at Talladega
Superspeedway. Eyler, 35, was the crew chief for Little in 1997 and
Martin in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited to work with Kevin and the (No. 16) team,'' Eyler
said. ``They're heading in the right direction now, and I'm just
excited that Jack Roush would give me the opportunity to be a part
of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Eyler replaces James Ince, who resigned after a 28th-place
finish at Bristol on April 11. Lepage had only one top-10 finish _
seventh at Darlington _ in his second season with Roush.
</P>
<P>
   The team already stands to lose its sponsor, Primestar, after
this season. The satellite communications company was recently
acquired by a competitor. TV Guide has signed on as an associate
sponsor and could become the primary one if the team shows
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR levies fines
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Morgan, Lepage's interim crew chief last week at
Martinsville, was one of three crew chiefs fined by NASCAR for
rules violations.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Leslie, crew chief of Johnny Benson's No. 26 Ford, and
Jimmy Elledge, crew chief for Kenny Wallace's No. 55 Chevrolet,
also were fined $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   All three crew chiefs were penalized for illegal parts and/or
equipment and for drilling holes in frames, frame supports and
cross members with the intent of making the metal lighter. The
violations were found before last week's Goody's Body Pain 500.
</P>
<P>
   Casey is back
</P>
<P>
   It was only two months ago that Casey Atwood's No. 27 Chevrolet
got rear-ended by Mike McLaughlin, flipped several times on the
front stretch and then sat destroyed in the infield grass at
Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood, 18, says the wreck won't affect his driving when the
Busch Series hits Talladega Superspeedway on Saturday for its
second and last restrictor-plate race of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you race long enough, then you will be involved in that one
bad crash,'' said Atwood, ninth in the points standings. ``I feel
that I'm lucky in two ways. I was not hurt in the crash, and since
I was not hurt, it has not affected my will to go fast. I'm ready
for the fast speeds and close racing of Talladega.''
</P>
<P>
   Two's not a crowd
</P>
<P>
   Progressive Motorsports' decision to add driver Jeff Green and
the No. 32 Chevy to its stable is paying immediate dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Green and teammate Jason Keller, in his second season with
Progressive, each has one win in the first eight races. Keller is
third in points, only 47 behind leader Elton Sawyer, and Green is
sixth going into Saturday's Touchstone Energy 300.
</P>
<P>
   Green won at Nashville Speedway on April 3, and then Keller
followed with a victory at Bristol a week later.

 &HT;    Schrader wins Busch pole
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLADEGA, Ala. _ Ken Schrader won the pole for Saturday's
Touchstone Energy 300 Busch series race Thursday at Talladega
Superspeedway, and then said his 192.455 mph lap was nothing to get
excited about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car either runs or it don't,'' Schrader said. ``It's very
uneventful riding around here by yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought he'd accomplished something significant by
knocking Joe Nemechek (192.366) from the top starting position,
Schrader said, ``I was just the monkey that sat in the car while it
went around.''
</P>
<P>
   His point was that his engine builder and body people had more
to do with the efficiency of his No. 15 Chevrolet than an
experienced driver tooling around a superspeedway with no traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The driver here for qualifying is not that big a deal,'' said
Schrader, who also took the Busch pole in the season's first event
at Daytona. ``I feel that the guys in the chassis shop really did a
lot of work.'' Schrader's day went a lot smoother than Nemechek's,
who had to go to a backup engine after he blew his primary
qualifying engine.

`LOST AND FOUND' IS SNARLY, ABUSIVE IN ITS PURSUIT OF LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andy Warhol once said every person would be famous for 15
minutes. Well, ``Lost &AMP; Found'' is funny for 15 minutes and then
fades into mean-spirited cruelty and stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   It seems every new comedy wants to be the next ``There's
Something About Mary.'' As a result, the jokes aimed at innocent
people or animals just get more perverse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lost &AMP; Found'' is a nasty story about smug restaurateur Dylan
Ramsey (David Spade), who falls in love with his luscious French
musician neighbor, Lila Dubois (Sophie Marceau). Lila has come to
America to find work in a symphony and to fulfill her dream of
playing the cello at the Hollywood Bowl. Her ex-fiance, Rene
(Patrick Bruel), has followed her to Los Angeles in order to win
her back.
</P>
<P>
   He's everything Dylan isn't: rich, handsome, buff, clever - and
a philanderer. His very presence rankles Dylan, who is puny and
struggling to expand his short-menu coffee house into a
full-fledged bistro.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan ultimately launches the perfect plan: Lila has a dog named
Jack who continually runs away. He'll kidnap Jack and, when Lila is
frantic with worry, he'll return the terrier and look like a hero
to his dream girl.
</P>
<P>
   But Dylan underestimates Rene's perserverance and canniness.
Soon the two men are at each other's throat for Lila's affections.
And Jack just keeps getting lost in the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Movies have gone a long way down in presenting behavior that
might easily be called ``borderline'' as normal, appealing and
romantic. ``Lost &AMP; Found'' is snarly and abusive in its pursuit of
true love.
</P>
<P>
   Star David Spade co-wrote the script, and the cynical/abusive
attitude he generally displays so well is glaringly in evidence. He
acts so superior that he barely registers enough interest in
another person to make us believe he might fall in love.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, ``Lost &AMP; Found'' turns into a woefully contrived, unfunny
mess. Lila, who must be smarter than the film portrays, is stuck
between picking the loser behind door No. 1 or a worse loser behind
door No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   We're ultimately left wondering why Marceau, a French movie
star, ever picked such an unlikely project. By the end, when Lila
is reconciled with her beloved dog, it's clear he's the best of all
her sorry options.
</P>
<P>
   Lost &AMP; Found. Directed by Jeff Pollack. Written by J.B. Cook,
Marc Meeks, David Spade. Cast: David Spade, Sophie Marceau, Patrick
Bruel. Warner Bros. 98 minutes. Rated PG-13 for language, sexual
content.

AS ANNOUNCER, WRONA LOVES TO HORSE AROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Some racetrack announcers are identified
with particular pet phrases _ Phil Georgeff's ``Spinning out of the
turn,'' Dave Johnson's ``Down the stretch they come,'' Trevor
Denman's ``Moving like a winner.'' Not Michael Wrona.
</P>
<P>
   Wrona, the 33-year-old Australian who takes over as the voice of
Hollywood Park when the track opens a 66-day season tonight, is
known for his boundless creativity. He might be the sport's
greatest phrasemaker. But don't expect to hear the same phrases
over and over.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, during a brief stay at Hollywood Park, Wrona delivered
his most often quoted line. He was describing the final yards of
Itsallgreektome's Hollywood Turf Cup victory. Referring to the
Greek's unproven stamina, Wrona posed and answered the question,
``Can he stay the distance? He stays like a mother in law!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do throw in occasional quips or one-liners, but I don't want
to be known as a comedian. I throw those in sporadically,'' said
Wrona, who was calling the races at Golden Gate Fields near San
Francisco when Luke Kruytbosch left Hollywood Park for Churchill
Downs. ``I don't like to be predictable.''
</P>
<P>
   The one time Wrona admits scripting a call, he did it in the
interest of originality. It was 1996 and Cigar was at Arlington
Park in Chicago to attempt a record-tying 16th straight victory.
Wrona ordered tapes of Cigar's 15 wins and wrote down the
superlatives used by all of those announcers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of put a mental pen through all of those
(descriptions),'' he said. When Cigar and jockey Jerry Bailey made
their winning move on the turn, Wrona was ready with, ``Bailey sets
Cigar alight!'' As they neared the finish, it was, ``Cigar is an
unstoppable dynamo _ the crowd rises to a champion _ 16 in
succession and Cigar assumes the crown of immortality!''
</P>
<P>
   Wrona, who is from Brisbane and began his career at 17 at a
track in the Australian Outback, certainly has an agile mind. And
racing can use more of those.
</P>
<P>
   As Hollywood Park begins its 60th spring-summer season, the
track and the sport are changing.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of Hollywood Park by Churchill Downs, the subject
of negotiations announced three weeks ago, is expected to be
completed soon. Officials of both tracks have declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the year-old National Thoroughbred Racing Association
tries to solidify its role as a ``league office,'' amid indications
the industry is on the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   As always, Hollywood Park opens just as racing fans are
preoccupied with the Triple Crown, which begins with the Kentucky
Derby a week from Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Wrona, who tries to stay clear of racetrack politics, offered
his views on a number of topics:
</P>
<P>
   __ On the NTRA and racing's future: ``I'm a believer in the
NTRA. I definitely gravitate towards an optimistic view on racing.
It'll never return to its glory days in terms of on-course
attendance. But Australian racing is (strong) despite small
on-course crowds. Simulcasting has been in place in Australia for a
couple of decades. It's as easy for somebody to have a bet on the
races in Australia as for somebody to play the Lotto here. It's a
far more socially acceptable pastime in Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   __ On the Hollywood Park sale: ``I have to think it's a
guarantee of Hollywood Park being a live racing venue for many
years to come. So it certainly meets with my approval. I've had
Retama Park (in Texas) close on me in its inaugural season. I've
closed down Arlington. I've done a lot of moving around and I
desperately want to carve a niche for myself (at Hollywood Park).''
</P>
<P>
   __ On the growth of exotic wagers: ``They've become so popular
that I'm surprised more racecallers haven't allowed their styles to
evolve with that. They tend to concentrate too much on the likely
winner. I think of the poor punter, holding a trifecta ticket in
his sweaty palm, wondering if he stands a chance.'' So Wrona
mentions more horses late in a race than most callers.
</P>
<P>
   __ On Santa Anita announcer Trevor Denman, who is from South
Africa: ``To the American ear, we're pretty much the same. There
are inevitable comparisons. I take it as a compliment, knowing how
highly regarded Trevor is. I admire Trevor as a racecaller and I
also acknowledge he blazed the trail for other foreign announcers
in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   __ On American racing fans: ``I find it a shame racing fans in
this country don't relate more to the horses as horses rather than
as numbers on the program. Australia people cheer the horse's name.
Here I only hear numbers or jockeys' names. One day I was leaving
the racecourse in Chicago and the man next to me was talking rather
excitedly about a huge trifecta he had hit. I said, `Which horses
were they?' He said, `9, 4, 3.' He couldn't remember the names of
any of the horses.''
</P>
<P>
   __ On the Kentucky Derby: ``I have liked Prime Timber since just
before he won (the San Felipe Stakes). I see no reason to jump off
yet. I do believe Menifee is the best 3-year-old in the country,
but I have some concern about his seasoning.''
</P>
<P>
   __ On his favorite horse: ``Kingston Town (an Australian horse
of the '70s and '80s) was one of the reasons I became such a racing
freak. The other was (announcer) John Tapp. The combination of John
Tapp calling Kingston Town is still the most electrifying memory I
have of my early days of following racing. The biggest race in
Australia is the W.S. Cox Plate. Kingston Town is the only horse to
win it three times.''
</P>
<P>
   __ On his favorite jockey: ``I don't have a favorite, but the
person who made the greatest impression on me when I first came to
California is Laffit Pincay. His strength is really quite
incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   __ On Charlie Whittingham, the Hall of Fame trainer who died at
age 86 Tuesday in Pasadena: ``Even before I came to this country, I
was well aware of the name Charlie Whittingham. He truly was world
famous.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Three months after the largest economy in
Latin America seemed on the verge of an Asian-style meltdown,
provoking alarm in markets around the world, Brazil is bouncing
back.
</P>
<P>
   After an initial burst of price increases, always a main anxiety
in this country haunted by a history of four-digit inflation,
shoppers are demanding that prices hold steady and forcing stores
to comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer has it in hand to reject any price increase,''
proclaims a sign outside a McDonald's on Avenida Paulista, the main
street of the bustling financial district here in South America's
largest city.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, inflation forecasts are about half the 17 percent
originally expected.
</P>
<P>
   And just as it has done since Brazil's financial crisis erupted
in January, causing a 40 percent decline in the value of the local
currency, the real, the nation's central bank continues to buy and
sell currency in the foreign-exchange market to help stabilize the
real's value. But the real has proved to be so resilient that the
objective these days is not to prop it up but to prevent it from
strengthening too much.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark interest rates, which tend to be slightly higher
than the interbank lending rate, choked off borrowing after it was
raised to a punishing level of 50 percent to discourage investors
from taking their money out of the country. But now it has fallen
to less than 34 percent and seems likely to slide further. Many
investors view this decline as a sign of the economy's underlying
strength and are putting more money into Brazil. Foreign reserves,
a barometer of international confidence in the country, have
climbed nearly $8 billion in the last month to more than $42
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, another highly visible measure of Brazil's
resilience, has risen 50 percent from near-record lows hit in the
first turbulent days of the crisis, more than recovering its
losses.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign confidence in Brazil's future is also seen in the
Brazilian government's return to international capital markets,
something that would have been unthinkable just weeks ago. On
Thursday, with strong demand, Brazil sold $2 billion of five-year
notes.
</P>
<P>
   Privatizations of state-owned businesses have also resumed. Just
last week a local gas company was auctioned for $1 billion, nearly
double the anticipated price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sleepless nights of January,'' as Finance Minister Pedro
Malan put it in an interview last week in Brasilia, have given way
to a cautious resurgence of optimism about the country's economic
health and prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the crisis that began here last August with Russia's
default is by no means over. But the talk of a Brazilian
``contagion'' has all but vanished, and the risks have been reduced
to levels that Brazilian officials consider manageable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose we are entering the end of the hurricane,'' a
visibly relaxed Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's president, said
in an interview last week in Brasilia, just hours before leaving on
a trip to Europe to meet with heads of state and investors there.
``My feeling is that we are overcoming it.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign economists agree with that assessment. ``The situation
in Brazil, and in Latin America in general, is today much brighter
than it was two months ago,'' Michel Camdessus, managing director
of the International Monetary Fund, said Wednesday in Washington at
the fund's annual spring meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we see in the strengthening of the vitality of the
economy of Brazil,'' he added, now means that ``we expect to have
been wrong in forecasting the magnitude of recession in Brazil for
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Over all, Brazil seems to be well on its way to complying with
the terms of the $41.5 billion rescue package it signed with the
IMF in November but then was forced to revise after the collapse of
the real in mid-January. In fact, most of the goals set for the end
of 1999 _ such as an exchange rate of about 1.7 reais to the dollar
_ have already been achieved.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, Brazil's 165 million people have yet
to feel the effects of the turnaround. Indeed, many continue to
suffer from the austerity imposed by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The country remains in a recession, and in some ways the quick
recovery in the currency's value has actually hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Exporters who had expected a bonanza in sales as a result of the
January devaluation, which makes Brazilian goods cheaper abroad,
are now scaling back their predictions. The Cardoso administration
and the IMF had predicted an ambitious trade surplus of $10.6
billion for 1999 in their March accord, but most analysts now
expect the figure to come in around $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fall of the dollar has been more rapid than we expected,''
Cardoso said.
</P>
<P>
   But the real's speedy recovery has also distinguished Brazil
from the East Asian nations that were forced to devalue their
currencies in 1997, helping to set off the global financial crisis.
Cardoso called that distinction a sign of Brazil's basic economic
soundness. ``Inflation has been controlled, and the economy is in
good shape,'' he said. ``No company has gone bankrupt, and no
banks. And what debt has not been paid?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso's hand has been strengthened by the apparent willingness
of the average Brazilian to tolerate a recession so long as there
is no renewal of the hyperinflation that afflicted the country
before his election in 1994. Even labor unions that initially
wanted to reintroduce a policy of indexing wages to price increases
have dropped that demand, indicating they will settle for a modest
increase when a new official minimum wage is announced on May 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Brazilian was frightened when the real took that big
drop against the dollar because we thought it meant inflation was
coming back,'' said Daniel Glaucio de Oliveira, a 23-year-old
textile salesman. ``But now we see things are going back to normal,
and that if we can just be patient and everyone does his part,
we'll soon be getting out of this hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the decade, annual inflation here rose to more than
1,000 percent, with prices and wages pushing each other up because
of just such a policy of indexation. But the ``real plan'' that
went into effect in 1994 brought that spiral to an end by linking
the nation's currency to the dollar, ending the erosion of salaries
and enabling millions of Brazilians to buy goods on the installment
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that people have tasted what consumerism is, they don't
want to give that up,'' Paul Bydalek, president of Atlantic Rating,
an economic analysis firm in Rio de Janeiro. ``People want
stability.''
</P>
<P>
   So despite signs of an upturn, Brazilian consumers continue to
act conservatively, enforcing a discipline that has imposed itself
on other sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   At the clothing store here where she works, Andrea Frattini, a
28-year-old sales clerk, has noticed the difference in spending
habits and what she regards as a new mentality brought on by the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting about the same flow of customers, but people are
controlling themselves more and spending less,'' she said.
``Customers who used to spend 100 reais are now spending 50 and
telling us that they are trying to avoid a lot of extra expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Mailson da Nobrega, a former finance minister who is now an
economic consultant here, explained the phenomenon. ``The economic
retraction has made it impossible to pass on price increases from
the devaluation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But just as they argued in January that the situation here was
not as grave as jittery overseas investors were saying, government
leaders now caution against exaggerated optimism. ``The Brazilian
situation was never as bad as it was presented then, and it is not
as good as it is presented now,'' Cardoso said.
</P>
<P>
   Their most immediate worry is that the Brazilian Congress will
be tempted, as it had done in the recent past, not to push ahead
with what officials and economists view as long overdue economic
and political changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the top concern of everyone,'' said Arminio Fraga, a
former aide to financier George Soros. Fraga's installation as
president of the central bank in March was an early turning point
in Brazil's battle to regain investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We run the risk of the government mistaking this truce as a
victory,'' da Nobrega added. While he sees short-term stability, he
said, the government must address its historical tendency to spend
much more than it can afford.
</P>
<P>
   After January's currency collapse, both houses of the Brazilian
Congress approved measures they had rejected in December, giving
the government broader powers to tax pensions and financial
transactions to reduce a yawning budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   But to retain the credibility his government has regained in
recent weeks, Cardoso aims to persuade Congress to approve a new
fiscal responsibility law that will make it impossible for states
and municipalities to spend more money than they take in. Changes
aimed at simplifying Brazil's complex and inefficient tax structure
are also part of the IMF agreement, and must be approved for Brazil
to remain in good standing.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more essential in the long run is a package of
political-law changes that would restrict the frequency with which
legislators can change parties, limit electoral coalitions,
introduce voting by districts and require parties to obtain 5
percent of the vote to be represented in Congress.The Brazilian
Congress now has more than 20 parties, and the measure, if passed,
is expected to reduce that number to a more manageable five or six
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso said he was certain he would obtain passage of these
changes this year. At the moment, however, congressional attention
is focused on a pair of parliamentary inquiries: one into
inefficiency and corruption in the judicial system and the other
into accusations of insider dealings in the banking system in the
January currency collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The rebellion of Itamar Franco, a former president who is now
governor of the country's second-largest state, Minas Gerais,
against the central government also continues. Franco, who had
introduced the stabilization program when Cardoso was his finance
minister, was a catalyst for the January crisis by declaring a
90-day moratorium on debt payments by his state. He recently
extended the policy.
</P>
<P>
   But Cardoso dismissed the continued defiance as ``without
consequence,'' and most political and financial analysts here
agree.
</P>
<P>
   After talks with Cardoso, several other state governors who had
threatened to join Franco have decided against it, and Cardoso's
administration has stepped in to pay the international obligations
of Minas Gerais.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give him credit for defusing what was a really contentious
issue,'' said Frederick Henderson, president of General Motors of
Brazil. ``The government has demonstrated some fairly strong
leadership and brought some order to the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for Cardoso, a sociologist who has written a score of books,
the crisis has been nearly as costly in political as in economic
terms. After being elected by a wide margin in October to a second
term, the first Brazilian leader in modern times to be able to do
so, his job performance rating has dropped sharply, from 58 percent
in December, to a low of 35 percent, according to the most recent
poll.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cardoso seems more concerned, according to those who work
with him, about leaving a strong and healthy economy to his
successor than in succumbing to populist measures that might
immediately restore his popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows,'' said Malan, the finance minister, ``that he is
deciding the whole of his second term now in these next few
months.''

VAN GUNDY STILL STANDING, BUT ON UNSTABLE GROUND
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also BKN-CHARLOTTE-SILAS)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jeff Van Gundy was working a roll of ankle tape in
his hand. He had walked down a gray hallway inside Madison Square
Garden, flipping the roll against the wall and catching it as he
made his way to an interview room.
</P>
<P>
   As he sat down, he appeared weary and unshaven. Although on
practice days Van Gundy has always looked as if he has been pulled
from the bottom of a hamper, Thursday he was a little more
disheveled than usual, a little more loaded with the nervous energy
he was taking out on the roll of tape.
</P>
<P>
   He did not seem like a relieved man, nor the winner of a power
struggle with Ernie Grunfeld, the team's former president and
general manager. Van Gundy looked like a survivor who had escaped
the ax that had fallen on Grunfeld a day earlier. Grunfeld was
dismissed for assembling a team with a league-high $68-million
payroll that has been skimpy on results, and for allowing acrimony
and miscommunication to divide the organization.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Grunfeld was held accountable for a team in danger
of missing the playoffs for the first time in 12 years. But the
decision made by the Garden's president, Dave Checketts, did not
absolve Van Gundy from his role in guiding a team that has
struggled to a 21-21 record. With eight games left, beating
Charlotte Friday night at the Garden is the only way to start
making things right again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you work with someone for a long time, you're going
to have disagreements,'' Van Gundy said after Thursday's practice.
``The unfortunate part is, losing caused this. If we win some of
those close games, everybody has their job. What was reported as a
feud, that's way overstated. I even read where Dave said there was
a division. If there was, losing caused the division, not a
division causing losing. That's for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm responsible for the results on the floor. Whatever blame
people want to assign, I have to take a great portion of that
because of what happens on the floor. Ernie's thing, because of the
results, certainly that had an impact. I don't know everything
about why Dave decided to do it because I'm not in on those
decisions. But I think everything is triggered by losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy's survival will depend on the same quotient. That's
why he had to chuckle when he was asked if he would seek more power
over personnel moves in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, when you're coaching a 21-21 team and thinking
about getting more, I think that's a little hasty,'' Van Gundy said
with a smile. ``I've always been consulted. That doesn't mean
agreement is always there.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a coach, you want to have your voice heard, certainly, but
this isn't about that. This is about losing. There can be a million
conspiracy theories, but it comes down to losing more than people
think you should.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Knicks fail to land a playoff spot or fail to make it
past the first round, there is no guarantee Van Gundy will return
even though he has the unwavering support of Patrick Ewing, the
franchise's centerpiece player. That relationship likely insulated
Van Gundy from being the first one held accountable for this
season, but even Ewing understands that the bond will not save him
if the slide continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's job is on the line,'' Ewing said. ``When you don't
perform to the level you're expected to, everybody's job is on the
line. We definitely have to play for ourselves and for Jeff. The
bottom line is, we have to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Win with the talent Grunfeld collected. Marcus Camby was one of
those hand-picked by Grunfeld. Often, Camby was an innocent
middleman in the rift between Grunfeld and Van Gundy over how much
of a role he should play. Now, without Grunfeld as an advocate, he
is not sure if he fits into the Knicks' plans for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to be here, but anything can happen now,'' Camby
said. ``Ernie has left and everything's up in the air. We just have
to turn this thing around. If we don't turn it around, I think
there are going to be a lot of changes here.''
</P>
<P>
   Another new addition to the team, Latrell Sprewell, has failed
to blend in well and already has management thinking of trading him
in the off season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't personally feel like I've been put on notice,''
Sprewell said. ``But we're definitely aware there could be other
changes if we continue to play the way we have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no one saw Grunfeld's dismissal from his position as
anything but a warning, the change is unlikely to affect how the
team plays on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   As Van Gundy worked the tape Thursday, he acknowledged that.
``I've learned a couple of things by being here,'' he said, ``and
one is, when you lose, it's ugly. That's how it is. Yeah, if we'd
won more, there wouldn't be a need to blame.''

<P>
   The hottest team in the National Basketball Association is a
crew full of castoffs, a coach and players who have been
disregarded or underappreciated for a significant stretch of their
careers. But after winning their last nine games and turning a
once-pathetic season into a potential joy ride, Paul Silas and his
Charlotte Hornets can no longer be discounted.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets, who lost eight of their first nine games and at one
point were 4-11, are playing the best basketball in the Eastern
Conference and, incredibly, have their sights set on the playoffs.
With nine regular-season games remaining, Charlotte (21-20) holds
the eighth and final playoff spot, one-half game ahead of the
Knicks, who they visit Friday night at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   A short time ago, the Hornets seemed to be in disarray. Injuries
to Glen Rice (right elbow) and Anthony Mason (torn biceps) had
sidelined their two best players, and the disgruntled head coach,
Dave Cowens, was venting his frustrations with management to the
news media. Circumstances were as precarious with the owner, George
Shinn, who was being chastised for his financial frugality and
problems in his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even if the Hornets fail to qualify for post-season play,
the future is bright. First, Michael Jordan is reportedly near an
agreement with Shinn that would make him a half owner of the team,
a move that would bring untold benefits to the franchise. Second,
the Hornets seem to have the personnel and chemistry necessary to
become a member of the conference elite.
</P>
<P>
   It all begins with Silas, who took over on an interim basis
after Cowens resigned on March 8. Silas, who coached the hapless
San Diego Clippers from 1980 to 1983 and has been an assistant with
both the Knicks and the Nets, had to wait 16 years for another shot
at a lead job. The delay is somewhat regrettable, since the
longtime assistant has had the respect of players for years. But
under Silas the Hornets have a 17-9 record and the ``interim'' will
almost certainly be removed from his title, especially if the
players have any say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul Silas is the man,'' said Bobby Phills, the guard-forward
who has led the Hornets on their nine-game winning streak.
``There's no question that he should get the head-coaching job.
What more could you want in a coach? He's turned this organization
around. He believed in everybody from the get-go and that gave
everyone a lot of confidence. We respect him, and he respects us.
We couldn't ask for anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Phills is one of the many Hornets who, like Silas, has risen
above past slights. A second-round draft pick of the Milwaukee
Bucks, who cut him almost immediately, Phills spent a year in the
Continental Basketball Association, before sticking for six seasons
with Cleveland. Though he built a reputation as a defensive stopper
with the Cavaliers, they thought the seven-year, $33 million
contract Charlotte offered him before last season was too long and
steep.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a mediocre season, Phills has emerged as the team
leader. When Rice and J.R. Reid went to the Los Angeles Lakers for
the shooting guard Eddie Jones and center Elden Campbell, Phills
seemed to be the odd man out. But Silas moved the muscular,
6-foot-5-inch Phills to small forward and the player and team took
off.
</P>
<P>
   Phills, 10th in the league in 3-point accuracy (.415), has led
the Hornets to a 16-4 record since the switch. When he missed six
games from March 28 to April 5 with a pulled left groin, Charlotte
went 1-5. Since his return, the Hornets have not lost, as he has
averaged 19.4 points, 5.6 rebounds and 4.9 assists. He hit
game-winning jump shots against Washington and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby has been the glue to our team since early on,'' Silas
said. ``And now his confidence is unbelievable. He's taking people
off the dribble. He's developed a medium range game. I'm even
seeing him take a couple of dribbles, step back behind the 3-point
line and let it fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Phills, David Wesley, Charlotte's starting point guard,
spent a season in the CBA, and when the Hornets signed him last
season he was viewed as a big stat man on weak teams. Now, he is
proving his critics wrong by helping Charlotte win. As are Campbell
and Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, Shaquille O'Neal's talented backup for the past few
seasons, has been widely regarded as an inconsistent malcontent who
would never deliver on a nightly basis. But in 22 starts for the
Hornets, the 7-footer has been exceptional. He grabbed a
career-high 19 rebounds in his first game in Charlotte and has been
a solid ever since, averaging 15.6 points and 9.5 rebounds, and
shooting 50 percent from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   While Jones, a two-time All-Star, always has been recognized for
his skills, his solid contributions to the Lakers were taken for
granted because of Kobe Bryant's acrobatics. Since the trade,
however, the Lakers have floundered without Jones' defense. (Jones
is doubtful for Friday night's game with a lacerated finger on his
right hand.)

 &HT;    Stress, sex and video screens fill up-and-down tale of air
controllers `Pushing Tin'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like ``Donnie Brasco,'' his last movie, director Mike Newell's
``Pushing Tin'' takes us into a high-stress, high-testosterone
demimonde. It's a parallel universe where men make life-and-death
decisions and their women are accustomed to being treated as steam
valves.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Brasco'' was a fact-based slice of mafia life, ``Pushing
Tin'' (also fact-based) introduces us to another kind of family:
the sweaty fraternity of air traffic controllers who keep 747s from
colliding every few seconds in the super-crowded sky above
Manhattan. (``Pushing tin'' is controllers' slang for routing
planes.)
</P>
<P>
   Nick Falzone (John Cusack) is known for keeping his cool,
choreographing the trajectory of all the blips (representing
planes) on his radar screen. It's like a very hip video game, but
``game over'' could translate into hundreds of charred bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're gonna have to build planes faster to keep me
interested,'' he boasts, but the stress shows up in the way Nick
drives maniacally through traffic and can turn anything into a bet.
</P>
<P>
   His sense of competition kicks into high gear with the arrival
of his polar opposite, the brooding, Harley-riding Russell (Billy
Bob Thornton).
</P>
<P>
   Russell's rep as a Zen master of the control room is made even
more impressive by the appearance of Angelina Jolie as his luscious
19-year-old wife, Mary. (``What number are you?'' a woman asks her
at a backyard barbecue full of second and third wives of
controllers.)
</P>
<P>
   For its first third, ``Pushing Tin'' is a fascinating look at
this obsessive-compulsive world. But it turns into something much
more routine, a comedy of discomfort as Nick and Russell's
competitive streak starts to have repercussions in their bedrooms.
The movie becomes a domestic melodrama that could be unfolding in
just about any high-stress situation; it sheds the specifics that
make the film so interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the actors keep the movie in the air even while its
script is steadily losing altitude. Cusack is ideally cast as a
grown-up kid, a family man who can't quite keep the lid down on
temptation. He makes the film's middle section a memorable study in
muted agony as he tries to keep his jealousies and mistakes from
destroying his life. He's beautifully matched by Cate Blanchett as
his wife (a ``first''). Sporting a dead-on Long Island accent, she
exudes an almost palpable sense of decency as a woman trying to
expand her suburban horizons by taking night classes.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, in denim and leather, brings to the movie a sense of
sinuous menace mixed with a sly sense of humor. Jolie (who was the
best thing in the ensemble comedy ``Playing by Heart'') proves that
her physical assets are secondary to her emotional clarity as an
actor. She's one to watch.
</P>
<P>
   The ensemble includes Jake Weber as Cusack's pal and Vicki Lewis
as the sole female controller, who works her stress out by lifting
weights when she's not pushing tin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pushing Tin''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B -
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, Cate Blanchett and
Angelina Jolie. Rated R for language and a scene of sexuality. 2
hours, 3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A juiced-up ensemble comedy-drama that loses its
bearings halfway through its flight.

 &HT;    Tour showcases garden retreats perfect for living large and
relaxing outdoors
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lavender wisteria shrouds the deck with wafts of
morning sweetness, inviting homeowners to bring their mug of coffee
outdoors for a look.
</P>
<P>
   By afternoon, canopies of green envelope the porch, attracting
neighbors for a glass of iced tea, while by evening, the cool,
crisp air lures families into the garden for a quiet moonlit meal,
away from the chatter of television.
</P>
<P>
   What is it about this time of year that makes us want to stay
outdoors, long after completing a day of gardening? For the nine
homeowners who will open their private retreats for this year's
Gardens for Connoisseurs Tour on May 8 and 9, it's having a spot
that blends the indoors with the out.
</P>
<P>
   From quaint cottage gardens to sprawling, gracious estates,
``Each garden is truly an extension of the owner's home and a place
where they live,'' said Mary Stanley, co-chairwoman of the event.
</P>
<P>
   The tour, a Mother's Day tradition benefiting the Atlanta
Botanical Garden, illustrates what's become a major design trend _
gardens that are more than just pretty places to pass through. They
are sanctuaries where people relax, share meals and give parties.
Homeowners are using their yards for everything from quiet
breakfast nooks to jazz-filled banquet halls for entertaining
hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   So you say you have a nice garden but need some ideas for making
it more livable. If so, the tour, with stops from Buckhead to
Decatur, offers an array of options.
</P>
<P>
   Creating intimate spaces
</P>
<P>
   When husband and wife are both landscape architects, it's a safe
bet their garden is quite a showplace. Hugh and Mary Palmer Dargan
have designed gardens from grand estates in Atlanta to tiny
courtyards in Charleston, S.C., where they lived until moving to
Atlanta four years ago. Like most new homeowners, they faced their
share of unromantic gardening projects, such as correcting
drainage, when they bought their Peachtree Heights bungalow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We raised the entire lawn 4 feet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The front yard is anchored on one side by a pair of towering
oaks, while a weeping corkscrew willow creates a focal point on the
other. A wide curving border encircles the lawn, forming what the
couple calls their ``perennial sweep,'' filled with color and
texture at all seasons. In spring, a Japanese maple, snowball
viburnum and a variety of old roses take center stage.
</P>
<P>
   Look for practical details in this garden. The beds are lined
with an 8-inch mow strip of Pennsylvania bluestone that keeps the
lawn safe from gardeners, visitors and dogs. The driveway blends
with the garden because the Dargans planted its median with
low-growing ground covers, including sedums and strawberry
begonias. A 20-inch-tall wooden rail fence, backed with wire,
allows their two small dogs to enjoy the yard without needing a
solid enclosure.
</P>
<P>
   In the small L-shaped back yard, the Dargans extended their
cottagelike home into two classically designed garden ``rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   The first is accessible through a pair of French doors that open
onto an arbored stone patio, set with table and chairs for enjoying
summer dinners. The patio extends to a quatrefoil-shaped lawn that
gives guests plenty of standing room for taking in the views. At
the rear is a gurgling fountain that draws them to a backdrop of
handpainted ceramic tiles in deep blues, accented by large blue
pots and ornamental spheres.
</P>
<P>
   To the side, a stone path leads to an herb garden with a raised
bed at its center and rosemary topiaries at each corner. This
garden extends to a red ``dining tent'' covering a wooden platform,
open only on the garden side to create privacy. It's ideal for
small dinner parties.
</P>
<P>
   The tent is one of several props the Dargans inherited from
gardens they designed for decorator houses and managed to work into
their tiny retreat. ``We call them `homeless show garden pieces,'
'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rooms that divide and conquer
</P>
<P>
   Space wasn't a problem two years ago when Doug Candler and Craig
Dick developed their Atlanta garden; the challenge was creating
intimate areas within their expansive back and side yard. Landscape
architect William Smith designed a multiterraced garden large
enough for entertaining hundreds but with cozy spots for suppers
with a few friends.
</P>
<P>
   Six birches were removed to build a long swimming pool extending
from a two-story sun deck to a rear woodland garden, where a
bridge-covered stream flows into a goldfish pond. The pool's
terrace, covered in warm crab orchard stone with umbrella-covered
tables, descends to a second terrace, where a serpentine pathway
winds through a wide border filled with pansies and snapdragons.
Finally, granite steps lead to a lush fescue lawn, where the view
of the Midtown skyline reminds visitors they're not touring a
country estate after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was all just a shady lawn before we put in the pool,''
Candler said. ``Now, the extra light allows us to grow a lot
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Using fences, hedges and borders to divide a lawn into ``rooms''
allows homeowners to conquer large open spaces, making them more
functional.
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest gardens on tour lies behind a Georgian manor
house in Atlanta. Three years ago, Hugh Dargan Associates updated
the hilltop site, designed by landscape architect Ed Daugherty,
with new plantings and, most recently, a kitchen garden.
</P>
<P>
   One unique feature is that the estate is maintained exclusively
with organic methods and materials. ``It's a new mind-set to do
something of this scope organically,'' Dargan said.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeping curved borders snake their way through the garden,
creating intrigue as to what's around the bend. White tulips,
Gourmet Popcorn roses and Japanese anemone form the ``white
garden,'' while pastel tulips and blue pansies line a
crescent-shaped garden at the edge of the circular lawn.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen garden's stone walls already were in place. ``We
just jazzed it up a little,'' Dargan said, with a variety of herbs,
including parsley, rosemary and chives. A weather vane creates a
focal point in a center raised bed, while four other beds are
anchored by Regency-inspired tomato baskets, which support Golden
Orb cherries in summer.
</P>
<P>
   From the garden, a path extends to a tulip-blanketed border that
once served as a refuse area. Earlier this month, it dazzled crowds
gathered for a garden party marking a family wedding. ``We now call
it the wedding garden,'' Dargan said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's making a garden space livable.

 &HT;    Smoltz picking up pace of '98
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It's early, but not too early to notice what John Smoltz
is doing.
</P>
<P>
   He is 2-0 with a 2.37 ERA this season. Before that, he waltzed
through spring training _ 2-1, 2.63 ERA. Backing that up was last
year's 17-3 record, and the distinction as baseball's winningest
pitcher over the past three years with 58 victories.
</P>
<P>
   He will go into his next start _ Sunday against the Marlins in
Miami _ having won 20 of 23 decisions dating to Sept. 19, 1997.
That run coincides with Smoltz's last elbow surgery, in the
offseason in 1997, and the ensuing decision to change his pitching
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I step on the mound now, I feel like there's many ways I
can get you out, where I never felt that way before,'' Smoltz said.
``Sure, it was great when I was so-called `dominating.' People saw
the stuff and said, `Why can't he do that 27 times a year?' But
inside, you know every fifth day you're not going to feel great.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched too many guys like (Greg) Maddux and (Tom)
Glavine go out there and pitch when they haven't been their best
and win. That's what puts you in a different class. I feel like I'm
approaching that now.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing has been different for Smoltz this year, particularly
so after Monday night's 11-3 win over the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had fun,'' said Smoltz, who unlike last year is pitching
relatively pain-free. ``I haven't had too many games where you say
you had fun and accomplished things at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not too early for catcher Javy Lopez to give Smoltz the
first Cy Young mention of the season. ``That year he won the Cy
Young (in 1996), he did the same thing,'' Lopez said. ``The way
he's throwing, there's no doubt he could be the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Smoltz, he just wants to keep on keeping on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to get to the feeling, `Hey, Smoltz is pitching _
game over,''' he said.

ANALYSIS: NO TIME TO WASTE IN PREPARING FOR GROUND TROOPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert middle initial into byline. No other changes.)  (mb) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ After four weeks of inconclusive airstrikes
against Yugoslavia, talk at NATO has increasingly turned to ground
troops to evict Yugoslav forces from Kosovo and secure autonomy for
the province and its Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   But unless NATO starts assembling ground forces soon, the
alliance may not have a credible threat of a land attack before the
onset of winter.
</P>
<P>
   For now, as the allies gather in Washington for a grand summit
marking NATO's 50th anniversary, there is broad agreement within
the organization that the bombing needs to continue, in the
lingering hope that it will eventually force Slobodan Milosevic,
the Yugoslav president, to meet NATO's demands.
</P>
<P>
   But what if several more months of bombing raids do not compel
Milosevic to withdraw his forces from Kosovo? While NATO's military
commanders have insisted that airstrikes are delivering a punishing
blow to the Yugoslav military, they have never guaranteed that air
power alone can deliver a victory.
</P>
<P>
   And what if the air campaign produces more cases of ``collateral
damage,'' the military's antiseptic term for the accidental bombing
of civilians, and public support for protracted bombing begins to
wane?
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, allied nations are talking of ground troops as a
way to bring the war to a speedy close. Nobody at NATO is eager to
rush into a land war. But if the alliance decides to turn to ground
troops, military experts say, they should go in before the weather
begins to worsen in September and October. Clear skies and
unhampered air power would be needed to protect the troops. It
would also be best if Western troops did not have to endure a
winter war.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to quiet the criticism in Congress that NATO lacks a
backup plan for using ground troops, the Clinton administration
said Wednesday night that it favors ``updating'' the options allied
military planners developed last summer for sending ground troops
into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. would certainly support as a prudent measure any
updating of the assessments of the use of ground troops in a
permissive and non-permissive environment,'' a White House official
said.
</P>
<P>
   But informal planning is at best a small step and one that is
unlikely to seriously worry Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   To make the vague talk of combat troops credible, the alliance
needs to start actual military preparations immediately, like
deciding which NATO members would contribute troops, mobilizing and
training reserves, persuading nations in the region to make their
ports and airfields available and then shipping troops and weapons
to the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Although it might seem strange that it would take the allied
nations so long to prepare for conflict in the heart of Europe,
NATO has its own procedures and diplomatic rituals in addition to
the practical and logistical considerations necessary to engage
tens of thousands of troops.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States prepared for the 1991 Persian Gulf war,
it began to send huge numbers of troops and weapons to the region
even before the generals worked out a military plan to evict Iraqi
soldiers from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   While in principle there is no reason that allied nations could
not start preparing troops now for a possible mission in Kosovo,
NATO does not generally work that way.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many military preparations are unlikely to be made
before allied nations formally instruct Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO
commander, to prepare a plan for a ground combat operation, and
then debate the strategy and approve it.
</P>
<P>
   Such a process has not even begun.
</P>
<P>
   The blessing of the entire 19-member alliance would be needed to
approve and implement a plan to engage ground troops in the
conflict. So far, NATO has agreed to send a peacekeeping force of
28,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the political decision to send combat troops into Kosovo
is made, getting forces to the Balkans could take six to eight
weeks, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The logistics would not be easy. Albania, which is already being
used a base for Apache helicopters and multiple-rocket launch
systems, is willing to serve as the staging ground for an attack.
But its port, airfields and roads are poor and its terrain
mountainous.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia, a non-NATO nation where 12,000 troops for a potential
British peacekeeping force have already been deployed, would be
more suitable. But that would mean aligning political support from
its government and from Greece, whose port at Salonnika would be
crucial. Neither is yet willing to support a land attack.
</P>
<P>
   Though the difficulties are formidable, there are powerful
reasons why NATO might at least want to have an option to use
combat troops.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it would strengthen the allies' negotiating
leverage in trying to work out a settlement. Milosevic's strategy
is to try to ride out NATO's air war in the hope that the alliance
will crack. But that would be harder to do if the allies made clear
that they had other military options.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the option to use ground forces might also be useful
if airstrikes eventually lead Yugoslav forces to retreat.
Paramilitary units operating in Kosovo, some NATO officials worry,
could launch a final spasm of violent reprisals against any ethnic
Albanians remaining in the province as Yugoslav forces withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   Without substantial forces on the ground in the Balkans, NATO
could only look on from the sidelines, much as America and its
allies watched from the southern side of the Euphrates as Iraqi
forces attacked Iraqi Shiites immediately after the war in the
Persian Gulf in 1991. The alliance could ultimately win a military
victory through air power but end up suffering a moral defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, using ground troops to impose a peace settlement
against disorganized Yugoslav resistance might be the only way to
bring a decisive end, a point top British officials have
underscored in recent days.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Clark has contended that the bombing may succeed in
breaking the will of the Milosevic regime, diplomats say he has
also told allies that there are no guarantees. As an Army officer,
could hardly be expected to believe differently.
</P>
<P>
   Another Army man was also careful to emphasize the limits of air
power in forcing foreign dictators to bend to the will of the
United States. Just before the Persian Gulf war, Gen. Colin Powell,
who at the time was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told
Congress that he was not about to rely exclusively on air power to
evict Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   And Powell offered that view even though he had far more air
power at his disposal than Clark and the foe he was fighting was
vulnerably situated in the open desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can hunker down, one can dig in, one can disperse to try
to ride out such a single-dimension attack,'' he said. ``Such
strategies are designed to hope to win; they are not designed to
win.''

 &HT;    Hornby's slacker portraits lure filmdom's eye
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you wear Doc Martens and listen to Radiohead, you've probably
heard of Nick Hornby. If you haven't, you soon will. The balding,
41-year-old former British high school teacher has struck a chord
with young men _ and women _ with his best-selling books about
soccer, slackers and singles on the prowl.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his novels, ``High Fidelity'' (Riverhead, $12.95
paperback) and ``About a Boy'' (Riverhead, $12.95 paperback) are
headed for the big screen. John Cusack is set to star in ``High
Fidelity,'' the story of the misadventures of a group of record
store employees, and Robert DeNiro has paid $3 million for rights
to ``About a Boy,'' Hornby's tale of a superficial, 36-year-old
bachelor who joins a single parents' club just to meet women.
</P>
<P>
   All this is pretty heady stuff for a middle-aged family man
whose literary inspiration is Anne Tyler. ``I think she's cool,''
Hornby says from his home in London. ``She probably wouldn't think
so. When I read `The Accidental Tourist,' I found it completely
liberating. I realized you could write literary books that were
simple and had jokes in them. I always thought jokes weren't
permitted.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornby was a regular contributor to Esquire and other magazines
before he wrote ``Fever Pitch'' (1992), a memoir about his
obsession with soccer. He followed that in 1995 with ``High
Fidelity,'' which chronicles a breakup from a guy's point of view.
``The kind of fiction I enjoyed reading was domestic, but it tended
to be mostly women who wrote those books,'' Hornby says. ``There
didn't seem to be any reason why a guy couldn't write that kind of
stuff. And, of course, there was the music as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the music. Rob, the protagonist in ``High Fidelity,'' is a
record shop owner who makes music lists such as the Best Five Pop
Songs About Death and has nothing but disdain for fans of Billy
Joel. Will, the self-absorbed bachelor in ``About a Boy,'' cannot
stand it when a woman he meets sings Judy Collins' ``Both Sides
Now'' with her eyes closed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his references to musical trends, Hornby admits that he
really doesn't feel hip. His first music idol was Rod Stewart,
because he also likes soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't keep up with what's in and out,'' Hornby says of
music. ``I do buy a lot of new stuff. I'm listening to Lauryn Hill
now and I like that a lot. But if anyone tells you something's
cool, it probably isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornby will sign books at 7 p.m. Friday at Chapter 11 at Ansley
Mall, 1544 Piedmont Ave., 404-872-7986.
</P>
<P>
   SASSY OPERA: It's hard to imagine Will Tweedy, Grandpa Rucker,
Miss Love and other characters from ``Cold Sassy Tree'' strutting
across the stage and singing opera, but that's what's planned next
year at the Houston Grand Opera company. Composer Carlisle Floyd,
whose ``Susannah'' is being performed this week at the Metropolitan
Opera House, has been commissioned to write an opera based on late
Atlanta author Olive Ann Burns' classic Southern tale. The story of
Grandpa Rucker's scandalous marriage to Miss Love barely two weeks
after his wife's death is told by 14-year-old Will Tweedy. It's set
around the turn of the century in a Georgia town called Cold Sassy,
which was renamed Commerce by its citizens to make it sound more
modern. ``The first thing that attracted me to `Cold Sassy Tree'
were the characters,'' Floyd says from his home in Houston. ``They
were wonderfully rich and colorful, and the story is a curious mix
of the comic and the serious. It was the hardest libretto I've ever
had to do.'' The opera is scheduled to debut in Houston next
spring, with Australian film director Bruce Beresford (``Driving
Miss Daisy'') helming the production.

 &HT;    Enigmatic anti-hero characterizes best, worst of capitalist
spirit
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 25.
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the appropriately named novel ``Bone by Bone,'' Peter
Matthiessen completes his brilliant trilogy about a back-country
South Carolina farmer who became a legend on the lawless frontier
of turn-of-the-century Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about the real Edgar J. Watson. He was born in
Edgefield, S.C., in 1855, fled under suspicious circumstances and
ended up in Florida after adventures out West.
</P>
<P>
   When Matthiessen introduced his character in his 1990 novel,
``Killing Mr. Watson,'' the man is murdered by 20 neighbors in the
first chapter. The rest of the book is an account of the victim's
life as seen through the eyes of the witnesses. It becomes clear
that Watson is a man of contradictions. Was he a decent family man
and prosperous sugar cane grower? Or a coldblooded killer who shot
the outlaw queen Belle Starr in the back and murdered dozens?
</P>
<P>
   We never hear from Watson in the first book _ or the second. In
``Lost Man's River'' (1997), Lucius Watson tries unsuccessfully to
solve the mystery of a father whose moods were as unpredictable as
the South Florida weather.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in ``Bone by Bone,'' Matthiessen, a founder of the
Paris Review and winner of the National Book Award for ``The Snow
Leopard,'' lets his enigmatic character tell his story, from his
traumatic childhood as the son of an abusive, alcoholic father to
his brutal demise in the Everglades. Yes, he did kill Starr, but
there were extenuating circumstances; and yes, he did kill a number
of people, but most were justified.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on local lore and legend, Matthiessen reconstructs
Watson as meticulously as a scientist reassembles the skeleton of a
prehistoric creature. The result is a portrait of a troubled man
determined to let nothing derail his dreams of an empire. Always in
a black frock coat that concealed his ever-present pistol, Watson
was an intimidating figure who loomed over his neighbors,
physically and mentally.
</P>
<P>
   In a sprawling tale reminiscent of Larry McMurtry's ``Lonesome
Dove,'' Matthiessen eloquently re-creates the last years of the
American frontier, when railroad barons such as Henry Flagler used
any legal means to carve out his empire and men like Edgar Watson
ignored the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``No decent American is going to believe that a man who pays his
bills is a common criminal, no matter what,'' Watson says.
</P>
<P>
   But believe they did. Everywhere Watson went, his reputation as
a killer preceded him and thwarted his dreams of becoming a
respectable businessman. Bankers and developers refused to lend him
money, scoffed at his ideas, then adopted them as their own.
Frustrated by lack of acceptance, Watson resorted to violence to
achieve his ends.
</P>
<P>
   How myths are created _ particularly in frontier regions _ is
one of the novel's central themes. But the author, an ardent
environmentalist, is more interested in a tragedy greater than the
self-destruction of an anti-hero. This is an account of the
plundering of paradise by Watson, Flagler and others.
</P>
<P>
   Matthiessen describes in poetic but horrifying detail how
multitudes of egrets and flamingos were killed for their valuable
plumage, how Indian mounds were ravaged by relic hunters and how
thousands of alligators were slain for their hides.
</P>
<P>
   On one alligator hunt, Watson tells of ``stripping the soft
flats off the bellies and rolling them up by firelight. It was
exciting for a while, because stacking flats at such a rate was
like heaping up cash money. . . . It soon turned to a stink of
putrefaction, as if the Everglades had rolled over and died.''
</P>
<P>
   That odor clings to Watson as he sinks deeper into debt and
desperation. By novel's end, Matthiessen has fit the bones together
to show a man who represents the capitalist spirit of America at
its best _ and worst. In Watson's view, his actions were no
different from those of an imperialistic nation that seized Spanish
colonies in the Caribbean and Pacific. In the words of one of
Matthiessen's fictional historians, ``Say what you like about
Mister Watson, he looked and acted like our idea of a hero.''
</P>

   Bone by Bone. By Peter Matthiessen. Random House. $23. 288

   The verdict: A searing portrait of frontier Florida and an
empire builder created and destroyed by his own myth.

</P>
<P>
   R (profanity, sexuality, violence)
</P>
<P>
   This farce about a mobster (Robert De Niro) who takes his issues
to a psychiatrist (Billy Crystal) never becomes the laugh-riot it
could be. It's an offer you could refuse, but the stars (plus Lisa
Kudrow as Crystal's fiancee) make it worthwhile. (SM)1 hour, 46
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby Geniuses''

<P>
   PG
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Turner and Peter MacNicol play rival researchers _ she
the breathy villainess, he the bland do-bee _ rushing to crack the
talk code emanating from five brilliant babes. Sly _ the toddler
leader _ has got a secret twin and you've got yourself 94 minutes
chock full of stupid pint-sized tricks from the brain of Bob Clark.
At first, ``Geniuses'' is dumb, and then it just gets dumber. (Bob
Longino) 94 minutes.D+

   ``Cookie's Fortune''

</P>
<P>
   PG-13 (sexually suggestive scenes)
</P>
<P>
   This Southern gothic shaggy-dog story goes down as sweet and
smooth as a double shot of Jack Black. Glenn Close, Julianne Moore,
Charles S. Dutton, Liv Tyler, Chris O'Donnell, Ned Beatty and Lyle
Lovett are among those involved in the unexpected death of a gently
demented Mississippi widow (Patricia Neal.) A mellow Robert Altman
directs this magnolia-scented whimsy with affection and compassion.

   Ryan Phillippe and Selma Blair.
</P>
<P>
   R (profanity, sexual situations, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Last decade's ``Dangerous Liaisons'' gets a makeover with Sarah
Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe as a couple of desultorily rich
teens manipulating the romantic lives of everyone around them,
purely for their own amusement and without a whit of concern about
who may be hurt in the process. It's practically guaranteed to be a
runaway hit with the teen audience. (Jill Vejnoska) 1 hour, 37

   Like the Nickelodeon series on which it's based, this movie's
appeal is centered in the carefully nurtured normalcy of its title
character, Doug Funnie, a nice kid coping with some typical preteen
passions. The gently anarchic, pro-environment plot is simply a
framework to dispense the quiet main-street morals and vivid
comic-book colors that make the wholesome Doug a superstar with
children. (Tom Sabulis) At metro theaters. 1 hour, 17 minutes. B-

   PG-13 (profanity, partial nudity, sex-related situations)
</P>
<P>
   Matthew McConaughey plays the subject of a 24-hour-a-day
documentary in Ron Howard's new comedy. Yeah, it's too much like
``Truman Show'' for its own good, but the slick packaging and
strong cast (including Jenna Elfman, Ellen DeGeneres and Martin
Landau) help it stand on its own. (SM) 2 hours, 3 minutes. B+

   In the near future, virtual-reality games have become so
mind-blowing that a counter-movement called realists has arisen.
One of their targets is celebrity game inventor Jennifer Jason
Leigh, a.k.a. the ``game-pod goddess.'' Fans of director David
Cronenberg know to expect mutilations, mutations and pitch-black
humor. But whether he's cracking you up or grossing you out, his is
a unique cinematic vision. (ERG) At Phipps. 1 hour, 37 minutes. A -

<P>
   Although most high school students might compare their teachers
to aliens, at Herrington High they really are. In this flimsy and
unoriginal but fun monster-thriller, the students band together to
fight their fate when they discover that their teachers, including
the football coach (Robert Patrick) and the principal (Bebe
Neuwirth), want to turn them into computer-generated creepies. (Cox

   PG-13 (profanity, sexuality, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Opposites attract as strait-laced Ben Affleck heads to his
wedding with free-spirit Sandra Bullock. Like ``My Best Friend's

<P>
   R (drug content, sexuality, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   violence)
</P>
<P>
   A three-part comedy-drama unfolding on a single Christmas Eve,
it has the energetic, late-night delirium of a Chinese fire drill.
You could think of it as a movie built on ``X's.'' We get Xmas,
exhilaration, exhaustion, excitement and the drug called ecstasy,
better known as X. It's a bright, shining package. And though it
turns out to be pretty empty, you can't help admiring how cleverly
it's wrapped. (SM)1 hour, 42 minutes. B

   R (sexuality, language and violence)
</P>
<P>
   A good film noir _ even a tongue-in-cheek one, like this wants
to be _ has to ground its hairpin plot with real people. No such
luck here. The folks in this movie, about a sex-death-and-insurance
scam, are as slickly remote as the lavish set decor and
cinematography. (SM)

   R (brief nudity and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Kate Winslet stars in this independent film about a single mom
who takes her daughters to 1972 Marrakesh in search of
enlightenment. Set in the waning days of flower power, the movie
portrays a generation whose idealism had its poisonous side.
Winslet gives a wondrously brave performance as a loving but
blinkered mother whose feckless romanticism makes her a benign
menace to her kids. (ERG) 1 hour, 39 minutes.B+

   Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence bicker for more than 60 years

</P>
<P>
   Smokin'. This whip-smart lark is an English caper comedy
glistening with confidence and a wicked sense of humor. Four
likable, conniving East End lads have a week to settle the debt
they owe a hood named Hatchet Harry. Rookie writer/director Guy
Ritchie piles on the characters, plot twists and violence, but one
thing is clear: everyone involved had a fine time making this
movie. You'll have fun watching it. (ERG) At Phipps. 1 hour, 45

<P>
   There's something about David Spade's new movie ``Lost &AMP; Found''
that's way too much like last summer's over-the-top _ and better _
comedy ``There's Something About Mary.'' Like gross humor that'll
kick your gag reflex into gear. Still, Spade's flick has its
moments _ especially his knockout impersonation of Neil Diamond.

   A knockout sci-fi flick. Writer-directors Andy and Larry
Wachowski bring their sharp storytelling and visual showmanship to
an adventure starring Keanu Reeves that should please both comic

   This film wonders if settling down is the same as selling out.
In 1977, a 30-ish ad man (Christian Bale) with a wife (Emily
Watson), baby, mortgage, etc. is taunted by his free-wheeling '60s
youth when an old buddy shows up. The movie starts well but seems
to lose energy. Still, the theme is worthy and the performances
good, especially Watson, who does hard-headed sensible as well as
high-strung flaky. (ERG) 1 hour, 39 minutes. B-

   It's the look that matters. Not the plot involving drugs,
murder, good guys turned bad and a car wash. This ``Mod Squad'' _
with Claire Danes, Omar Epps and an occasionally inspired Giovanni

   The titular Joe (Peter Mullan) is another of director Ken
Loach's sturdy working-class blokes. A recovering Glasgow
alcoholic, Joe begins a tentative and touching affair with a
good-hearted social worker. But his fragile peace with his past
becomes achingly clear, threatening their relationship. A slight

relives high school hell and pretty much bumbles her way to
popularity. Everything about her career is implausible. The movie's

   Deeply satisfying tale of West Virginia teenager Homer (Jake
Gyllenhaal) and three friends who, in the 1950s, began to build and
shoot off model rockets. Their goal: to win a science fair, which
could help them escape a future of working in the coal mine of
their small town. Based on Homer Hickam's autobiography ``Rocket
Boys,'' it makes the process of learning seem as exciting as a
special FX-driven action flick. (SM) 1 hour, 48 minutes. A-

<P>
   PG-13
</P>
<P>
   It's a mess from the start. Henry (Steve Martin) and Nancy Clark
(Goldie Hawn) are a long-married couple from Ohio trying to
redefine their lives now that the children are grown. They land in
New York and high jinks ensue. The only time the film hints at the
madcap success it could be is when John Cleese appears as the
secretly cross-dressing hotel manager.

   A juiced-up ensemble comedy-drama that loses its bearings

   This energetic, amusing but scattered film introduces us to
Stevo's (Matthew Lillard) world of beer blasts, punk bands, acid
trips and run-ins with the rednecks of Salt Lake City, circa 1985.

   What starts out as a terrible teen version of ``The Taming of
the Shrew'' unexpectedly starts to percolate with wit and charm,
thanks largely to its Kate-and-Petruchio stand-ins, Kat (Julia
Stiles) and Patrick (Heath Ledger). The script can't go too far
wrong with Shakespeare's plot. (It's worked for 400 years.)
References to the original verge on precious. But the film also has

   The IMAX film has awesome special effects but, as a fictional

into his lab, Ally accidentally cracks it and is thrust back in

 &HT;    A Quick Look at New Movies
 &HT;    By Steve Murray, Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``SLC Punk!''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Lillard. Rated R for pervasive language, drug
use, violent anti-social behavior and some sexuality. 1 hour, 37
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: An uneven celebration of young punk life, circa
1985.
</P>
<P>
   Lillard's manic spark ignites `SLC Punk!'
</P>
<P>
   It takes a long time for college kid Stevo (Matthew Lillard) to
figure out that his blue hair and torn T-shirts aren't true
rebellion, they're just fashion. It takes all of ``SLC Punk!,'' in
fact, and you may want to yell at the screen to make Stevo get to
the point.
</P>
<P>
   That's a problem for the movie, which seems to start, stop and
start over several times. This energetic, amusing but scattered
first feature from writer-director James Merendino introduces us to
Stevo's world of beer blasts, punk bands, acid trips and run-ins
with the rednecks of Salt Lake City, circa 1985. A picaresque romp,
it wants to be a ``Trainspotting''-Lite, an Americanized howl
against conformity that winds up, well, conforming.
</P>
<P>
   The cast includes Annabeth Gish as Stevo's sometime girlfriend
and drug partner, and Jason Segel in a funny bit as a geeky-looking
teen pal whose placid exterior belies the brawler within. There's
also a quick-tempered foreigner (Til Schweiger), who seems to have
strolled in from a Quentin Tarantino flick; his gratuitously gross
speech about a plane crash makes you realize that Merendino is
throwing everything he can think of onscreen to see if it sticks.
At the very least, the movie gives Lillard (who gave ``Scream'' and
``She's All That'' memorable manic spark) a chance to show his
range. He's an off-kilter but believable romantic lead, a puckish
punk who's a little too smart to buy his own anarchist dogma.

   DRAMA
</P>
<P>
   ``Hideous Kinky''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kate Winslet. Directed by Gillies MacKinnon. Rated R
for brief nudity and sexual situations. 1 hour, 39 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A winning portrayal by Winslet.
</P>
<P>
   Hideous title, wonderful Winslet
</P>
<P>
   After ``Titanic,'' Kate Winslet could have gone to Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she made ``Hideous Kinky,'' a hideously titled movie
with some crafty things to say about family, free spirits and
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The year is 1972. Flower power is on the wane, but there are
still a few tie-dyed die-hards clinging to their ideal of a
blissed-out world where everyone grooves on peace, love and very
nice, nonaddictive drugs.
</P>
<P>
   One such dreamy gypsy is Julia (Winslet), who's hopped the
Marrakesh Express. Literally. This young Londoner has moved herself
and her two daughters _ sober, responsible Bea (Bella Riza) and
giggly, wide-eyed Lucy (Carrie Mullan) _ to Morocco, where she
hopes to hook up with a spiritually enlightened Sufi master.
</P>
<P>
   With her open embrace of Third World exotica, her hippie-bred
willingness to trust utter strangers, her belief that she can drift
amiably through a foreign and often dangerous culture with only a
friendly smile for protection, she's the ultimate innocent abroad.
Worse, she's in charge _ if that's the word _ of two vulnerable
children.
</P>
<P>
   Winslet gives a wondrously brave performance as this poignantly
oblivious seeker. In a sense, she's a benign menace: a loving but
blinkered mommie weirdest whose naivete could prove deadly.
Winslet's sleight-of-hand is that she shows us this character,
warts and all, yet manages to make her sympathetic, too.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   DRAMA
</P>
<P>
   ``Metroland''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Christian Bale and Emily Watson. Directed by Philip
Saville. Not rated, but contains sex, nudity, bad language and drug
use. 1 hour, 39 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A sometimes compelling film that wonders whether
settling down means selling out.
</P>
<P>
   The man in the gray flannel suit may be a sartorial emblem of
conformity from the 1950s, but the gray-flannel-suit mentality _
and flaming youth's ambivalence toward it _ can fit the fashion of
any decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Metroland'' looks back on the freewheeling 1960s from the
perspective of the late '70s. It's 1977, and Chris (Christian Bale)
is a 30-ish ad man with a wife (Emily Watson), a baby, a mortgage,
a car payment, etc. He lives in Metroland, a comfy London suburb
described by one character as ``25 minutes from Baker Street and a
pension at the end of the line.'' Still, Chris is content in his
middle-class cul-de-sac until his past _ in the form of best buddy
Toni (Lee Ross) _ resurfaces to taunt him about the compromises
he's made.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the movie takes place in flashbacks: London in 1963,
which has a cheeky ``Hard Day's Night'' ambience, and 1968 Paris,
which is a little foolish. (``I have sex in the afternoon,'' brags
Chris. ``If that's not French, I don't know what is.'')
</P>
<P>
   The effect is a bit like a nostalgia movie wrapped inside a
nostalgia movie. The performances are strong, with Watson proving
that she can do hardheaded sensible as well as she does high-strung
flaky. But the film ends up curiously flat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   COMEDY
</P>
<P>
   ``Lost &AMP; Found''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring David Spade and Sophie Marceau. Rated PG-13 for
profanity and gross-out scenes. 1 hour,
</P>
<P>
   50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Barely finds its way.
</P>
<P>
   Gross-out fans have a new `Mary'
</P>
<P>
   There's something about David Spade's new movie, ``Lost &AMP;
Found,'' that's way too much like last summer's over-the-top comedy
``There's Something About Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a feisty little dog that gets tossed around like a hot
potato. Like gross humor that'll kick your gag reflex into gear.
Like a klutzy-guy-meets-girl, guy-desperately-wants-girl plot.
</P>
<P>
   It's sort of all the same thing. Only not as good. Still, ``Lost
&AMP; Found'' has its moments.
</P>
<P>
   Spade plays Dylan, a struggling Los Angeles restaurateur who's
smitten when he spots his new neighbor, a drop-dead gorgeous
aspiring cellist named Lila (Sophie Marceau). Most of the time
she's thinking about her cutesy terrier, Jack, so Dylan does what
only a few desperately lonely guys might do: he abducts the dog.
</P>
<P>
   Many typical high jinks ensue. To the movie's credit, a couple
of gags work really well _ such as Spade's porky employee who moves
in with him a la ``Single White Female'' and Spade's knockout
impersonation of Neil Diamond. Too much of the time, though, Spade
maintains his detached image _ the aloof, too-cool dude who seems
to want to be anywhere except where he is.
</P>
<P>
   It works when he's in supporting roles, as on ``Just Shoot Me.''
But as the main star, his put-on indifference comes close to
clogging the whole works.

BUDDY ROGERS, STAR OF `WINGS' AND BAND LEADER, DIES AT 94  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan.)   By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles ``Buddy'' Rogers, the handsome leading man and band
leader who starred in ``Wings'' (1927), the first film to win an
Academy Award, and who later married Mary Pickford, ``America's
Sweetheart,'' died on Wednesday at his home in Rancho Mirage,
Calif. Rogers was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Six feet tall, slim and with brown eyes and black hair, Rogers
was a versatile musician whose almost inadvertent screen career
catapulted him to immediate stardom. But in some 35 films between
1926 and 1957 _ vehicles with titles like ``Fascinating Youth,''
``So's Your Old Man,'' ``My Best Girl,'' ``Abie's Irish Rose,''
``Varsity,'' ``Dance Band,'' ``Golden Hoofs'' and ``Mexican
Spitfire's Baby'' _ he never impressed critics as more than a
pleasant performer.
</P>
<P>
   He portrayed pilots, college boys, salesmen and lawyers, but he
was best remembered for his starring role as an all-American boy
who goes off to fight the Hun as a member of the Army Air Corps in
William A. Wellman's classic World War I spectacle, ``Wings,''
whose cast included Richard Arlen, Clara Bow and Gary Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   For his portrayal of the young airman, Paramount Pictures paid
Rogers $65 a week and gave him three suits of clothes as a gift.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing him in ``Wings,'' Miss Pickford, one of film's
foremost and wealthiest stars, asked that he be cast in her next
film, `My Best Girl.'' In that whimsical 1927 film, she played
Maggie Johnson, a pretty salesgirl in a 5-and-10-cent store who
captures the heart of Joe Merrill ( Rogers), not knowing he is the
son of the owner of the chain of stores.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Pickford, who had been married since 1920 to her second
husband, Douglas Fairbanks, captured Rogers' heart off-screen as
well, although they were not married until 1937, after Miss
Pickford and Fairbanks were divorced.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, Rogers, who was 11 years younger than Miss
Pickford, was fond of recalling that Clark Gable ``once told Mary,
when we got married, that it wouldn't last six months.'' Their
marriage ended only with Miss Pickford's death at 86 in 1979. In
1981, Rogers married Beverly Ricono, a Los Angeles real estate
agent, who survives him.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers did not confine his show-business career to films. In
1932 he and his orchestra made their Broadway debut in Ziegfeld's
``Hot-Cha!,'' and throughout the years, he appeared in vaudeville
and on radio and television and on the stage, and he produced films
as well. During World War II, he served as a flight training
instructor in the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   With Miss Pickford, he presided over their legendary home,
Pickfair, an estate named for Miss Pickford and Fairbanks and
perched on a mountaintop overlooking Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   For years, through Miss Pickford's marriages to Fairbanks and
Rogers, the home was the unofficial capital of Hollywood's
brightest stars, a place where Chaplin and Keaton and Crawford were
guests, where Pavlova danced and Maurice Chevalier sang.
</P>
<P>
   By 1971, three or four years after an eye operation, Miss
Pickford rarely left her bedroom at Pickfair, but Rogers remained a
genial host of parties for guests who stood among Frederic
Remington paintings, drank Champagne from crystal and gold Louis
XIV goblets and ate enormous shrimp served by two butlers and two
maids.
</P>
<P>
   On one such occasion, speaking of his wife and making a little
joke about their first film, Rogers said, ``She was `My Best Girl'
in 1927, and she's still my best girl.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Miss Pickford were active in philanthropy, contributing
to charities like the Motion Picture and Television Fund, of which
Miss Pickford was a founder; at the Academy Award ceremony in 1986,
Rogers was given the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for his
``philanthropic commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Rogers was born on Aug. 13, 1904, on a farm in Olathe,
Kan., one of three children of Maude and Bert H. Rogers, who was a
newspaperman and later a probate judge in Johnson County.
</P>
<P>
   Charles was known as Buddy from childhood. It was a nickname
that he did not favor, but when he became a producer he used it to
avoid confusion with another producer with the same name.
</P>
<P>
   After grammar and high school in Olathe, Rogers went off to the
University of Kansas, where, eager to augment what was already a
generous allowance, he formed an orchestra that earned him money by
performing at dances.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1925, his father, on a visit to Kansas City,
heard from a friend in the film business about a nationwide search
for candidates for Paramount's training school. A photo of Charles
was sent off, and, much to his surprise, he found himself in the
school and six months later playing the male lead in ``Fascinating
Youth'' (1926).
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, when ``Wings'' was shown at a Library of Congress
screening of the first 10 films to be selected by the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as best pictures of the year,
Rogers was in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   When the film ended, he wiped away a tear and said, ``I'm only
crying because I saw so many of my pals I'll never see again.''

 &HT;    Scaling these `Walls' well worth it
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 25.
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Draper's vivid first novel, ``Hadrian's Walls,'' is set
in a kind of East Texas ``Chinatown.'' Things happen in
Shepardsville that play outside the accepted social physics of most
other places. What's normal there would seem baroque or
impenetrable or hideous to an outsider. It's a prison town. Prisons
are the reason it is. Four units ring it, another is planted
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the common bond,'' describes narrator Hadrian
Coleman _ Shepardsville native, convict (murder), escapee (its
first) and now pardoned prodigal son. ``They employed people, gave
people something to talk about _ gave them a whole new language, so
that ordinary gray-haired matrons could be heard chuckling at the
D.A.R. luncheon,
</P>
<P>
   `Buddy says he wishes he could put an end to that turf battle
over at the Carter Unit between the Aryan Brotherhood and the
Mandingo Warriors. . . .' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of it all is Sonny Hope, outrageously flawed scion
of a prison director and now the deal-making, cream-skimming
director himself. Hadrian's lifelong friend, Sonny is a bawdy,
bodacious fox, ``an absolutely brilliant spectacle you couldn't
resist any more than you could understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is through the perverse relationship between Hadrian and
Sonny that Draper creates a creeping story of bare-knuckle politics
and rock-bottom soul-searching. A magazine writer for Texas Monthly
and now GQ, Draper writes with an evocative,
I'll-get-there-when-I-get-there style that turns every nod and wink
into its own means-something drama. He molds a world of walls
that's lushly claustrophobic, one that offers the exhilaration _
sometimes exquisite, sometimes ghastly _ of scaling them.
</P>
<P>
   There are problems. Draper's offhand poetics sometimes pile up
and drag _ a mind can be too fertile _ and some intensely rendered
scenes don't quite deliver the punch their setup promises. Some
stretches are more interesting than riveting, daring your mind to
wander. And by the end, Draper succumbs to the journalist's itch to
wrap things up, rather than the novelist's art of leaving just
enough unsaid.
</P>
<P>
   But there's real talent at work here _ talent that evokes the
native, gully-wash political savvy of Billy Lee Brammer's ``The Gay
Place'' and the roiling gothic Southernness of Larry Brown's
``Fathers and Sons.'' Draper's sure sense of place is often its own
reward (``The air abruptly became soupy, the road a ragged carpet
of pine needles. The odor stung like buckshot. To live out here,
you had better love the smell of pine, and I most certainly did''),
but the lasting prize for any reader of ``Hadrian's Walls'' is the
discovery of a new novelist who promises better yet.

 &HT;    Behind-scenes Clinton tale feels like old news
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 25.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The house wine would do, and the second glass would be
pushed aside at the end. No one thought to order a bottle for the
table. The tone of the evening was less celebratory than warily
businesslike. Michael Isikoff, the author of ``Uncovering Clinton:
A Reporter's Story'' (Crown, $25), had finished a book signing at
Chapter 11 bookstore in the Peachtree Battle Shopping Center and
now, sitting on the patio of Anis, a Provencal restaurant in
Buckhead, he fidgeted in his seat continually while conversations
around him went on without reference to Bill Clinton or Monica
Lewinsky or, for that matter, Michael Isikoff.

   A first-time author on tour is anxious about reviews, anxious
about sales, anxious about making a good impression. In Isikoff's
case, there was anxiety of another kind as well. At Chapter 11,
while he was signing copies of ``Uncovering Clinton,'' a display
case promoting George Stephanopoulos' ``All Too Human'' flanked
him, and one could hardly notice Isikoff's book without noticing
the other.
</P>
<P>
   Isikoff is the Newsweek reporter credited with uncovering (while
working for The Washington Post) the undisclosed extent of
President Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky, and with it the
supporting cast of a soap opera whose run has just about played
out. He was to have appeared on Geraldo Rivera's CNBC program that
evening, but gamely settled for dinner with a reporter and his
media escort when the show's producers decided Kosovo was of
greater urgency.
</P>
<P>
   Tenacious reporting
</P>
<P>
   Before the entrees were served, Isikoff groused about reviews
his book has received and about ``the scandal,'' as he put it, of
book reviewing in general. The only reviewers who had actually read
``Uncovering Clinton,'' apparently, were the ones who had good
things to say about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's right there,'' Isikoff said, and indeed it is. As
a piece of reporting, no one can begrudge Isikoff his tenacity and
keen intuition. You admire it all the more if you were once a
political reporter yourself, and know the gray area that separates
public appearance from private reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great story, a compelling story,'' Isikoff was saying.
But is it really? Its principals by now are tediously familiar. Is
it worth knowing still more? This is the curse of current events,
of course. They are evanescent as snowflakes, if never quite so
pure. A sense of proportion takes hold and the Linda Tripps and
Lucianne Goldbergs seem even smaller than we imagined.
</P>
<P>
   This is not entirely Isikoff's fault. He only wanted to tell a
story that first was pirated out from under him by Matt Drudge, the
guttersnipe of the Internet, and then made community property.
Robbed of a story that was, in a sense, ``his,'' he sets out to
tell it in the first person, with his own tribulations and shouting
matches with editors never far from center stage.
</P>
<P>
   An ear for journalese
</P>
<P>
   Isikoff would not be the first journalist to find that the
narrative techniques of news reporting are not those of nonfiction.
A news story, written in a tight prose that allows no breathing
room, assumes the shape of an inverted pyramid, with the most
important information presented first. A book requires a different
contour altogether. It doesn't look like a pyramid and it shouldn't
look like a sack of potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Neither should its language sound like a gab on the phone.
Journalism lives by immediacy, serious nonfiction by a more
measured consideration of what one wants to say. Isikoff, needing
to finish his book before Monica was yesterday's news, is given to
the journalese of reporters whose nose is better than their ear.
Thus, Kenneth Starr is described as a ``conservative legal titan,''
lawyer Joseph Cammarata is ``slated'' to appear on TV talk shows, a
Post colleague is ``a pro'' (but, one paragraph earlier, a Clinton
adviser an ``eminence grise.'' An article in a legal magazine
exploring Paula Jones' complaint is not long but ``massive.'' And
when one editor wants to talk to another, he ``marches'' into his
office. Isikoff himself, within the space of half a page, is
``stunned to learn,'' ``amazed to discover'' and ``chagrined to
discover.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the misspellings. The first I noticed was
that of my old Raleigh colleague James Bennet, who covered the
White House for The New York Times. It would be easy for the
unawares to give him the extra ``t'' of most Bennetts, including
Clinton lawyer Robert Bennett. But ``Arkansas senator William
Fullbright'' is inexcusable, and former Clinton press secretary Dee
Dee Myers will wonder who this ``DeDe Meyers'' might be.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, these are small and inconsequential; cumulatively
they add up to sloppiness in a book whose story does not become
more compelling with each day. The morning after Isikoff finished
his dinner in Buckhead and flew to Chicago for another signing, the
headlines read, ``Scores of refugees killed in disputed convoy
attack.'' Monica didn't matter much to Bill, and now the world's
losing interest, too.

 &HT;    Ellison's second act
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for sunday, April 25.
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Writing a first novel that becomes a classic can be a blessing
and a curse. There's instant acclaim, of course, but with the fame
comes intense pressure to write an even better second book.
Margaret Mitchell and Harper Lee didn't even attempt to top their
spectacular debuts. Ralph Ellison died trying.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-two years after his landmark book ``Invisible Man'' was
published, Ellison was still reshaping and rewriting his sprawling
manuscript when he died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had become a saga,'' says Ellison's literary executor, John
F. Callahan, ``and within the saga were several possible novels.''
</P>
<P>
   One of these novels will be published this summer as
``Juneteenth'' (Random House, $25), thanks to Callahan's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The professor of humanities at Lewis and Clark College in
Portland, Ore., was asked by Ellison's widow to edit the manuscript
into one volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``That seemed to betray his work,'' Callahan says. ``Then, in
the midst of this manuscript, I found there was an
all-but-finished, compelling novel. One of the sections of the
novel he called `Juneteenth,' and it hit me one day, that's the
title.''
</P>
<P>
   Set in the 1950s, ``Juneteenth'' is the story of Hickman, a
black jazz musician. Hickman eventually becomes a minister and
raises a young boy, Bliss, as a black child even though he looks
white. Bliss runs away from home, becomes a race-baiting senator in
New England, and is shot on the floor of the Senate by a young
black man. As he lies dying, he summons Hickman to his bedside to
talk of their shared pasts and buried secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The title refers to June 19, 1865, the day that Union troops
landed at Galveston, Texas, and brought news of Lincoln's
Emancipation Proclamation. Ever since, that date has been a day of
celebration among blacks in Texas and Ellison's home state of
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who has been moved by `Invisible Man' is going to want
to read this book,'' says Callahan, who spent 2 1/2 years preparing
the manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   ``Invisible Man'' chronicles the life of a black man who grows
up in the segregated South, moves to New York and struggles to
escape racial stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Invisible Man,'' ``Juneteenth'' is about what it means to
be an American, Callahan says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the novel says you can't deny your kinships, and
kinship is not fundamentally a matter of bloodlines. It has to do
with the relationships in your life. The book is about liberation
and rebirth. You never fully gain liberation. You have to achieve
it over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   I N E L L I S O N ' S W O R D S
</P>
<P>
   The following are among copious notes Ralph Ellison made during
the four decades that ``Juneteenth'' was a work in progress:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``A great religious leader is a `master of ecstasy.' He evokes
emotions that move beyond the rational onto the mystical. A jazz
musician does something of the same. By his manipulation of sound
and rhythm, he releases movements and emotions which allow for the
transcendence of everyday reality. As an ex-jazzman, Hickman
combines the two roles, and this is the source of his leadership.
He possesses a power which is not directly active _ or at least not
recognized for what it is in the south's political arena, but it is
there.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Negroes appear to whites to enjoy themselves more because
they have so little of that which is material. They appear to
whites to suffer grief, heartbreak, and sadness more because they
have, apparently, so much to be unhappy about. And the source of
that unhappiness is seen as based in their color and social status
rather than in their humanity.''

 &HT;    Quiet revelations of a well-lived life
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Horton Foote was a Boy Scout, in the 1920s, he was assigned
to take a 14-mile hike into the country outside Wharton, his
coastal Texas town. He stopped for a bottle of soda water at a
country store. When the elderly clerk learned his name, he told the
thunderstruck boy that he had been born a slave on the plantation
of Foote's great-great-grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Another time _ one rainy afternoon, snooping in his parents'
drawers _ the young playwright and screenwriter in the making came
upon a weird white robe. His mortified mother had to explain its
use: Ku Klux Klan. It had been worn to the one Klan meeting ever
attended by the author's father, a storekeeper so beloved for his
fairness and generosity to black customers that they used to line
up to shake the hand of ``Mr. Footes.''
</P>
<P>
   Such are the intimate astonishments that jump out _ like fish
breaking the surface of a still, dark lake _ from Foote's quiet,
warm, dignified narrative in ``Farewell: A Memoir of a Texas
Childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer has always had a gift for children's voices (remember
the delightful Scout and her pals in his screenplay of ``To Kill a
Mockingbird''?), so it's no surprise that, at 82, Foote recaptures
so well how the world looks through a child's eyes. Even more
striking is his ability to recall a child's premonition of troubles
unseen. Though ``Farewell'' is dominated by scenes of simple joys _
climbing the pecan trees, sitting on the front porch on a summer
night listening to interwoven strains of music from a white church,
a black juke joint, a Mexican cantina _ there is always a
mysterious curtain of adult whispers, or silence. Just behind it,
we glimpse dim images of broken marriages, ruined crops,
ne'er-do-well uncles (Foote had his share of them) and other
scandals.
</P>
<P>
   The book starts mighty slowly. One can become impatient, for
instance, with how exhaustively Foote catalogs his many relations
in Wharton, as in those endless ``begat'' sections of the Bible.
But it's a necessary discipline to imprint the town clearly on the
reader's imagination, to establish the deceptively drowsy rhythms
of bygone Southern life that will later be shaken by lightning
bolts of change.
</P>
<P>
   The Foote fan, especially, will find the book engrossing.
Wharton is, in effect, Harrison, Texas, scene of most of Foote's
plays and films. We meet irrepressible Aunt Loula, loquacious font
of family lore. We meet real-life models for characters: the sad,
henpecked husband of ``The Trip to Bountiful''; the poor boy who
wins the heart of a rich girl (Foote's father and mother) in
``Courtship''; the man who grieves for the mysterious suicide of
his son but shuns his bereaved male partner, ``The Young Man From
Atlanta.'' (I once asked Foote, ``Why Atlanta?'' and he answered,
``That's where the young man was from.'')
</P>
<P>
   If you are new to Foote, ``Farewell'' may prompt you to explore
his distinguished body of work. When the 16-year-old Horton boards
the bus for Dallas and acting school, and bids farewell to Wharton,
you may find yourself impatient for another installment of his long
and well-lived life.
</P>

 &HT;    Proulx takes edge off her harsh tales
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 25.
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Annie Proulx isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   Little she writes about smacks of the familiar. Where so many
successful authors strive to create worlds that are instantly, even
comfortably, recognizable to readers, Proulx goes where few others
would. Not if they had many other options, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in 1993's Pulitzer Prize-winning ``The Shipping News,''
the distraught main character relocates to a Newfoundland that is
more day-to-day details about codfishing than dreamy seascapes.
And, in making a musical instrument the central motif of 1996's
``Accordion Crimes,'' Proulx settled not on the piano or violin,
but rather on the unfamiliar
</P>
<P>
   squeezebox.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps it's not surprising that Proulx chose America's least
populated state, Wyoming, as the setting for the stories in her new
collection, ``Close Range.'' Or that in some ways, the people and
places she writes about seem more foreign than if the book had been
set in Wiesbaden, Germany, or Wales.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Mud Below,'' Diamond Felts is a rodeo bull rider
constantly bucked about by life and increasingly looking for
reasons to keep hanging on. In ``People in Hell Just Want a Drink
of Water,'' the eight Dunmire brothers are ``brass-nutted boys''
who ride their horses hard on their ranch outside Laramie _ and are
even harder in their treatment of an addled neighbor who
``displays'' himself to the local women.
</P>
<P>
   There are 11 stories in all, each one featuring characters
seemingly as unrelenting as the land they work or as desperate as
the furtive couplings they engage in with near-strangers in drab
motel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it all might be too hard for readers to take were it not
for Proulx's unerring eye for detail and her unfailing use of
language. Diamond is ``playing the bull night after night,''
experiencing the short-lived rush of sex, but making sure ``there
was nobody in his life to slow him down with love.'' We may not
know many people like Diamond, the Dunmires or any of Proulx's
other characters, but we can't help wanting to know these
characters in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, they can even break our hearts without warning. In
the final story, ``Brokeback Mountain,'' Ennis Del Mar and Jack
Twist are at once Proulx's most unbelievable creations and her most
poignantly believable. Hard-driven and hard-drinking cowboys, they
meet in their late teens and embark on an intense sexual
relationship that lasts for nearly 20 years despite both their
marriages and long periods of separation.
</P>
<P>
   It seems like an affair (and an affair that must be kept secret
in unforgiving Wyoming), but really it's love. And then it's too
late to do anything about it. Or as Ennis tells himself at the end
of a story that should have even the most hardhearted reader
blinking back tears, ``If you can't fix it, you've got to stand
it.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't easy. But Proulx's ``Close Range'' is definitely worth
it.

 &HT;    Ernest Hemingway: Everyone Remembers Papa
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 25.
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ernest Hemingway once said he wanted no biography of himself
written while he was alive and preferably not for 100 years after
he died. He was granted the first wish, but shortly after his death
in 1961 the scholars and critics descended on his literary carcass
like so many vultures circling a dead leopard on Mount Kilimanjaro.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,100 scholarly articles, numerous biographies and
four posthumous books have been published since he blew his brains
out with a 12-gauge shotgun from Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch. Literary
festivals and bars have been named after him, T-shirts are marketed
bearing his likeness, and hundreds of aspiring young writers have
made near-religious pilgrimages to Paris and Pamplona in hopes of
absorbing some essence of Papa.
</P>
<P>
   Larger than life when alive, Hemingway became a giant when dead.
</P>
<P>
   On the 100th anniversary of his birth this summer _ June 21 _
Hemingway fans can enjoy a feeding frenzy on new books about the
man whose goal in life was to write one true sentence.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to several biographies and photo books, ``True at
First Light,'' the final posthumous work of Hemingway's, will be
published. Edited by his son, Patrick Hemingway, the ``fictional
memoir'' chronicles Hemingway's final safari in Africa and his love
affair with a young African woman.
</P>
<P>
   Four other unfinished Hemingway works have been published
posthumously: ``A Moveable Feast,'' ``Islands in the Stream,''
``The Dangerous Summer'' and ``The Garden of Eden.''
</P>
<P>
   If Hemingway were alive, the sight of the upcoming literary
spectacle would drive him to suicide _ or murder, says his friend,
author A.E. Hotchner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hated this kind of thing. Years ago, a young professor of
English decided he would be an interpreter of Hemingway and wrote
to him,'' says Hotchner, whose memoir, ``Papa Hemingway'' (Carroll
&AMP; Graf, $13.95 paperback), recently was reissued. ``Hemingway said,
`Whatever your publishers will pay you, I'll pay you double not to
write it. You'll get it wrong.' They're still getting it wrong. The
man's been written about enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The basic problem, Hotchner says, is that every professor has to
find a new way to write about Hemingway. ``What on earth can you
write that's new? They're all just scratching for more stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the man who supposedly hated publicity probably did
more than any other writer to cultivate his reputation. ``He was a
genius at creating and maintaining an image,'' says Matthew
Bruccoli, a Hemingway scholar and Jeffries professor of English at
the University of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Bruccoli says, Hemingway's reputation has never
faltered. ``Almost with every other writer after his death, there
is an assessment or an evaluation. Hemingway remains the most
recognized American writer in the world. No writer has ever been
imitated to the extent that Hemingway has been imitated, both on
paper, in style and technique.''
</P>
<P>
   To some critics, Hemingway's enduring fame is more a result of
his adventurous lifestyle than his literary style. Actually, says
Hotchner, it's a combination of his personality, plus the fact that
his books are vivid records of times and places.
</P>
<P>
   ``That book about Paris in the '20s, `The Sun Also Rises,' it's
a portrait of the mores and attitudes of that period. `For Whom the
Bell Tolls' is the only vibrant history we have of the Spanish
Civil War. `A Farewell to Arms' gave an insight into the first
World War that nothing else did. He was avant-garde in his
personality and everything he did. That's what endured. So, like
Babe Ruth and a few other icons, Hemingway represents the
writer/adventurer that's disappeared. He's become a symbol of
something that's past.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruccoli did not realize how important a figure Hemingway was
until one night in New York when he had gotten off work as a copy
boy at the New York Herald Tribune. Waiting for his train in the
subway station, he noticed a crowd of people around a newsstand
that got magazines a day early.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was 1 o'clock in the morning, and they were lined up to
get an issue of Life magazine that had `A Moveable Feast' in it. Is
there any other 20th-century American writer for whom people would
line up to get the first possible copy of his work? You'd have to
go back to Dickens. That's when I realized that Hemingway had an
attraction for readers such as no other writer, with the possible
exception of Mark Twain. Yes, it's hero worship. But if people have
to worship heroes, why can't they worship writers instead of some
Hollywood pretty boy?''

 &HT;    Kidder celebrates life of community
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 25.
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Northampton, Mass., a town of 30,000 souls, is old by American
standards (Jonathan Edwards preached there before the Revolutionary
War), home to prestigious Smith College and a sizable gay and
lesbian community, as safe and community-spirited as any place you
can find in America these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``As places go, it seemed so orderly,'' Tracy Kidder writes in
``HomeTown,'' his evocative new book about the people who live
there. ``And yet what an appalling abundance it contained. If all
of the town were transparent, if the roofs came off all the
buildings and the houses and the cars, and you were forced to look
down and see in one broad sweep everything that had happened here
and was happening . . . To apprehend it all at once _ who could
stand it?''
</P>
<P>
   In literary terms, that's exactly what Kidder does, although the
``appalling abundance'' and ``who could stand it?'' of that passage
may make you think this is one of those seamy
underbelly-of-the-American-dream books, which it emphatically is
not. Kidder is a gentle and respectful reporter and writer, and he
obviously loves the people of Northampton, even the misfits.
Especially the misfits.
</P>
<P>
   Kidder celebrates, without being sappy, communities, whether the
fifth-grade classroom in 1989's ``Among Schoolchildren'' (set in
nearby Holyoke) or those ``Hardy Boys'' building a computer in
``The Soul of a New Machine,'' which won a Pulitzer Prize for
nonfiction in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   His, and our, entree to Northampton is Tommy O'Connor, a
hometown boy who always wanted to be a policeman and became one: a
big, brusque, my-way-or-the-highway cop with a shaved head and an
intimidating presence. Tommy is both nicely settled (loving wife,
dad who's a character) and frequently conflicted between his code
of ethics and what he encounters as a Northampton cop.
</P>
<P>
   There's Frankie, an addict and goofy loser who does undercover
drug buys for the cops, and whom Tommy wants to rescue from street
life, but can't. And Rick, his childhood friend, also a cop, who's
accused of molesting his young daughter. Rather than turn
``HomeTown'' into an ugly incest whodunit, though, Kidder focuses
on the effect the devastating charge has on Tommy.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Tommy's orbit, but within Northampton's, live others,
like Alan Scheinman, an attorney who made piles of money in real
estate deals and then developed an obsessive-compulsive disorder so
severe it cut him off from humanity. He struggles to overcome his
mental problems, and when he begins dating a flighty stripper half
his age, what for most men would be unseemly feels like a sweet
triumph.
</P>
<P>
   And Laura Baumeister, a young woman on scholarship at Smith. A
victim of bad luck and bad choices, she's forced to apply for food
stamps to support her young son even as she's memorizing her T.S.
Eliot. The dowdy but hard-working mayor, the old-timer who reads
the news every morning on the AM radio station, the ER nurse, the
market owner, the guy who plays the bongos outside City Hall. ``To
apprehend it all at once _ who could stand it?''
</P>
<P>
   But to apprehend all is to understand all, with Kidder as a
guide. He burrows to the core of many of these people, telling us
their secrets, their fears, what they think when they lie awake at
3 a.m. This is not exactly new territory for Kidder, neither the
approach to presenting people nor the geography (all five of his
books are set in Massachusetts, where he lives in Williamsburg,
near Northampton). But it is exceedingly hard to do at the level he
does it, both the intensive reporting and the smoothly unobtrusive
writing.
</P>
<P>
   Kidder does not draw larger lessons in his books: They are rich
with specifics, and it is up to the reader to search for any
universality. Some people may want to do that, but it isn't
necessary. ``HomeTown'' is a book that lingers like the best
fiction.

 &HT;    Author ties threads of life together in memoir
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 25.
 &HT;    By Teresa K. Weaver
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bobbie Ann Mason spent her young adulthood trying to get away
from western Kentucky. Now, at 58, she is back in her home state,
re-creating in a memoir the rural setting and lifestyle that have
unwittingly shaped her writing from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   In the same unembellished, unpretentious prose that has
propelled her fiction _ from her acclaimed collection ``Shiloh and
Other Stories'' to the novels ``In Country'' and ``Feather Crowns''
_ Mason's ``Clear Springs: A Memoir'' (Random House, June) recounts
her odyssey as a writer, her escape from the family's 54-acre dairy
farm to the wider world and her eventual return to country life.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more of us are rummaging in the attic, trying to
retrieve our history,'' Mason writes in the introduction. ``We draw
genealogical charts and hang old quilts on the wall. We seem to
hope that if we can find out our family stories and trace our roots
and save the old cookie jars and coal scuttles, we just might
rescue ourselves and be made whole.''
</P>
<P>
   From her home in central Kentucky, where she lives with her
husband of 30 years, Roger Rawlings, and their seven cats and two
dogs, Mason talked about her first foray into nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What prompted you to write a memoir?
</P>
<P>
   A: I had spent a good part of the decade doing genealogical
research, studying family history and Kentucky history. And I had
written a historical novel, ``Feather Crowns'' (about the birth of
quintuplets to a Kentucky couple in the 1890s). So this memoir
clearly grew from some of that. It started in fact when I wrote
Chapter 1, which was an independent piece for The New Yorker. But
the inspiration for that was just standing at the pond (on the
family farm). It was a tone I felt. It radiated outward like the
ripples in the pond. I was standing there looking around at the
fields and the highway, and it felt like the whole world revolved
around that pond. It was a moment of self-awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How difficult was it to change gears from fiction to fact?
</P>
<P>
   A: Actually, it was a lot like writing fiction, except the
material I had to work with was very troublesome. I was forced to
make sense of facts, rather than just closing my eyes and making it
all up.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How involved was your research?
</P>
<P>
   A: I did a lot of genealogical research, but that didn't really
amount to anything in the book. It did, though, get me into the
whole feeling of trying to tie the threads together. That was part
of it, feeling like everything should fit together. The other part
was talking to my mother, trying to learn everything I could about
her early life. Mainly it was a matter of making sense of what I
had before me. I had a lot of facts and trivia and memories and
little stories that I had been told, and I had to kind of
understand it all. I had to put it in a coherent form that I could
make something out of. This is the fiction writer talking: as if
you could make a literary structure out of your life.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't have a sensational story to tell right off the bat, but
it was more about the texture of experience, the comprehension of
where am I right now, what did I come from? Those are the kinds of
questions we all ask.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was there any resistance from the family to your telling this
story?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. My mother read it, and all she said was, ``Well, I know
that. Tell me something new.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since you moved back to Kentucky, what has the adjustment
been like?
</P>
<P>
   A: Very difficult. I had moved back to be closer to the family
and it turned out I was still too far away. And my father died as
soon as I moved back. So I've spent the rest of the decade trying
to be with my mother. I haven't really developed a normal life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you read any memoirs to prepare for this project? Were
there models that you followed?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, I didn't re-read Nabokov's ``Speak, Memory,'' but it
was certainly whispering in my ear.

 &HT;    A further journey into beauty of Italy
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 15.
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I walk from window to window, taking in the view.''
</P>
<P>
   When Frances Mayes wrote that final line about her new part-time
home near Cortona, Italy, in her best-selling book ``Under the
Tuscan Sun,'' she says, she was also writing the first line for her
second, even more substantial obeisance to Italian life, this time
dubbed ``Bella Tuscany: The Sweet Life in Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   Her eyes do take it all in: the tall, tall cypress trees (``tips
pointed like sable paintbrushes'') planted in remembrance of
Italy's World War I veterans; stars that shoot over the valley,
``stars that fell even before the Etruscans watched from this
hillside.'' Her nostrils and ears are on full alert as she travels
through small towns: ``As I walk by open windows, I'm transfixed by
the aroma of ragu and the cascades of concurrent voices.'' And the
food she tastes. The magnificent food. Cannellini simply dressed
with oil, sage, salt and a healthy dose of pepper. Pasta al limone.
Carp paired with herbs and bits of roast pork. Truffles and
mushrooms and sausages. And green Sicilian tangerines, ``exactly,''
as she so precisely points out, ``the color of a parrot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the Tuscan Sun,'' published in 1996, was at its core a
captivating combination of PBS' ``This Old House,'' ``Victory
Garden'' and ``Cooking Secrets of the CIA.'' Book clubs ate it up.
</P>
<P>
   This follow-up memoir continues Mayes' sweet-life sojourns to
Bramasole, the old Tuscan house with the Etruscan stone wall that
she and her second husband, Ed, bought and began loving and
restoring (with a seemingly bottomless bank account) nine years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bella Tuscany'' echoes plenty from the first book _ part of a
stone wall falls and needs repairing; a lingering evening is spent
enjoying lasagna and Vino Nobile outdoors with lanterns perched
atop the stone wall; each summer day brings ``a heaping basket of
perfect, absolutely perfect, red, red tomatoes'' _ but it is also
where Mayes spends more pages stretching her soul.
</P>
<P>
   She has sent out her taproot to run deep into Italy. Well beyond
Tuscany, her visits take her to Sicily, partly to see and taste the
island's 2-foot-tall Easter-time chocolate eggs and marzipan
creations (Noah's Ark complete with animals, for example), and to
watery Venice, where beauty is so stunning that tourists ``step out
of the gondolas like new beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayes' quest for a spiritual connection to Italy is a sometimes
poignant melding of her new life with her second home in San
Francisco and her early roots in Fitzgerald, Ga. It's also a way
for her to deepen her sense about life (including a surprise
marriage in San Francisco), death (in both America and her newfound
country), and what pulses far within her own psyche (a
preoccupation with monogrammed linen, for example, or inner musings
about the curing comfort of sticking tired feet into the temperate,
healing Italian waters of Bango Vignoni).
</P>
<P>
   To some, her connections may seem strained. (In an early
chapter, while gazing at a church's stained glass, she wonders
whether fetuses perceive the same kind of filtered light.) But near
the book's end, her mind is so exquisitely in tune with Italy that
she can evoke three vivid metaphors for the land's dry autumn
grasses. And that makes for, undoubtedly, sweet reading.

 &HT;    Nabokov remains utterly resistant
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 25.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In October of 1958, a seemingly lurid novel about a 12-year-old
nymphet assumed the No. 1 position on The New York Times Bestseller
List. Its author, largely unknown to the reading public, was a
Russian expatriate named Vladimir Nabokov, then teaching literature
at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had ``Lolita'' risen to No. 1 than another Russian
novel, ``Dr. Zhivago,'' made its first appearance on the list. The
author was as little known as Nabokov, but within six weeks Boris
Pasternak's epic about the Russian Revolution had passed
``Lolita.'' By coincidence, both authors had begun their books 11
years earlier, Pasternak while imprisoned in the Soviet Union,
Nabokov while enjoying the freedom of American academic life and
the leisure of netting butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   On the centenary of his birth, Nabokov has never thrown off the
criticism that his novels and stories were those of a dilettante _
intricate, interesting in the way chess puzzles are interesting,
but things to be admired from an emotional distance. Critics
expected an emigre from the Soviet Union to write tracts about
tyranny in the form of fiction. Nabokov was utterly resistant. ``I
write for the sake of the pleasure, for the sake of the
difficulty,'' he told an interviewer. ``I have no social purpose,
no moral message. . . . I just like composing riddles with elegant
solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Born into the aristocracy of czarist Russia, Nabokov claimed to
have been bilingual from birth and judged his English to be better
than his Russian. Whatever the fluency of his Russian, he was
renowned as a master of English prose (a matter of keen interest,
no doubt, to the prurient who flocked to the 1962 movie version of
``Lolita''). Someone asked him once which language he thought in.
He answered:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think in any language. I think in images. I don't
believe that people think in languages. They don't move their lips
when they think. It is only a certain type of illiterate person who
moves his lips when he reads or ruminates.''
</P>
<P>
   His opinions were strong and his grudges permanent. Certain of
the great names of Literature were, he thought, overrated
(Faulkner) and others outright hacks (Dostoyevsky). James Joyce he
admired extravagantly. But when the public embraced ``Dr.
Zhivago''_ and just at the time his own novel was making him known
_ he felt only disgust and nausea (``dreary, conventional stuff'').
</P>
<P>
   It may have been sour grapes, writes Stacy Schiff in a biography
of Vera Nabokov, his wife of 52 years and intimate collaborator,
but no one could convince Nabokov otherwise. ``He restrained
himself as much as possible,'' Schiff writes, ``but still could not
resist snorting when told that the waiting list for `Zhivago' in
the Ithaca library was longer than that for `Lolita.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to be the only Russian novelist in existence,''
complained Edmund Wilson, a friend until Nabokov dismissed Wilson's
grasp of Russian grammar and style at great length in the pages of
The New York Review of Books.
</P>
<P>
   It is a minor irony that Nabokov's first published work was not
in a literary magazine but a journal called The Entomologist. All
his life he considered himself a professional lepidopterist, and he
contributed articles on butterflies to numerous scientific
journals.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he was as much an artist in English as Flaubert was in
French, and it is little wonder that his diamond-perfect prose is
enjoying renewed appreciation. Besides Schiff's elegantly written
biography of Vera Nabokov, the Everyman's Library has brought out a
new edition of ``Speak, Memory'' and Beacon Press later this year
will publish ``Nabokov's Butterflies.'' And last fall a new edition
of ``Lolita,'' which Nabokov ranked one of his two favorite works
(along with his translation of Pushkin's ``Eugene Onegin''), was
reissued.
</P>
<P>
   All of this comes almost 22 years after Nabokov died in
Montreux, Switzerland, where he and Vera _ to whom he dedicated
every one of his 27 books _ lived in a hotel, took Alpine walks and
lived apolitical lives. ``The larger the issue the less it
interests me,'' he said. ``Some of my best concerns are microscopic
patches of color.''
</P>
<P>
   He was hardly oblivious of the social and political issues of
the day. But he had only contempt for writers who believed that
artists have a moral duty to something other than their
imagination. The Russia he had known was one he was content to
leave forever: ``All the Russia I need is always with me _
literature, language and my own Russian childhood. . . . Anyway,
the grotesque shadow of a police state will not be dispelled in my
lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   He would have thought it a fine irony: The Soviet Union he hated
lies dead and buried. Russia is gravely ill, as usual. But the art
of Vladimir Nabokov is alive and well, thank you.

BRADLEY OUTLINES VISION FOR A 21ST-CENTURY PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Although hard to draw out on details, former Sen. Bill
Bradley on Thursday mapped broad outlines of a 21st-century
presidency he said would have greater vision, more authority
delegated and fewer daily sound bites than life under Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The former New Jersey senator skewered the Clinton
administration on its Yugoslavia bombing campaign, committed
himself to expanded trade with China, and said America's top
spending priority should be its neglected children.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley came to Seattle to raise $250,000 for his presidential
campaign, and to draw out differences between himself and Vice
President Al Gore, the leading Democratic presidential contender.
</P>
<P>
   The one-time New York Knicks forward argued that the
administration had no game plan last month when NATO launched its
aerial war against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have said from the beginning that objectives of this
operation were not clear. You do not have success without clear
objectives,'' Bradley said at a meeting with Seattle
Post-Intelligencer editors.
</P>
<P>
   If the goal of the United States and its allies was to avert
ethnic cleansing, Bradley said, ``It's already happened.'' If NATO
wanted to stop the conflict from spreading to unstable states
bordering Serbia and Kosovo, ``It has already spread.''
</P>
<P>
   Although offering support for U.S. troops in the field, Bradley
offered a biting analysis of proposed commitment of ground forces
to Kosovo. ``I've always believed you do not commit military force
into some place without figuring out how you get out of that
place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley traced what he called U.S. policy blunders over
Yugoslavia back to the Bush administration. He noted that U.S.
peacekeepers have been in Bosnia more than three years, not the
promised three to four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said in a (1996) speech in the Senate that we had just
created the next Berlin,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was campaigning in Washington state at the same time
President Clinton was traveling to a Washington, D.C.-area high
school for a televised talk with students in the wake of killings
at a Colorado high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is what he (Clinton) does, he is comfortable with it, and
it is reassuring.... But it is not my way of doing things,''
Bradley said of Clinton's public empathizing.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said the presidency offers America's premier bully
pulpit, but is not meant for non-stop preaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea, since Ronald Reagan, has been that the essence of
public policy is you dominate the daily news cycle,'' he said.
``(It seems that) the president has to be on the evening news each
night.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bradley's view, constant exposure gives the White House small
tactical victories but deprives it of the ability to convincingly
offer a larger vision and goals to the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Franklin D. Roosevelt used to go on boat trips for three
weeks,'' he said. ``When he spoke, people wanted to hear what he
had to say. He spoke with an authority you do not have by competing
for airtime with TV anchormen.''
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of China, Bradley is an unabashed supporter of
China trade and strongly opposes any restrictions on commerce tied
to China's human rights policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more China opens up, the more it ultimately liberalizes,''
he said. ``You now see a higher level of political freedom in China
than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said China should be allowed to join the World Trade
Organization ``with no special favors'' and should be welcomed into
the international financial system.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century after he played with the Knicks' winning
teams, Bradley, 55, can still display an off-court elusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   He is eloquent on such objectives as helping children achieve
and bringing about racial reconciliation in America. But he gives
few details of of how he would achieve such goals.
</P>
<P>
   He would ``do something'' about teen pregnancies and ``deal
with'' the fact that one in every five children grows up in
poverty. He said he strongly feels the need for strong families
teaching children ``that there is a meaning to life deeper than the
material.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a vision, after which comes the policies and
then the actions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has shown signs of catching on in polls. A recent
Reuters-Zogby survey showed him trailing Gore by 54 percent to 35
percent in New Hampshire, site of a crucial early primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said the Clinton impeachment saga may have broken the
personal ``invasiveness'' of presidential campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fever is broken,'' he said. ``We can get back to talking
about things that are substantive and relevant.... The people have
a right to know whether I am a crook.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have a right to know whether I am a sinner. We're
all sinners.''

 &HT;    Father's agony: African-American son slain for race
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Michael Shoels moved his family to this
middle-class suburban community because he wanted a better
environment for his family.
</P>
<P>
   But the violence and racial antagonism that afflict so many
African-American families in this country followed the Shoels even
to placid Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   Isaiah Shoels, 18, was the only black victim of the Columbine
High School tragedy, and witnesses say his killers targeted him
specifically because of the color of his skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``One kid said to the other, `There's an n-word over here,'''
said Craig Scott, who huddled under a table in the school library
with Isaiah when the two killers entered the room. ``The other kid
came over and saw him. Isaiah tried to back up and he didn't say
anything, and they shot Isaiah.''
</P>
<P>
   After battling through a sleepless night Tuesday not knowing his
son's fate, Michael Shoels finally got official confirmation of his
son's death Wednesday. That racism was part of the reason his son
died made the tragedy that much harder to bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been agonizing,'' Shoels told reporters. ``I'm
really hurting inside. No child, whether they are black, white,
red, yellow, should die for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Shoels has two other children, both of whom attend
Columbine High and survived the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Isaiah Shoels was a bright, outgoing youth who
liked other people and did his best to fit in, even though at
Columbine, he was one of only about two dozen African-Americans in
an overwhelmingly white student body of 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Short in stature but powerfully built, Shoels had played
football at a previous school and wrestled when he transferred to
Columbine. He was in top condition, and once lifted twice his
weight in the work-out room, amazing some of his friends.
</P>
<P>
   When Larry Mingo, another African-American student, transferred
to Columbine last month, Shoels went out of his way to make him
feel at home, Mingo told the Rocky Mountain News.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was new, and he did what no one else volunteered to do, he
showed me around,'' Mingo said.
</P>
<P>
   But being black in a mostly white school wasn't without its
tensions. Isaiah told his father that some students who dressed in
black trench coats and hung out together made him feel
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always used to tell me they would pick on him, and I would
always say, `Son, you will have to overcome that,''' he said. ``I
trained my children to get along with everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Shoels now cringes when he recalls his reaction to his
son's complaints. But, perhaps like many African-American parents,
he may have felt torn, wanting his son to rise above the taunts,
but also not wanting to see him hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should've listened to my son more,'' he told NBC. ``I should
have gone to the authorities, but I felt he was strong enough to
overcome it.

 By BILL MAXWELL 
 &HT;    (Bill Maxwell, African American, is an editorial writer and
columnist for the St. Petersburg Times in St. Petersburg, Fla. He
can be reached on the Internet at maxwell(at) sptimes.com) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Retired Gen. Colin Powell's smiling face,
along with that of a teenage girl, graces the cover of the April 11
issue of Parade magazine. The accompanying story discusses the
celebration of the 11th annual National Youth Service Day. It is an
inspiring article, showing youngsters and adults performing
wonderful deeds to make their communities better.
 &HT;    While celebrities such as Powell bring national attention to
worthy programs and volunteers, many other projects and workers
whom we never read about _ especially older citizens _ toil each
day, often at great personal expense and effort, to lift the
quality of life for their friends and neighbors.
 &HT;    I know of no better example of such selflessness than that
exemplified by members of Christ United Methodist Church on
Gainesville's predominantly low-income eastside. The church has 83
members, with about 30 attending services regularly.
 &HT;    In 1997, the pastor at that time, the Rev. Paul N. Jewett, and
the administrative board discussed ways to attract new members and
persuade those who did not attend to show up more often.
 &HT;    The major obstacle to attracting new members was a matter of
demographics. When the church moved to its current location in
1965, the neighborhood was overwhelmingly white and blue collar.
Today, the area is mostly black and poor. Only two of the church's
members are black. Even more, while the average age of area
residents is 30 years, that of the members is 65.
 &HT;    ``In other words,'' a member said, ``our church is a bunch of
old white people in a younger black community.''
 &HT;    A revival the previous year had been a ``blessing,'' Jewett
said, but it did not increase membership. Betty Jewett, the
pastor's wife, asked: ``Why not just do what Jesus said we should
do _ serve people?''
 &HT;    Less than two years later, that simple question has produced
Prime Time, a unique after-school program that is free of charge to
the neighborhood's kindergarten and elementary school children.
Currently, 18 children, all African-American, attend the program
each school day from 2:30 to 5:30. It has had as many as 25. None
of the children or their parents are members of the church.
 &HT;    ``Prime Time is for children from households unable to afford
traditional after-school programs,'' said Betty Wagner, chairwoman
of the program's board of directors. ``Prime Time offers assistance
with reading, writing and arithmetic skills and provides activities
that promote the development of creative talents. We want to keep
these children from becoming latchkey children. We don't want to
see our children roaming the streets.''
 &HT;    Diane Loyless, the program's treasurer, expresses a more
long-term goal: ``By helping them now, we want to deter the
children from going the wrong way in later years. So many times in
larger families, some children just don't get special attention.
Our volunteers work one-on-one with the kids.''
 &HT;    Homework is just one part of the activities. The students keep a
personal journal and write and publish their own newspaper called,
of course, Prime Times. A University of Florida music professor
teaches piano lessons, and another professor teaches art. Each
week, the children are taken on field trips, visiting places such
as museums, hospitals, the airport and other important sites.
 &HT;    ``We take the children to these places because we want them to
become complete citizens,'' Jewett said.
 &HT;    Donna Simpson-Brown, a 47-year-old self-employed hairdresser who
is often away from home in the afternoon, enrolled two children and
two grandchildren in the program from the outset and believes that
she made the right decision. ``The tutoring is worth a million
dollars in itself,'' she said. ``Dominique is on the honor roll.
Kaytlyn ... brought up her grades from Cs to As and Bs. And she is
taking piano lessons. She loves it. I definitely see an attitude
shift in my children since they've been in Prime Time. They don't
want to stay home after school. They want to come here. I don't
have to worry about them getting into trouble if I'm not home.''
 &HT;    While Jewett and the volunteers believe that Prime Time is a
miracle, they also believe that how it became a reality is just as
miraculous. After establishing an advisory board, Jewett had to
raise money for a safe playground, two paid staffers, a van and
supplies.
 &HT;    The first $20 came from a local restaurant where the pastor ate
each Sunday. Jewett wrote to a friend in California describing his
plan, and the friend, a retired Warner Bros. executive, donated the
$4,000 that established a memorial playground for Prime Time
students. Since then, many other permanent donors have come aboard.
 &HT;    ``The most rewarding and blessed part of this whole experience
is the way that people want to help if you tell them what you're
doing,'' Jewett said. ``They respond. A professor at the university
and his wife, for example, have underwritten two children to attend
the program for a year.''
 &HT;    Jewett says his budget is about $25,000 a year, but the families
pay only a $10 registration fee. Everything else is free. ``We are
struggling,'' he said, ``but we believe that we are doing what we
should be doing as representatives of Jesus: helping people.''

 By BILL MAXWELL 
 &HT;    (Bill Maxwell, African American, is an editorial writer and
columnist for the St. Petersburg Times in St. Petersburg, Fla. He
can be reached on the Internet at maxwell(at) sptimes.com) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Retired Gen. Colin Powell's smiling face,
along with that of a teenage girl, graces the cover of the April 11
issue of Parade magazine. The accompanying story discusses the
celebration of the 11th annual National Youth Service Day. It is an
inspiring article, showing youngsters and adults performing
wonderful deeds to make their communities better.
 &HT;    While celebrities such as Powell bring national attention to
worthy programs and volunteers, many other projects and workers
whom we never read about _ especially older citizens _ toil each
day, often at great personal expense and effort, to lift the
quality of life for their friends and neighbors.
 &HT;    I know of no better example of such selflessness than that
exemplified by members of Christ United Methodist Church on
Gainesville's predominantly low-income eastside. The church has 83
members, with about 30 attending services regularly.
 &HT;    In 1997, the pastor at that time, the Rev. Paul N. Jewett, and
the administrative board discussed ways to attract new members and
persuade those who did not attend to show up more often.
 &HT;    The major obstacle to attracting new members was a matter of
demographics. When the church moved to its current location in
1965, the neighborhood was overwhelmingly white and blue collar.
Today, the area is mostly black and poor. Only two of the church's
members are black. Even more, while the average age of area
residents is 30 years, that of the members is 65.
 &HT;    ``In other words,'' a member said, ``our church is a bunch of
old white people in a younger black community.''
 &HT;    A revival the previous year had been a ``blessing,'' Jewett
said, but it did not increase membership. Betty Jewett, the
pastor's wife, asked: ``Why not just do what Jesus said we should
do _ serve people?''
 &HT;    Less than two years later, that simple question has produced
Prime Time, a unique after-school program that is free of charge to
the neighborhood's kindergarten and elementary school children.
Currently, 18 children, all African-American, attend the program
each school day from 2:30 to 5:30. It has had as many as 25. None
of the children or their parents are members of the church.
 &HT;    ``Prime Time is for children from households unable to afford
traditional after-school programs,'' said Betty Wagner, chairwoman
of the program's board of directors. ``Prime Time offers assistance
with reading, writing and arithmetic skills and provides activities
that promote the development of creative talents. We want to keep
these children from becoming latchkey children. We don't want to
see our children roaming the streets.''
 &HT;    Diane Loyless, the program's treasurer, expresses a more
long-term goal: ``By helping them now, we want to deter the
children from going the wrong way in later years. So many times in
larger families, some children just don't get special attention.
Our volunteers work one-on-one with the kids.''
 &HT;    Homework is just one part of the activities. The students keep a
personal journal and write and publish their own newspaper called,
of course, Prime Times. A University of Florida music professor
teaches piano lessons, and another professor teaches art. Each
week, the children are taken on field trips, visiting places such
as museums, hospitals, the airport and other important sites.
 &HT;    ``We take the children to these places because we want them to
become complete citizens,'' Jewett said.
 &HT;    Donna Simpson-Brown, a 47-year-old self-employed hairdresser who
is often away from home in the afternoon, enrolled two children and
two grandchildren in the program from the outset and believes that
she made the right decision. ``The tutoring is worth a million
dollars in itself,'' she said. ``Dominique is on the honor roll.
Kaytlyn ... brought up her grades from Cs to As and Bs. And she is
taking piano lessons. She loves it. I definitely see an attitude
shift in my children since they've been in Prime Time. They don't
want to stay home after school. They want to come here. I don't
have to worry about them getting into trouble if I'm not home.''
 &HT;    While Jewett and the volunteers believe that Prime Time is a
miracle, they also believe that how it became a reality is just as
miraculous. After establishing an advisory board, Jewett had to
raise money for a safe playground, two paid staffers, a van and
supplies.
 &HT;    The first $20 came from a local restaurant where the pastor ate
each Sunday. Jewett wrote to a friend in California describing his
plan, and the friend, a retired Warner Bros. executive, donated the
$4,000 that established a memorial playground for Prime Time
students. Since then, many other permanent donors have come aboard.
 &HT;    ``The most rewarding and blessed part of this whole experience
is the way that people want to help if you tell them what you're
doing,'' Jewett said. ``They respond. A professor at the university
and his wife, for example, have underwritten two children to attend
the program for a year.''
 &HT;    Jewett says his budget is about $25,000 a year, but the families
pay only a $10 registration fee. Everything else is free. ``We are
struggling,'' he said, ``but we believe that we are doing what we
should be doing as representatives of Jesus: helping people.''

 &HT;    Ceremonies that celebrate homosexual unions shall not be
conducted by our ministers and shall not be conducted in our
church. _ Social Principles of the United Methodists' Book of
Discipline.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The top policy-making body of the 8.5 million-member United
Methodist Church, the General Conference, passed this principle in
1996 specifically banning same-sex unions in the nation's second
largest Protestant denomination (the Southern Baptist Convention is
the largest). But some ministers and lay persons considered the
principle to be advisory and not binding.
 &HT;    Then on Aug. 8, 1998, the Methodists' Judicial Council, the
denomination's top governing body, ruled that this principle had
the force of church law, declaring the principle to be binding
rather than advisory on all United Methodist clergy. Pastors who
perform same-sex unions may be tried before church courts and
reprimanded and defrocked.
 &HT;    On Sept. 19, 1998, the Rev. Gregory Dell, 53, of the Broadway
United Methodist Church in Chicago, performed a ``service of holy
union'' for two gay men. Two weeks ago a 13-member jury of
Methodist ministers, by a 10-3 vote, found Dell guilty of
disobedience to Methodism's ``order and discipline'' for
officiating at the same-sex commitment ceremony. The jury suspended
Dell from his ordained ministerial duties, effective on July 5 _
unless Dell signs a written pledge to his bishop not to officiate
at another holy union ceremony as long as the ban is in place.
 &HT;    Dell is not willing to do that: ``I will never sign such a
pledge,'' Dell said. ``That would be a violation of what I believe
the spirit of God and all these people signify,'' he told The
Chicago Tribune.
 &HT;    The trial cost the church $100,000.
 &HT;    During his 30 years of pastoral service, Dell, who is a married
heterosexual and the father of a son, has conducted 33 services of
holy union for gay and lesbian couples. He estimates that 30
percent of his congregation is gay.
 &HT;    ``I took a vow to be in ministry with all persons _ not
regardless of their identity but in celebration of their
identity,'' Dell said in a press statement. ``I'm expected to
Baptize, teach, counsel, visit, bury and learn from all of the
persons to whom I've been appointed to pastor. I'm also charged to
bless and celebrate relationships of love between persons when
those relationships uphold standards of fairness and ministry. It
is a privilege _ not a duty _ to do so. To withhold such blessing
from some because of their identity and regardless of the quality
of their relationships would be the true violation of my
ordination,'' he said.
 &HT;    Dell's conviction of breaking church law comes in the wake of
another high-profile trial in March 1998 of the Rev. Jimmy Creech
of Omaha, Nebraska. Creech had performed a holy union ceremony for
a lesbian couple in September of 1997 _ before the Judicial
Council's decision to make the ban on same-sex ceremonies binding.
In his case, a church jury narrowly acquitted Creech, accused of
disobedience; but he was not reappointed to the Omaha church.
 &HT;    Still another act of Methodist ecclesiastical disobedience
occurred on Jan. 15, 1999 in Sacramento, Calif. In the Convention
Center there before 1,000 invited guests, a group of 84 United
Methodist ministers performed a service of union to bless a lesbian
couple. According to an Associated Press news account it was billed
the ```wedding' of the year for U.S. Protestantism.''
 &HT;    Two weeks ago the Methodist bishop of Northern California filed
a complaint against the ministers who participated in the holy
union ceremony and the presider, the Rev. Don Fado. The bishop's
action is the first step toward a possible church trial of the
clergy members, who if convicted, could be defrocked like Dell.
 &HT;    The United Methodist Church has a potential crisis on its hands.
There are approximately 350 United Methodist ministers who have
signed a public statement of their intention to perform same-sex
commitment ceremonies. If these ministers follow through on their
pledges and church officials choose to put them on trial, the
United Methodist Church will incur enormous costs and cause
serious, perhaps irreparable, divisions between its conservative
and liberal wings. Such developments may ripple throughout
Protestant Christianity where the battle over gays and religion so
far has been largely fought out over the ordination of openly gay
and lesbian clergy.
 &HT;    Fado described the problem in simpler terms: ``In our church,
unfortunately, I'm allowed to come into their (a gay or lesbian
couple) home and bless their house, bless their car, bless their
tractor and even bless their dog, but I am not allowed to bless
them,'' he said.
 &HT;    But for United Methodists _ and for that matter all Christians _
there is an even more serious theological crisis when rigid
adherence to church law takes precedence over the Gospel teachings
and compassion of Jesus Christ.

 By TIM GIAGO (Nanwica Kciji) 
 &HT;    (Tim Giago, Lakota Indian, is CEO of book publishers Lakota
Times Publishing, Inc., located in Sioux Falls, S.D. His Indian
name is Nanwica Kciji.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Nineteen years ago the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of
the Black Hills Claims suit brought by the united tribes of the
Great Sioux Nation that these lands, sacred to several Indian
tribes, were taken illegally.
 &HT;    At the time, Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, who died last
month, wrote for the court, ``A more ripe and rank case of
dishonorable dealing will never, in all probability, be found in
our history.''
 &HT;    The tribes of the Great Sioux Nation were awarded a judgement of
$17.1 million as value of the 7.3 million acres taken by the 1877
Congressional Act, $3,484 for the right of way, $450,000 for
damages resulting from gold removed prior to the Act, plus 5
percent simple interest from the date of the theft totaling
$105,994,430.52. This brought the total monetary award to the
tribes to $123,447,914.52.
 &HT;    On July 18, 2000, 20 years will have passed since Congress
appropriated this monetary award. The tribes of the Great Sioux
Nation have refused to accept it and thus far, not one penny has
changed hands. The lawsuit over the Black Hills was first filed by
the Sioux Nation in 1921. After 59 years of litigation, the tribes
finally had their day in court. I realize justice often moves
slowly, but 59 years?
 &HT;    The monetary award has been held in trust by the Bureau of
Indian Affairs since 1980. It has been accumulating interest since
it was awarded and has grown to nearly $600 million. And still the
tribes of the Sioux Nation, the absolute poorest of the poor,
refuse to accept it.
 &HT;    In 1985 former Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), introduced the
Bradley Bill to address the claims of the Sioux Tribes. The
mainstream media immediately reported erroneously that the tribes
were attempting to regain all of the Black Hills. This was never
the case. In the Bradley Bill the tribes asked to be awarded 1.3
million acres of the total 7.3 million acres, to be used as a Great
Sioux Nation National Park. And they asked only for U.S. National
Forest lands. They did not ask for private, state, national parks
or municipality lands.
 &HT;    The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the 7.3 million acres of land
taken in 1877 were taken illegally. By awarding money only, the
court was saying, ``All right, we stole your land and we admit it.
Therefore we will award you the money we believe it was worth in
1877, but forget the billions of dollars in timber and mineral
wealth since extracted from your stolen land.''
 &HT;    The tribes of the Great Sioux Nation didn't see it this way.
They simply refused to take the money and run. They asked that a
small portion of the land be returned to them since the land was
always regarded as sacred.
 &HT;    Whenever I read in newspapers that the Sioux are trying to get
back the Black Hills or whenever I hear it on the radio or see it
on a TV newscast I cringe. It is bad enough this erroneous
information is being used as propaganda against the tribes, but to
reinforce this error by repeating it as news has really damaged the
ability of the tribes to communicate their real desires. For
responsible news reporters to lend credence to a lie, I believe, is
almost unforgivable.
 &HT;    The tribes will soon meet to discuss the future of their claim
and of the monetary award they have thus far refused to accept. In
all probability, a new sponsor in the House and the Senate will be
found to introduce another bill seeking the return of a very small
portion of the Black Hills. The Bradley Bill never got off the
ground so the tribes are ready to try again.
 &HT;    When this happens, the tribes will make copies of the new Bill
available to all of the media, both national and local. News
directors should become familiar with the language in the Bill so
that unfounded rumors generated by opponents do not cloud the facts
and inflame the issue.
 &HT;    The summer of 1999 will be the season when many decisions will
be reached by the tribal leaders and members of the tribes who have
waited patiently for justice for more than 100 years.
 &HT;    Just remember that the tribes are not trying to remove or
displace any present occupants residing in the Black Hills. They
are only asking for a small portion of the land stolen from them
112 years ago, land which is unoccupied Forest Service land.
 &HT;    History judges great nations by how they treat their indigenous
people. How will history judge South Dakota and America?

 &HT;    (Tim Giago, Lakota Indian, is CEO of book publishers Lakota
Times Publishing, Inc., located in Sioux Falls, S.D. His Indian

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Nineteen years ago the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of
the Black Hills Claims suit brought by the united tribes of the
Great Sioux Nation that these lands, sacred to several Indian
tribes, were taken illegally.
 &HT;    At the time, Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, who died last
month, wrote for the court, ``A more ripe and rank case of
dishonorable dealing will never, in all probability, be found in
our history.''
 &HT;    The tribes of the Great Sioux Nation were awarded a judgement of
$17.1 million as value of the 7.3 million acres taken by the 1877
Congressional Act, $3,484 for the right of way, $450,000 for
damages resulting from gold removed prior to the Act, plus 5
percent simple interest from the date of the theft totaling
$105,994,430.52. This brought the total monetary award to the
tribes to $123,447,914.52.
 &HT;    On July 18, 2000, 20 years will have passed since Congress
appropriated this monetary award. The tribes of the Great Sioux
Nation have refused to accept it and thus far, not one penny has
changed hands. The lawsuit over the Black Hills was first filed by
the Sioux Nation in 1921. After 59 years of litigation, the tribes
finally had their day in court. I realize justice often moves
slowly, but 59 years?
 &HT;    The monetary award has been held in trust by the Bureau of
Indian Affairs since 1980. It has been accumulating interest since
it was awarded and has grown to nearly $600 million. And still the
tribes of the Sioux Nation, the absolute poorest of the poor,
refuse to accept it.
 &HT;    In 1985 former Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), introduced the
Bradley Bill to address the claims of the Sioux Tribes. The
mainstream media immediately reported erroneously that the tribes
were attempting to regain all of the Black Hills. This was never
the case. In the Bradley Bill the tribes asked to be awarded 1.3
million acres of the total 7.3 million acres, to be used as a Great
Sioux Nation National Park. And they asked only for U.S. National
Forest lands. They did not ask for private, state, national parks
or municipality lands.
 &HT;    The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the 7.3 million acres of land
taken in 1877 were taken illegally. By awarding money only, the
court was saying, ``All right, we stole your land and we admit it.
Therefore we will award you the money we believe it was worth in
1877, but forget the billions of dollars in timber and mineral
wealth since extracted from your stolen land.''
 &HT;    The tribes of the Great Sioux Nation didn't see it this way.
They simply refused to take the money and run. They asked that a
small portion of the land be returned to them since the land was
always regarded as sacred.
 &HT;    Whenever I read in newspapers that the Sioux are trying to get
back the Black Hills or whenever I hear it on the radio or see it
on a TV newscast I cringe. It is bad enough this erroneous
information is being used as propaganda against the tribes, but to
reinforce this error by repeating it as news has really damaged the
ability of the tribes to communicate their real desires. For
responsible news reporters to lend credence to a lie, I believe, is
almost unforgivable.
 &HT;    The tribes will soon meet to discuss the future of their claim
and of the monetary award they have thus far refused to accept. In
all probability, a new sponsor in the House and the Senate will be
found to introduce another bill seeking the return of a very small
portion of the Black Hills. The Bradley Bill never got off the
ground so the tribes are ready to try again.
 &HT;    When this happens, the tribes will make copies of the new Bill
available to all of the media, both national and local. News
directors should become familiar with the language in the Bill so
that unfounded rumors generated by opponents do not cloud the facts
and inflame the issue.
 &HT;    The summer of 1999 will be the season when many decisions will
be reached by the tribal leaders and members of the tribes who have
waited patiently for justice for more than 100 years.
 &HT;    Just remember that the tribes are not trying to remove or
displace any present occupants residing in the Black Hills. They
are only asking for a small portion of the land stolen from them
112 years ago, land which is unoccupied Forest Service land.
 &HT;    History judges great nations by how they treat their indigenous
people. How will history judge South Dakota and America?

 &HT;    ``Race is an issue in policing.'' This is no surprise to lots of
people of color. It is usually denied by white people, though,
especially police officials. But at a recent forum some police
chiefs publicly acknowledged that people of color have been
unfairly singled out in traffic stops.
 &HT;    The Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) early this month
organized a day of closed-door meetings in Washington, D.C. between
police executives and community leaders to address the topic
``Balancing Crime Strategies and Democratic Principles.''
 &HT;    Philadelphia Police Commissioner John Timoney, president of
PERF, declared: ``If we are to deal with it, we must stipulate that
race is an issue in policing.'' Timoney went on to say, ``There are
an awful lot of people in denial, but so be it. We must move
forward.''
 &HT;    The PERF meeting consisted of 35 police chiefs and activists.
Racial profiling is currently being investigated by the U.S.
Justice Department which is looking at the practices by the New
Jersey State Police as well as police agencies in Eastpointe,
Michigan and Orange County, Florida.
 &HT;    Many of the studies on racial profiling focus on traffic stops.
But recently New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman fired State Police
Superintendent Carl Williams for remarks he made that people of
color are responsible for most of the cocaine and marijuana
dealing. And African American men are eight times more likely to be
convicted than white men.
 &HT;    PERF participants discussed solutions to racial profiling
practices. One solution discussed was to adopt a program used in
San Diego, Calif.: to keep records of the race of the people
routinely stopped by police officers. This way actual statistical
tracking data will indicate whether racial profiling is being used
in traffic stops.
 &HT;    Of course racial profiling is not limited to traffic stops.
People of color are subject to racial profiling in every aspect of
criminal law. When a police report is released stating that a black
man is suspected of a crime, just about all black men are stopped
regardless of height, weight, hair texture or color, or whether
they fit the description at all.
 &HT;    Williams is not the only person to suggest that people of color
are more likely to engage in criminal activities. Many people think
that is the case even if they don't acknowledge it publically. And
therein lies the rub. People holding these beliefs become police
officers who are in the position to (consciously or unconsciously)
engage in racial profiling.
 &HT;    Although it is painful, I am glad when officials admit the
truth. But the discussion should go much further. There needs to be
a complete examination of all aspects of the so-called justice
system, beginning with the initial contacts police have with people
of color. It is only in this way that racism in criminal law can be
prevented.

 By CHRISTINE GRANADOS 
 c. 1999 Hispanic magazine 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Talk to any Latino actor and invariably the conversation turns
to typecasting. There isn't a working Hispanic actress in
Tinseltown, for instance, who hasn't been offered a role as a
prostitute, a maid, or a welfare mother.
 &HT;    Elizabeth Pena is no exception. The difference lies in how she
approaches such roles. ``We're showing more self-respect in the way
we handle roles and offers,'' Pena said in an interview with the
Los Angeles Times. ``I've seen actors fight to put flesh on roles,
refusing to play a cartoon character.''
 &HT;    For example, Pena, in her late 30s, beefed up her role as
Carmen, the Salvadoran maid in the 1986 comedy ``Down and Out in
Beverly Hills,'' with humor. She managed not to make a caricature
of the young Salvadoran illegal alien. She also gave an
unforgettable performance as Rosie, the abused wife of Richie
Valens' elder brother, in the 1987 crossover hit ``La Bamba.''
 &HT;    Since 1986, she has continued to win meatier roles. In 1990 she
played Jezebel, the alienated girlfriend of Tim Robbins in
``Jacob's Ladder.'' She appeared in ``The Waterdance,'' ``Across
the Moon,'' ``Dead Funny,'' and ``Vibes'' on the big screen.
 &HT;    Among her TV appearances, Pena portrayed Jinx on NBC's ``L.A.
Law'' and Mika Camarena in the Emmy-Award-winning NBC miniseries
``Drug Wars: The Camarena Story.''
 &HT;    In 1996 she landed the lead in the John Sayles film ``Lone
Star,'' a movie about the Texas border town of Frontera, where
Pena's character, Pilar Cruz, a high school history teacher,
rekindles an old flame with sheriff Sam Deeds, played by Chris
Cooper. Pena's and Cooper's characters embody the film's central
ideas about crossing borders, escaping the burden of history, and
challenging the past. Her portrayal of the strong, widowed, single
mother of two children won accolades and awards.
 &HT;    The Cuban American actress understood the Mexican American
character she would play in that movie and spent countless hours
listening to, recording and absorbing Mexican American and Mexican
culture for her role as Pilar.
 &HT;    ``I recorded people's voices to get the proper inflection. I
crossed the border to collect history,'' she told the Dallas
Morning News about her work in Eagle Pass, Texas, during the
filming of ``Lone Star.''
 &HT;    ``I would sit for hours looking at women, how they dressed. I
talked to people. I hung out. I shopped at stores to see what kind
of clothing was there and what food was eaten.'' That attention to
detail allows Pena to capture nuances of Hispanic roles that take
her far beyond stereotypes.
 &HT;    ``Honoring ourselves as human beings and becoming the best
actors is the way to succeed. Hollywood's notion of what roles we
can play will have to change,'' she told the Los Angeles Times last
year.
 &HT;    Today, Hispanic actresses are getting starring roles in
comedies, action adventure films, and dramas. Cameron Diaz starred
in ``There's Something About Mary,'' a mainstream box office hit
earning more than $130 million, while Jennifer Lopez played the
lead character in the action thriller ``Anaconda,'' which grossed
$16.1 million when it opened in 1997. Pena's starring role in the
popular independent film ``Lone Star'' won her the 1997 Independent
Spirit Award and the Bravo Award for Best Actress in a Film.
 &HT;    ``For a young actress, she has a rare maturity on screen,'' said
``Lone Star'' director Sayles about Pena. ``Perhaps it's a
confidence that comes from having been raised in the theater,'' he
added.
 &HT;    She comes by her talent for stage and screen naturally. Her
parents, Margarita and Mario Pena, founded and still run the
bilingual Latin American Theater Ensemble in New York. Her father
is an actor/writer/director and a three-time Fulbright Scholarship
recipient who travels the world helping start-up theater companies
similar to the one he and his wife founded.
 &HT;    Despite the fact that there were actors and directors in the
family, Pena still had a hard time convincing her mother that she
wanted to be an actress. When she was accepted to the New York High
School of Performing Arts, her mother said, ``If you become an
actress, you'll kill me.'' Pena was so determined that she replied,
according to People magazine, ``Well, you better start arranging
your funeral.''
 &HT;    The experience she gained watching her parents and performing on
stage at such a young age (she was 10 years old when she got her
first lead role) did not prepare her for the attitudes she would
face at the performing arts school. It wasn't until after she was
enrolled there that she felt the tinge of discrimination.
 &HT;    ``I was never, ever taught that there was a difference between a
black person, Jewish person, a Hispanic or Asian person. My parents
were not typical Cuban traditionalist parents, they were people in
the theater, people who traveled,'' she told People magazine in
1991.
 &HT;    She learned the difficult lesson of discrimination at the school
when ``all of a sudden I couldn't play Madge in `Picnic.' I'm going
`Why'?''' When she found out that it was because she wasn't from
Kansas, her first thought was, ``But that's why we're actors!''
 &HT;    Things have gotten better since then. In 1995 she played Kate
Haley, a marine mammal veterinarian, in ``Free Willy II,'' and more
recently she played a bomb squad expert in New Line Cinema's ``Rush
Hour,'' starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. The movie shows
Hollywood executives that an action/buddy movie without an Anglo
costar can cross over and be a box office success.
 &HT;    Pena has completed production on independent feature films
``Strangeland'' and ``The Pass'' and the Showtime movie ``Aldrich
Ames: America Betrayed,'' with Timothy Hutton. In the Showtime
original feature, Pena plays Rosario Ames, the wife of the CIA
agent who sold secrets to the Soviets.
 &HT;    Pena has had some experience with politics and secrecy. Although
she was born in Elizabeth, N.J. (for which she is named), she spent
eight years in her parents' native Cuba before immigrating to New
York. Her father was imprisoned for writing antigovernment poetry.
After talking his way out of prison, he fled back to the United
States, followed shortly afterward by then nine-year-old Elizabeth,
her sister, Tania, and her mother.
 &HT;    The five-foot-three actress has lived in the United States since
1968. She currently resides in Seattle with her husband, Hans
Rolla, a carpenter- contractor, and their daughter, Fiona, born in
1997.
 &HT;    Latinas are gaining ground in Hollywood, but the progress has by
no means been steady enough to keep up with the dramatic shift in
the Hispanic population of the United States. Pena says she gets
tired of hearing Latinos whine about typecasting.
 &HT;    ``The question of typecasting and lack of access is a big
yawn,'' she says. ``Every time we project ourselves as a victim,
the subliminal `them' keeps us stuck in that place.''
 &HT;    She admits that improvements for Hispanic actors are slight, but
she is optimistic, insisting, ``Revolutions happen one person at
time.''

detail allows Pena to capture nuances of Hispanic roles that take
her far beyond stereotypes.
 &HT;    ``Honoring ourselves as human beings and becoming the best
actors is the way to succeed. Hollywood's notion of what roles we
can play will have to change,'' she told the Los Angeles Times last
year.
 &HT;    Today, Hispanic actresses are getting starring roles in
comedies, action adventure films, and dramas. Cameron Diaz starred
in ``There's Something About Mary,'' a mainstream box office hit
earning more than $130 million, while Jennifer Lopez played the
lead character in the action thriller ``Anaconda,'' which grossed
$16.1 millin when it opened in 1997. Pena's starring role in the
popular independent film ``Lone Star'' won her the 1997 Independent
Spirit Award and the Bravo Award for Best Actress in a Film.
 &HT;    ``For a young actress, she has a rare maturity on sceen,'' said
``Lone Star'' director Sayles about Pena. ``Perhaps it's a
confidence that comes from having been raised in the theater,'' he
added.
 &HT;    She comes by her talent for stage and screen naturally. Her
parents, Margarita and Mario Pena, founded and still run the
bilingual Latin American Theater Ensemble in New York. Her father
is an actor/writer/director and a three-time Fulbright Scholarship
recipient who travels the world helping start-up theater companies
similar to the one he and his wife founded.
 &HT;    Despite the fact that there were actors and directors in the
family, Pena still had a hard time convincing her mother that she
wanted to be an actress. When she was accepted to the New York High
School of Performing Arts, her mother said, ``If you become an
actress, you'll kill me.'' Pena was so determined that she replied,
according to People magazine, ``Well, you better start arranging
your funeral.''
 &HT;    The experience she gained watching her parents and performing on
stage at such a young age (she was 10 years old when she got her
first lead role) did not prepare her for the attitudes she would
face at the performing arts school. It wasn't until after she was
enrolled there that she felt the tinge of discrimination.
 &HT;    ``I was never, ever taught that there was a difference between a
black person, Jewish person, a Hispanic or Asian person. My parents
were not typical Cuban traditionalist parents, they were people in
the theater, people who traveled,'' she told People magazine in
1991.
 &HT;    She learned the difficult lesson of discrimination at the school
when ``all of a sudden I couldn't play Madge in `Picnic.' I'm going
`Why'?''' When she found out that it was because she wasn't from
Kansas, her first thought was, ``But that's why we're actors!''
 &HT;    Things have gotten better since then. In 1995 she played Kate
Haley, a marine mammal veterinarian, in ``Free Willy II,'' and more
recently she played a bomb squad expert in New Line Cinema's ``Rush
Hour,'' starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. The movie shows
Hollywood executives that an action/buddy movie without an Anglo
costar can cross over and be a box office success.
 &HT;    Pena has completed production on independent feature films
``Strangeland'' and ``The Pass'' and the Showtime movie ``Aldrich
Ames: America Betrayed,'' with Timothy Hutton. In the Showtime
original feature, Pena plays Rosario Ames, the wife of the CIA
agent who sold secrets to the Soviets.
 &HT;    Pena has had some experience with politics and secrecy. Although
she was born in Elizabeth, N.J. (for which she is named), she spent
eight years in her parents' native Cuba before immigrating to New
York. Her father was imprisoned for writing antigovernment poetry.
After talking his way out of prison, he fled back to the United
States, followed shortly afterward by then nine-year-old Elizabeth,
her sister, Tania, and her mother.
 &HT;    The five-foot-three actress has lived in the United States since
1968. She currently resides in Seattle with her husband, Hans
Rolla, a carpenter- contractor, and their daughter, Fiona, born in
1997.
 &HT;    Latinas are gaining ground in Hollywood, but the progress has by
no means been steady enough to keep up with the dramatic shift in
the Hispanic population of the United States. Pena says she gets
tired of hearing Latinos whine about typecasting.
 &HT;    ``The question of typecasting and lack of access is a big
yawn,'' she says. ``Every time we project ourselves as a victim,
the subliminal `them' keeps us stuck in that place.''
 &HT;    She admits that improvements for Hispanic actors are slight, but
she is optimistic, insisting, ``Revolutions happen one person at
time.''

   CHURCH FINDS ITS CALLING IN CHILDREN. Christ United Methodist
Church in Gainesville, Fla., was surrounded in the 1960s by a
blue-collar white community. ``Today, it is mostly black and
poor,'' reports columnist Bill Maxwell. The average age of the
congregation _ white, except for two black members _ is 65,
compared to 30 for area residents. So, what should their role be,
church members wondered. The answer: Prime Time, the church's
unique after-school program. Offering music, art, academic tutoring
and field trips, it is free of charge to the neighborhood's
kindergarten and elementary school children _ ``who love
attending,'' adds Maxwell.

   A WAY TO REPAIR THE GREAT INJUSTICE TO THE GREAT SIOUX NATION.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 19 years ago in the case of the Black
Hills Claims suit that these lands were taken from the Great Sioux
Nation illegally. The awarded money, held in trust since then, has
grown to nearly $600 million, but the impoverished Sioux refuse to
accept it, writes columnist Tim Giago. They simply ask that a small
portion of the land _ 1.3 million acres (unoccupied U.S. Forest
land) of the total 7.3 million _ be returned to them to be used as
a Great Sioux Nation National Park. ``History judges great nations
by how they treat their indigenous people. How will history judge

Some 350 United Methodist ministers have pledged to continue to
perform same-sex commitment ceremonies _ defying church law banning
homosexual unions, reports columnist Chuck Colbert. If church
officials choose to put them on trial, the United Methodist Church
will incur enormous costs and cause serious, perhaps irreparable,

``there is an even more serious theological crisis when rigid
adherence to church law takes precedence over the Gospel teachings

SKETCH OF 2 YOUTHS: CONTRADICTIONS AND CONFUSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

   LITTLETON, Colo. _ It was just 11 weeks ago that a court officer
released Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold early from a juvenile
diversion program, saying they had learned the intended lessons in
the months since their arrest and had promising futures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric is a very bright young man who is likely to succeed in
life,'' the officer wrote in a report made public here on Thursday.
``He is intelligent enough to achieve lofty goals as long as he
stays on task and remains motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Klebold, the officer said, ``He is intelligent enough to make
any dream a reality, but he needs to understand hard work is part
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Who could predict that the two high school seniors would move
from minor charges of criminal mischief, theft and trespass to
masterminding one of the worst school massacres in the nation's
history, killing a dozen schoolmates and a teacher before turning
the guns on themselves?
</P>
<P>
   As more bombs were discovered at Columbine High School and names
of the dead were made public on Thursday, the families and closest
friends of the two responsible for the carnage remained in
seclusion. But a fuller portrait of the two perpetrators and their
families is beginning to emerge, and it is filled with
contradictions and confusion.
</P>
<P>
   The killers, who targeted athletes, both had done well in Little
League, teammates said; Harris was fond of wearing a Colorado
Rockies cap before he moved to this Denver suburb from Plattsburgh,
N.Y. They were said to hate minorities, but in Plattsburgh, Harris'
best friends were black and Asian.
</P>
<P>
   In Littleton, their only scrape with the law was the March 1998
arrest that resulted in the juvenile diversion program. They held
jobs at a local pizza place, and a Saturday night out was likely to
be at the Rock `N' Bowl at Belleview Lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Many students recalled nasty interactions in which the young men
insulted and threatened classmates or even flashed weapons; many
others, though, recalled quiet, shy teen-agers who played cards in
the lunchroom and offered to help others make videos or use
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Any warning signs seemed hidden under the black trench coats
they wore, regardless of the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, they dressed a little differently, maybe they dressed in
black, but so, what do priests dress in?'' asked John Adams, whose
daughter was friends with Klebold and often had him over to watch
movies or play computer games. ``Are priests anarchists, do they
blow up things? It's just people trying to set other people apart
because they're different. That's why we have so many of the
problems in this world, because we try to set ourselves apart or
set ourselves above.''
</P>
<P>
   The court officer, whose name was blacked out in the documents,
said Harris ``excelled in school'' and enjoyed an anger management
program that seemed to dovetail with his individual counseling; for
Klebold, the officer said, the 45 hours of community service were
the most effective, as ``he learned a lot from having to give up
free time to work for no money.''
</P>
<P>
   The boys tested negative for drugs, and paid their fees on time.
They wrote letters of apology, and took an ethics class. Harris was
described as ``very articulate and intelligent,'' Klebold as
someone ``with a great deal of potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenny La Plante, a senior who took an early morning bowling
class with both young men, recalled Klebold's tiny gesture of
rebellion: tossing the ball shotput-style from his chest down the
lanes, which annoyed the teacher and the alley management. Harris,
she said, was a star last semester in Composition for the College
Bound. ``He was one of the smartest kids in our class,'' she said.
``He always knew the answers, whether it was a passage from
Shakespeare or a prepositional phrase.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Denver Post reported Thursday that the two young men had
made a video in a production class that showed people in trench
coats gunning down athletes in the school hallways, and were upset
when they were not allowed to show it to classmates. Andrew Breed
and Peter Maher, 17-year-old juniors at Columbine, said they, too,
glimpsed the darker side.
</P>
<P>
   Last July 4th, Breed and Maher said they ran into the two young
men as well as others in the trench coat mafia at a 7-Eleven.
Someone tossed a donut and some biting insults at the crowd with
Harris and Klebold. As they drove away, Maher said he saw someone
in a trench coat waving a pistol-grip shotgun in the air.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, the two groups met again at a nearby
fireworks stand, Breed and Maher said, and the youths in trench
coats were shouting at them in German. Maher said that Harris held
a foot-long lead pipe by his side and another student, who was
questioned after Tuesday's massacre but released, pulled out a
knife.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people at the school get into fights, they throw a few
punches and it's broken up, but no, they wanted to put us in the
hospital,'' Breed recalled. ``I was going to beat the crap out of
him, but then I'm glad I didn't because I would have probably been
the target. They would probably have been looking for me on this
day, so I'm glad I didn't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Breed said he has known Klebold since they were on the same
baseball team in first grade. But this year, Breed said, if someone
bumped into Klebold in the hallway, he would say, ``I'll kill
you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a normal kid,'' Breed said. ``I don't know what
happened. He turned into a nutcase.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Harris and Klebold come from middle-class families. Dylan's
father, Thomas, is a retired geologist who now runs a real estate
company from his home. His mother, Susan, works in the local
community college system, counseling disabled students, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I can tell, this family was utterly, utterly
normal,'' Michael Briand, a colleague of Klebold's mother, told The
Associated Press. ``They did everything right. But somehow the pain
and anger was too deep, and they didn't see it or couldn't reach
it. This has got to be a pervasive thing in our society if it can
reach this far, into families like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris' father, Wayne, is a decorated Air Force pilot who
retired as a major after 20 years of service in 1993, and now works
in the administration at Flight Safety Services, a pilot training
school in Englewood, not far from here.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Katherine, works at a catering service in town and
his older brother, Kevin, is a student at the University of
Colorado in Boulder. Scott Berg, a sophomore at the university who
also attended Columbine, said Kevin Harris is ``just the sort of
guy his brother was gunning for.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kevin Harris was an honor student and played tight end for the
Columbine Rebels, Berg said, and Harris' mother went to all the
games, even when their son was only on junior varsity. Berg's
younger brother Steve, an athlete at Columbine, said he recently
confronted Harris during bowling class.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother's Jewish, and this whole Naziism thing really
bothered him,'' Scott Berg said. ``So he went up to these guys and
said, what's with all this German stuff.''

AFTER 16 YEARS IN PRISON, TONY AYALA EYES RING AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The conversation, naturally enough, gravitates toward boxing.
Tony Ayala Jr., after all, is a boxer.
</P>
<P>
   Or he was a boxer, before that horrible night 16 years ago in
Paterson, N.J., when, high on heroin and alcohol, he went to the
home of a female neighbor and raped her.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio native was a skilled boxer with powerful,
lightning-quick hands. Even as a 19-year-old, he was the top-ranked
junior middleweight of the day, with a sparkling 22-0 record and 19
knockouts. He looked powerful in such fights as the battering of
Curtis Ramsey on June 26, 1982, at Will Rogers Memorial Coliseum in
Fort Worth. He was headed for a title bout, and stardom.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing skills and fame couldn't help him in the courtroom,
though. Ayala, already on probation for beating a woman at a San
Antonio drive-in theater in 1980 and for breaking into a San
Antonio home, was sentenced to 35 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ayala wants to be a boxer again.
</P>
<P>
   He was released from a New Jersey prison on Tuesday after 16
years behind bars, out early because of good behavior. Even though
he is 36, and even though he hasn't fought as a professional since
he was 19, he is talking about a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, boxing was the first topic he discussed yesterday during a
news conference that Fort Worth promoter Lester Bedford put
together in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't, however, the most important thing on Ayala's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep talking about comebacks and we keep talking about
boxing, but the crime itself and the fact that out there, there is
still a victim, that's not forgotten,'' Ayala said. ``It will never
be forgotten by me. While others may judge me as a fighter and
judge my life depending on what I do in the ring, my view of it is
totally different.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tony Ayala Jr. who went to prison was young, reckless and
out of control, tormented, he said, by demons caused by being
sexually abused as a youngster by a male friend of the family, and
exacerbated by drugs and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a wreck,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, I victimized an
innocent person. That is never lost on me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tony Ayala Jr. who was released on Tuesday, knows that he is
not the victim in this sorry saga. He sounds like a changed man.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are measuring the success of my life on
whether or not my comeback in boxing is a success,'' he said. ``The
fact is, I feel personally that I've already reached a level of
success in that I'm not out of control, that I've gained insights
about how I was, that I don't have the desire to go out and drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quote, unquote normal. I feel good and happy and fulfilled
without the need of chemicals in my system.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala began to change when he started visiting prison
psychologist Brian Raditz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to the conclusion that I had to resolve the issues that
were tearing me apart, that had gotten me in prison,'' Ayala said.
``I had to find out why I had committed such a horrible crime, and
I had to find out whether or not I was just an animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Raditz, who now is Ayala's manager and adviser, saw a man who
wanted to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 21 years I've treated thousands of patients, and never have
I seen anyone work as hard on himself as Tony did,'' Raditz said.
``He unmasked a lot of his fears, his hurts. He got a great handle
on himself and developed significant insights.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala became a peer counselor in the prison system. In the past
couple of years, he gave seminars to groups that were brought into
the jail, including students from nearby schools.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to continue that kind of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very much interested in sharing my experiences with kids,
how I got to that point in my life, in the hopes that it could
change a few lives around,'' he said. ``Do I believe that I'm a
savior? No, I do not. Do I believe that every person who hears my
story will decide to settle down and make the right choices? No, I
do not. But if I can help one, there's one life that won't have to
experience the sadness and the shame and the remorse that I've had
to. In doing so, maybe something positive will have turned out of
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, Ayala is a boxer again.
</P>
<P>
   The man-child was in line to fight the best of his day, to take
on Roberto Duran, Thomas Hearns, Sugar Ray Leonard and Marvin
Hagler.
</P>
<P>
   The man wants to see if that talent is still there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a personal thing,'' he said. ``I ruined my career. I have
been compared to some great, great fighters. I don't know if I
belong with that category, and this is an opportunity I will never
get again in life. The window of this opportunity is very small.
I'm 36 years old. If I do make a comeback, and if it is in any way,
shape or form successful, it has to be done quickly. Time is not on
my side.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Sr. will, as before, be his trainer, primarily at his San
Antonio gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will come into the gym, work six rounds at a time, work on
the little things that he missed while he was incarcerated, and
mostly mentally get focused on fighting again,'' Ayala Sr. said.
``Four to six weeks after he's been in the gym, he'll start
sparring again and go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala Jr. is ready to take on ``every top dog out there.'' But
even if he's no longer good enough to climb into the ring with the
likes of Oscar de la Hoya, there's money to be made fighting
what-might-have-been bouts against Duran and Hearns.
</P>
<P>
   But, he insists, this really isn't about fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it's much more than boxing,'' he said. ``I'm recognizing
things. The most important thing is my adjustment back into the
real world.''

 &HT;    Vets' views shaped by Vietnam experience
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Then a young ROTC recruit enthusiastic about the
war in Vietnam, Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.) recalls the moment in 1965
when Marines were deployed to provide defensive ``support'' for
U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the Marines were frontline soldiers. Two years
after that, Cleland, then a young Army captain, helicoptered into
Vietnam to help break a siege of 5,000 Marines trapped by enemy
forces. A grenade explosion on that mission almost killed Cleland,
blowing off both legs and an arm.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Cleland looks at the 2,200 Marines on a ship in the
Adriatic Sea off the Balkans, sent to provide ``support'' to
helicopter units in Albania, and is reminded of those first Marines
sent to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're slipping into a ground war,'' Cleland warns.
</P>
<P>
   As a Navy pilot stationed on an aircraft carrier off Vietnam,
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) watched Soviet ships unload missiles and
transport them to Vietnamese planes. Then he would shake his head
in disgust. U.S. pilots were under orders from Washington not to
hit the Soviet ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the strategy that's being employed has some parallels
to Vietnam: graduated escalation, reliance on air power,
politicians choosing targets,'' says McCain, a Republican
presidential candidate. ``Those things have some haunting
reminiscences.''
</P>
<P>
   As the conflict in Kosovo wears on, both Cleland and McCain have
emerged as some of the toughest critics of the administration's
military policy in the Balkans. Cleland advocates an end to the air
war and a cease-fire. McCain wants a massive ground force to
overwhelm Serbia and win the war quickly.
</P>
<P>
   To varying degrees, both have shaped their views of the Kosovo
crisis based on their experiences in Vietnam 30 years ago. For the
Senate's three other wounded Vietnam veterans, the war's lessons
have also served as warning markers for U.S. involvement in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) echoes McCain in calling for a ground
war option in Kosovo. Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) supports the air
strikes and believes the United States should at least prepare for
the possibility of a ground war. Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.), like
Cleland, firmly opposes ground troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For each of these men, Vietnam was a defining moment. They lived
a ground war. They saw the costs of war. And, through luck and
grit, they lived to tell about it.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, shot down over Vietnam in 1967, survived 5 1/2 years of
torture at the hands of his captors, enduring repeated beatings,
isolation and inhuman living conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Hagel, a highly decorated Army sergeant, was wounded twice,
first when a booby-trap mine ripped a hole in his chest and later
when his vehicle was incinerated, nearly burning him and his
brother alive.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey, a recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor and a
former Navy Seal, lost his leg to a grenade in an assault on a
Vietnamese camp in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, a Navy gunboat commander, was wounded three times in
ambushes in and around Vietnam's Mekong Delta.
</P>
<P>
   They differ about what to do in Kosovo. But they share a deep
distrust of politicians conducting wars and a powerful skepticism
about the ability of bombing alone to defeat an enemy.
</P>
<P>
   They also all subscribe to the military doctrine articulated by
another Vietnam veteran, Gen. Colin Powell, that wars are won with
a massive deployment of force in the shortest possible amount of
time.
</P>
<P>
   Hagel refers repeatedly to the so-called Powell doctrine in
explaining his demand for a ground war option in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't engage your military for whatever objective unless
you are prepared to do what it takes to win,'' says Hagel, a member
of the Foreign Relations Committee. ``We're not doing that in
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   For Cleland, American policy in Vietnam never had a clear
objective and never had an exit strategy. He finds neither in
American policy in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two things a Vietnam veteran fears the most in terms of
military engagement anywhere in the world is, number one, no win,
and, number two, no exit,'' Cleland says. ``When you combine both
of them, a Vietnam guy like me goes nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, who became an anti-Vietnam war protester when he returned
from combat duty, says he sees some of the same ``political
committee management'' of the war in Kosovo that he saw as a
soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry says he wants a better defined mission that holds out the
threat of a ground war to bring maximum pressure on Yugoslav leader
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important to send every clear message possible to
someone like Milosevic,'' says Kerry, a member of the Foreign
Relations Committee. ``Some of the messages, frankly, have been
less than clear.''
</P>
<P>
   After Vietnam, Kerrey said he made a promise to himself never to
allow personal politics to influence decisions about war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politicians were afraid to change their views because they
didn't want to lose credibility,'' he says. ``And while they were
satisfying that desire not to lose credibility, we were losing our
lives and our health.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey, the ranking member of the Select Committee on
Intelligence, says the Kosovo conflict is less vital to U.S.
interests than threats from North Korea and Iraq. He is opposed to
U.S. ground troops in Kosovo and, like Cleland, says the
effectiveness of the air strikes may be coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vietnamese defeated us with truncheon tools,'' he says. If
the Serbs ``have the will to fight, they will survive as well.

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The collective-bargaining agreement reached last week between the
Women's National Basketball Association and its players' union has
fallen apart, postponing Tuesday's draft and making the 1999 season
an ``all-or-nothing'' proposition, league president Val Ackerman
said Thursday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We had hoped to announce the signing of the WNBA's first
collective-bargaining agreement,'' she said. ``There is no deal,
and we have no choice but to postpone the draft indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   Further talks between the two sides have not been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   When Ackerman announced last week's accord, she called it a
landmark proposition for women's professional basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was established as the deadline for obtaining the
majority vote from the union's 122 players needed for ratification.
Although that was thought to have been a formality, talks broke
down Wednesday night when several new issues were brought to the
table.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman said the union is trying to renegotiate minimum
salaries for rookies, the sliding rookie pay scale, and player
bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's National Basketball Players Association, she said,
also seeks to limit the number of public player appearances, a move
that could damage the community-friendly image the league has
fostered during its two years of existence.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the WNBPA were unavailable for comment Thursday.
But in a prepared statement released by union director Pam Wheeler,
blame for the 11th-hour breakdown was placed on the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, the league officials are trying to intimidate the women
into signing a document that contains terms far more onerous than
anything we shook hands on last week,'' Wheeler's statement said.
``Among other things, we are being asked to sign away virtually any
meaningful right a woman may have to market her own personal image,
and accept a wage freeze for the next four classes of rookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition, those veteran players who are joining our
bargaining unit from the ABL (the defunct American Basketball
League) are being asked to come in the league as `rookies,' hereby
giving up any right they may have to engage in individual salary
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share in the disappointment of the college players and
former ABL players who have been affected by this capricious action
by the WNBA, and hope to get things back on track as soon as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 14, the league and the union, which has been in place
only since last fall, reached agreement in principle on a four-year
contract.
</P>
<P>
   It included increases in the minimum salary from $15,000 to
$30,000 for veterans and $25,000 for rookies. Those figures would
rise to $40,000 and $30,000, respectively, by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the benefits package were a year-round health and
dental plan, a 401(k) retirement plan, maternity leave and life
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the groundwork was laid for four expansion teams to begin
competition in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Every day the ratification and signing process is delayed,
Ackerman said, increases the amount of work that must be completed
in a given time frame to facilitate the start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our vision, our hope, always was that we would have a deal
before the season,'' Ackerman said. ``We accept that this is a
funny year with everything that's happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``But nonetheless, and in the course of bargaining, we had tried
very hard to make the point (to the union) that we didn't have a
lot of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the same sort of luxury that a league such as
the NBA has to postpone things. For us, it's really all or nothing.
There won't be a delay to the start of our season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It either happens, or it doesn't happen. We're not in a
position where we can start three weeks late. That won't happen. We
either start on time or it won't start at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman said when, or if, the draft takes place is contingent
upon reaching a new accord.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 season is scheduled to begin June 10.

CAN'T WIN REVOLUTION WITH SHOOTOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fans in New England last Saturday chanted, ``No more
shootouts,'' as the Revolution lost to Columbus. It was its third
shootout loss in four games.
</P>
<P>
   The first four Galaxy games also ended in shootouts. And all
four of San Jose's wins this season have come in shootouts.
</P>
<P>
   It seems the shootout becomes an issue every year. Fifteen MLS
games have been decided in such fashion this season _ and something
has to give, if you listen to the coaches and players.
</P>
<P>
   The shootout, adopted by the now defunct North American Soccer
League in the 1970s, is a corny method of deciding draws. There's
nothing traditional about it. And it's no big deal during the
regular season for a league that takes excitement where it can be
found.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, the shootout isn't hurting teams in the standings.
Teams get a victory, but the win is worth only a point.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose and Chicago are both 4-1. But all of Chicago's wins
have come in regulation while all of San Jose's have come under the
shootout clock. The Fire leads the Clash 12-4 in points, which is
the only thing that really matters.
</P>
<P>
   Fans might boo the shootout once in a while, but I've never seen
a fan get up and leave before the shootout decided a game. Most of
the time it's a delight for fans who have been bored by a scoreless
draw.
</P>
<P>
   Still, under pressure from coaches and management, MLS
commissioner Doug Logan was asked this week whether the shootout
will remain in the league's plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the day coming where our competition committee goes a
different way in determining the outcome of the games,'' said
Logan. ``I maintain that (the shootout) is exciting for our fans
and discourages the number of draws. If we did not have the
shootout, the subject matter today would be, `Why are we having so
many draws?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Most casual fans and general sports fans favor games in which
there is an outcome. That's a fact of life. There is a balance to
weigh, but this is a wasted exercise unless MLS becomes a good
business. We have to do things that would not be detrimental to us
as a business.''
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with the shootout system is during the
playoffs, when the points system is thrown out the window. Only
wins (shootouts included) count in the three-game playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   This means less-talented visiting teams play more defensive
soccer, hoping to steal a victory via shootout on the road. It's
unfair to decide a playoff game in this manner. If anything, MLS
has two alternatives. It could learn from hockey and continue to
play in a sudden-death format until a team scores. There is nothing
as exciting as sudden-death playoff hockey.
</P>
<P>
   It could also use the aggregate system used by many other soccer
leagues. Under this system, draws count and the team with the best
record and goal differential at the end of a series advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion to improve the soccer is that we need to learn from
Europe,'' said New England player-coach Walter Zenga. ``If I want
to learn about basketball, I go to the United States. If I want to
learn about soccer, I go to Italy or Germany or Europe or Argentina
or Brazil.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Wild and wacky: It has been a crazy week around the MLS.
Kansas City coach Ron Newman, the winningest coach in U.S. soccer
history, resigned after the Wizards' 0-4 start. He was under heavy
criticism from goalkeeper Tony Meola.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian Carlos Valderrama, one of the best playmakers in the
league, was benched by Miami coach Ivo Wortman and is rumored to be
on the trading block.
</P>
<P>
   And in Chicago, the reigning MLS champions played their season
opener on a spray-painted Soldier Field against Dallas. The field
was in such horrible shape, Logan almost tripped during the pregame
festivities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed. I almost sprained my ankle during the ring
ceremony,'' Logan said. ``. . . I was very disturbed. (Soldier
Field is) not holding up (its) end of the bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To call that a soccer field, that's pretty embarrassing,''
Dallas coach Dave Dir told the Chicago Tribune. ``It's the worst
thing I've ever played on _ worse than any high school field, worse
than any club field. It's an embarrassment to Chicago that the
champions of the league have to play on it.''

inadequate pay increases during the past six years. For four of the

STUDENTS INTENDED TO BLOW UP SCHOOL, SHERIFF SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for addition; final eight grafs are new.)

<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Bomb squads on Thursday found a large
home-made bomb made from two propane tanks and a gasoline canister
at Columbine High School, leading the sheriff here to conclude that
two students were out to ``destroy the school'' on Tuesday when
they launched a murderous rampage that left 15 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery also heightened a growing belief that the two
young men who stormed the school firing shotguns and tossing pipe
bombs before taking their own lives had help from others in
planning for the attack, said the Jefferson County sheriff, John P.
Stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were going to burn the school up,'' said Stone, adding
that at least 32 explosive devices and several weapons have now
been found at the scene. The authorities have conducted interviews
with several students at the school who belonged to the group
informally known as the trench coat mafia, to which the two dead
youths belonged, and some members have been given polygraph tests.
So far, there have been no arrests, an investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to piece together the students' motivations and the
extent of preparations for the assault, the investigators have
seized hand-written notes and a short videotape that the two boys,
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, made last fall for a video
production class. Some students have described the video as a
macabre preview of the attack in which trenchcoat-clad students gun
down others who take the role of popular athletes at the school,
though the school district here declined on Thursday to make any
comment on such a video.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators also said on Thursday that they believed at
least some of the weapons used in Tuesday's attack may have been
stolen, although they are not sure when. The pair were armed with
shotguns whose stocks had been sawed off, a semiautomatic rifle and
pistol and a handgun.
</P>
<P>
   As local sherriff's department officers and federal law
enforcement officials carried out an investigation they estimated
could take weeks, the mourning for the dead continued for another
day.
</P>
<P>
   Under a spring storm that alternated between snow and rain,
students came to the school grounds on Thursday to be together and
leave offerings at makeshift memorials that have grown 2{ feet high
with flowers in places. But many also questioned whether they would
ever want to set foot inside Columbine High again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our friends died in there,'' said Dave Beadey, a 17-year-old
junior. ``Even if they cleaned it all up, you'd always know that
you were sitting in a place where people got killed. They should
just tear it all down and put up a new school someplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   The superintendent of the Jefferson County School District, Jane
Hammond, said on Thursday that the high school would remain closed
for the rest of this school year, and that school officials were
trying to find a place where Columbine's nearly 2,000 students
could finish the year. Students and teachers alike, Dr. Hammond
said, had implored them to find a place where they could all do so
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want them separated into different settings,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The horrific assault Tuesday continued to prompt sorrow and
soul-searching around the nation, but it also seemed to have
inspired threats of copycat incidents that led the authorities at
schools in at least three states _ California, Texas and
Pennsylvania _ to issue warnings or evacuate schools on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In Wylie, Texas, just northeast of Dallas, a ``profane and
threatening'' statement was found written on a wall of the
intermediate school, the police there said, prompting nearly all
parents to take their children out of the school.
</P>
<P>
   In Pleasant Hill, Calif., about 25 miles east of San Francisco,
College Park High School was evacuated and a bomb squad called in
after a package resembling a bomb was discovered on school grounds.
</P>
<P>
   And in Newtown, Pa., Council Rock High School will be closed
Friday because of ``unsubstantiated rumors circulating in the high
school that contained the threat of potential violence,'' the
principal, David Yates, said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado Springs, Colo., about 60 miles south of Denver, four
teen-agers were charged with trespassing after they arrived at
school in trench coats and masks in an apparent prank.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb found in the kitchen of Columbine High School on
Thursday was made from two 20-pound propane tanks similar to those
used with household grills, along with a gasoline-filled cannister,
which could have caused ``an extensive amount of damage'' had they
been detonated, Sgt. Jim Parr of the Jefferson County sheriff's
office said at a news briefing Thursday night. And Parr held out
the possibility that still more explosive devices could be found as
investigators conduct an ``inch by inch'' search of the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say that all the bombs are out of the
school,'' he said. ``It's a very large building.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Thursday, Stone said that so much explosive material
had been found that the authorities believed there was a good
chance that other people were involved in the deadly attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's drawing suspicion out here that they would have time to
put as much ordnance in that school as they did without some
help,'' the sheriff said.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb was found in a large duffel bag hidden in the kitchen
and was attached to what might have been a remote-controlled
detonation device, an official in the sheriff's office said
Thursday night. It was equipped with nails, BBs and broken glass
intended as shrapnel and, had it been activated during the busy
lunch hour, could have killed scores of people in the kitchen and
adjoining cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of so much powerful explosive material indicated
that the suspects were intent on trying to blow up Columbine High,
said Stone. ``These subjects were not only on a killing rampage,
but they were going to destroy the school.''
</P>
<P>
   While their full motivation remained a mystery, the hatred felt
by the two youths appears in part to have been a grotesque
extension of a long-running feud that members of the trenchcoat
mafia had with more popular cliques at the school, known as
``jocks'' and ``preps.'' New details emerged on Thursday of the
feud, including descriptions by some students of the taunting the
``jocks'' directed at the less-popular students, and of a
near-brawl last summer that started when one member of the
trenchcoat mafia is said to have flashed a shotgun near a local
park.
</P>
<P>
   According to these descriptions, both groups were verbally
abusive, the jocks sometimes referring to the others in derogatory
homosexual terms and the outcast group sometimes invoking Nazi
terminology and threatening to unleash violence at the school.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the students interviewed in the past few days have
insisted that as nasty as this adolescent feud could be, there was
never any widespread fear that it could lead to the kind of horror
unleashed here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, it was just like it must be at every other high school
in America,'' said Breanna Cook, a 17-year-old junior. ``You know,
kids can be really mean to each other, really cruel. It's always
been that way. But you don't expect it to all turn into a real
war.''
</P>
<P>
   And no one seemed to know how the weapons and explosive material
got into the school. ``No one saw them carry it into the school and
people did see them enter,'' Jefferson County District Attorney
David Thomas said Thursday, referring to the bomb discovered in the
kitchen. ``So we have to explore how that device got into the
school.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 people were injured by bullets or shrapnel in the
attack on Tuesday and of these, 14 remain hospitalized, with eight
listed in critical or serious condition.

   WASHINGTON _ A generation ago, John Kerry, a decorated Navy
lieutenant, came home to lead protests against the Vietnam War that
he had served in. Max Cleland, a young Army captain, lost his legs
and an arm when he reached for a loose grenade that exploded. Chuck
Hagel, an Army sergeant, was wounded alongside his brother. John
McCain, a Navy pilot, was shot down, imprisoned and tortured in
Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   Now as Congress grapples with Kosovo, and Vietnam-era words and
phrases like ``quagmire'' and ``fighting with one hand tied behind
the back'' resonate once again, these Vietnam combat veterans in
the Senate and two more _ Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Charles Robb
of Virginia _ speak with the special authority of experience. But
the vexing questions of this war have pulled them in different
directions.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, R-Ariz., who is seeking his party's presidential
nomination, has been perhaps the most vocal and influential
congressional hawk, urging the administration to fight to win in
Kosovo. He said he thought Vietnam had taught the nation the danger
of waging war with too many constraints.
</P>
<P>
   But Cleland, D-Ga., said it was time for a cease-fire and an
exit strategy. ``I don't think there is a military solution in
Kosovo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to force a debate that the congressional leadership has
sought to avoid, McCain has introduced a resolution that would pave
the way for ground troops by authorizing President Clinton to
employ ``all necessary force'' against Yugoslavia. Three of
McCain's fellow Vietnam veterans stand with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the lessons of Vietnam is: if you are going to send
American forces into harm's way, you don't do it in a limited
way,'' Kerry, D-Mass., said. ``You don't do it tying hands behind
your back ahead of time. You don't ask people to give their lives
for something less than the prospect of success.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kerrey. D-Neb., a Medal of Honor winner who lost his leg in
Vietnam, and Cleland think unbridled escalation of the Yugoslav
conflict without public support could turn it into another Vietnam.
Cleland compared McCain's measure with the Tonkin Gulf resolution
of 1964 that gave the president authority to take ``all necessary
steps'' in Southeast Asia. The war quickly grew until 550,000
American troops were there by 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not,'' Cleland said, ``going to vote as a U.S. senator
for my generation's version of a Gulf of Tonkin resolution, which
has come to mean an open-ended, ill-defined conflict in which you
commit Americans, particularly on the ground, and get a bunch of
people killed and argue about why they were there later.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain complained of ``this kind of optimistic rosy scenario
that is so harmful in the long run to the credibility of the
government.'' He compared the daily pronouncements from NATO of
bridges destroyed and targets hit in Belgrade with the optimistic _
and discredited _ Pentagon briefings in Saigon that came to be
known derisively as the ``five o'clock follies.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleland bristles at what he sees as ``mission creep, war by
increments, war by committee.'' That, he says, leads to
``open-ended ill-defined conflict where you have a strategy for
neither victory nor exit.''
</P>
<P>
   The senators who want to open the door to ground troops still
say air power, diplomacy and the threat of a ground war may yet
force Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to negotiate. But
McCain also bluntly says that should the air campaign fail, 60,000
to 70,000 troops may be needed to drive the Serbs from Kosovo and
return the ethnic Albanians refugees home under NATO protection.
``The bulk of it would have to be the United States,'' he said
quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey, by contrast, said a ground war ``raises the price tag
beyond what I think this operation is worth'' and beyond what the
American people would support. ``Americans care deeply about the
humanitarian crisis and are willing to spend the time and money
necessary to help the refugees,'' he said, ``but to fight and
retake the land called Kosovo and drive the Serbs out? I doubt that
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is not surprising that these six men cannot take the
same side. But the division is poignant because the six say they
have developed an unusual bond and sometimes quite consciously try
to stand together on matters related to Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Hagel said that the six keep an eye on one another's positions,
even though they range from liberal to conservative. ``If one of us
is too far out and maybe somewhere where the others aren't, you
kind of wonder why,'' Hagel said.
</P>
<P>
   Robb, a Democrat, remembers when, as governor of Virginia, he
was the only Vietnam combat veteran who was a governor. Then he
learned of another combat veteran and Democrat _ Kerrey _ running
for governor of Nebraska. He sought him out to campaign for him.
``We have been close for a long period of time,'' Robb said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry and McCain in particular have had to overcome the
divisions of Vietnam to become close friends. As an anti-war
protester in 1971, Kerry led veterans in a demonstration at the
Capitol where they threw away their medals. McCain heard about the
protest while still locked away in the notorious Hoa Lo prison.
</P>
<P>
   Even years later, McCain said, Kerry's action still was
offensive. ``It didn't mean there was an adversarial
relationship,'' he said. ``There was a certain distance between
us.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1991, they sat across from each other on a military
transport plane flying a congressional delegation to Kuwait after
the Gulf War. They talked about Vietnam through the night.
</P>
<P>
   That conversation never stopped. Together they investigated
whether there were still missing prisoners of war in Vietnam. In
1993, their mission took them to the Hanoi prison where McCain had
spent most of his nearly six years in captivity. The senators
visited McCain's cell.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry described that moment as ``this eerie remarkable
experience of standing in this place where he wondered whether he
would ever come out alive.'' McCain this week had to struggle to
control his emotions as he tried to give his own account of that
visit to the prison. ``Now they've torn it down,'' he finally said.

LAWSUIT ALLEGES COCA-COLA DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BLACK EMPLOYEES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A group of black employees filed a class-action
lawsuit Thursday accusing the Coca-Cola Co. of discriminating
against African-Americans in pay, promotions and performance
evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta by four
past and current employees ranging from a security guard to a
former executive who earned nearly $100,000 a year. But the
complaint said the four brought the action on behalf of as many as
1,500 black employees who work or have had salaried positions at
Coca-Cola throughout the United States since April 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs contend that Coca-Cola pays its average black
employee nearly $27,000 a year less than its average white
employee. For two years, the suit says, at least one of the
plaintiffs, Kimberly Gray Orton, a supervisor in Atlanta, was paid
less than white employees who worked for her.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint contends that Coca-Cola limits black workers'
chances for promotion and that those who are promoted are shunted
into management positions in areas like human resources, public
relations and community affairs that have little power and offer
little chance of further advancement.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also contends that though Coca-Cola goes to great
lengths to market its products to black consumers _ about 25
percent of its brands are bought by African-Americans _ the company
``has failed to place the same importance on its African-American
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Baskin, a spokesman for Coca-Cola, said the company's
lawyers had not seen the suit and therefore he could not comment on
any details about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not yet seen the lawsuit,'' Baskin said in a telephone
interview. ``But based on what we have heard, we believe it without
merit. The Coca-Cola Company does not tolerate discrimination, and
if discrimination is found we take action to stop it and prevent it
from occurring.''
</P>
<P>
   A crucial accusation in the suit is that black employees
consistently received poor evaluations of their work from their
supervisors. According to figures compiled by the plaintiffs'
lawyers on white-collar employees at Coca-Cola's corporate
headquarters, 55.8 percent of whites received one of the top three
of six performance grades last year while 46.1 percent of blacks
got such evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no defense for this,'' said Cyrus Mehri, a lawyer who
is representing the plaintiffs. ``There is no reason why
African-Americans should be consistently getting poor performance
evaluations.''

About 4,000 Seattle teachers and classroom assistants stayed away

Washington teachers received no salary increases from the state
legislature. Critics of the teachers' proposals have pointed out
that inflation indices overestimate the increase in prices. (Larry

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seattle's 4,000 teachers and classroom assistants shut
down the school system Thursday by staying away from work in a
one-day protest against what they called inadequate pay increases
during the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and staff in six smaller Washington districts also
walked out, joining those in more than 30 other districts around
the state, who, in a series of rolling single-day protests over the
last week, have left the job to lobby state legislators for sizable
raises.
</P>
<P>
   In four of the last six years, Washington's public-school
teachers, whose pay is financed by the state budget, have received
no raises from the Legislature. Only in 1995-96 and 1997-98 did
they get increases, of 4 percent and 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the same six-year period, the cost of living in the state has
risen 15 percent, and the average price of a Seattle home has grown
to $198,000 from $151,000. Many Seattle teachers say they can no
longer afford to live here.
</P>
<P>
   Washington teachers, whose average pay ranges from about $25,000
a year, for beginners, to some $50,000, for those with at least 15
years' experience and a doctorate, are demanding across-the-board
raises of 15 percent over the next two years, more than is
envisioned under even the most generous plan contemplated in
Olympia, at either the State Capitol or the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Some 1,000 teachers, parents and students rallied Thursday
morning at the construction site of the Safeco baseball stadium,
the Seattle Mariners' future home, which is being financed in part
with state dollars. State officials were able to win approval of
that state financing with talk of ``creative funding.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers carried signs that said, ``If you can `creatively' fund
a stadium, you can `creatively' fund educators,'' and, ``They took
the cream from my coffee and left me with 2 percent,'' a reference
to the offer made to the teachers by the governor, Gary Locke, a
Democrat. One woman held a sign saying, ``I don't have a husband to
support my teaching habit.''
</P>
<P>
   Louisa Warden, 16, attended the rally in support of her mother,
a teacher. ``They're a national resource,'' she said of educators.
``It's disrespectful not only to teachers but to students when they
treat people like this.''
</P>
<P>
   After the rally, the teachers and their supporters rode about 50
buses south to Olympia, where legislators, their session scheduled
to end on Sunday, were engaged in negotiations on the state budget.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Democratic-controlled Senate passed the most
generous pay offer to emerge from the capital. It would provide a
15 percent raise over two years to only newer teachers, limiting
mid-level teachers to 8 percent and the most experienced to 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, whose membership is divided evenly between the two
parties, Democrats were working Thursday on a two-year raise of
about 6 percent, plus $12 million set aside for additional pay for
beginning teachers, but the Republicans were talking about a less
expensive package.
</P>
<P>
   Locke's plan calls for a two-year increase of about 4 percent.
The governor said Thursday that the teachers' demands would cost
the state hundreds of millions of dollars that it could not afford
and, because of a spending cap that limits annual increases in the
budget, would result in large cuts for nursing homes, mental health
programs and the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting on the Capitol grounds, one new teacher showed
House leaders his letter of resignation as well as his pay stubs
($1,500 a month take-home) and monthly student loan bills ($600).
The 30-year-old teacher, Joshua Proudfoot, who has been working for
two years at the New Options Middle School in Seattle, said he was
accepting a teaching job in Eugene, Ore., where he will get a 15
percent raise and be able to buy a house that costs about half of
what one in Seattle would cost.
</P>
<P>
   Devin Gruver, a special-education teacher in the Highline School
District south of Seattle, told legislators that he had taught for
26 years, in a specialty with a serious staffing shortage. ``The
abuse,'' he said, ``has been such that financially, the only wise
thing to do is retire'' and move to Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't afford to have a computer, the Internet or a newspaper
anymore,'' Gruver said later. ``Every year I have to figure out
what would be a luxury, what is the next luxury I can give up.
There's nothing left to pare.''

About 4,000 Seattle teachers and classroom assistants stayed away

inadequate pay increases during the past six years. For four of the

   LISEC, Macedonia _ Fetie Rreci, at age 50, was hoping to be
adopted by a nice family, but she knew she was not at her best. Her
clothes were crusted with mud. She was not smelling so good. She
stood in a public building with her husband, son and daughter. They
had also been sleeping on the ground. They also stank.
</P>
<P>
   Then Harum Mustafa, a farmer from the tiny village of Lisec, saw
them and smiled. The unwashed were exactly what he was looking for.
``We're willing to take in some refugees,'' he said to them in
familiar Albanian. ``If you want, you can come with me.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last three weeks, the four Rrecis have been living with
the six Mustafas. It is a story repeating itself a thousand times
over in this Balkan nation. Some 130,000 ethnic Albanians have
poured into Macedonia from Kosovo during this last month. While
50,000 of them are temporarily housed in refugee camps, most of the
rest have found shelter in private homes.
</P>
<P>
   In cities like Skopje or Tetovo, it is common to find some
connection between the helpers and the helped: a cousin is given
sanctuary and he brings in some friends who also bring in some
cousins. In the villages, though, most often it is strangers in a
strange house.

   ``These people are our brothers and sisters,'' said Shehadije
Mustafa, 49, Harum's wife. ``If we don't help them, who will? When
you see your own kind being beaten and tortured, you must do
something. We do not have much, but what we have we will share.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisec is a farming village in the mountains just outside of
Tetovo. It has 120 homes, dozens of bean patches, a single mud
road. Dwellings have roofs of tin and walls of stone and cement.
Animal sheds are made of remnant lumber and thin branches.
</P>
<P>
   Every family in Lisec is of Albanian stock, and every one has
taken in refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will make a big problem for you, I'm afraid,'' Fetie Rreci
said when she met Shehadije Mustafa.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is mine is yours,'' Mrs. Mustafa replied.
</P>
<P>
   For most refugees, a room in someone's home _ no matter how
cramped _ is preferable to the tents in the camps. The Rrecis spent
six days in the camp at Blace near the border. They considered it
hell and abandoned it when they could.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees are arriving faster than the tents are going up. On
Thursday, 1,500 to 2,000 more people came in by train, and U.N.
relief officials have declared that the nation is simply
overwhelmed. They asked those countries that had agreed to accept
refugees, including the United States, to step up efforts to
transport the dispossessed.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees are a varied lot; some of them young and healthy,
wearing Nike sneakers and nylon sweat pants. Others are old,
walking bent over like rows of apostrophes.
</P>
<P>
   They do have one thing in common, the story of being uprooted.
They talk of nasty soldiers with guns, days of hiding and awful
questions: Where have they taken those women? Why are they
separating out the young men? How will I ever find my loved ones?
</P>
<P>
   The Rrecis are from the town of Lausa. When the Serbian
paramilitary chased them from their home, they made their way to
Pristina, Kosovo's capital. There, they were told they had to leave
the country. ``Give our regards to President Clinton,'' they recall
one soldier taunting them. They were herded toward a train like
cattle, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminded you of those movies about the Jews and Hitler,''
Mrs. Rreci said.
</P>
<P>
   As they neared the train, they found themselves in one of two
thick columns of people. A vehicle with tank treads came speeding
between these rows. A soldier pushed a little girl in front of the
huge rig, the Rrecis said. A thousand people screamed.
</P>
<P>
   The girl was crushed, Ms. Rreci said. She saw the girl's mother
collapse to the ground in sorrow. The father ran toward the body,
and, for a time, tried to press the head back together. ``Leave the
mess for the dogs,'' soldiers said, pulling him away.
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. Rreci told the story, she began to weep. Mrs. Mustafa
took her hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is fragile, isn't it?'' Mrs. Mustafa said.
</P>
<P>
   She suggested that Mrs. Rreci show some photos. As the family
hid in the woods near Lausa, they once came back to see what had
happened to their house. They took pictures that showed charred
cement, a mangled tricycle, an oven with its door torn off. Beside
the front door, the words, ``This is Serbia,'' were spray-painted
on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the only pictures we have now,'' Mrs. Rreci said.
``Our family photographs are gone. Burned. Destroyed. Our family's
past is destroyed, too.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After three weeks in Lisec, the Rrecis are practically
old-timers. Across the lumpy mud road, a family of 16 had just
arrived the night before. They slept in a single room _ and were
glad to do it. They had earlier been at that horrible camp in
Blace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blace can never be forgiven,'' said Qamil Murati, 46, an
electrician from the village of Shakovice.
</P>
<P>
   At Blace, the family lived in the mud. As it rained, Salerie
Murati, 26, lay on her back and tried to remain still as she slept.
Her 5-week-old son rested on her chest, swathed in damp blankets.
She was afraid she would roll over and the baby would slide into
the muck.
</P>
<P>
   The Muratis, like the Rrecis, had a personal tale of
unfathomable evil. They had seen it at Blace. The Macedonian police
are no better than the Serbs, they said. They had seen them
separate an infant from its mother, leaving the women in
inconsolable grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray to God that he sees all this happening and makes
careful notice,'' said Mrs. Murati, who was nursing her baby.
Another of her children was holding a stuffed animal, a little
yellow caterpillar with yarn strands serving as the feelers. A wood
stove provided heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray that God rewards the people of this village who have
shown us a kindness that is beyond words. And I hope God punishes
the Serbs and Macedonians for the bad things they do. Such hate
they have. They hate us and it makes us hate them.''
</P>
<P>
   This is surely so.
</P>
<P>
   Far along the mud road, where Lisec begins to run out of bean
patches and potato fields, is the village's small school house.
Refugee children have come to study, and their classmates have
given them spare notebooks and pencils. Teachers try to encourage
the transplanted students who, they say, are prone to outbursts of
tears.
</P>
<P>
   Gezim Feka, a 10-year-old from the village of Vushtria, is a
favorite among the newcomers. He has written a poem about hate that
his teachers are quite proud of. It speaks of Slobodan Milosevic,
the Serb who is Yugoslavia's president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will cut Slobodan into pieces, into pieces, into pieces,''
the poem reads. ``Then we will bury him in separate holes, separate
holes, separate holes.''

SURPRISING PROFITS SEND MARKETS SOARING
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ IBM's strong profit report helped propel the stock
market to another big advance Thursday as large growth stocks,
which had fallen out of favor as perhaps too expensive just a
couple of weeks ago, continued to rebound.
</P>
<P>
   The rally, which brought another record for the Dow Jones
industrial average, came despite a slump in the bond market that
raised interest rates along a broad front.
</P>
<P>
   IBM was the star performer after reporting a 42 percent rise in
first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, climbing 22|, to 194{. It
accounted for 105 of the 145.76-point gain in the Dow, which
finished up 1.4 percent, to 10,727.18. Even lacking IBM, the Nasdaq
composite index did twice as well, advancing 72.53 points, or 2.91
percent, to 2,561.61. The index is now just 37 points shy of its
all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 22.7 points, or 1.7
percent, to 1,358.82 also a record.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts pointed to several more reports of surprisingly good
earnings besides IBM's as the main impetus for the market's third
consecutive advance after Monday's swoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a continuation of some really impressive earnings,
definitely better than the Street was expecting,'' said Warren
Epstein, head trader at Richard Rosenblatt &AMP; Co. ``There's a
tremendous amount of buying momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Combined volume on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq was
more than 2 billion shares.
</P>
<P>
   According to IBES, which tracks analysts' profit estimates, the
quarter ended in March appears to have been the best for positive
earnings surprises in 11 years. Many analysts cut projections last
autumn on spreading economic turmoil overseas.
</P>
<P>
   And more companies reported Thursday, bringing the season's
total to about 50 percent of the S&AMP;P 500. Among them were Lucent,
up 2|, to 61}; American Express, up 2 5/16, to 137 3/16; Chevron,
up 2[, to 98{; Nokia, up 2 9/16, to 81 3/16, and Quaker Oats, up
4\, to 67 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Some, however, slumped after disclosing results. Procter &AMP;
Gamble declined 4 13/16, to 94[; Black &AMP; Decker dropped 4 7/16, to
54 1/16, and McDonald's fell 11/16, to 44 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schwab, which rose 2 13/16, to 120 13/16, announced a
2-for-1 stock split, its seventh since the brokerage firm went
public in 1987. The previous split, which was 3-for-1, was in
December. Sara Lee, which warned analysts to expect lower profit
growth and was downgraded by Merrill Lynch, fell 1[, to 24. After
the market closed, the company said it was bidding $10.50 a share
for Chock Full o' Nuts, which had risen ], to 6]. Chock Full
responded by calling the offer ``inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer and other technology issues, benefiting from IBM
fallout, turned in another strong performance, with Amazon.com
climbing 10 13/16, to 190 1/16, America Online up 5 15/16, to 148
11/16, Microsoft rising 2 15/16, to 84 15/16, and Yahoo up 9[, to
184.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Ghriskey, a value-oriented portfolio manager at the
Dreyfus Corp., expressed hope that the market's sudden mid-April
lurch toward cyclical and smaller stocks would resume, but he was
unwilling to predict this.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is so dominated by megacap growth stocks, and I
don't think they'll be abandoned so quickly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 928 million shares changed hands on the New York
Stock Exchange as 1,705 stocks advanced and 1,307 declined and new
52-week highs outnumbered new lows by 65 to 28.

AT&AMP;T BIDS TO BECOME BIGGEST CABLE PROVIDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert new 5th, 7th, 8th and 10th grafs, and to attach 9
new grafs to end of original text, beginning: Some major
independent ...) (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT and SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bidding to become the largest cable television provider in the
United States, AT&AMP;T Corp. made an unsolicited offer Thursday to
acquire MediaOne Group Inc. for about $58 billion in cash and
stock.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is trying to break up a deal announced last month in which
MediaOne agreed to be acquired by Comcast Corp. for $53 billion in
stock. AT&AMP;T has already won the support of Amos Hostetter, whose
family is MediaOne's biggest shareholder with about 13 percent of
the company.
</P>
<P>
   If AT&AMP;T, already the nation's biggest long-distance telephone
carrier, succeeds in its bid for MediaOne, it will have grown from
no presence in the cable television market to the nation's largest
cable company in less than a year. Last June, AT&AMP;T agreed to
acquire Tele-Communications Inc., the No. 2 cable company, for
$31.8 billion; that deal was completed last month.
</P>
<P>
   With TCI, AT&AMP;T now offers cable service in 10 of the 20 biggest
U.S. markets. If AT&AMP;T acquires MediaOne, almost three-quarters of
the combined company's subscribers will be in 15 of the top 20
markets.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's offer, which came after the market closed Thursday,
represented a 17 percent premium over the current value of
Comcast's offer and a 26 percent premium to MediaOne's current
trading price. On Thursday, AT&AMP;T closed at $56.75 a share, down 25
cents; Comcast closed at $66.1875, up $2.5625, and MediaOne closed
at $69.50, up $2.5625. In after-hours trading, Mediaone traded as
high as $82.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, a combined AT&AMP;T-MediaOne would serve about 16 million
cable television subscribers and would be in markets covering about
27 percent of the nation's roughly 100 million homes. The company
would also be poised to serve millions of additional homes through
affiliates and partners. That raised concerns among some consumer
advocates Thursday that such a behemoth could stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of
Consumers Union, a consumer advocacy group, said his organization
would challenge the deal as a violation of both antitrust laws and
rules that are meant to limit concentration in the cable industry _
rules that have been stayed temporarily by the Federal
Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``This amasses massive power in the hands of one cable
company,'' Kimmelman said. ``This would create an enormous obstacle
to the development of competition in the cable industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Since C. Michael Armstrong, a former IBM executive, took over as
AT&AMP;T's chairman in 1997, he has been trying to build a
comprehensive portfolio of voice, video and Internet communications
services that AT&AMP;T can offer to consumers in a single bundle. Just
as important, he has been looking for ways for AT&AMP;T to reestablish
the direct links into the homes of U.S. consumers that the company
lost when it was forced to shed its local telephone business in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   To help pay for its offer, AT&AMP;T plans to have $30 billion in
financing in place by the end of the month _ the largest short-term
financing deal yet, an AT&AMP;T spokeswoman said. Goldman Sachs Credit
Partners LP and Chase Manhattan Corp. have each committed $5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   With its move into the cable television industry, which also
includes a troubled partnership with Time Warner Inc., AT&AMP;T is
getting set for a showdown with the Baby Bell local phone giants
for the ears and eyeballs of U.S. consumers. At least one of the
Bells could win regulatory approval to compete in AT&AMP;T's core
long-distance market this year, and AT&AMP;T plans to counter that by
offering consumers integrated packages of local, long-distance,
wireless, Internet and television service.
</P>
<P>
   If AT&AMP;T acquires MediaOne, the remaining independent cable
companies, like Cox Communications, would be faced with a titan in
their midst, even though cable companies do not generally compete
directly against one another.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne did not return a phone call from a reporter Thursday
night. Comcast declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T believes it can have a dominant role in the consumer
market,'' said Brian Adamik, an analyst for Yankee Group, a
technology consulting firm in Boston. ``We are moving to a duopoly
in the consumer market between AT&AMP;T and the Baby Bells.''
</P>
<P>
   Salvatore Muoio, who runs an investment firm that bears his
name, called the bid ``a terrific move for AT&AMP;T because by owning
systems outright, they control their own destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T is buying cable companies so they can offer local phone
and Internet service,'' Muoio said. ``Otherwise the local phone
companies could begin offering long distance while AT&AMP;T did not
have the ability to offer local phone and Internet service.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If you can't do everything, you are going to lose
market share in your core business, without taking it in new
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   If AT&AMP;T's bid for MediaOne succeeds, it would be a setback for
Comcast, the Philadelphia-based cable company that has been
competing with the telephone companies to offer high-speed access
to the Internet. As the only two industries that have
communications cables passing almost every house and business in
the United States, cable and telephone companies have been
positioning themselves to grab a share of each other's businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Some major independent cable companies remain, including
Cablevision Systems Corp., but a Comcast merger with Cablevision
might be more complicated since both are controlled by families.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said Thursday that AT&AMP;T was prepared to pay more than
Comcast to acquire MediaOne because AT&AMP;T could make better use of
MediaOne's cable assets. He added that an acquisition was
preferable to a joint venture with MediaOne because making
partnerships like the one with Time Warner work has proved
difficult. In that venture, AT&AMP;T is to provide telephone services
over Time Warner's cables.
</P>
<P>
   ``The joint ventures are running into difficulties in defining
the scope,'' Armstrong said in a conference call with reporters.
``We are having problems separating the voice and data
applications, because technology and time are converging them.''
</P>
<P>
   A potential problem in AT&AMP;T's current venture with Time Warner
is that MediaOne owns 25.5 percent of the Time Warner subsidiary
that owns most of Time Warner's cable systems. But by acquiring
MediaOne, AT&AMP;T would be removing a potential obstacle in its
relationship with Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, AT&AMP;T would exchange $30.85 in cash
and 0.95 shares of AT&AMP;T stock, valued at $59.50 a share, for a
total of $87.375 for each of MediaOne's roughly 660 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   The deal may be particularly attractive to MediaOne shareholders
because AT&AMP;T has guaranteed a floor price. AT&AMP;T said it would add
more cash to offset up to 10 percent of any decline in its stock
from its $57 closing price on Wednesday. Making good on that
promise, AT&AMP;T said, could cost an additional $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T would also assume MediaOne's debt of about $4.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $30 billion in financing, about $23 billion would go to
finance the cash part of the purchase. Another $1.5 billion would
go to Comcast, since MediaOne has already agreed to pay Comcast
$1.5 billion in breakup fees if it terminates their deal. AT&AMP;T
would use the balance for more general needs.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T also said it planned to sell some of MediaOne's noncable
operations _ such as its overseas wireless phone unit _ which AT&AMP;T
said had a value of $18 billion to $20 billion.

ANDERSON'S SPUNK IMPRESSES COLLINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ With Jim Edmonds out for four months because of
shoulder surgery, Garret Anderson is the center fielder. Or is he?
</P>
<P>
   Manager Terry Collins said he will consider moving Anderson back
to left field and Darin Erstad to center once Mo Vaughn returns to
first base. Erstad will continue to play first base as long as
Vaughn is the DH.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to take a real hard look at our whole outfield
situation,'' Collins said. ``It depends on where Darin is more
comfortable, because Garret can play any of 'em.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he has been impressed with Anderson's work ethic
this season and it might have something to do with the abundance of
outfielders the Angels had at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garret was the one guy we could move around (during spring
training),'' Collins said. ``He didn't want to be the DH. He said,
`I'm going to make sure I do everything I can to be in the lineup
every day, both offensively and defensively.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Garret Anderson's whole approach from the start of
spring training was completely different. He has played the game
hard, he's busted his behind, he's going after balls in the
outfield. He's really been impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Woeful West: A quick glance at the division standings in the
AL West on Thursday found all four teams below .500, led by the
Rangers at 7-8. Is it a bad division? A sign of things to come?
</P>
<P>
   Collins would only speak about his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some things we've had to get straightened out,'' he
said. ``Hopefully we'll get them straightened out. I've seen it too
many times _ sometimes you get off to a great start, sometimes you
don't. But I don't think after two weeks of the season you can draw
conclusions. We've got to continue to hang in there and not let our
confidence get down. And now with Mo in the lineup, our confidence
will continue to rise.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Wells accepts fate: Many members of the New York media were
in town to talk with ex-New York Yankees pitcher David Wells, who
starts tonight for the Blue Jays against his old teammates at
Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Wells was devastated when the Yankees traded him and two other
players to Toronto for pitcher Roger Clemens during the offseason.
But Wells says he's over it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the best two years of my life, but I let it go,''
Wells said of his time with the Yankees. ``It wasn't fair to this
organization to keep dwelling on not being a Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now my job is to go in there and try to shove it up their
(rears) and that's what I'm going to try to do.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Biding his time: Shortstop Gary DiSarcina, recovering from
surgery on his broken left forearm, is on the trip. But about all
he can do, besides his therapy, is shag balls in the outfield
during batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina, whose injury is on his glove arm, is using a
left-hander's glove to catch the ball and avoid any unnecessary
strain on his left arm.
</P>
<P>
   __ Outlook: The Angels begin a three-game series with the Kansas
City Royals beginning tonight. Pitching matchups for the series at
Kauffman Stadium: Today (5:05 p.m.) _ Ken Hill (0-1, 5.87 ERA) vs.
Jose Rosado (0-1, 2.08); Saturday (11:05 a.m.) _ Steve Sparks (0-3,
9.42) vs. Jeff Suppan (0-3, 4.67); Sunday (11:05 a.m.) _ Chuck
Finley (1-2, 7.94) vs. Jay Witasick (0-1, 4.91).

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A month into NATO's war against Yugoslavia, U.S.
cruise missiles destroyed one of President Slobodan Milosevic's
official residences in Belgrade, and the Pentagon and NATO vowed to
launch more attacks at the core of his power and control.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia denounced the strike as an assassination attempt, but
U.S. and NATO officials denied that the attack was a deliberate
attempt to kill Milosevic. They defended the target as a legitimate
assault on the military leadership of Yugoslavia, though not on him
directly, effectively a distinction without a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at the White House with NATO's secretary general,
Javier Solana, on the eve of NATO's 50th anniversary summit,
President Clinton said the alliance had an obligation to pursue the
power structure that Milosevic uses to command the forces that have
driven hundreds of thousands of Albanians from the province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this conflict,'' the president said, ``it would be wrong
and unfair not to target the command and control operations as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic and his family were not in the residence, Yugoslav
officials said, when four cruise missiles fired from warships in
the Adriatic Sea struck with thunderous blows about 4 a.m. in
Belgrade. By Thursday afternoon, Milosevic appeared on Yugoslavia's
state-run television at a meeting with Viktor Chernomyrdin,
Russia's newest envoy to the Balkans, at another presidential
residence nearby, called Beli Dvor, or White Palace.
</P>
<P>
   The images from that meeting juxtaposed those of the destruction
at Milosevic's villa on Uzicka Street in Dedinje, an exclusive
section of the Yugoslav capital where many diplomatic compounds are
situated, including the residence of the U.S. ambassador.
Yugoslavia's former leader, Josip Broz Tito, lived in the villa,
and his mausoleum is on the grounds, though evidently far enough
away that it was not damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes on Thursday strikes came just one day after NATO
forces blasted a 23-story office tower in Belgrade that housed the
political parties of Milosevic and his wife, as well as several
radio and television stations, including one owned by their
daughter. These attacks signaled an expansion of NATO's efforts to
undercut the political and economic pillars that Milosevic has
relied on in more than 11 years of rule.
</P>
<P>
   The air assault continued with new ferocity Thursday, the 30th
day of NATO's bombing campaign. The Yugoslav news agency, Tanjug,
reported new missile strikes around Pristina and villages in
southern Serbia. NATO aircraft again attacked a bridge in
Yugoslavia's second largest city, Novi Sad, after discovering
workers trying to repair damage from two previous strikes. [Updates
as warranted)
</P>
<P>
   ``We are targeting the head of this military regime on the one
hand,'' the Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said Thursday.
``We're trying to cut that off and break the central nervous
system, the central command and control system of the regime. And
we're also attacking the feet of the regime on the ground in
Kosovo, the feet that are being used to stamp out, or attempt to
stamp out, the Kosovar Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the United States and its NATO allies agreed to review
contingency plans for the possible use of ground forces to rout
Yugoslav forces from Kosovo, the Pentagon offered one of its most
detailed assessments to date of the damage being inflicted on
Yugoslavia's military and police forces.
</P>
<P>
   American and allied warplanes now are flying day and night. On
Wednesday night, NATO said, it carried out 324 missions, sending
the total for the campaign over 9,300. Nearly a third of those _
2,750 _ were combat missions against targets across Yugoslavia,
Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   A month into the war, the Yugoslav military is still able to
function, according to Rear Adm. Thomas Wilson, director of
intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ``They are still
responding to political guidance,'' Wilson said. ``And they are
still conducting their operations.''
</P>
<P>
   But he described a force significantly weakened by the NATO
raids. The attacks have eroded air defenses to the point that
allied pilots can fly virtually anywhere with an acceptable level
of risk, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen radar stations have been destroyed, as well as more than
30 percent of the SA-3 surface-to-air missiles and 10 to 15 percent
of the more mobile SA-6 missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The admiral said that NATO forces had destroyed 16 of the
roughly 80 MiG jets in Yugoslavia and more than 35 other aircraft
and helicopters, functionally destroyed the Yugoslavs' ability to
repair airplanes, and inflicted significant damage to airfields in
nine cities.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has also hurt the army leadership and caused
``widespread destruction'' to the 3rd army, the force in southern
Serbia and Kosovo, Wilson said, adding that the armed forces are
beginning to suffer the effects of shortages of fuel and other
supplies. The destruction of oil refineries and ammunition
factories has forced the country to search out foreign sellers, so
far unsuccessfully, the admiral said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is increasing evidence, both among forces in Kosovo and
among the Serbian army in general, that this campaign is having an
impact on their morale,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson also offered the first estimate of the scope of damage to
the 300 Yugoslav tanks in Kosovo, saying 30 to 60 had been
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the weather continues to be spotty, allied warplanes
have reportedly been striking more and more targets. In addition to
planned strikes against stationary targets like bridges and
military headquarters, NATO now keeps squadrons of jets positioned
over the Adriatic ready to dart in on a moment's notice to bomb
``targets of opportunity'' spotted by reconnaissance aircraft
flying high overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ground forces in Kosovo remain a focus of the
strikes, the attacks on targets close to Milosevic represent an
effort to intensify pressure on his power structure, now that it is
clear that the attacks have done little to ease his defiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a conscious decision to increase the pain,'' a
NATO diplomat said, describing the bombings of the office tower and
Milosevic's house as the first in a list of high-profile strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The question that officials refused to discuss was why the
supreme NATO commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, had not launched such
attacks earlier.

U.S. INQUIRES WHY SUSPECT AT ATOM LAB KEPT ACCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is investigating
how a computer scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory kept his
access to U.S. nuclear secrets long after he was suspected of being
a Chinese spy, officials said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson may soon take disciplinary action against officials
who allowed the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, a Taiwan-born computer
expert at Los Alamos, to retain his access to a classified
information about America's nuclear-weapons designs for nearly
three years after he emerged as a leading suspect in China's theft
of design data related to America's most advanced nuclear warhead.
</P>
<P>
   Lee continued to have access to U.S. nuclear secrets at Los
Alamos for more than a year after the director of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, Louis Freeh, told Energy Department
officials in 1997 that there was no longer any investigative reason
to keep Lee in a sensitive position.
</P>
<P>
   When the FBI investigates spy cases, it often asks employers not
to move suspects out of their jobs in order to avoid tipping them
off.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known which officials might face punishment. Los
Alamos and the nation's other nuclear-weapons laboratories are
owned by the Energy Department. Richardson's internal inquiry came
just as congressional leaders presented President Clinton with
evidence that Chinese nuclear spying has continued during his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican chairman and the ranking Democrat on a select
House committee that has investigated illicit transfers of American
high technology to China briefed Clinton Thursday on their
findings, including evidence of ``current and ongoing'' Chinese
espionage during the Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting that lasted for more than an hour, Rep. Christopher
Cox, R-Calif., and Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., told Clinton that
Chinese efforts to steal American atomic secrets is ``not ancient
history.''
</P>
<P>
   The president did not dispute their findings, the two lawmakers
said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of whether Beijing's espionage has continued during
the Clinton presidency is politically significant because of the
furor over the administration's handling of evidence in the Los
Alamos spy case.
</P>
<P>
   In response to criticism that the White House sought to play
down the evidence in that case for fear of damaging
American-Chinese relations, Clinton and his advisers have stressed
that the loss of design data related to the W-88 warhead from Los
Alamos occurred in the 1980s, long before Clinton took office.
</P>
<P>
   While The New York Times has reported on evidence of Chinese
atomic espionage during the Clinton administration, the president
has never publicly acknowledged that such spying occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stated last month that he had never been told about
evidence of Chinese nuclear espionage during his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   During a March 19 news conference, Clinton even stated that he
was not certain that the loss of the W-88 design data had been the
result of Chinese espionage. ``It is my understanding that the
investigation has not yet determined for sure that espionage
occurred,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   After the session with the congressional leaders, a spokesman
for the National Security Council, David C. Leavy, said that the
``president and the administration are under no illusions about the
fact that China and other countries are trying to acquire sensitive
technologies from the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   An administration official did not dispute the fact that the
briefing with the leaders of the Cox panel included a discussion of
possible Chinese atomic espionage during the Clinton presidency.
But the official emphasized that the information did not deal with
assertions of further espionage at one of America's nuclear-weapons
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We covered in great detail a number of incidents of
espionage,'' Cox said after the meeting with the president. ``There
is no disagreement between Congress and the Executive Branch that
this is a current, ongoing problem that needs immediate and
aggressive attention.''
</P>
<P>
   An administration official noted that Clinton had already been
briefed by his staff on all of the incidents of possible espionage
raised during the congressional session.

DODGERS GET READY FOR HOLLANDSWORTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a week of Dodgers decisions, another one looms
as the Dodgers brain trust decides which day to activate Todd
Hollandsworth and how they want to make room for him.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth, on the disabled list since opening day, spent the
past three days on a rehab assignment and he could be activated
before the Dodgers and St. Louis Cardinals begin a three-game
series today at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   If Hollandsworth is activated _ manager Davey Johnson said
earlier in the week that was the plan _ then a roster spot must be
cleared.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Kevin Malone said the possibility exists the
Dodgers could continue to go with 12 pitchers and four outfielders
or they could return to the conventional 11 pitchers and five
outfielders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have options,'' Malone said. ``It's something we're going
to have to talk about. We can do a couple of different things.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Dodgers' bullpen is beaten-up (Alan Mills has a
tender shoulder and Antonio Osuna is on the disabled list) and
lacks experience (Jeff Arnold, Jeff Kubenka, Onan Masaoka and
Robinson Checo have 24 games of experience), 12 pitchers might not
be needed because the Dodgers had Thursday off and will have Monday
off. They've bumped Carlos Perez from his next start, but pitching
coach Charlie Hough said Perez could be used in relief.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers could send down a pitcher. Checo, who came to the
Dodgers in the Mel Rojas and Dave Mlicki deal last week, has been
awful in his two outings. He's given up seven earned runs in 32/3
innings and Johnson said reports he received were Checo's fastball
and sinker had more movement than he saw.
</P>
<P>
   As he was with Rojas, Johnson is leery about pitching Checo in
crucial spots.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers elect to remain with four outfielders, Jacob
Brumfield could be the odd man out. Brumfield, a favorite of
Johnson's from their Cincinnati days, has two hits in 11 at-bats.
Hollandsworth has been on the disabled list with a pulled
hamstring, which he injured April 1 in an exhibition game against
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   __ McGwire day-to-day: A year ago Mark McGwire missed a series
in Los Angeles because of injury, and as the Cardinals make their
first trip to Dodger Stadium this season, his status is in question
again.
</P>
<P>
   The home run king strained his left hamstring Tuesday in
Milwaukee, didn't play Wednesday and a Cardinals spokesman said
Thursday his status for the three-game series against the Dodgers
is day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, coming off his 70-homer season, was experiencing
tightness in his hamstring, a Cardinals spokesman said. St. Louis
had Thursday off.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hitting woes: Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley's early-season
problems at the plate were somewhat expected considering he missed
most of spring training, but production from the Dodgers' catchers
has been abysmal through the first 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley is 8 for 44 (.182), backup Paul LoDuca is hitless in 16
at-bats and Rick Wilkins, recently designated for assignment, was 0
for 4. The three catchers have hit a combined .125 (8 for 64).
Hundley owns both homers and all three RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting's something I've always been able to do, so I'm not
worried about it,'' said LoDuca, who hit .309 in six minor-league
seasons. ``I'm a little too anxious. I've been working on it the
last few days, hitting the ball up the middle and the other way.
I'm happy with the way I'm catching and my defense. I'm just
swinging at bad pitches.''

<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. _ With two dozen students as his sounding board,
President Clinton puzzled Thursday over the causes of school
violence and mulled how to prevent it. But in the end, he could not
guarantee the students the protection they sought from the kind of
fatal chaos that erupted on Tuesday in Littleton, Colo., where 14
high school students and a teacher lay dead amid bombs and guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't feel safe anymore,'' Jonelle Mitchell, a
student here in the Washington suburbs, said to Clinton, who
presided over an hour-long discussion on lessons to be drawn from
Littleton. ``When is the government, when are you, going to do
something for the other students out there?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had little to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government doesn't run this high school,'' he
replied. ``You know, you have a local school board, and most of the
money comes from the state.''
</P>
<P>
   He referred to the ``big hunting culture'' in America and said
that his efforts to control access to weapons had met with
hostility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every little thing I've tried to do, from the passing of the
Brady Bill to the passing of the assault weapons ban _ all these
things have met with violent opposition, as if I were trying to
destroy the American way of life,'' Clinton said. ``And all I'm
trying to do is keep more people alive.''
</P>
<P>
   He did note that after earlier school killings, the federal
government had sent to all school districts a booklet describing
early warning signs of antisocial behavior.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would send new legislation to Capitol Hill but was
vague about what it would entail. Deputy Attorney General Eric
Holder said the administration would push for legislation to make
it harder for youths to get guns and to crack down on sales by
unlicensed dealers at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this could do anything to prevent the killings in
Littleton, and Clinton Thursday could do little more than lay out
the scope of the problem, empathize with teen-agers about high
school cliques and highlight some of the techniques that officials
at the T.C. Williams High School here have used to try to minimize
violence.
</P>
<P>
   T.C. Williams is one of the most diverse high schools in the
country. Its students come from more than 84 countries and speak
more than 56 languages. The school requires students to take an
``anger management'' program in ninth grade and offers a conflict
resolution and peer mediation program starting in seventh grade.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the mediation group intervened in student conflicts
about 100 times. The school also has a confidential hot line on
which students can discuss problems and report incidents that
trouble them.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's discussion provided Clinton another chance to espouse
one of his central concerns: that hatred is driven by a need for
some people to look down on people who are different. He said the
student-killers in Littleton had been ``dissed'' by their peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had the wrong reaction to the fact that they were
dissed,'' Clinton said. ``Everybody gets dissed sometime in life,
even the president.''
</P>
<P>
   He told the students that the adage ``sticks and stones will
break my bones but words will never hurt me'' was not true and
suddenly seemed to personalize the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how much energy is lost and how many things are
not done for America because people in Washington, D.C., at the
highest levels of power and influence get hurt by what other people
say about them _ mean, bad things other people say about them,'' he
said.

HOW MIDWIVES OF NATO PREVAILED OVER DOUBTERS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mich., Ohio, Texas)  (rk) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, whose 50th
anniversary will be ceremonially commemorated by the leaders of its
19 member nations here this weekend, was the brainchild of a
portly, rough-hewn former trade union leader with a grade-school
education, the illegitimate son of a serving-girl.
</P>
<P>
   His name was Ernest Bevin, and he was Britain's foreign
secretary. In the anxious early days of 1948, with Czechoslovakia
slipping under Communist sway and Berlin blockaded, he feared that
the Soviet Union would pick off the nations of Western Europe one
by one. The old continent's only real hope, he concluded, lay on
the other side of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Bevin therefore proposed to the British Cabinet on Jan. 8 ``that
we should seek to form with the backing of the Americas and the
dominions a Western democratic system comprising Scandinavia, the
Low Countries, France, Italy, Greece and possibly Portugal. As soon
as circumstances permit, we should, of course, wish to include
Spain and Germany, without whom no Western system can be
complete.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the kernel of the idea. With minor modifications, it
grew to become NATO, the centerpiece of the allied containment
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was superb idea, and it turned out to be a superb
accomplishment,'' said Lucius D. Battle, now 80, an American
diplomat who was present when the treaty establishing the
organization was signed on April 4, 1949. ``Surprising, in a way.
It was not at all clear, and there was by no means universal
agreement, that it was the right way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   After some initial hesitation, the far-seeing American secretary
of state, George C. Marshall, who had served as the nation's
military chief of staff during World War II, and his discreet,
patrician under secretary, Robert A. Lovett, came to agree with
Bevin. (At one early stage, Lovett accused the British of ``asking
us to pour concrete before we see the blueprints.'') They oversaw
months of negotiations that produced a draft treaty by
Christmastime.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall's successor, Dean Acheson, pushed the talks to a
conclusion in 1949 and won Senate approval with the indispensable
help of Sen. Arthur Vandenberg R-Mich., who had once been a
dyed-in-the-wool isolationist.
</P>
<P>
   But the real American midwife of the new organization, the first
major military alliance the United States had ever joined in
peacetime, was a career diplomat named John D. Hickerson. Unknown
to the public then, and all but forgotten now, Hickerson, a wry,
50-year-old Texan who had worked his way through the University of
Texas at Austin, in part by shining shoes, championed the concept
within the bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately he persuaded Marshall, and through him, President
Harry S. Truman, of the importance of the principle that became
Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty: An armed attack on any of
the signing countries would be considered an attack on all.
</P>
<P>
   That, he believed, would provide the tight links between Europe,
the United States and Canada that Bevin sought. For most of the
rest of 1948, while President Truman was staging the whirlwind
campaign that produced his upset victory in November, Hickerson and
his No. 2 in the State Department's Bureau of European Affairs,
Theodore C. Achilles, labored in the shadows with Hume Wrong of
Canada and senior European diplomats to pound a treaty into shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the valiant workers in the vineyards,'' said George
Elsey, now 81, then an aide to Truman. ``They were the ones who put
things together. The White House was not much involved. It was
State's show.''
</P>
<P>
   That it could be done at all was remarkable. It is an iron rule
of American politics that lame-duck presidents _ those nearing the
ends of their terms _ take few initiatives. Those they do take
almost always misfire. Truman, seen as a sure loser to Thomas E.
Dewey, not only laid the groundwork for NATO but also instituted
the Marshall Plan.
</P>
<P>
   But those were extraordinary times. The allies were keeping
Berlin alive only with an airlift of unprecedented dimensions. On
March 10, 1948, the body of Jan Masaryk, the Czech foreign
minister, was found on the pavement outside his apartment; it was
never established whether he had been killed by the Communists or
had committed suicide in political despair.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, Gen. Douglas MacArthur was warning that the imminent
victory of Chinese forces ``imperiled'' the United States. And in
Washington, the Red Scare was under way; on Dec. 15, Alger Hiss was
indicted for perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Times were hard in Europe. Washington lawyer Lloyd N. Cutler,
then a junior government official, recalls staying at Claridge's in
London, one of the world's grandest hotels, and shivering with
cold. Because of a desperate fuel shortage, he said, ``the only
thing in my room that was warm was the heated towel rack in the
bathroom.'' According to his biographer, Alan Bullock, Bevin was
horrified that spring when a French minister told him the Russians
would be in Paris by August.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the mood was grave but not frantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took the Cold War seriously,'' Elsey said, ``but I would
not say there was a sense of crisis _ nothing remotely resembling
the feeling later, during the Cuban missile crisis. Like the
Marshall Plan, NATO was carefully crafted, by people who didn't let
the alarm bells distract them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that everyone agreed that NATO was the right solution.
</P>
<P>
   George F. Kennan, then the director of policy planning at the
State Department, favored the containment of the Soviet Union, a
policy that he more than anyone else developed. But he considered
the problem basically political in nature, not military, and he
warned that the proposed pact ``would amount to a final
militarization of the present dividing-line through Europe''
(which, in the event, it did).
</P>
<P>
   Paul Nitze, who was to be his successor, said last week that
NATO ``seemed to me at the time an overcommitment on our part.''
When the Russians soon after announced that they had developed an
atomic bomb, ``I took a much more radical line,'' Nitze, now 92,
recalled. ``I thought getting rid of our nuclear weapons,
unilaterally if necessary, was the best way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The leading American journalist of the day, Walter Lippmann,
wanted to disarm and neutralize a united Germany, rather than
trying to draw the western part of a divided Germany into an
alliance. He argued that Germans would ``never align themselves
honestly and reliably with one side or the other,'' and he
dismissed NATO as ``inflationary paper from the mimeograph machine
in the State Department.''
</P>
<P>
   But significant as those voices were, the State Department's
European desk _ Hickerson and Achilles _ ``carried the day,'' said
James Chace in his biography, ``Acheson'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   The founding members were the United States, Britain, France,
Canada, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Portugal,
Iceland, Norway and Denmark.

</P>
<P>
   In April, the treaty was signed in the Departmental Auditorium
building, since renamed the Andrew Mellon Auditorium, on
Constitution Avenue. Acheson signed for the United States, with
Truman at his side. The Marine Band played airs from ``Porgy and
Bees,'' rather disconcertingly including ``It Ain't Necessarily
So'' and ``I Got Plenty of Nothin'.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who in the world picked the music?'' the buttoned-up Acheson
asked Battle, his aide.
</P>
<P>
   The ratification debate was not plenty of nothin'. Robert A.
Taft of Ohio, the unofficial leader of the Senate Republicans,
opposed the treaty, largely because it would automatically commit
the United States to fight alongside any other members who were
attacked, robbing Congress of its Constitutional authority to
declare war. That, of course, was just what the Europeans wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Acheson's negotiations, as he wrote in his memoir, ``Present at
the Creation'' (W.W. Norton, 1987), ``became a contest between our
allies, seeking to impale the Senate on the specific, and the
senators, attempting to wriggle free.''
</P>
<P>
   With Vandenberg's help, he convinced both groups, and the treaty
was resoundingly approved by the Senate, 82-13, on July 21.

RUSSIAN ENVOY ENDS PEACE VISIT; SLIGHT SIGNS OF PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ President Slobodan Milosevic spent nine
hours Thursday with a Russian peace envoy but appeared to give very
little ground.
</P>
<P>
   The envoy, former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, left
Belgrade late Thursday saying that Milosevic had agreed to an
``international presence in Kosovo under United Nations auspices''
to implement any political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic has agreed to such a U.N. presence before, and
details were scarce, including the key point of whether
international participants would be armed, and if so, under whose
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of international forces they will be, or from which
countries _ this is yet to be discussed,'' Chernomyrdin said at the
Belgrade airport. ``But the main thing is that Russia will take
part in them.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO insists on an armed ``international security force'' with
NATO troops as its core, so it is highly unlikely that Chernomyrdin
has made enough progress to change NATO's plans, which call for
continued bombing. Milosevic continues to insist that NATO stop
bombing first, before any talks proceed on a Kosovo settlement, and
he has refused to withdraw all Serbian security forces from the
province.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin described his long session with Milosevic as
important progress, but initial Western reactions were dubious.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, responding at a Washington news conference on
the eve of NATO's 50th anniversary summit meeting, said: ``If there
is an offer for a genuine security force, that's the first time
Milosevic has done that, and that represents, I suppose, some step
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   British officials said it was too early to judge the outcome,
but emphasized that NATO's demands included issues such as the safe
return of all ethnic Albanian refugees and the ability for
international investigators to pursue allegations of Serbian war
crimes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is hoping that the Russians can mediate this
conflict, but they have limited influence over the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   While Milosevic spent hours with Chernomyrdin, it was not clear
he liked what he heard. State television gave the Chernomyrdin
visit very little airtime late in the broadcast, a sharp contrast
to the lavish treatment given the visit April 14 of the Belarussian
leader, Aleksandr Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Lukashenko said at a joint appearance with Milosevic that
Belgrade would accept unarmed civilian monitors from non-NATO
countries in Kosovo under a U.N. mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Chernomyrdin and Milosevic signed a joint declaration
calling for an end to the airstrikes, the safe return of refugees
to Kosovo, a possible reduction of Yugoslav troops and police but
also for a withdrawal of NATO troops from the borders of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin said relief agencies should be allowed to carry out
work in Kosovo, economic aid should be offered to Yugoslavia and
talks on broad autonomy should continue.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, appointed Russia's special Balkan envoy last week
by President Boris Yeltsin, came with specific proposals that
included some form of armed international presence in Kosovo, but
one that would be agreeable to all sides.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His trip came one month after a mission led by Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeni Primakov ended in failure. Unlike the visit to
Belgrade by Primakov and a delegation of military and intelligence
officials days after the bombing began, Chernomyrdin's visit was
designed to elicit some concessions from Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of Primakov's mission was to show an effort, but he
was fully aware of the impossibility of achieving any results,''
said a Western diplomat based in Moscow. ``Chernomyrdin has no need
to repeat that effort. He needs to bring home something.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin has already moved away from a one-sided
condemnation of NATO's bombing campaign, calling Wednesday for an
end as well to ``ethnic cleansing and separatism'' in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin spent two days this week consulting with the
leaders of Georgia, Azerbaijan and Ukraine, seeking support close
to home.
</P>
<P>
   The war is growing increasingly costly for Yugoslavia.
Information Minister Milan Komnenic said Thursday that 517
civilians, including 13 children, had been killed in the bombing
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He said that more than 4,000 civilians had been seriously
injured since the start of the strikes on March 24.

   LITTLETON, Colo. _ It took five minutes for Katie Trojan to make
her escape from Columbine High School as two classmates unleashed a
storm of gunfire and bomb blasts. She remembers every second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see every step I took,'' said Trojan, a junior who was among
the first students able to flee the campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can still see the places where I put my feet on the fence to
jump over it.''
</P>
<P>
   She and others who lived through the massacre are now living
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Police SWAT team member Donn Kraemer, 49, relied on his training
to keep focused during the daring rescue of a trapped student. But
when asked if he has shed tears since, he admitted to a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cops aren't supposed to cry,'' he said. ``We do that on our
own time.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraemer was training recruits at a gun range when he was
dispatched to the far more deadly shooting scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard on the radio shots were being fired and there were
explosions,'' Kraemer said. ``But until I got here I didn't believe
it. I knew it wasn't Hollywood, I knew it wasn't a prank. It was
just disbelief.''
</P>
<P>
   He arrived to a chaotic scene of students rushing from the
school and others signaling for help from windows.
</P>
<P>
   A sign in a second-floor window read ``1 bleeding to death.'' A
student was trying to leap from another window.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't get to the window with the sign,'' Kraemer said.
``But we knew we had one victim we could help. He was ready to jump
head first to get out of that room. At the time we didn't know
where he was but he was in the library, the main killing field.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraemer and six other SWAT officers were about 40 yards from the
window in an armored vehicle that a courier service had provided
for rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   One officer rode in the cab with the driver and his supervisor,
while the others walked behind the vehicle, using it as mobile
cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept our weapons pointed at the window because we didn't
know if he was alone,'' Kraemer said.
</P>
<P>
   When the vehicle was positioned under the window, Kraemer put
down his weapon, climbed on the roof of the armored car with
another officer and pulled the boy to safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who he was. I don't even know his name,'' Kraemer
said. ``He was in deep shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraemer said he heard no other sounds coming from the room where
several victims and the two gunmen later were found dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was any bright spot in our mission, it was rescuing
him,'' Kraemer said.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath left Kraemer and other hardened police officers
emotionally drained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police officers by nature sometimes use black humor to relieve
stress,'' Kraemer said. ``I saw none of that. Everyone was numb.
There were no high-fives, no `You did a good job.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Trojan, 16, was in a counseling office when a teacher came in to
tell them someone was shooting a gun in the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   She and several teachers and students took cover in a copy room
closet for a few minutes, then decided to make their break when
explosions set off fire alarms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were running just trying to get away.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, she heard teachers yelling at other fleeing students,
telling them to jump a nearby fence and ``Run for your lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole time I was thinking `What about this person? What
about that person?' '' she recalled Thursday. ``One of the first
people that came to my mind didn't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trojan returned to a park near the school Wednesday and
Thursday, placing flowers and seeking comfort from other survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where I find a lot of my friends and we need each
other right now,'' Trojan said. ``We feel so fortunate that we're
here and that we survived. But then you realize your friend didn't
make it, and you just have to tell yourself she's in a better
place.''
</P>
<P>
   And matters difficult to fathom just two days ago have come into
focus with terrible clarity. ``Last year I never understood what it
was like for the kids in Jonesboro (the site of a deadly school
shooting in Arkansas),'' Trojan said. ``Now I do. And it's a
horrible feeling to understand that.''

   SOMERS, N.Y. _ They are two days and 1,650 miles removed from
the death and disbelief consuming Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., but in the minds of students at Somers High
School in northern Westchester County, visions of the carnage
linger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an awkward feeling when I came to first period this
morning,'' said Noah Stebbins, 18, a burly senior with blond hair
as short as razor stubble. ``Just like the first time you step on a
plane after a major plane crash.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an apt description of how most of the 50 students at
Somers High, where wooded acres give an air of seclusion and wild
geese peck at the school's manicured baseball field, are feeling
since the murder of 15 people at Columbine High.
</P>
<P>
   Though they had followed the news of other shootings at other
schools in recent years _ memories of Jonesboro, Ark., and West
Paducah, Ky, have not faded entirely _ the latest killings shook
students here as none of the others had. In Columbine High,
students at Somers see a simulacrum of themselves: an affluent
suburban hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that feeling has been dashed, students said. Before they
opened fire on their classmates and then, the police say, killed
themselves, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had not seemed very
different from some students at Somers High.
</P>
<P>
   Like Columbine and, indeed, most high schools, Somers High has
its contingents of jocks, brains, burnouts and goths, the
black-clad demimonde to which Harris and Dylan apparently belonged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you have to worry even more, who you can and can't be
friends with,'' said Jenn Sgroi, a 16-year-old junior. ``There used
to be basically, like, the preps and the geeks. Now it's like
there's so many different groups. Like, there is the goths, and
there is the jocks and there is the preps and there is the nerds.
Now I have to worry about all these different groups.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, school officials, in an appeal piped into
classrooms, asked students for a moment of silence for the 15 dead.
Thursday, the school tried to regain its normally ingrained sense
of security.
</P>
<P>
   But television images broadcast in the aftermath of the murders
have left Somers students more cautious. ``It made me conscience of
what I say,'' said Cindy Boniello, a junior who recalled a chilling
interview with a Columbine student who said she had begged one of
the gun-wielding classmates for her life, only to watch the gun
turned on a friend nearby. ``You just can't joke with some people.
You just have to be aware of that.''
</P>
<P>
   As have their peers around the nation, a wave of students at
Somers High visited school counselors to discuss their feelings
about the violence in Littleton, said the principal, Linda Horisk.
So, too, have a few teachers, faced with the double burden of
dealing with their own reactions and those of their students.
</P>
<P>
   Allison Zeinoun, an English teacher, confronted her first-period
class with the massacre, asking students to write out their
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kind of try to bring it home, to make it more personal,''
said Ms. Zeinoun.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the essays betrayed feelings of anger toward the news
media. But many Somers students said they had spent hours
transfixed by the live broadcasts immediately after the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the stuff that I saw is stuff I never want to see
again,'' Stebbins said, shaking his head. ``Kids aren't supposed to
go into buildings and shoot everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet students here predicted the grisly events would happen
again.
</P>
<P>
   School killings are starting to feel like an annual ritual, said
Christopher Sales, a Somers High senior. ``I wouldn't be surprised
if it happens again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the chances of it happening at Somers High School,
parents have been invited to meet with psychiatrists from the Four
Winds Psychiatric Hospital in Katonah on May 4 to talk about
identifying the signs of a child in need of help, Ms. Horisk said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zeinoun, the English teacher, said the Columbine killings
have created a renewed sense of community and inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel more aware of wanting to make everybody feel, not
loved, but cared for,'' she said. ``So that if they need to turn to
somebody, they're not going to turn to violence.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of the opening of the NATO summit here,
President Clinton and NATO leaders vowed to intensify the military
and economic punishment of Serbia even as they reserved judgment on
a possible peace proposal from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   American and NATO war planners in Washington and Brussels began
drawing up options for a land assault to drive the forces of
President Slobodan Milosevic from the Yugoslav province of Kosovo
as alliance leaders gathered in Washington for a suddenly grim
commemoration of NATO's 50th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, standing in the Rose Garden with Javier Solana, NATO's
secretary general, said that Milosevic must withdraw his troops
from Kosovo ``or he can watch as NATO grinds down his war machine,
and the Serb people he claims to represent face mounting
hardship.''
</P>
<P>
   As the summit opens, some difference are clear within an
alliance that has struggled to present a unified face. Prime
Minister Tony Blair and other British officials, the first
arrivals, aggressively pushed a hard line on Kosovo in a series of
meetings with Clinton, members of Congress and business leaders.
Blair has been the most outspoken of the NATO leaders in urging the
deployment of ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   Sketchy reports that Milosevic was willing to accept some form
of international monitoring force in Kosovo were called a possible
``step forward'' by Clinton at the news conference Thursday.
However, those reports left it unclear whether Milosevic would
accept an armed international presence.
</P>
<P>
   As the president spoke Thursday afternoon, NATO warplanes and
missiles began a third night of attacks on leadership targets in
Serbia. NATO bombs hit Milosevic's presidential residence and the
government television station in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia denounced the strike as an assassination attempt,
which American and NATO officials denied. They portrayed it as a
legitimate assault on the military leadership of Yugoslavia, though
not on Milosevic directly, effectively drawing a distinction
without making a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that removing Milosevic from power was not one of
the aims of the conflict, and that if Milosevic withdrew his troops
from Kosovo and allowed the peaceful return of the refugees, NATO
would wreak no further damage and would not seek to unseat the
Yugoslav president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we set forth certain conditions, and if he meets those
conditions, and the Serbian people are willing to continue him in
power, then I could imagine such an outcome,'' Clinton said. ``Now
that begs the question of what the War Crimes Tribunal will do or
what other action might be taken. But we _ NATO has never taken a
position on that issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Chernomyrdin, the former Russian prime minister, said
Thursday after meeting with Milosevic in Belgrade that Milosevic
would be willing to accept an unspecified international
``presence'' in Kosovo to monitor the return of refugees. The
United States and NATO have tried to suggest to the Russians that
Russian troops be part of some type of land force there.
</P>
<P>
   Administration and allied officials said Thursday night that
they were skeptical about the Russian-Serbian initiative and that
few details were available.
</P>
<P>
   A European official said he thought Belgrade and Moscow might be
trying to undercut the summit by offering a vague peace plan just
as NATO leaders sat down to map a military campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One senior American official said he suspected the initiative
was a propaganda ploy designed to appeal to the Russian people; an
American aide said that the proposal had gaps on issues like the
size and composition of a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton did not dismiss the offer out of hand, as he did an
earlier cease-fire initiative brokered by Yevgeny Primakov, the
current Russian prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is an offer for a genuine security force,'' the
president said, ``that's the first time that Milosevic has ever
done that, and that represents, I suppose, some step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then repeated that such a force could include not only
American and NATO troops, but also Russians, Ukrainians and
soldiers from other Slavic and Orthodox Christian countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is true,'' Clinton said of the Milosevic offer, ``then
it is at least the first acknowledgment by Milosevic that there
will have to be a security force there. But for the security force
to work, it will have to have the confidence of the people who live
there, and it will have to operate in a way that protects all the
people there, including the Serb minority.''
</P>
<P>
   The NATO summit was intended to be a celebration of the
alliance's victory over communism and a seminar on its future.
Instead, it has become a war council on Kosovo, with all its
reminders of the grisly ethnic conflicts that grew into the
century's bloodiest wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This NATO summit in Washington will be one of the most
important meetings the alliance has ever held,'' Solana said. ``Our
focus will be on the immediate, and particularly on Kosovo. It is,
no doubt, the gravest crisis that Europe and NATO have faced for
many years.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior European official said that Milosevic's apparent
willingness to consider an international presence in Kosovo was a
sign that he was beginning to crack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting,'' the official said, who insisted on
anonymity. ``We're getting these signals from Milosevic, that
here's a guy sitting there in front of his TV screens trying to
read signals from NATO, and he's hearing that we're not going away,
and the air strikes are getting harder and getting close to home,
and he's getting worried.''
</P>
<P>
   But a NATO diplomat said that Milosevic would only accept a
small and unarmed force, and pointed to language calling for a
``reduction'' in Yugoslav forces in Kosovo rather than complete
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Blair staked out a hard line as he moved from
speech to speech in his first full day here. Addressing about 30
United States senators, he laid out what one congressional aide
called a ``compelling case'' for the allied attacks on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Alistair Campbell, chief spokesman for the prime minister's
office, said that Blair was trying, in his public and private
comments, to assure allied unity.
</P>
<P>
   His language has been more forceful than Clinton's, in part
because the president fears alienating an American public that lags
behind the British people in support for the Balkan conflict,
Campbell said. But he denied that the British were serving as the
stalking horse for the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   And he insisted that the two countries are on the same track on
Kosovo. He said that Blair was determined to use the NATO summit
``to send powerful signals to Serbia and rest of world about NATO
determination and confidence the air campaign is working.''

 CONGRESSMAN SAYS NATO IS WORSENING REFUGEE CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just back from a stealthy three-day mission of
personal diplomacy to Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Rep. Jim Saxton,
R-N.J., said Thursday that the NATO bombing had succeeded mainly in
hurting Yugoslav civilians and worsening the refugee crisis in
Kosovo, but not in weakening the Yugoslav military.
</P>
<P>
   Saxton, in an hourlong interview with reporters in his Capitol
Hill office, went so far as to contend that the United States and
its NATO allies deserved some blame for the mass expulsion of
Albanians from Kosovo by Yugoslav forces, and suggested that it
might not have happened if NATO had not started the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know when the ethnic cleansing started, I know when the
refugees started to move,'' he said. ``It was when we started
bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   Saxton, an eight-term representative from Mount Holly in
southern New Jersey, is relatively shy of the media and usually
keeps a low profile, and his colleagues considered him an unlikely
candidate to slip into a war zone on a mysterious mission. The only
official in Washington he told of his plans was House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, who counseled him not to go for safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Saxton said the trip was arranged through contacts
he had developed as chairman of the House Task Force on Terrorism
and Unconventional Warfare. They put him in touch with a Yugoslav
organization called the Institute for Geopolitical Studies, which
persuaded the Yugoslav government to extend him an official
invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Saxton said he flew from Washington to Paris last Sunday, and
then to Budapest, Hungary, where Yugoslav officials drove him
across the border to Belgrade, a five-hour trip. Over two days, he
said, he met with the Yugoslav foreign minister, the deputy prime
minister for international relations, and the chairman of the
Parliament's foreign relations committee.
</P>
<P>
   Saxton said he also toured a nearby city, Pancevo, where he said
NATO bombs had damaged an oil refinery, a chemical plant and
hundreds of homes. He did not meet with the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic. He left on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Saxton was accompanied on the trip by an aide, Yossef Bodansky,
whose writings on Middle Eastern terrorism have been acclaimed in
Serbia. Bodansky says that Muslim leaders in Bosnia and Kosovo have
been heavily supported by fundamentalist Islamic terrorists and
Osama bin Laden, a suspect in the bombings of U.S. embassies in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Saxton made similar assertions Thursday, saying NATO had
inserted itself into a dirty civil war in which both sides were
guilty of atrocities. The Clinton administration contends that
Yugoslav forces have been far more brutal than the Kosovar rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got people who are supported by bin Laden, and you've
got people supported by Milosevic,'' he said. ``We have chosen bin
Laden?''
</P>
<P>
   Saxton said his goal had been to learn more about the conflict
before voting on whether to send in ground troops. He also said he
had hoped to bring home the three American soldiers in Yugoslav
custody. Yugoslav officials had told him he might be able to visit
the soldiers, but withdrew the offer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Saxton said the trip had confirmed his opposition to American
involvement in the conflict and to the use of American ground
troops. He said he had come away convinced that the Yugoslavs were
prepared to negotiate in good faith, and he said he expressed this
conviction to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright over the
telephone Thursday morning. A State Department spokeswoman said
Albright would not comment on Saxton's trip.

GREENSPAN HAS RESERVATIONS, BUT WOULD LET OTHER COUNTRIES ADOPT
DOLLAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman,
joined the Clinton administration Thursday in saying the United
States would be open to proposals from other countries that want to
adopt the dollar as their national currency.
</P>
<P>
   But in testimony before a congressional committee, Greenspan and
Lawrence Summers, the deputy treasury secretary, warned countries
that might be contemplating such a step that monetary union with
the United States could never be a substitute for pursuing sound
policies to strengthen their economies and financial systems.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting a united view on the topic, Greenspan and Summers
also emphasized that the United States would not change its
monetary policy to deal with economic problems in other nations
using the dollar or serve as a lender of last resort to their
banks.
</P>
<P>
   A number of countries have been considering abandoning their
national currencies and adopting the American dollar _ the accepted
international benchmark of financial stability _ as a way of
reducing interest rates, inflation and exchange-rate volatility.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions have been most serious in Argentina, which has
already held informal talks about the possibility with the Treasury
and the Federal Reserve. The issue is also being openly debated in
Mexico and, to a lesser extent, in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The idea has got increasing attention following Europe's
decision to create a common currency, the euro, a step that is
expected to increase the European Union's growth prospects and
competitiveness in the long run. Some economists say making the
dollar the common currency of the Americas could greatly expand
trade and help the United States by creating more stable and
vibrant markets for its goods among its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said the administration's position on another country's
desire to adopt the dollar would depend on the country and the
circumstances. ``But it is absolutely not our intent to close the
door on the consideration of this issue by countries who have that
interest,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries would not have to seek permission from the
United States to use the dollar as their legal tender. Several
countries, including Panama, already use the dollar as their
official currency, and the dollar is widely used on an unofficial
basis in many other nations, from Russia to the Philippines and
Bolivia. So strong is foreign demand for dollars that roughly
two-thirds of all American currency is in circulation outside the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the stakes involved, the big countries weighing
the possibility of dollarization have signaled that they would only
take such a step in coordination with the United States. Among
other things, countries would need large quantities of cash from
the United States during any changeover.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Speaking before two subcommittees of the Senate Banking
Committee, Greenspan said that in recent years some small countries
with generally sound economic policies had found themselves
buffeted by global forces. Those countries, he said, probably would
have fared better had they ``locked themselves into a currency of
one of the more stable, larger countries'' like the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan said adopting the dollar would not help another
country unless that country was also willing to develop a
well-regulated, well-capitalized financial system, keep a lid on
budget deficits and avoid running up big foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important for us to be certain that dollarization
as we view it is not some means to bypass the types of policies
that are required to create stability,'' Greenspan said. A country
that adopts the dollar without pursuing sound policies generally,
he said, ``will find within a reasonably short time that it will
fail, and that in the process of failure, they almost surely will
be worse off than they were without it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dollarization is a component of a broader debate over how
developing nations can best manage their currencies and
foreign-exchange systems in a world where rapid flows of capital
can knock all but the mightiest of economies off track.
</P>
<P>
   At meetings next week, financial officials from the leading
industrial nations and delegates to the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank will consider how to respond to the global
financial turmoil of the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Exchange-rate systems are at the top of the agenda, with many
countries having come to the conclusion that developing economies
need to choose between two options at opposite ends of the spectrum
of possibilities: allowing their currencies to float freely in
value, or irrevocably fixing the value at a certain level.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing a national currency with the dollar is in effect the
most dramatic and unambiguous way of freezing that currency's value
irrevocably. Such a move would effectively eliminate the
exchange-rate fluctuations that can bedevil borrowers and exporters
in a developing nation, since the dollar is the benchmark against
which other currencies are usually valued.
</P>
<P>
   It would all but eliminate inflation, since the money supply
would be controlled not by the nation's central bank but by the
Federal Reserve. And because exchange-rate and inflation risks
would be substantially reduced, interest rates within the nation
adopting the dollar would probably come down.
</P>
<P>
   But in adopting the dollar, a country would give up control of
its own monetary policy, reducing its ability to cope with any ups
and downs in its economy.
</P>
<P>
   It would be restricted in its ability to deal with a banking
crisis, since it could not inject money into the financial system.
And it would give up what economists call ``seigniorage,'' the
interest payments it receives from holding foreign currency
reserves in the form of U.S. Treasury bonds, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists favor dollarization as a realistic way to help
bring stability to emerging economies, especially in Latin America.
Before joining the Clinton administration, Summers was an
enthusiastic proponent of dollarization.
</P>
<P>
   But the issues involved are not just economic. Giving up a
national currency _ even a troubled or weak currency _ is a major
political decision in any country, and involves a substantial
ceding of sovereignty. And Summers and Greenspan discussed in their
testimony today the possibility that a dollarized nation that hits
a rough economic patch will likely attribute its problems to the
United States, creating diplomatic issues as well.

BOMB DISCOVERY RAISES CONCERNS SCHOOL KILLERS HAD HELP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN AND MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ The largest of 30 homemade bombs was
discovered Thursday in the kitchen of Columbine High School,
heightening suspicions that the presumed killers had help in their
conspiracy and planned an apolycptic ending to the massacre that
killed 15 and shocked the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These subjects were not only on a killing rampage, but they
were going to destroy the school. They were going to burn the
school up,'' said Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb, hidden in a duffel bag and fashioned from a 20-pound
propane tank attached to a container of gasoline, was overlooked in
the initial sweep by SWAT teams, and investigators said it was
possible there were still more bombs hidden in the school.
</P>
<P>
   Police are investigating whether presumed killers Eric Harris
and Dylan Klebold, who attended a Saturday night after-hours prom
party at Columbine High School, used that access to the school to
prowl the hallways placing explosives. But another possibility was
that the killers had as-yet unidentified co-conspirators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would have been difficult, maybe not impossible,
but very difficult, for two people to have gotten all these
explosives into the school, in addition to the weapons,'' said
Jefferson County District Attorney David Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   He noted, however, that investigators have no physical evidence
to indicate a third person was directly involved in the attack.
Thomas reiterated, however, that investigators suspect others at
least knew of Klebold and Harris's plans.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, investigators reported finding a note at Harris's
home that could provide clues to the motive. Police would not
reveal the contents of the note.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, school property remained a community shrine,
attracting hundreds of people who braved a spring snowstorm to draw
as close to the school, and each other, as they could.
</P>
<P>
   A makeshift shrine to the 12 slain students and one dead teacher
continued to grow Thursday, organized loosely aroung the theme,
``In The Arms of Angels.'' Several tents were erected to protect
mourners and their offerings from the falling snow. Hundreds of
bouquets of flowers and scores of sympathetic notes littered the
ground. Under one, a football jersey belonging to slain high school
senior Isaiah Shoels was hung. On his No. 80, someone had written,
``We love you, Isaiah.''
</P>
<P>
   A wooden cross festooneed with blue-and-white ribbons,
representing the school colors stood tall. On the cold ground
nearby were 13 small crosses, 9 blue and 4 pink, representing the
nine boys and four girls killed, not including the shooters.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and friends of sophomore John Tomlin, crawled into the
back of his beloved Chevrolet pick-up truck, which was covered in
flowers and cards. They huddled inside, drawing close for warmth
and comfort.
</P>
<P>
   School officials said Columbine would remain closed
indefinitely. They hope to relocate the 1,965 students to another
location sometime next week. They said their priority in
determining the location is keeping students and faculty together.
</P>
<P>
   The crime scene investigation has been painstakingly slow,
police say, because of the scores of knapsacks, lunch sacks, gym
bags _ all possible hiding spots for bombs _ that were left behind
in the chaos and must be searched. All the bodies were removed by
early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Officals who have seen the shattered classroom windows and
blood-stained hallways said they are haunted by the images.
``Everything seemed frozen in time. Some of the victims seemed to
have stopped almost in mid-action. One victim had a pencil in his
hand. In the cafeteria, there were sandwiches with one bite out of
them. Glass and debris were everywhere,'' Thomas said. ``It was a
devastating scene. I can only describe it as a war zone.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hours following the shooting spree, three teen-agers,
wearing jackets inscribed with a symbol the presumed killers also
sometimes wore _ a crucifix with a slash through it _ were
arrested. The teenage boys, police say, were spotted standing on a
nearby hill watching the bloodshed, but they were released
following initial interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday police said they had not identified other suspects,
though they continued to question friends of Harris and Klebold,
other members of the so-called ``Trench Coat Mafia,'' a loose
affiliation of outcasts.
</P>
<P>
   As the nation searches its collective conscience for solutions
or at least explanations for the schoolhouse killings, the quest to
understand Harris and Klebold continues. They shared a passion for
computers, spending hours in the Harris family garage navigating
Internet Web pages for instructions on building bombs, friends say.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have retrieved a computer from the Harris home, and
several web sites visited frequently by the boys, who favored two
of the country's best selling video games, ``Quest' and ``Doom.''
Aside from video games whose winners have the highest body count,
just about everything the ``Trench Coat Mafia'' stood for has been
examined by a confused public.
</P>
<P>
   Questions persist: Was it the Gothic movement, attracting teens
who paint their faces death-white and their fingernails blood-black
that drew Harris and Klebold to killing? Or were Harris and Klebold
fueled by the racist song lyrics they favored, the modern-day
Internet they revered, or the age-old clash of high school cliques
some say plauged them?
</P>
<P>
   Looking for ways to help school communities across the country
feel safe, President Clinton Thursday hosted a roundtable with
students in a suburban Washington, D.C., school, hearing their need
for school psychiatric care and peer efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno Thursday arrived in this traumatized
city to meet with the victims and their families, school officials,
and investigators in an attempt to ``erase this kind of violence
once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association, due to host its annual
conference in Denver this weekend, will scale back the event from
three days to one in response to the killings, and the public
outcry over access to handguns.
</P>
<P>
   But the Denver Mayor Wellington Webb called on the NRA to canel
the event completely. Denver District Schools, and two other
suburban school districts, took the unusual step of banning black
trench coats worn in schools, a response to the Trench Coat Mafia
uniform of long black dusters worn by Harris, Klebold, and their
friends.
</P>
<P>
   The parent of the two boys have hired attorneys, after providing
short statements saying they were stunned by the actions of their
sons, and sympathized with other grief-stricken parents.
Prosecutors say it is too early to determine whether the boys'
parents will be charged in conn

TOBACCO LAWYERS LOOK AT BONDS TO SPEED FEES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Miss., Texas, Calif., N.Y., Mass., S.C.)   (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of plaintiffs' lawyers, including some who have already
been awarded billions of dollars in fees for representing states in
tobacco lawsuits, are exploring the possibility of having bonds
issued so they can collect the money faster.
</P>
<P>
   The bond issue, should it go forward, would apparently be the
first used for speeding payment of lawyers fees, several of the
lawyers involved in the discussions said Thursday. The lawyers said
they had already contacted more than 10 major investment-banking
houses about their interest in issuing bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of recent settlements between states and the
tobacco industry to resolve lawsuits seeking to recover
smoking-related health care costs, cigarette makers are required to
pay the fees of the lawyers hired by the states.
</P>
<P>
   But the industry is not required to pay all the money at once.
The agreement calls for the companies to pay $500 million in fees
annually until the awards are paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Under those terms, the $8.2 billion in fees awarded by
arbitrators last year to lawyers representing three states _
Florida, Mississippi and Texas _ will take about 16 years before
they are paid out.
</P>
<P>
   Billions of dollars in additional fees that are expected to be
awarded by arbitrators over the next year or two will substantially
lengthen the payout period.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lieff, a lawyer from San Francisco whose firm represented
several states, said issuing bonds would allow the lawyers to get
their money faster and with more favorable tax treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Lieff said the bonds would also insulate the lawyers from risks
if any of the cigarette makers participating in the settlement went
bankrupt. The cost of the bonds to investors could be discounted to
reflect that risk.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawyers involved in the group exploring the bond issue
include Richard Scruggs of Pascagoula, Miss., and Ronald Motley and
Joe Rice, members of the same law firm in Charleston, S.C. Along
with participating in the Texas, Florida and Mississippi cases, the
men represented more than 30 other states in cases against the
tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Borod, whose Boston firm represented Massachusetts and
other states, said the lawyers decided at a meeting in Washington
several weeks ago to approach investment banking houses about
issuing bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Borod said that the investment houses had until Tuesday to
submit proposals outlining how they would issue the bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know a lot of firms are working on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that based on the response from Wall Street, the group
of lawyers would decide whether to go forward with the bond issue.
Some of the firms involved, like Borod's, have not been awarded
fees yet but expect to get such awards in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   A number of states are also exploring the possibility of issuing
bonds. New York City is likely to become the first government in
the country to raise money based on future payments it will receive
from the tobacco settlement.

LAZARD TO PAY $11 MILLION TO SETTLE FEDERAL CHARGES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.J., Fla., Ark., Pa., Wash. Ind.)   By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lazard Freres &AMP; Co., the Wall Street investment bank, agreed
Thursday to pay $11 million to settle federal charges for its role
in an industrywide scandal of overcharging in the sale of billions
of dollars worth of bonds in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the closing chapter of Lazard's disastrous foray into
the municipal finance business, the firm agreed to pay about $7.45
million to the federal government and the remainder to local
government agencies in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana and
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Lazard centered on a practice known as ``yield
burning,'' in which financial firms profited heavily by inflating
the prices of U. S. government securities they sold to
municipalities seeking to lower their borrowing costs.
</P>
<P>
   While negotiating with Lazard Freres, federal investigators also
have been in talks to settle similar charges against more than a
dozen other Wall Street firms, lawyers close to the case said.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement with Lazard ``represents a framework for similar
resolutions with other investment banks,'' said William R. Baker,
an associate director of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange
Commission in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers close to the case say the settlements with the
other firms could easily exceed $100 million in total. As with the
settlement with Lazard, some of the money would be to repay losses
suffered by the Treasury Department and some would compensate local
government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   For Lazard, the settlement brings to an end a
reputation-damaging affair that began more than a decade ago when
Lazard decided to break into the trillion-dollar municipal finance
market. Using political power as entree to municipal deals, it set
about hiring political figures around the country. One was Mark S.
Ferber, a former aide to a state Senate leader in Massachusetts.
Others were Richard P. Poirier Jr., who had been close to Gov. Jim
Florio of New Jersey, and James E. Eaton, a one-time aide to Gov.
Bob Graham of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   By 1992, Lazard had broken into the top ranks in municipal
underwriting, winning big contracts in Boston, New Jersey and New
York. But three years later, Lazard closed its municipal department
after a series of federal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   With the settlement Thursday, Lazard has agreed to pay $44
million to settle a number of cases involving its municipal bond
sales. Ferber, who had represented himself as an independent
adviser at Lazard, but had taken kickbacks to steer clients to
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., was sentenced to jail for 33 months in late
1996. Poirier and Eaton were indicted on charges of conspiring with
an Arkansas brokerage firm to steer municipal bond business in
Georgia to Lazard in 1992. Eaton pleaded guilty; Poirier is
awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement after the latest settlement was announced,
Lazard said it was ``especially pleased to have finally resolved
this matter.'' Through its lawyers, it declined to discuss the case
further.
</P>
<P>
   Yield burning was a technique that bond dealers devised to
secure better rates as municipalities refinanced debt. When
interest rates fall, municipalities often issue new bonds to
refinance the debt and lower their interest payments.
</P>
<P>
   But there are usually restrictions on when the old bonds can be
retired. So a municipal bond issuer has to wait before using the
new proceeds to retire the old debt. During that time, the money
from the new municipal bonds is invested in Treasury bonds and held
in escrow.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the escrow account cannot earn a higher return than the
interest rate paid by the new bonds. If it does, the excess is
supposed to go to the Treasury. To reduce, or burn down, the yield,
Wall Street firms sometimes sold the Treasury bonds to the
municipalities at artificially high prices. In this way, the
Treasury was maneuvered out of millions that went into pockets of
the bankers. It was not supposed to cost the municipalities
anything. But sometimes, federal officials say, the bankers also
gave the municipalities less than they were entitled to.
</P>
<P>
   The first widely publicized complaints about the practice came
in early 1995. They were made by Michael R. Lissack, an investment
banker who was dismissed by Smith Barney, now Salomon Smith Barney,
in a dispute over several issues. Lissack filed a suit under the
federal whistle-blower statute and the federal agencies joined in.
</P>
<P>
   John R. Phillips, a lawyer for Lissack, said that under a
provision in the whistle-blower statute, his client is eligible to
receive 15 to 25 percent of settlements that go to the Treasury.
Lissack has had to deal with his own legal problems.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, for example, he agreed to pay $30,000 and accept
a ban of at least five years from the securities business to settle
federal charges that he misrepresented how much money would be
saved for Dade County, Fla., in a municipal bond transaction in
1994.

 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
TALLADEGA, Ala. _ Many NASCAR followers have thought Jeff Burton
was on the verge of greatness since he won his first Winston Cup
race two years ago in the inaugural event at Texas Motor Speedway.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Burton finished fourth in the points race in 1997 and fifth last
year, but he still wasn't a serious contender for the championship.
He had the talent, and he had the equipment in the Exide Batteries
Ford, but something was holding him back.
</P>
<P>
   Burton was angry that he couldn't get over the hump, and that
anger, coupled with a fiery temper, might have been the reason for
his problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``My emotions have gotten me where I am, but they also have held
me back at times,'' Burton said. ``I think the best thing about me
is the passion I have for what I do, but I haven't always been the
easiest guy in the world to work with. So this year is a kinder and
gentler Jeff Burton, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, it's working, because the 31-year-old Virginian
is on top of the Winston Cup point standings after eight races.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon, Dale Jarrett and Mark Martin are lurking near the
top, just as they have in each of the last three seasons. But all
three are looking up at Burton entering Sunday's DieHard 500 at the
Talladega Superspeedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still early, so I really don't like talking about points
much,'' Burton said. ``We're not going to get overexcited about
being the leader. Obviously, we feel good about what we've done so
far, but I'm trying to focus on what we need to do to keep
improving. You can't win a championship this early, but you can
lose one.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton probably had Talladega in mind when he made that
statement. The restrictor-plate superspeedways of Daytona and
Talladega have been the nemesis for Roush Racing teammates Burton
and Martin.
</P>
<P>
   In his last five restrictor-plate races, Burton's average finish
is 24.2, including a 35th and 40th at Daytona, and a 43rd at
Talladega one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff can't walk out of here with a 30th- or 40th-place
finish,'' said Buddy Parrott, the general manager of Roush Racing.
``That would be disastrous. We've got to get better on the
superspeedways.''
</P>
<P>
   Talladega has been better for Burton than Daytona. He has three
top-10 finishes at NASCAR's fastest track, but he never has
finished higher than seventh on the 2.6-mile tri-oval. And
qualifying has been a problem. Burton has started 34th or lower in
five of his 10 starts at Talladega.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had some decent finishes, but I want to win here,''
Burton said. ``You have to be patient. I think that's the biggest
difference that stands out for me this year _ patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not every race is going to go the way you want. It's a long
season. If we win a race, we don't think that means we're going to
go win the next one. And if we have a problem and finish 35th or
whatever, we don't think that means we will have problems in the
next race.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton hasn't had many problems since his 35th-place finish in
the Daytona 500 to start the 1999 season. He has finished seventh
or better in each of the last seven races, including victories at
Las Vegas and Darlington, and a second-place finish to John
Andretti last weekend at Martinsville, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Burton held off his older brother, Ward, to win at Las Vegas,
and he won at Darlington when rain stopped the race one lap after
he was involved in a crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question we can feel a difference in this year's
team,'' Burton said. ``We are better by a long shot than we were at
this point last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've had some breaks and we've won two races because of
circumstances. We caught a caution at the right time at Las Vegas,
and the rain won it for us at Darlington.''
</P>
<P>
   Being fortunate helps, but a lot more than luck has placed
Burton ahead of the pack this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff is a hard worker who understands the car, which makes him
a big asset to the crew,'' Parrott said. ``Jeff is in the shop as
much as he can be. He is involved in building the cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Roush first noticed Burton a decade ago when he was a
youngster on the Busch Grand National circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I built the engines Jeff was using on the Busch circuit, and
he often would outrun Mark (Martin) and the (Busch) car we were
fielding,'' Roush said. ``Jeff seemed to have the same maturity,
knowledge and instincts I had seen in Mark years earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin finished second to Gordon in the championship chase last
season, the third time Martin has ended up No. 2. He could end up
No. 2 to his teammate this year, but Burton knows he wouldn't be
the driver he is today without Martin's help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark brings a lot of things to the table that have helped
me,'' Burton said. ``He is as honest a guy as you will find, and I
believe he is the best race-car driver in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gained a mutual respect for each other, and I think
we've made each other better. Mark and I work together on a daily
basis. We make decisions together. That's the strength of what
we're doing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton said the big break of his career came when he joined
Roush Racing, which is the only five-car team in NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best decision I've made in my career was to become
associated with Jack Roush,'' Burton said. ``When you drive a car
that isn't capable of running up front, you don't learn much. But
Jack has given me a competitive car, and that's when I really
started learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton was the Winston Cup Rookie of the Year in 1994, one year
after Gordon did the same. Gordon has won three championships since
then, but many NASCAR fans are hoping Burton has reached the point
where he can give Gordon stiff competition for many years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started this season with a goal to improve three things:
our pit stops, our qualifying and our consistency,'' Burton said.
``You have to be consistent. We felt if we improved in those areas,
we would have a successful season.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton and his crew have improved in all three areas, but they
still must prove they can improve at a restrictor-plate track like
Talladega.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning a championship requires excellence in every aspect of
the sport,'' Burton said. ``We have to get better. We haven't run a
complete race and done everything right yet by any means. We can be
better than we've been.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 24 car (Gordon), the 6 (Martin) and the 88 (Jarrett) are
going to be there at the end, so we have to continue to race
aggressively.''

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
CHICAGO _ Seemingly out of options on their own pitching staff, the
Chicago Cubs were bailed out when Mother Nature took the mound to
water down the Astros' smoking bats Thursday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A persistent storm stopped long enough for the Astros and Cubs
to play the first two games of their series, but Thursday's finale
was washed out. It couldn't have come at a better time for the
Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of blistering Cubs pitchers, the Astros take
their traveling assault show to Cincinnati, where they begin a
three-game series against the Reds tonight at Cinergy Field.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long ago that there was so much concern over the
Astros' offense that it seemed manager Larry Dierker would issue an
all-points bulletin to locate his wayward sluggers. Rest easy; they
have been found and are again the most feared assortment of hitters
in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros rank first in the NL in batting average (.306) and
on-base percentage (.378) and second in slugging percentage (.485)
and hits (145). For good measure, they are second in stolen bases
(19).
</P>
<P>
   Normally, when the offense is rolling it's a good bet Jeff
Bagwell and Craig Biggio are leading the charge. And while Bagwell
is on fire, the two most consistent Astros hitters are an unlikely
pair.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Carl Everett is the only Astro who has reached
base in every game. He has hit safely in 13 of the Astros' 14
games, and his .400 average is second on the team to Ricky
Gutierrez, who is hitting .424 and would be second in the league in
batting if he had enough at-bats to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky gets overlooked a little bit because we have so many
great hitters in our lineup, but he's been going great,'' Dierker
said of his eighth-place hitter. ``Opposing pitchers make a big
mistake when they overlook Ricky; that's when they end up paying
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez, who collected the 500th hit of his career Tuesday
against the Cubs, is riding a six-game hitting streak and is
batting .500 over his last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoys the challenge of hitting in front of the pitcher, even
though eighth-place hitters seldom see good pitches. Opposing
pitchers often view the ninth spot as an automatic out and rarely
challenge the No. 8 hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're hitting eighth you have to be patient, and I don't
mind that at all,'' said Gutierrez, who has hit .261 in each of the
past two seasons. ``A lot of guys don't like to hit eighth, but
it's not a pride thing with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm seeing the ball well, and I've been able to get
some hits. Hopefully, I'll be able to keep it going because the
strength of our lineup is getting hits up and down the order.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering the season, there were questions about the middle of
the order _ specifically the fifth spot, which was occupied by
Moises Alou in 1998. Alou had arthroscopic knee surgery in February
and is out at least until August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moises is gone,'' Astros hitting instructor Tom McCraw said.
``We have to fight with the guys we have. It's like in war; if your
buddy goes down, you can't go back and get him. You have to keep
fighting, and that's what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   And Everett hasn't been a bad replacement as the No. 5 hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old switch hitter, whom the Astros acquired from the
Mets for John Hudek in December 1997, has produced multiple hits in
seven of the Astros' 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   He and Bagwell are tied for the team lead with 33 total bases,
and his 10 RBIs rank second to Bagwell's 12 on the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the least bit surprised,'' said McCraw, who coached
Everett when both were with the Mets. ``(General manager) Gerry
(Hunsicker) asked me about him before we made the trade, and I told
him Carl was ready to explode.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talent has always been there. Now he's maturing as a
hitter, and he's getting an opportunity. I think he could have a
big year for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett hit .333 before the 1998 All-Star break and .257 after
it, which may be why Dierker describes him as a streak hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's on a hot streak right now, and it would be great if he
could keep it going for an extended period of time,'' Dierker said.
``He proved that he could drive in runs last season. So even when
he's not on a hot streak, I'm going to keep on playing him.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett downplays talk about his being streaky, choosing instead
to call his production consistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is streaky?'' he said. ``To me, that's basically saying
it's going to end. That's what people said last year (when he
finished with a .296 batting average).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't pay any attention to that. I'm just going to try to
keep doing what I've been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good.

 Column: NATO Summit Draws the Keen Interest of Defense
Stock  Investors 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Mark Veverka &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
After initial belief that defense stocks would not benefit from the
Kosovo conflict, investors in aerospace and defense firms are now
keeping a close eye on the NATO summit that begins today in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   As the possibility of a ground attack grows, investor focus is
expected to shift from stocks that benefit from an air war to those
companies whose products would be used in a ground war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The probability of a NATO ground attack against Yugoslav
forces in Kosovo is increasing. (And) Congress seems likely to add
billions of dollars more to the Department of Defense budget,''
says defense firm analyst Byron Callan of Merrill Lynch in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   While the prospects of a pending ground war is nothing to
celebrate, it is doubly painful for American taxpayers who probably
will see their slim chances of a tax cut destroyed like a Belgrade
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   In short, a ground war would probably cost more than the $6
billion the Clinton administration is prepared to spend. However,
since it isn't clear how much more Congress might allocate to the
war, Callan isn't changing his defense stock recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, one stock that Callan thinks might eventually get a
lift from the additional spending tied to a ground attack is
Alliant Techsystems, a maker of medium-caliber cannon ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Callan surmises that defense stocks might
psychologically benefit from Russia's ``vehement opposition to a
ground attack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Russian) threats may sharpen investor concerns about the
deterioration (of) international security, (which in turn) bolsters
the attractiveness of defense stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LUCKY ACE: &LR;  Successful investing takes intelligence, sound
strategy, execution and sometimes a little bit of luck. Take San
Francisco's Parkside Group, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Parkside is a relatively young buyout partnership founded by
managing partner Barry Schneider, who deftly transformed his
family's $4 million (sales) floor covering business, MSA
Industries, into the nation's largest distributor of commercial
floor coverings.
</P>
<P>
   Under his direction, the company expanded to 46 branches in 31
states and racked up more than $300 million in sales. Eventually,
Schneider sold MSA Industries to DuPont in August 1996 for an
undisclosed amount. He rolled much of his proceeds from the sale
into Parkside, where he is joined by partners Gil Amelio, former
chief executive of Apple Computer and National Semiconductor, and
Chuck Frank, former president of Il Fornaio.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it was more than luck that spurred the growth and
sale of the Schneider family business, which largely resulted from
hard work and vision. Where luck came into play was with Parkside's
first investment: MacGregor Golf Co.
</P>
<P>
   The buyout group bought then-struggling MacGregor of Georgia
last August. Considering the relatively flat demand for golf clubs
and the stiff competition with other major manufacturers, Schneider
knew turning around MacGregor wasn't going to be a ``gimme.''
</P>
<P>
   But two weeks ago, at the storied Master's golf tournament in
Augusta, Ga., the turnaround task suddenly got a little easier.
Spanish touring pro Jose Maria Olazabal won the grand slam event
using MacGregor clubs.
</P>
<P>
   For Schneider, who along with his son followed Olazabal for
three rounds of the tournament, it was like sponsoring the winner
of the Indianapolis 500 on his first try.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost indescribable to watch a person who represents
your brand, play the way he played,'' Schneider beamed. ``(And) the
resulting feedback from consumers has been phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOND FAREWELL: &LR;  I just wanted to say goodbye to our colleague
Mark Martinez, who has been an editorial assistant in The Chronicle
business section for more than two years. Mark is leaving the paper
to work for his mentor, financial columnist Herb Greenberg, at
TheStreet.com. While Mark's job description here didn't call for
doing research and checking the facts of columnists, he routinely
did just that on his own initiative. He has been an invaluable
asset to Street Smarts and the business section.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Herb occupied this space for about 10 years and was
largely responsible for recruiting Mark to The Chronicle. Our loss
is TSC's gain. Good luck, Mark.
</P>
<P>

 &QL; 
Street Smarts runs every Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday. Mark
Veverka can be reached by mail at 901 Mission St., San Francisco,

KILLERS PLANNED TO DESTROY THE SCHOOL WITH LARGE BOMB 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Two students who massacred classmates at
Columbine High School left a large bomb in the kitchen, indicating
they planned to destroy the school and may have had help from
others, investigators said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``These subjects were not only on a killing rampage, but they
were going to destroy the school. They were going to burn the
school up,'' said Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, used sawed-off shotguns,
a semiautomatic rifle, a pistol and homemade bombs to kill 12
students and one teacher Tuesday before killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   As the 11:30 a.m. attack inside the two-story building dragged
on, SWAT teams worked to free students caught inside the school and
frantic parents gathered outside, some waiting hours for word that
their children were safe.
</P>
<P>
   No motive has been established, although the two collected guns,
professed to like Adolf Hitler and disliked minorities and athletes
and belonged to a costumed social group called the ``Trenchcoat
Mafia.'' Most of the members, numbered to be about 15, graduated
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said a note had been found at the home of one of the
gunmen but did not release details. CNN reported that it was a
suicide note and indicated the two teen-agers acted alone. ``This
is the way we want to go out,'' the note said, according to CNN,
which cited unidentified sources.
</P>
<P>
   But sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said police were looking
into the possibility of additional suspects because of the amount
of ammunition and explosives strewn around the school and the
uncertainty about how the two gunmen, masked and dressed in long
black coats, carried it all inside.
</P>
<P>
   There is a ``very good chance there were more people involved,''
Davis said. &UR;  &LR; At least 30 bombs, some on timers and others hidden as
booby traps, were found after the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb discovered in the kitchen was in a duffel bag and
included wiring, a two-gallon can of gasoline and an explosive
device fashioned from a 20-pound propane tank, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume that the gas, if the bottle was full, it would have
been devastating,'' said Sgt. Jim Parr, a Jefferson County
Sheriff's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty pounds of propane can create quite an extensive amount
of damage,'' Davis said. The bomb went undetected in the first
police sweep of the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how it got there. No one has identified them
carrying the tank into the kitchen,'' said District Attorney David
Thomas of the First Judicial District in Golden, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Police have questioned ``associates'' of the gunmen, interviewed
parents and are talking to dozens of the school's 1,900 students.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said investigators are questioning eight to 10 former
members of the ``Trenchcoat Mafia'' who are no longer students at
Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said a third gunmen has not been ruled out, although
physical evidence of another shooter has yet to surface during the
search of the school. Some students who fled the school said they
saw a third gunman.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they would collect damaged tiles and
furniture and take hundreds of photographs to conserve evidence in
case of future charges.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Marianos, of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, said the weapons used would be traced to determine how
the teens obtained them.
</P>
<P>
   At the Harris home, investigators found pipe bomb parts, the
personal diary of Harris and a video the teen-agers filmed at the
school last fall, in which they staged a mock attack on the school,
the Denver Post said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In Harris' school yearbook, the words ``dead, dying'' or
``save'' had been written over some of the pictures, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   School officials said Columbine will be closed indefinitely as
the investigation continues and the damage is assessed. Other
schools in the district reopened Thursday although heavy snow
delayed some openings. Security was tightened in the district.
</P>
<P>
   A plan was being formulated to have Columbine students finish
the school year at other schools, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 23 people wounded in the attack, 14 people remained
hospitalized Thursday, three in critical condition and five in
serious condition.
</P>
<P>
   Families began making funeral arrangements as the 15 bodies _
most of them had lain in the school for 24 hours while police
searched the building _ were released by the coroner. About half
the bodies had been released by late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first to be buried will be Rachel Scott, 17, whose
service is set for Saturday. Scott's automobile, left in the school
parking lot, has become a gathering site for mourning teens.
</P>
<P>
   Another teen will be buried out of state on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The community has held several services and vigils since the
massacre. Hundreds of people, mostly teens, continued to stream
through a media staging area by the parking lot to leave flowers,
butterfly balloons, banners and notes for the victims' families and
the school.
</P>
<P>
   A 50-foot lattice wall was erected to hold bunches of flowers.
Teen-agers huddled to sing hymns, cry and pray.
</P>
<P>
   As the Denver suburb of 35,000 tried to make sense of the
tragedy, President Clinton traveled to a Virginia high school to
address the nation's students. In a meeting with students at T.C.
Williams High School in Alexandria, broadcast to schools elsewhere,
he said U.S. schools ``are still the safest place our kids can
be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They had the wrong reaction to the fact they were `dissed,' ''
he said of the gunmen. ``Look, everybody gets `dissed' some time in
life _ even the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors of the two gunmen have described their families as
respectable, middle class and generally friendly. The boys, while
described as bright and typical teens by many who knew them, had
for some time shown a dark side to others. Students said they had
been belligerent, obsessed with violent computer games and had
threatened school athletes and others who teased them.

TOUTED TALENTS OF BOUCHEZ HARD TO FIND IN `THE DREAMLIFE OF
ANGELS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been a few seasons since a newcomer has taken the European
critical establishment by the storm of Elodie Bouchez, the young
French star of ``The Dreamlife of Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   She won the best actress prize at Cannes, the European Film
Awards' best actress and best newcomer awards, and the best actress
nod of Les Prix Lumieres - a near clean sweep of the major European
awards for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, exactly why her performance has captured the European
critics on such a grand and unanimous scale is not completely
obvious to me on the evidence of this film.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchez does have a melancholy charm, and the movie is
reasonably engrossing, with the look and feel of gritty
authenticity. But why it has been singled out for such lavish
praise is hard to figure.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchez plays Isa, a 20-year-old free spirit who, after some
time on the road, arrives in the northern city of Lille with
nothing but a backpack of possessions and an optimistic attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Instantly, she picks up a job as a seamstress in a sweatshop,
where she makes friends with another rebellious 20-year-old girl
named Marie (Natacha Regnier). Soon, they become friends and
roommates.
</P>
<P>
   Isa soon loses her job, and while vegging around Marie's
apartment one day, she finds the journal of its past occupant, a
young woman who is now in a brain-dead coma after a car wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, Isa becomes obsessed with the accident victim,
reading her journal over and over again, and visiting her bedside
so often that the hospital staff assumes she's a relative.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she becomes increasingly drawn into the plight
of her best friend, Marie, who has fallen into her own obsessive
relationship: a masochistic backstreet affair with a wealthy young
man about town (Gregoire Colin).
</P>
<P>
   However, Isa is utterly helpless on both fronts. The comatose
woman doesn't even know of her existence and sinks further into
oblivion with every passing hour; and Marie's low self-esteem has
put her on a collision course with disaster.
</P>
<P>
   So Isa is more a passive observer of the action of the movie _
the voyeur, the audience point-of-view. Bouchez's acting task is to
communicate the character's growing concern and helplessness in the
face of two situations she can't possibly affect.
</P>
<P>
   As this plays out, Regnier has by far the showier part; the
script mostly requires Bouchez to just stand around looking worried
and sympathetic. And since she doesn't have a particularly
expressive face or demonstrative acting style, she doesn't make a
huge first impression.
</P>
<P>
   But she does somehow linger in the mind long after everything
else in this movie is forgotten. And she has that waiflike,
enigmatic quality that the French tend to find absolutely
irresistible. Whatever she's got, it's made this modest little
Gen-X drama a big hit in Europe and made Bouchez the hottest new
thing in French films.
</P>
<P>
   The Dreamlife of Angels. Directed by Erick Zonca. Screenplay by
Zonca and Roger Bohbot. Cast: Elodie Bouchez, Natacha Regnier,
Gregoire Colin, Jo Prestia, Patrick Mercado. Sony Classics. 113
minutes. In French with English subtitles. Rated R for nudity and

SKETCH OF 2 YOUTHS: CONTRADICTIONS AND CONFUSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for add-on; final 20 grafs are new.)

<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ It was just 11 weeks ago that a court officer
released Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold early from a juvenile
diversion program, saying they had learned the intended lessons in
the months since their arrest and had promising futures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric is a very bright young man who is likely to succeed in
life,'' the officer wrote in a report made public here on Thursday.
``He is intelligent enough to achieve lofty goals as long as he
stays on task and remains motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Klebold, the officer said, ``He is intelligent enough to make
any dream a reality, but he needs to understand hard work is part
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Who could predict that the two high school seniors would move
from minor charges of criminal mischief, theft and trespass to
masterminding one of the worst school massacres in the nation's
history, killing a dozen schoolmates and a teacher before turning
the guns on themselves?
</P>
<P>
   As more bombs were discovered at Columbine High School and names
of the dead were made public on Thursday, the families and closest
friends of the two responsible for the carnage remained in
seclusion. But a fuller portrait of the two perpetrators and their
families is beginning to emerge, and it is filled with
contradictions and confusion.
</P>
<P>
   The killers, who targeted athletes, both had done well in Little
League, teammates said; Harris was fond of wearing a Colorado
Rockies cap before he moved to this Denver suburb from Plattsburgh,
N.Y. They were said to hate minorities, but in Plattsburgh, Harris'
best friends were black and Asian.
</P>
<P>
   In Littleton, their only scrape with the law was the March 1998
arrest that resulted in the juvenile diversion program. They held
jobs at a local pizza place, and a Saturday night out was likely to
be at the Rock `N' Bowl at Belleview Lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Many students recalled nasty interactions in which the young men
insulted and threatened classmates or even flashed weapons; many
others, though, recalled quiet, shy teen-agers who played cards in
the lunchroom and offered to help others make videos or use
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Any warning signs seemed hidden under the black trench coats
they wore, regardless of the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, they dressed a little differently, maybe they dressed in
black, but so, what do priests dress in?'' asked John Adams, whose
daughter was friends with Klebold and often had him over to watch
movies or play computer games. ``Are priests anarchists, do they
blow up things? It's just people trying to set other people apart
because they're different. That's why we have so many of the
problems in this world, because we try to set ourselves apart or
set ourselves above.''
</P>
<P>
   The court officer, whose name was blacked out in the documents,
said Harris ``excelled in school'' and enjoyed an anger management
program that seemed to dovetail with his individual counseling; for
Klebold, the officer said, the 45 hours of community service were
the most effective, as ``he learned a lot from having to give up
free time to work for no money.''
</P>
<P>
   The boys tested negative for drugs, and paid their fees on time.
They wrote letters of apology, and took an ethics class. Harris was
described as ``very articulate and intelligent,'' Klebold as
someone ``with a great deal of potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenny La Plante, a senior who took an early morning bowling
class with both young men, recalled Klebold's tiny gesture of
rebellion: tossing the ball shotput-style from his chest down the
lanes, which annoyed the teacher and the alley management. Harris,
she said, was a star last semester in Composition for the College
Bound. ``He was one of the smartest kids in our class,'' she said.
``He always knew the answers, whether it was a passage from
Shakespeare or a prepositional phrase.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Denver Post reported Thursday that the two young men had
made a video in a production class that showed people in trench
coats gunning down athletes in the school hallways, and were upset
when they were not allowed to show it to classmates. Andrew Breed
and Peter Maher, 17-year-old juniors at Columbine, said they, too,
glimpsed the darker side.
</P>
<P>
   Last July 4th, Breed and Maher said they ran into the two young
men as well as others in the trench coat mafia at a 7-Eleven.
Someone tossed a donut and some biting insults at the crowd with
Harris and Klebold. As they drove away, Maher said he saw someone
in a trench coat waving a pistol-grip shotgun in the air.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, the two groups met again at a nearby
fireworks stand, Breed and Maher said, and the youths in trench
coats were shouting at them in German. Maher said that Harris held
a foot-long lead pipe by his side and another student, who was
questioned after Tuesday's massacre but released, pulled out a
knife.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people at the school get into fights, they throw a few
punches and it's broken up, but no, they wanted to put us in the
hospital,'' Breed recalled. ``I was going to beat the crap out of
him, but then I'm glad I didn't because I would have probably been
the target. They would probably have been looking for me on this
day, so I'm glad I didn't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Breed said he has known Klebold since they were on the same
baseball team in first grade. But this year, Breed said, if someone
bumped into Klebold in the hallway, he would say, ``I'll kill
you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a normal kid,'' Breed said. ``I don't know what
happened. He turned into a nutcase.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Harris and Klebold come from middle-class families. Dylan's
father, Thomas, is a retired geologist who now runs a real estate
company from his home. His mother, Susan, works in the local
community college system, counseling disabled students, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I can tell, this family was utterly, utterly
normal,'' Michael Briand, a colleague of Klebold's mother, told The
Associated Press. ``They did everything right. But somehow the pain
and anger was too deep, and they didn't see it or couldn't reach
it. This has got to be a pervasive thing in our society if it can
reach this far, into families like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris' father, Wayne, is a decorated Air Force pilot who
retired as a major after 20 years of service in 1993, and now works
in the administration at Flight Safety Services, a pilot training
school in Englewood, not far from here.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Katherine, works at a catering service in town and
his older brother, Kevin, is a student at the University of
Colorado in Boulder. Scott Berg, a sophomore at the university who
also attended Columbine, said Kevin Harris is ``just the sort of
guy his brother was gunning for.''

 LITTLETON, Colo.: gunning for.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kevin Harris was an honor student and played tight end for the
Columbine Rebels, Berg said, and Harris' mother went to all the
games, even when their son was only on junior varsity. Berg's
younger brother Steve, an athlete at Columbine, said he recently
confronted Harris during bowling class.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother's Jewish, and this whole Naziism thing really
bothered him,'' Scott Berg said. ``So he went up to these guys and
said, what's with all this German stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   It is those allegations of racism that are most baffling to
friends and neighbors that Harris left behind in Plattsburgh, a
small town about an hour south of Montreal, in 1993, when the Air
Force base where his father was stationed closed.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the portrait of an awkward outsider that has been
drawn since the shooting, his friends here say that although Harris
was more reserved than many of his peers, he was well-liked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had all these little cliques, and he was right along with
all of us,'' said Nora Bordeau, 17, a former classmate. ``He was a
quiet kid, but he had a lot of friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his closest friends, they said, were two boys from the
base who have also moved away; one was black, the other Asian.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of his good friends was this Asian kid who was also a very
good athlete, so I don't think anyone would say he had a problem
with either athletes or minorities when he was here,'' said Mike
Condo, 18.
</P>
<P>
   Harris became an avid Rockies fan even before his family moved
West, and often wore a baseball cap in Plattsburgh. His father
urged him to join Little League to meet other kids, and people here
said his parents came to every game as well as some practices.
Whenever a boy went up to bat, recalled Brendan LaPier, 17, a
former teammate, Harris' father offered ``a pat on the back and a
little confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris was an average player who didn't mind being alone and
spent a lot of time in the dugout. When the shy right-fielder came
up to bat, he would stare at the pitcher and ready his stance, then
let the balls zoom past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to kind of egg him on to swing, to hit the pitch
sometimes,'' said Terry Condo, his former coach. ``It wasn't that
he was afraid of the ball, just that he didn't want to miss. He
didn't want to fail.''
</P>
<P>
   During a sixth-grade field trip to Boston, Harris and his
classmates visited a pizza restaurant, where he ate scrambled egg
pizza and then played video games. One game, called Lethal
Enforcer, in which a plastic gun is fired at the screen, seemed to
really capture his fascination, his friends recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Pasti, 17, said Harris left an inscrutable message on his
middle-school yearbook: ``You've been a good friend. Have a great
summer. I'll send you a shirt from Denver. I'm going to miss all of
you. Mochenderrystinckypoo, Eric Harris.''
</P>
<P>
   Though schools in Plattsburgh have been closed this week for
spring break, many former classmates have been gathering in each
other's homes to watch the news with horror. At first, some were
concerned about his safety and tried to contact him, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Like their counterparts in Colorado, most in Plattsburgh
remember Harris as a student who got A's and B's and loved computer
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the one thing I can remember him talking about, the
games he played and the levels he would get,'' said LaPier. ``He
would just come up and tell you about it, while, otherwise, he was
the kind of person you would have to approach if you wanted to
talk.''
</P>
<P>
   That love of computers may be connected to the killing spree as
investigators searching for clues about the perpetrators turn to
the recesses of cyberspace, where documents attributed to the two
killers talk of their darker interests and inspirations.
</P>
<P>
   America Online has deleted web postings connected to Harris
because of the incident, but material posted on the Internet on
Thursday appeared to replicate his previous Websites and postings,
according to several people who viewed and copied the pages before
they were removed Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Material on the Web attributed to Harris included instructions
on how to build pipe bombs like those used on Tuesday and an
illustration of a creature toting a shotgun and knife, standing on
a pile of skulls. Also on the site are the song lyrics: ``WHAT I
DON'T SAY I DON'T DO.'' ``WHAT I DON'T DO I DON'T LIKE.'' ``WHAT I
DON'T LIKE I WASTE.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important piece of evidence is a document
discussing weapons of destruction. ``Shrapnel is very important if
you want to kill and injure a lot of people,'' it reads. ``Almost
anything small and metal will work.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on the Web site, there is an illustration apparently made
by Harris of a man shooting automatic pistols, a large monster with
horns, and a boy with eyes wide open and pointing two pistols out
at the screen. In big red letters, it says: ``I HATE YOU. ERIC
HARRIS OWNS EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU: The fireworks will be set in
the four twenty one!! Doom will become reality!''
</P>
<P>
   A profile Harris may have written for his AOL account states his
hobbies as playing the video game Doom and ``meeting beautiful
females, being cool.''
</P>
<P>
   It includes a personal quote: ``Quit whining, it's just a flesh
wound _ Kill Em AALLL!!!''

SEOUL'S LEADER IRKED BY OPPOSITION CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ President Kim Dae-jung has been lionized
around the world for his lifetime of struggle for human rights in
Korea, and he is often mentioned as a candidate for the Nobel Peace
Prize because of his efforts to achieve peace and democracy on the
Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   So it is discomforting for Kim that his government is being
denounced by a Korean opposition party this week in Geneva at the
U.N. Commission on Human Rights. Members of the National Assembly
are accusing him of using torture and illegal surveillance to
suppress his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some positive steps taken by Kim,'' Lee
Shin-bom, a National Assembly member who is leading the delegation
to Geneva, said in a telephone interview. ``But overall the
situation has deteriorated in many areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who like Kim is a longtime fighter for democracy in South
Korea and a former political prisoner, accused the government in a
speech to the U.N. commission of endemic misuse of police,
prosecutors and the intelligence agency for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The catalog of accusations, strikingly similar to those that Kim
used to level against previous presidents, has left Kim's
supporters outraged and bewildered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nonsense, it's groundless,'' said Jay Yoo, vice president
of Kim's party, the National Congress for New Politics. Yoo said he
could understand the opposition's objecting to Kim's economic
measures or foreign policy, but not suggestions that Kim has become
dictatorial since taking office a bit more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one gauge that South Korea remains vibrantly democratic
is that Kim's critics say the nastiest things about him and get
away with it. Moreover, at least at the surface, South Korea has
never been freer, for Kim has freed longtime political prisoners
who had been punished for praising the communist government in
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think democracy functions well here,'' said a Western
diplomat in Seoul. ``Koreans have won their long struggle for
democracy, and it is working well.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the leading opposition party, the Grand National Party,
is accusing Kim of betraying the cause of democracy and of using
the government apparatus for political purposes. The Grand National
Party, which organized the delegation to Geneva to denounce Kim,
previously dominated South Korea and now is on the outside of
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Kim Dae-jung's intention is to see the collapse of
the opposition party,'' Lee Hoi-chang, leader of the Grand National
Party and Kim's rival in the last presidential election, said this
week. ``If that happens, there will be no democracy in Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Hoi-chang and other critics assert in particular that Kim
has used threats of punishment and exposure of damaging information
to force members of other parties in the National Assembly to join
Kim's party. In addition, Lee Hoi-chang's brother has been
imprisoned and is now on trial on charges of campaign finance
violations, in what critics complain is a political prosecution.
``The intention is to implicate my brother and inflict political
damage on me,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been awkward for the Grand National Party to denounce
Kim for being dictatorial, because it previously engaged in many of
the abuses that it is complaining about now that it is in the
opposition.

   IBM LIFTS DOW TO RECORD AS NASDAQ AND S&AMP;P SOAR
</P>
<P>
   IBM's strong profit report helped propel the stock market to
another big advance as large growth stocks, which had fallen out of
favor as perhaps too expensive just a couple of weeks ago,
continued to rebound.
</P>
<P>
   The rally brought another record for the Dow Jones industrial
average, which rose 145.76 points, or 1.38 percent, to 10,727.18.
The Nasdaq composite index did even better, gaining 72.53 points,
or 2.91 percent, to 2,561.61, just 37 points shy of its all-time
high. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 22.7 points, or
1.7 percent, to 1,358.82, also a record.

   GREENSPAN BACKS WIDER DOLLAR USE
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before a congressional committee, Alan Greenspan,
the Federal Reserve chairman, and Lawrence H. Summers, the deputy
treasury secretary, presented a united openness to other countries
seeking to adopt the dollar as their national currency, but warned
that such a move should not replace sound monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   INTEL TO EXPAND TO THE INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   Intel said it was planning a big move into the Internet services
business. The strategy is a striking departure for the maker of
Pentium chips that serve as the electronic brains of most personal
computers and reflects how far Intel is willing to go to grow.

   LAZARD SETTLES MUNICIPAL BOND CASE
</P>
<P>
   Lazard Freres &AMP; Co., the Wall Street investment bank, agreed to
pay $11 million to settle federal charges for inflating the prices
of government securities it sold to municipalities. The settlement
ends the firm's disastrous foray into municipal finance.
</P>
<P>
   PEPSICO EARNINGS BEAT FORECASTS
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings,
but the company's shares fell after its chief financial officer
said future earnings might be a little lower than analysts had been
led to believe by the company's chairman and chief executive, Roger
A. Enrico. Pepsico will spend $75 million to upgrade its computer
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Profits at Lucent Technologies, the phone-equipment maker,
Airtouch Communications, Bell Atlantic and GTE met or surpassed
Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox said first-quarter earnings rose 14 percent, mostly
through cost cuts, but its shares fell because revenue did not
increase.
</P>
<P>
   COCA-COLA ACCUSED OF RACIAL BIAS
</P>
<P>
   A group of black employees filed a class-action lawsuit accusing
Coca-Cola of discriminating against African-Americans in pay,
promotions and performance evaluations. The suit contends that the
company pays its average black employee nearly $27,000 a year less
than its average white employee and limits black workers' chances
for promotion.

   CRACKDOWN ON WEB INVESTIGATORS

   The federal government began cracking down on the deceptive

   PROFIT DECLINES 54 PERCENT AT RJR NABISCO
</P>
<P>
   In its final quarter as an international tobacco and food
company, RJR Nabisco Holdings reported that its first-quarter
earnings fell 54 percent because of costs to settle tobacco
litigation and declining cigarette sales.
</P>
<P>
   EXPORT GROWTH PLUNGES TO 3.5 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   The World Trade Organization said the rate of growth in world
merchandise exports fell to 3.5 percent last year _ only one-third
of its 1997 growth rate _ mainly because of the Asian economic
crisis. It warned that growth could slow further this year.
</P>
<P>
   GITIC CASE WORSE THAN EXPECTED
</P>
<P>
   In another blow to foreign banks, a Chinese court said that it
expected to salvage only $783 million in assets from one of China's
largest and most troubled companies, Guangdong International Trust
and Investment.

UCLA'S SCATES SYNONYMOUS WITH VOLLEYBALL SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The phone rings in Al Scates' Tarzana home. He
picks up the receiver and answers, ``Volleyball.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs at his gaffe, but it's totally in character to anyone
who knows Scates.
</P>
<P>
   His teams have won 17 national titles and more than 900 matches
in his 37 years as UCLA's men's coach. Since men's volleyball
became an official NCAA sport in 1970, Scates has had 34 players
earn All-America honors, coached seven Olympic medalists, seven
Players of the Year and the biggest name in the game: Karch Kiraly.
</P>
<P>
   His success has been so unusual in the sport that Scates was
inducted into the Volleyball Hall of Fame in Holyoke, Mass., even
though inductees usually have to have been retired for five years
to be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's dominance of the men's college game has been so
consistent that there hasn't been a player who spent four years in
the Bruins program who hasn't won at least one
national-championship ring.
</P>
<P>
   But this season has tested even Scates' mettle. The 20-6 Bruins
have suffered through more injuries and illnesses than any in
recent memory. This season, UCLA lost four straight matches _
including one to UC Irvine, which had never beaten UCLA _ for the
first time ever. Brigham Young beat it 15-0 in a game, the first
time in six years that the Bruins had been skunked.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament begins
Saturday, UCLA will be on the road. Scates was so sure the Bruins
would play at home, he listed the Wooden Center as the match site
on the team schedule. Instead, they're at Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   And to top it off, Scates was reprimanded by the conference for
comments he made about the officiating on the Bruins' trip to
Brigham Young.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the 59-year-old coach, who impressed John Wooden with
his meticulous practices, isn't changing his tune. Always
optimistic, Scates maintains his team is on track to win another
national championship when the Final Four comes to Pauley Pavilion
on May 6 and 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``He envisions success and so do his teams,'' said Denny Cline,
who played for Scates from 1974-76 and won NCAA titles each year,
then assisted Scates from 1977-84 and won five more titles. ``It's
a mind-set. You have to win the last games. You're used to doing
things that way . . . and he has a very good plan.''
</P>
<P>
   One his players always believe in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in his mind,'' junior opposite hitter Ed
Ratledge said. ``He doesn't give us a lot of lame pep talks. He
knows confident athletes play better. By not cutting us down, he
instills confidence in us.''
</P>
<P>
   Scates knows who and what he seeks, so much so that when it
comes to choosing players, he doesn't have to recruit. He hasn't
seen a future Bruin play since Tom Stillwell arrived six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he never personally scouted Kiraly, who went on to win
three Olympic gold medals. Kiraly wrote in his autobiography, ``The
Sand Man,'' he drove 60 miles from Santa Barbara to meet Scates
supposedly halfway, while the coach rode his bicycle two miles
(Scates said it was 10 miles, and he had to get on the freeway.)
</P>
<P>
   Cline once received a letter from Scates. It began, ``Dear
Dan.''
</P>
<P>
   Scates' assistant coaches _ all of whom have played for him _
know the kind of player he wants: one who comes from a winning
program, is self-motivated and knows how to win, will work hard in
practice and hates losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're used to winning,'' Scates said. ``They know what it
takes to win. I don't want to retrain someone. It's an advantage to
get competitive players who are used to winning.''
</P>
<P>
   A winning attitude also means someone who plays 100 percent all
the time, which is why Scates makes practices tougher than matches.
If you don't practice well, you don't play. And if you continue to
fare poorly, you'll drop from the main practice court to the
secondary court behind the infamous Blue Curtain.
</P>
<P>
   The need for toughness began in Scates' childhood. His father,
Ed, never wanted his son to run from a fight, so he paid kids to
come to his garage and box little Allen. When Al beat one kid, a
bigger one awaited next time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strong survive in our program,'' Scates said. ``A weaker
competitor will come and say, `If you tell me I'm a starter, I'll
play better.' The real competitor never asks. He just gets
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Every drill, pitting the first team against the second team, has
a winner and loser. Scates and his assistants often rig the match
with a bad call so the second team wins, thus infuriating the
starters but preparing them for match-like conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Ratledge transferred from Long Beach State and immediately
became impressed that Scates never scheduled three-hour practices
the day before a match. Nor does he ever insult or speak
condescendingly to his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people will tell you it's hard work that wins,''
Ratledge said. ``Al Scates is a man who knows how hard to work and
when.''
</P>
<P>
   Even John Wooden was impressed. Then again, Wooden always liked
volleyball and sometimes stopped his practices when they weren't
going well and let his teams play volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed at Al's ability and his teaching,'' Wooden said.
``He was one of the premier teachers. He ran a clean practice, well
organized and covered all the details.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great respect,'' Wooden said. ``His record speaks for
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   In matches, the object is to win, but it's OK to lose as long as
you beat a team the last time you play.
</P>
<P>
   Example: Last season, UCLA lost the MPSF championship to
Pepperdine but beat the Waves in the NCAA final.
</P>
<P>
   Scates knew UCLA would make the Final Four regardless of the
outcome. So he tried various lineups and plays, all the while
keeping his detailed statistics. To the untrained eye, the stats
resemble hieroglyphics. To Scates, they are a system that shows
what a UCLA player or what an opposing player did in a particular
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   He also videotapes every match and carefully breaks down every
play. The tape and stats showed Scates that during one rotation,
Pepperdine never set the middle, so he instructed his middles to
slide outside and block.
</P>
<P>
   Result: Pepperdine never scored a point on that rotation and
UCLA won its 17th national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``What coach Scates has is a system of analysis that helps train
the players for the next time,'' Cline said. ``He is a master of
coming up with ways to minimize his (team's) weaknesses and
maximizing ways to score.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratledge said his Long Beach coaches told their teams they're
every bit as good as UCLA, but Ratledge couldn't understand how
UCLA always won.
</P>
<P>
   He knows now.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew our tendencies better than we knew theirs,'' he
said. ``They scouted us better. He's a master of scouting.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of how Scates has won so much _ 966 matches, more
than any other men's or women's volleyball coach; why he has been
named the sport's coach of the year five times.
</P>
<P>
   And why he continues to believe that in spite of this season's
hardships, a national championship is possible in spite of having
to play at Hawaii and then at BYU.
</P>
<P>
   Scates' former players understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 30 years of coaching, you believe it,'' said Charlie
Jackson, who finished his career in 1998. ``You think, `He knows so
much more than I do.' If he says it with confidence, you don't
challenge it.''

TEARFUL AMY FISHER FACES VICTIM IN COURT AND APOLOGIZES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINEOLA, N.Y. _ With tears in her eyes, Amy Fisher apologized
Thursday to Mary Jo Buttafuoco for shooting her in the face seven
years ago when she was having an affair with Mrs. Buttafuoco's
husband, Joey.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Buttafuoco, who still has the bullet lodged in her neck and
suffers from lingering nerve damage, said she accepted the apology
and urged the judge to release Ms. Fisher from prison so she could
start a new life. The judge accepted her request and reduced Ms.
Fisher's sentence, making her eligible for parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has shown true remorse and sorrow for what she did to
me,'' Mrs. Buttafuoco, 44, told the court. She then turned to Amy
and said, ``You are being given a second chance in life, and I pray
you will take it and make something positive out of all this
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fisher was 17 when she shot Buttafuoco on May 16, 1992. She
initially claimed that Buttafuoco had urged her to kill his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The courtroom proceeding Thursday paved the way for Ms. Fisher
to be released on parole soon.
</P>
<P>
   Absent from the courtroom Thursday morning was Buttafuoco, 43,
an auto body repairman. He and his wife have since moved their
family to California, where Buttafuoco has worked as an actor and
radio talk shot host. Although Buttafuoco had denied having a
sexual relationship with Ms. Fisher, he did plead guilty to
statutory rape in October 1993 and served six months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Also absent Thursday morning was Eric W. Naiburg, the lawyer who
first represented Ms. Fisher and urged her to plead guilty in
October 1992. Ms. Fisher has charged that Naiburg lied to her about
the consequences of her plea, promising her that she would be
released from prison in in three and a half years. Ms. Fisher also
has charged him with having a sexual relationship with her when he
was representing her.
</P>
<P>
   Naiburg again Thursday denied the charges and limited his
comments to Thursday morning's events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy for Ms. Fisher,'' he said. ``Obviously the work
I did on her behalf has borne fruit. If Mary Jo can forgive Amy for
shooting her, and Joey for inspiring the shooting, I too can be
forgiving.''
</P>
<P>
   The somber mood of Thursday morning's court proceedings was
broken only briefly after Fred Klein, an assistant Suffolk County
district attorney, attempted to explain to the court why he was
recommending a shorter sentence for Ms. Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said several factors were taken into consideration,
including the fact that `` Buttafuoco raped Amy when she was 16
years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Buttafuoco jumped to her feet and shouted: ``Stop it, Fred.
Look at me when you say that Fred, you son of a bitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Buttafuoco was restrained by her lawyer, Dominick A.
Barbara, who told Nassau County Court Judge Ira H. Wexner,
``Obviously there are a number of very heated and unreconciled
issues here today.''
</P>
<P>
   The parole board is scheduled to meet on May 3 at the Albion
Correctional Facility in upstate New York, where Ms. Fisher has
spent most of her time in prison. If they hear her case at that
meeting, she could be released later that week, said a board
spokesman, Thomas Grant. Barket said he hoped that Ms. Fisher, who
was still in the Nassau County jail, would be returned to Albion in
time for the hearing.

`PUSHING TIN' FAILS AS A COMEDY AND A THRILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   English director Mike Newell has an uncanny knack for producing
art house films with a wide audience appeal _ a list that includes
``Dance With a Stranger,'' ``Enchanted April,'' ``Into the West,''
and ``Four Weddings and a Funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   And his only Hollywood film of the '90s, the mafia drama
``Donnie Brasco,'' was a near slam-dunk that worked as a breathless
gangster saga, a funny slice of lower-middle-class life and a
perfect star vehicle for Johnny Depp and Al Pacino.
</P>
<P>
   But he definitely has his off days. His follow-up to that
critical success, a clumsy comedy-drama called ``Pushing Tin,'' is
a dismal misfire _ almost as excruciating in its own way as
Newell's career nadir, ``An Awfully Big Adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Billed as a thriller about overstressed air traffic controllers,
it's almost devoid of aeronautical excitement, and its concerns are
so juvenile it often seems to have the macho sensibility of a '60s
biker movie.
</P>
<P>
   The hero is Nick Falzone (John Cusack), a hotshot controller who
works with an Animal House of misfits who ``push tin'' around the
overcrowded, unfriendly skies above Newark, N.J., in a single
viewless, claustrophobic room.
</P>
<P>
   One day, a new maverick controller, Russell (Billy Bob Thornton,
looking as scruffy and antisocial as he did in ``Chopper Chicks in
Zombietown''), arrives on the scene riding a big motorcycle. He and
Nick take an instant dislike for one another.
</P>
<P>
   When Nick beds Russell's alcoholic wife (Angelina Jolie),
Russell makes overtures toward Nick's wife (Cate Blanchett), and
pretty soon the guys are in such a war of one-upmanship that _ like
kids playing a computer game _ they're competing to see who can
squeeze the most planes in the narrowest air space.
</P>
<P>
   The point, of course, is that the pressure of the air traffic
controllers' jobs is so heavy that it tends to drive them nuts, and
endangers all our lives. That point is made well in one or two
chilling scenes. But most of the rest of the movie is a bore. The
testosterone battle between these two geeks _ racing each other on
the freeway, seducing each other's wives, slugging it out in the
control room _ makes them seem so repulsively adolescent you just
want to get away from them.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does it fail as a compelling character study, it's
never funny enough to work as a comedy, or gripping enough to work
as a thriller. Is there anything less exciting than watching a
character watch a video screen for endless amounts of screen time?
Does anyone really want to see a disaster epic without a disaster
in it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Pushing Tin'' does have one saving grace, however. As Nick's
long-suffering wife, Blanchett gives the movie some badly needed
charisma, and its one point of sympathy _ even nobility. If there
were any lingering doubt after ``Elizabeth,'' her big
change-of-pace role as a cheated-upon Jersey housewife in this
otherwise empty vessel is proof positive. The woman is a movie
star.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing Tin. Directed by Mike Newell. Screenplay by Glen Charles
and Les Charles, from an article by Darcy Frey. Cast: John Cusack,
Billy Bob Thornton, Cate Blanchett, Angelina Jolie, Jake Weber. 124
minutes. Rated R for language and brief nudity.

EMOTIONS HEAT UP AS RACE FOR BIG 12 TITLE ESCALATES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was Baylor's darkest hour in ... oh, a couple of months. But
Bears coach Steve Smith was sitting tall in the saddle.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the first-base line reviewing for the media the
sequences that led to Baylor's first back-to-back losses since the
season's opening week, Smith was being loudly heckled by a Texas
A&AMP;M fan, who had an appreciation for a personally abusive phrase.
</P>
<P>
   Finally Smith _ a former A&AMP;M assistant _ turned toward his
admirer and said, ``Suppose you just try to /act'' like you've got
some class and sit down and shut up?''
</P>
<P>
   End of heckling.
</P>
<P>
   But with four nationally ranked Texas teams rolling down the
stretch in the Big 12's final weeks, emotions are beginning to heat
up.
</P>
<P>
   At Disch-Falk Field in Austin, Texas Tech shortstop Lance
Woodcock had to be restrained from climbing into the stands after a
Texas fan, who was involved in an altercation with Woodcock's
father.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Woodcock had unknowingly seated himself amid ``The
Wild Bunch,'' a charming knot of Texas fanatics whose heckling
techniques _ aimed at Woodcock in this case _ are legendary.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, order was restored, one individual was ejected and
the 10th-ranked Red Raiders (35-10, 15-5) won two of three in a
hostile environment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the battle between A&AMP;M (35-10, 16-4) and Baylor
(37-9, 16-5) was carried out in the style of a Super Regional.
</P>
<P>
   For the series opener in Waco, each team put an All-American on
the mound _ Jason Jennings (9-0) for the Bears against Casey Fossom
(7-4) for the Aggies. Jennings threw a tough, 147-pitch complete
game while Fossom struggled as the Bears won, 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   The series then moved to College Station, where nearly 20,000
fans perched in and around Olsen Field for the final two games. The
Aggies captured two dramatic one-run victories, as catcher Shawn
Schumacher hit a two-run homer in the eighth to win the first and a
two-run single in the ninth to win the second.
</P>
<P>
   But the soft-spoken Schumacher also rankled Smith with a remark
that the first win had ``broken Baylor's bubble.''
</P>
<P>
   After the series final, Smith retorted: ``Our bubble isn't burst
by any stretch of the imagination. We came in here against a
nationally ranked team in a tough environment and lost two games in
the last at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of the way this team battled, and I still like our
chances.''
</P>
<P>
   So does A&AMP;M's Mark Johnson, whose first-place Aggies are the
third-ranked team in the nation, with Baylor sitting at seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a great team,'' Johnson said, ``and they've got a
better-looking schedule from here on out than the rest of us. This
isn't over.''
</P>
<P>
   So this weekend, the Bears will try to regroup with three at
home against struggling Oklahoma (21-21, 6-12); A&AMP;M will play host
to Kansas (10-30, 4-20). Tech will be on the road at Kansas State
(16-21, 5-13); No. 24 Texas (29-17, 13-8) will visit Iowa State
(14-25, 1-17).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Western Athletic Conference leader Rice became the
first Texas team to reach 40 victories (40-8, 18-3) and is ranked
second in the nation. The Owls hold a half-game lead over TCU
(26-17, 17-3), which lost to Texas with more than 14,000 in
attendance at The Ballpark in Arlington on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both are on the road this weekend, with the Owls in Hawaii and
TCU visiting Nevada-Las Vegas.

BRADLEY OUTLINES VISION FOR A 21ST-CENTURY PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Although hard to draw out on details, former Sen. Bill
Bradley on Thursday mapped broad outlines of a 21st-century
presidency he said would have greater vision, more authority
delegated and fewer daily sound bites than life under Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The former New Jersey senator skewered the Clinton
administration on its Yugoslavia bombing campaign, committed
himself to expanded trade with China, and said America's top
spending priority should be its neglected children.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley came to Seattle to raise $250,000 for his presidential
campaign, and to draw out differences between himself and Vice
President Al Gore, the leading Democratic presidential contender.
</P>
<P>
   The one-time New York Knicks forward argued that the
administration had no game plan last month when NATO launched its
aerial war against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have said from the beginning that objectives of this
operation were not clear. You do not have success without clear
objectives,'' Bradley said at a meeting with Seattle
Post-Intelligencer editors.
</P>
<P>
   If the goal of the United States and its allies was to avert
ethnic cleansing, Bradley said, ``It's already happened.'' If NATO
wanted to stop the conflict from spreading to unstable states
bordering Serbia and Kosovo, ``It has already spread.''
</P>
<P>
   Although offering support for U.S. troops in the field, Bradley
offered a biting analysis of proposed commitment of ground forces
to Kosovo. ``I've always believed you do not commit military force
into some place without figuring out how you get out of that
place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley traced what he called U.S. policy blunders over
Yugoslavia back to the Bush administration. He noted that U.S.
peacekeepers have been in Bosnia more than three years, not the
promised three to four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said in a (1996) speech in the Senate that we had just
created the next Berlin,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was campaigning in Washington state at the same time
President Clinton was traveling to a Washington, D.C.-area high
school for a televised talk with students in the wake of killings
at a Colorado high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is what he (Clinton) does, he is comfortable with it, and
it is reassuring.... But it is not my way of doing things,''
Bradley said of Clinton's public empathizing.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said the presidency offers America's premier bully
pulpit, but is not meant for non-stop preaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea, since Ronald Reagan, has been that the essence of
public policy is you dominate the daily news cycle,'' he said.
``(It seems that) the president has to be on the evening news each
night.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bradley's view, constant exposure gives the White House small
tactical victories but deprives it of the ability to convincingly
offer a larger vision and goals to the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Franklin D. Roosevelt used to go on boat trips for three
weeks,'' he said. ``When he spoke, people wanted to hear what he
had to say. He spoke with an authority you do not have by competing
for airtime with TV anchormen.''
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of China, Bradley is an unabashed supporter of
China trade and strongly opposes any restrictions on commerce tied
to China's human rights policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more China opens up, the more it ultimately liberalizes,''
he said. ``You now see a higher level of political freedom in China
than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said China should be allowed to join the World Trade
Organization ``with no special favors'' and should be welcomed into
the international financial system.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century after he played with the Knicks' winning
teams, Bradley, 55, can still display an off-court elusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   He is eloquent on such objectives as helping children achieve
and bringing about racial reconciliation in America. But he gives
few details of of how he would achieve such goals.
</P>
<P>
   He would ``do something'' about teen pregnancies and ``deal
with'' the fact that one in every five children grows up in
poverty. He said he strongly feels the need for strong families
teaching children ``that there is a meaning to life deeper than the
material.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a vision, after which comes the policies and
then the actions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has shown signs of catching on in polls. A recent
Reuters-Zogby survey showed him trailing Gore by 54 percent to 35
percent in New Hampshire, site of a crucial early primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said the Clinton impeachment saga may have broken the
personal ``invasiveness'' of presidential campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fever is broken,'' he said. ``We can get back to talking
about things that are substantive and relevant.... The people have
a right to know whether I am a crook.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have a right to know whether I am a sinner. We're
all sinners.''

FIXES QUOTE ATTRIBUTION TO SCHRAMM, STED ROZELLE, 4TH TO LAST GRAF 
THE DAY REALITY BIT THE TOY DEPARTMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the newspaper business, they don't call us the toy department
for nothing. To locate our workplace, first take the escalator to
the top of the building, bypassing electronics, household goods,
cosmetics, jewelry, furniture, and also Dennis Rodman's favorite,
women's lingerie.
</P>
<P>
   And then, once you've escaped the real world, there we are,
totally isolated from reality.
</P>
<P>
   Could I possibly interest you in the Nine-Toed Deion,
battery-operated, complete with fake limp, mechanical doll?
</P>
<P>
   The real world is forced to deal with a Slobodan Milosevic.
About as bad as it gets for us is George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, however, there does come an occasional time when
not even the toy department can sequester itself from tragedy, from
violence, or from natural disasters. Even the normal isolation the
jock kingdom enjoys, including the media who report on that
kingdom, can be instantly shattered, so great is the emotional
impact.
</P>
<P>
   Such, of course, was the case in Denver this week, when the
city's major-league baseball team, the NBA team, and the hockey
club all immediately postponed games. In the case of hockey, an
entire playoff series was rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The governor of Colorado didn't make this request of the teams,
nor the Denver mayor. This involved owners, and mainly jocks,
acting on their own feelings. Even players from those visiting
teams in Denver requested not to play, saying they were in shock
and grief over what happened at Columbine High School in Littleton,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Sports does serve as a reality escape, but none of us can run
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the most trying of times, professional sports has almost
always provided the one constant hideout. President Roosevelt asked
major-league baseball to continue to play with makeshift rosters
during World War II, citing a national morale boost.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, the games go on, as long as a stadium or an
arena is still standing.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, what happened this week near Denver caused a
nagging personal question to resurface. For nearly four decades, I
have wondered how in the name of decency could the late Pete
Rozelle have ordered NFL teams to take the field on Sunday, Nov.
24, 1963?
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier in Dallas, President John F. Kennedy had been
shot and killed. When NFL games kicked off around the country that
weekend, it touched off an obvious controversy. Commissioner
Rozelle made a decision he would later admit haunted him forever.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to creating positive public relations for the NFL,
Rozelle was known as a master. But this?
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete would say many times after that how much he considered it
a mistake,'' said Tex Schramm, a close friend of Rozelle's, and the
Cowboys' longtime president and general manager. ``But truthfully,
I thought he had made the right decision because it was an
alternative for a nation in grief. Jack Ruby, however, erased any
positive that could have come out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Schramm, Rozelle contacted John Kennedy's confidant
and friend, Pierre Salinger, to ask for advice on playing the
Sunday games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salinger had been on a State Department trip to the Far East
and was returning when he called Pete on an air phone,'' said
Schramm. ``He told Pete in his opinion Jack would want the games
played that Sunday. Salinger recommended Pete go ahead and play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were at Cleveland. ``We flew in there and more than
one player was worried what might happen since we were representing
the city of Dallas,'' said Schramm. ``But then when we got the news
on what Ruby had done \Rshooting and killing Lee Harvey Oswald\S,
the whole stadium was in a mental fog anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rozelle, of course, was wishing NFL teams had not been on
the field. The toy department received a national black eye that
day. Reality bit us.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, however, no praise is necessary, or really deserved,
for decisions made by that chapter of the jock kingdom. Those
postponements were from the heart. Even the toy department has one.

TROJANS LOSING NUMBERS GAME AT RECEIVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's never hard to notice USC wide receiver R. Jay
Soward, but it's become almost impossible to ignore the senior in
spring practices this week after injuries and academic problems
have decimated the Trojans' receiving corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taken most of the snaps,'' Soward said. ``Really, I like
it. It's more of an opportunity to get involved in the offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward and senior Windrell Hayes are the only receivers of note
remaining in spring practice after junior Troy Garner tore knee
ligaments and senior Quincy Woods became academically ineligible.
Junior Stan Guyness has also missed spring practice after tearing
knee ligaments in November.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries and lack of depth mean three incoming freshmen _
Marcell Allmond of St. Paul, Kareem Kelly of Long Beach Poly and
Steve Stevenson of Charter Oak _ will probably play prominent roles
next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, you'd like to redshirt one or two of them, but you
can't think that at the start,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said.
``We're going to find ways to use them. We're going to tell them,
`Go play. Get in there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   One thing to remember with Kelly: He needs to get a qualifying
score on his Scholastic Assessment Test.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett is evaluating how USC should award its 85 scholarships
to avoid future shortages at certain positions. One problem was the
Trojans had five kickers on scholarship when he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not well distributed,'' Hackett said. ``We'll have
18 linemen on scholarship next year. That's what we should have.
We'll only have (three) kickers on scholarship next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans also are trying to add walk-ons. About eight players
have decided to walk on next season, and Hackett would like to get
about 10-12.
</P>
<P>
   __ One more scrimmage: With only one day of spring practice
remaining, USC will hold its final scrimmage today, the Trojans'
third game simulation in the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It's a contrast from last spring, when USC held only one
official scrimmage, but Hackett has warmed to the idea of extra
scrimmages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to go full blast,'' Hackett said. ``I'm going to
scrimmage as many young guys as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Free safety Darnell Lacy, defensive lineman Jason Steen and
fullback Chad Pierson are expected to participate in the scrimmage
after sitting out Thursday's practice to concentrate on classe.
Tight end Antoine Harris, who missed Tuesday's practice to study,
returned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Looking for time: Hackett said senior Donta Kendrick has
emerged as the most improved lineman of spring practice. His
presence could shake up the look of the line. Already, right guard
Travis Claridge has spent considerable time at right tackle, but
Hackett said it is due to junior tackle Matt Welch being out with
shoulder injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Kendrick can play guard or tackle.
</P>
<P>
   __ Big recruit: Among the recruits at Thursday's practice was
highly regarded offensive lineman Paul Mociler of St. John Bosco.
Mociler is considering USC and Notre Dame, among other schools.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE DEVILS MUST DOUSE THE TORCH

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Just call him the Torch now.
</P>
<P>
   After Jaromir Jagr scored the overtime goal that momentarily
silenced Wayne Gretzky's going-away party last Sunday at Madison
Square Garden, the Great One talked about how ``maybe it was
fitting that the best young player in the game'' scored that goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone always talks about passing torches and all that
stuff; Jaromir caught it,'' Gretzky said. ``That's what I told him
after the game. I said, `You caught it.'''
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday night the Pittsburgh Penguins' right wing, who led
the NHL in scoring for the third time during the recent season,
carried that torch into the opening round of the Stanley Cup
playoffs against the New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very nice Wayne said that,'' Jagr was saying before the
game. ``But you've got to prove it in the playoffs. And I want to
prove he was right.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Devils are to survive the first round for the first time
in three years, they must find a way to douse the Torch. Out of
Kladno in the Czech Republic, he is 27, a rugged 6 feet 2 inches
and 230 pounds, his mane of wavy black hair flying from under the
back of his Penguins helmet.
</P>
<P>
   He is expected to be voted the Hart Trophy as the NHL's most
valuable player. He has already scored a career total of 345 goals
during his nine seasons and 50 more in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he plays within the team concept,'' said Robbie
Ftorek, the Devils' coach, ``that's what makes him the player he
is. You try to keep him on the outside and you don't want your
players in the penalty box.''
</P>
<P>
   Jagr scored 44 goals this season, but he led the NHL with 83
assists. He also led the NHL with 34 power-play assists. When
opponents swarmed to stop him during a power play, he wisely was
content to set up others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of anyone in hockey that can dominate an offense
like he does,'' said Scott Stevens, the Devils' defenseman and
captain. ``His teammates feed off him. You want to make him pass
the puck. You just want to control him.''
</P>
<P>
   During the season, the Devils controlled him. Of the Penguins'
13 goals against the Devils during the season, Jagr was involved in
eight (three goals, five assists), but the Devils won four of those
five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be in his face,'' Stevens said, ``but you've got
to be smart. He loves you to come at him. When you do, he braces,
then he rolls off and spins away. So you've got to play between him
and the goal. And you want to try to make him pass the puck.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to hit him, do it off the boards, not in the
open. You want to keep him on his backhand. You would rather have
him go wide than have him cut to the middle because he's really
fast. But he'll always try to beat you to the middle and get you
one-on-one.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Devils won the Stanley Cup in 1995, Stevens' primary
assignment in the Eastern Conference finals was to control the
Flyers' Eric Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jagr is different,'' Stevens said. ``Lindros was more dump the
puck and chase it. Jagr likes to control the puck more than Lindros
does.''
</P>
<P>
   During the season Jagr, with his 127 points, was involved in a
remarkable 53 percent of the Penguins' 242 goals. But of their 13
goals against the Devils, his involvement in eight was an even
higher ratio, 62 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has so many tools in his bag,'' Devils goaltender Martin
Brodeur said. ``Speed. Good shot. The way he sees the ice. You've
got to know where he is all the time. If not, he'll bury you.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the Devils, center Petr Sykora, their leading scorer this
season, has been aware of Jagr the longest.
</P>
<P>
   When Jagr was named to the Czech national team at age 16, Sykora
was an 11-year-old in the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knew Jaromir was going to be great,'' Sykora said.
``And now he's the most popular player in the Czech Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more popular than Dominik Hasek, the Buffalo Sabres'
goaltender whose acrobatics sparked the Czech Republic to the
Olympic gold medal in Nagano, Japan, early last year?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Jagr is more popular there than Hasek,'' Sykora said.
``Because of Jagr's scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   Even better, Jaromir Jagr is now carrying the torch that he
caught from Wayne Gretzky.

STUDENTS INTENDED TO BLOW UP SCHOOL, SHERIFF SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert new 5th thru 9th grafs, beginning: The weapons
found....Adds 2 grafs about Reno at end of story.)  (mk) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Bomb squads on Thursday found a large
home-made bomb made from two propane tanks and a gasoline canister
at Columbine High School, leading the sheriff here to conclude that
two students were out to ``destroy the school'' on Tuesday when
they launched a murderous rampage that left 15 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery also heightened a growing belief that the two
young men who stormed the school firing shotguns and tossing pipe
bombs before taking their own lives had help from others in
planning for the attack, said the Jefferson County sheriff, John P.
Stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were going to burn the school up,'' said Stone, adding
that at least 32 explosive devices and several weapons have now
been found at the scene. The authorities have conducted interviews
with several students at the school who belonged to the group
informally known as the trench coat mafia, to which the two dead
youths belonged, and some members have been given polygraph tests.
So far, there have been no arrests, an investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to piece together the students' motivations and the
extent of preparations for the assault, the investigators have
seized hand-written notes and a short videotape that the two boys,
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, made last fall for a video
production class. Some students have described the video as a
macabre preview of the attack in which trenchcoat-clad students gun
down others who take the role of popular athletes at the school,
though the school district here declined on Thursday to make any
comment on such a video.
</P>
<P>
   The weapons found at the scene were two sawed-off 12-gauge
shotguns, one a double-barrel and the other a pump-action repeater;
a 9-mm semiautomatic rifle, and a 9-mm semiautomatic pistol, said
Larry Bettendorf, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Bettendorf said the 9-mm weapons were fairly new, and that a
preliminary investigation had traced them to a retailer in
Colorado. The shotguns appeared to be as much as three decades old,
so their history could be harder to trace, the agent said.
</P>
<P>
   Bettendorf said he did not know which of the youths owned the
various weapons. The bureau is not releasing data on the
manufacturers at this time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bettendorf said that, with rare exceptions, sawed-off shotguns
are illegal and are used for criminal purposes. To legally possess
a shotgun with a barrel shorter than 18 inches, an owner must
register the weapon and pay a hefty tax to the ATF, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A person must be 18 or older to legally own a rifle or shotgun
and at least 21 to own a pistol, the agent said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also said on Thursday that they believed at least
some of the weapons used in Tuesday's attack may have been stolen,
although they are not sure when.
</P>
<P>
   As local sheriff's department officers and federal law
enforcement officials carried out an investigation they estimated
could take weeks, the mourning for the dead continued for another
day.
</P>
<P>
   Under a spring storm that alternated between snow and rain,
students came to the school grounds on Thursday to be together and
leave offerings at makeshift memorials that have grown 2 1/2 feet
high with flowers in places. But many also questioned whether they
would ever want to set foot inside Columbine High again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our friends died in there,'' said Dave Beadey, a 17-year-old
junior. ``Even if they cleaned it all up, you'd always know that
you were sitting in a place where people got killed. They should
just tear it all down and put up a new school someplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   The superintendent of the Jefferson County School District, Jane
Hammond, said on Thursday that the high school would remain closed
for the rest of this school year, and that school officials were
trying to find a place where Columbine's nearly 2,000 students
could finish the year. Students and teachers alike, Dr. Hammond
said, had implored them to find a place where they could all do so
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want them separated into different settings,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The horrific assault Tuesday continued to prompt sorrow and
soul-searching around the nation, but it also seemed to have
inspired threats of copycat incidents that led the authorities at
schools in at least three states _ California, Texas and
Pennsylvania _ to issue warnings or evacuate schools on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In Wylie, Texas, just northeast of Dallas, a ``profane and
threatening'' statement was found written on a wall of the
intermediate school, the police there said, prompting nearly all
parents to take their children out of the school.
</P>
<P>
   In Pleasant Hill, Calif., about 25 miles east of San Francisco,
College Park High School was evacuated and a bomb squad called in
after a package resembling a bomb was discovered on school grounds.
</P>
<P>
   And in Newtown, Pa., Council Rock High School will be closed
Friday because of ``unsubstantiated rumors circulating in the high
school that contained the threat of potential violence,'' the
principal, David Yates, said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado Springs, Colo., about 60 miles south of Denver, four
teen-agers were charged with trespassing after they arrived at
school in trench coats and masks in an apparent prank.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb found in the kitchen of Columbine High School on
Thursday was made from two 20-pound propane tanks similar to those
used with household grills, along with a gasoline-filled cannister,
which could have caused ``an extensive amount of damage'' had they
been detonated, Sgt. Jim Parr of the Jefferson County sheriff's
office said at a news briefing Thursday night. And Parr held out
the possibility that still more explosive devices could be found as
investigators conduct an ``inch by inch'' search of the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say that all the bombs are out of the
school,'' he said. ``It's a very large building.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Thursday, Stone said that so much explosive material
had been found that the authorities believed there was a good
chance that other people were involved in the deadly attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's drawing suspicion out here that they would have time to
put as much ordnance in that school as they did without some
help,'' the sheriff said.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb was found in a large duffel bag hidden in the kitchen
and was attached to what might have been a remote-controlled
detonation device, an official in the sheriff's office said
Thursday night. It was equipped with nails, BBs and broken glass
intended as shrapnel and, had it been activated during the busy
lunch hour, could have killed scores of people in the kitchen and
adjoining cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of so much powerful explosive material indicated
that the suspects were intent on trying to blow up Columbine High,
said Stone. ``These subjects were not only on a killing rampage,
but they were going to destroy the school.''
</P>
<P>
   While their full motivation remained a mystery, the hatred felt
by the two youths appears in part to have been a grotesque
extension of a long-running feud that members of the trenchcoat
mafia had with more popular cliques at the school, known as
``jocks'' and ``preps.'' New details emerged on Thursday of the
feud, including descriptions by some students of the taunting the
``jocks'' directed at the less-popular students, and of a
near-brawl last summer that started when one member of the
trenchcoat mafia is said to have flashed a shotgun near a local
park.
</P>
<P>
   According to these descriptions, both groups were verbally
abusive, the jocks sometimes referring to the others in derogatory
homosexual terms and the outcast group sometimes invoking Nazi
terminology and threatening to unleash violence at the school.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the students interviewed in the past few days have
insisted that as nasty as this adolescent feud could be, there was
never any widespread fear that it could lead to the kind of horror
unleashed here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, it was just like it must be at every other high school
in America,'' said Breanna Cook, a 17-year-old junior. ``You know,
kids can be really mean to each other, really cruel. It's always
been that way. But you don't expect it to all turn into a real
war.''
</P>
<P>
   And no one seemed to know how the weapons and explosive material
got into the school. ``No one saw them carry it into the school and
people did see them enter,'' Jefferson County District Attorney
David Thomas said Thursday, referring to the bomb discovered in the
kitchen. ``So we have to explore how that device got into the
school.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 people were injured by bullets or shrapnel in the
attack on Tuesday and of these, 14 remain hospitalized, with eight
listed in critical or serious condition.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno came to Littleton Thursday, where
she spent several hours meeting with local officials and listening
to accounts of Tuesday's attack and their response to it, and she
later praised the investigation. Earlier in the day, she called for
stronger drug-control laws and said she hoped the nation would
develop much better ways to identify youths who might be inclined
toward violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get the guns out of the hands of young people,''
she said. ``We've got to make sure they have the counseling, the
support to help them come to grips with the anger of their life
when it occurs.''

MCGWIRE'S NUMBERS POINT TO ANOTHER RECORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM McCONNELL  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For baseball fans, the question is: Can he do it
again?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the real question should be: When will he do it again?
</P>
<P>
   When you crunch Mark McGwire's numbers like he's been crunching
the baseball, you realize his 70-home run season last year was no
fluke. And when you talk to those in baseball who know him best,
there's little question McGwire can equal or break his own record.
It depends on one thing _ his health.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he stays healthy, there's no reason why he can't continue
to hit 60-70 home runs a year for the next three or four years,''
said Rod Dedeaux, who coached McGwire at USC. ``He's always had the
ability to do it. What he has now is the maturity to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   John Scolinos and Art Mazmanian, who along with Dedeaux coached
McGwire on the 1984 USA Olympic team, agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always had the power, but now he's really learned the
strike zone,'' said Scolinos, the former coach at Cal Poly Pomona.
``When we had him on the Olympic team, he had a tendency to be a
wild swinger, to go into slumps, to try to pull everything and hit
every ball 500 feet. When you see him today, he's very disciplined
at the plate. He's learned that all he has to do is hit the ball
and the home runs will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark has always had the same amazing ability to hit the ball a
long, long way,'' said Mt. San Antonio College coach Mazmanian.
``He made a believer out of me when he was on the Olympic team. One
night in Memphis, he switched from an aluminum bat to a wooden one
and still hit three balls up against the fence in left-center
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got tremendous bat speed, which is the key to being a
great hitter. He generates tremendous energy with his swing, which
you know if you have ever stood around the batting cage and watched
him hit. When you put those things together, you understand why he
hits so many home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's career statistics leave little doubt he can match _
and surpass _ the 70-home run barrier.
</P>
<P>
   He's the only hitter in major-league history with three
consecutive 50-plus home run seasons. The 128 home runs he hit in
1997 and 1998 combined are the best two-season total in history
(Babe Ruth is next, at 114). McGwire's home run per-at bat ratio is
the best in history.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most amazingly, he figures to become the only man in
history to surpass the 400 career home run record in one season and
the 500 barrier the next. He needs 38 more homers this year to
reach 500.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, McGwire has benefited from playing in an era when
pitching is diluted, primarily because of expansion. As a rookie
with the Oakland Athletics in 1987, he was on a 70-home run pace
before winding up with 49 (which is itself a record for rookies).
This was accomplished while playing in the spacious Oakland
Coliseum and at a time when there were only 26 major-league teams.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, he had almost exactly the same number of plate
appearances as in 1998, and he walked 71 times. Last year, he
walked 162 times. As his walk totals have increased, so have the
frequency of his home runs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 to 1998, he played in 545 games and hit 219 home runs,
which means he homered in 40 percent of his games. That's a
60-homer-per-season pace.
</P>
<P>
   Which means if you have tickets to all three Cardinals-Dodgers
games this weekend, odds are you will see McGwire hit at least one
home run. That is, if the hamstring injury that has plagued him the
last couple of games doesn't keep him out of the
lineup. &UR; !dlim!!end! &QL;

ADVERTISING: A TRUCE IN TURF WARS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla.)   (jw) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMELIA ISLAND , Fla. _ The advertising industry has long been
enamored of hyperbole in the service of size. So it was appropriate
that the opening general session here Thursday of the 81st annual
meeting of the American Association of Advertising Agencies was all
about bigness: a big client, a big agency company and big news
about a big contentious issue.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is a dispute between the agency association, known as
the Four A's, and its counterpart representing big marketer
clients, the Association of National Advertisers. A surprise
decision by the advertiser association last fall to invite agencies
to join its group has roiled relations between the two trade
organizations, particularly because the move was made after little
or no consultation with officials of the Four A's.
</P>
<P>
   But during a break in the general session Thursday, John Sarsen
Jr., president and chief executive of the advertiser association,
disclosed that he had suspended the invitations pending a study,
``jointly funded and managed'' by both organizations, of ways that
advertisers and agencies could cooperate ``to help marketers build
their brands and build their businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The move seems to be a big retreat by the advertiser
association, whose decision last fall was attacked by several
prominent agency executives who used inflammatory terms like
``sabotage'' and ``power grab.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarsen, of course, does not agree.
</P>
<P>
   Many agency executives considered the invitations ``an
affirmation of their importance to advertisers,'' Sarsen said, and
``we had a whole bunch of agencies say they wanted to be members.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we did it,'' he said, ``we assumed that as most
advertisers are members of multiple associations,'' belonging to
more than one organization ``would not have a negative impact'' on
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in some cases, other agencies said it was an either-or
situation,'' Sarsen added. ``We don't want to do anything that
would negatively impact agencies, so on reflection we said why
don't we jointly look at ways the two organizations can work
together.''
</P>
<P>
   The two associations will hire a consultant who will study the
issues and make recommendations. Consultants are being interviewed,
Sarsen said, and the advertiser association hopes the study can be
completed before its next annual meeting, which is scheduled for
Oct. 9 to 13.
</P>
<P>
   O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive of the Four A's,
who was especially vociferous in his opposition to the invitations,
declared his satisfaction at this turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's not to like about it?'' he asked. ``Having a neutral
party take a look at the two organizations is very worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll still say I don't think they had really thought it
through,'' Drake said, referring to the officials of the advertiser
association. ``To use a marketing analogy, it was like announcing a
new product and not being ready to ship it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another outspoken opponent of the invitations also pronounced
himself pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very sensible approach to have someone from outside
both organizations looking at both organizations,'' said Patrick
McGrath, president and chief executive at Jordan McGrath Case &AMP;
Partners/Euro RSCG in New York, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide
unit of Havas Advertising, ``to see how to help the ANA accomplish
what it set out to do _ enhance our skills at branding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be ways for the two organizations to bring more
efficiency and creativity to solving problems we have together,''
he added, such as difficulties with the federal government or
unions.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath, the 1998-99 chairman of the Four A's, which continues
to meet Saturday, declined to characterize the shift by the
advertiser association as a victory for his association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken off our boxing gloves,'' he said, ``and now we're
going to try to work together.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrath's successor for 1999-2000 at the helm of the Four A's,
Shelly Lazarus, termed the hiring of the consultants as ``the exact
right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's valuable to have a third party with an objective view
come in and give us suggestions,'' said Ms. Lazarus, who is
chairwoman and chief executive at Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide in New
York, part of WPP Group PLC Last fall, Ms. Lazarus said she
believed that agency membership in the advertiser association was
worth considering.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Geier Jr., chairman and chief executive of the
Interpublic Group of Cos. in New York, which owns agencies like
Lowe Group and McCann-Erickson World Group, said, ``Maybe we'll
find ways to work together and maybe not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Either way, having a consultant helping figure it out is by
far the best way to go,'' he added. ``It's a victory for both of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Geier, whose agency company is the world's biggest, with
estimated billings of $37.7 billion, addressed the general session
in a rare public speaking appearance. He focused his speech on the
new media, urging Madison Avenue to go beyond using the new
technology and ``help define its potential and give it a purpose
and a place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk personally, tell stories, spin dreams,'' he added.
``Inform and entertain. Create unique new forms of communication.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Geier said, agencies must remember what he
called Geier's Law: ``People don't change anything like as fast as
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The theorists may like revolutions,'' he added. ``Consumers
prefer evolutions. And guess who's making the final call?''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the big client at the general session was John Pepper
Jr., chairman of the Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., the world's biggest
advertiser. He drew the biggest applause of the day with
exhortations to strengthen the relationships between agencies and
clients.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies must ``create the kind of great advertising campaigns
that create great global leadership brands'' and ``serve consumers
extraordinarily well,'' Pepper declared.
</P>
<P>
   And clients must help agencies create ``more great
advertising,'' by helping them ``to overcome fear,'' he added,
``the greatest inhibitor to relationships that nurture great
ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be a mind-set of great expectations,'' Pepper said.
``Shoot for the moon or reach for the stars, whatever your galactic
preference happens to be.''

BRAZILIANS RAISE $2 BILLION IN SALE OF NOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With strong demand from investors, Brazil sold $2 billion of
five-year notes Thursday, finishing the first leg of a bond sale
that could hit $3 billion, three times the original size.
</P>
<P>
   The second leg of the sale comes Friday, when Brazil decides how
many more notes to sell in exchange for existing Brazilian Brady
bonds, which were created as part of the debt reduction deals done
when bankers restructured their bank loans with Latin American
countries in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Some corporate bond traders said Thursday afternoon that the
swap was rumored to total $1 billion. The rumor was based, in part,
on a report from Brazil by Bloomberg News Thursday morning, quoting
an executive for one of the underwriters, Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, that the sale, originally set at $1 billion, could be
increased to $3 billion. The other underwriter is Salomon Smith
Barney, a unit of Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil made no comment on the size of the exchange in two news
releases Thursday. It remained unclear how attractive a swap of
Brady bonds would be because the securities eligible for the swap
had a higher yield than the new notes.
</P>
<P>
   The Brady bonds, however, are more complicated and harder to
trade. The swap would be based on the yield of the $2 billion of
notes sold Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing just a $1 billion sale last week was probably the
best way for Brazil to test its ability to return to the capital
markets without setting itself up for an embarrassment. And
increasing the size of a deal always looks good.
</P>
<P>
   The sale has been closely watched because it comes just three
months after Brazil devalued its currency, the real, and was faced
with the prospect of rising interest rates, rising inflation and a
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Its success could open the door to global bond markets for
Brazilian corporate borrowers while giving another boost to
emerging markets in general. Already this year, stock and bond
markets in emerging economies have been among the best performers.
This deal follows the return to the market of the Korean
Development Bank last week.
</P>
<P>
   The quick turnaround in Brazil has surprised many investors. It
also left many of them without what they may normally have thought
was the right amount of exposure to Brazil. This fact helped
heighten demand.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors wanted a premium for buying Brazil again.
Brazil apparently was willing to give one.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year notes, maturing in 2004, were priced to yield
11.88 percent, 6.75 percentage points over the yield on the
five-year United States Treasury note. That is just above the yield
of about 11.82 percent now on Brazil's outstanding note that
matures in 2008. A shorter maturity would normally yield less. The
coupon on the note is 11.625 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving a little extra is a smart way to bring investors
back,'' said Barbara Kenworthy, portfolio manager at Prudential
Mutual Funds. She said that she bought a ``small position'' for her
bond funds.

A SYSTEM WITH FEW STANDARDS PUT THE HOLYFIELD JUDGE AT RINGSIDE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Dec. 12, Eugenia Williams was at ringside in Atlantic City,
N.J., to judge a lightweight rematch bout between Arturo Gatti and
Ivan Robinson. The first fight between the highly regarded boxers
had gone 10 bruising rounds, with Robinson gaining a split
decision, and the rematch was just as brutal. Williams scored it
97-92 for Robinson in what was a unanimous decision for the
promising Philadelphian.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' verdict, on its face, struck most observers as
perfectly acceptable, and Gatti himself did not object to it. Now,
however, Gatti's handlers and others have come to question whether
Williams should ever have been in position to judge the fight in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, it turns out, was a friend of Williams and her
daughter. Williams said in a recent interview that she had come to
know and befriend Robinson during his amateur boxing career. Her
daughter went to high school with Robinson, and the daughter and
Robinson were regularly in touch.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, though, did not inform anyone involved in the fight _
not the New Jersey State Athletic Commission or the promoter or the
fighters _ that she and her daughter were friends of Robinson. She
did not have to, and, as she notes, nobody ever asked her to
declare any possible conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had known that, I would have definitely asked her to be
changed,'' Pat Lynch, Gatti's manager, said of the Williams family
friendship with Robinson. ``As a professional, she should have
stepped aside anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' involvement in the Gatti-Robinson fight is not the
only time her professionalism has come under fire.
</P>
<P>
   Her most publicly debated performance as a boxing judge came
March 13 in the Evander Holyfield bout with Lennox Lewis at Madison
Square Garden. Williams scored the fight for Holyfield, making
possible the much-disputed draw. Her scoring, as well as that of
the judge who ruled the fight even, drew howls of outrage and cries
of ``fix'' from fans. It also prompted a criminal investigation by
New York State prosecutors in Manhattan and a pledge of reform by
officials in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   How Williams, a 48-year-old municipal accounts clerk in Atlantic
City, came to be at ringside in the biggest heavyweight fight in
New York in decades represents for many followers of boxing yet one
more example of how flawed the sport is, and how badly it needs
reform.
</P>
<P>
   Just weeks before Williams earned the biggest payday of her
career as a judge _ $5,150 for the Holyfield fight _ she had filed
for bankruptcy, declaring herself overwhelmed by debts on more than
a dozen credit cards. Investigators looking into the circumstances
of the Holyfield fight believe her financial distress should have
barred her from serving as a judge. But the bankruptcy was never
disclosed, nor was it required to be disclosed by state officials.
Indeed, in New York and New Jersey, the only thing preventing a
judge from participating in a major prizefight is a pending felony
charge or a criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   Williams did not earn the right to work the fight because of
stellar credentials. No organization or sanctioning body in the
United States ranks judges. Williams, whose New Jersey license to
judge is honored by most states, was at ringside at the Garden
because she had been selected by Bob Lee, the president of the
International Boxing Federation, one of the organizations that was
behind the fight and whose heavyweight crown is held by Holyfield.
Lee is a former deputy commissioner of boxing in New Jersey, having
left that office in 1984 after investigators determined that the
commission was rife with conflicts of interest among its officials.
The IBF is currently under investigation by a federal grand jury in
Newark into possible improprieties in its ranking of boxers.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was paid for her work in the Holyfield bout by the
fight's promoters on a check that was issued by Don King
Productions. Many of those who advocate boxing reform have long
considered the paying of judges by promoters as potentially
dangerous. The concern is that judges might feel pressure to score
a fight in a way that serves the promoter's long-term financial
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go to a baseball game and the umpire makes a bad
call, people never presume that the game is fixed,'' said Eliot L.
Spitzer, the New York State attorney general who has ordered an
investigation into how the New York State Athletic Commission deals
with boxing judges. ``But in boxing, whenever there is a
questionable decision, we presume, reflexively, a fix. That says
something about the lack of integrity in the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Of judges working prizefights, Spitzer said, ``We know virtually
nothing about these judges.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of the sport say that state boxing commissions have
been reluctant to enforce tough standards for fear of losing
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Promoters live in a different ethical world and they're not
going to acquiesce to strict regulatory rules,'' said James J.
Morley, executive director of the New Jersey Commission of
Investigation, who led an examination of boxing in the state in
1984. ``They'll just take the fights somewhere else where they can
do what they like.''
</P>
<P>
   From the moment of her controversial decision, Williams has
emphatically denied that the decision was influenced in any way by
her relationship with members in the IBF, the fight's promoters or
anybody else. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ The likelihood of a dam being removed on the Elwha
River seemed to diminish significantly Thursday when Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt and Sen. Slade Gorton made it clear there
is no room for compromise between them.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have long pushed to remove the two dams on the
Olympic Peninsula's Elwha River in an effort to restore salmon
runs. Last year, all interests, including the city of Port Angeles,
elected officials from both parties and the dams' private owner
agreed to removal.
</P>
<P>
   But funding fell through when Gorton, R-Wash., insisted that a
provision be included stating that no dam on the Columbia or Snake
rivers could be removed without congressional permission.
Environmentalists are pushing to breach four federal dams on the
lower Snake River in an effort to restore salmon runs, but they
have won no support from elected officials of either political
party.
</P>
<P>
   Current law requires congressional approval for the removal of
federal dams, and after a testy hearing before Gorton's
subcommittee, Babbitt told reporters that he would never agree to
also grant Congress veto power over the removal of privately owned
dams. That is the price Gorton is demanding before he will agree to
grant federal money for the acquisition and removal of the Elwha
River dams.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt and Gorton have dug in their heels as each nears the end
of his term. Babbitt is expected to leave office by January 2001,
when President Clinton's second term ends, and Gorton must win
re-election if he is to avoid leaving at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The two have conflicting desires in their remaining months.
Babbitt has made the restoration of free-flowing rivers a goal of
his tenure, while Gorton has made defending the dams on the Snake
and Columbia a central element of his re-election campaign
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to be able to reach any agreement that will allow
us to go forward on the Elwha... and provide a degree of protection
and public consent with respect to major decisions on the Columbia
and Snake rivers?'' Gorton asked Babbitt Thursday, during a hearing
before the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee which Gorton
chairs.
</P>
<P>
   The answer was no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator, I've given this a lot of thought since... last year,
and I'm not prepared to support or advocate a linkage,'' Babbitt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt has argued that Congress already has the right to
approve or reject the removal of federal dams, but that private
parties should be able to negotiate with regulators the removal of
non-federal dams. As an example, he cited the Condit Dam on the
White Salmon River, which is expected to be breached as a result of
an agreement now being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it is inappropriate to freeze a (dam licensing)
system that is working over apprehensions that I think are entirely
unjustified,'' Babbitt said. ``History and reality argue for using
the existing system. It has never led to an inappropriate result
and I don't think it's going to.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews after the hearing, Babbitt and Gorton each
expressed hope that the Elwha dams might yet be removed, but
offered no suggestion as to how that might be accomplished given
their rift.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll continue to advocate and try to persuade the Congress to
give us the funding necessary to get the dams down, provide a water
supply for Port Angeles, and restore the fish, but I cannot
acquiesce in having it held hostage to a whole range of other
issues,'' Babbitt said. ``This dam and the town of Port Angeles can
not be held hostage to a back door rewrite of federal hydro(power)
policy that would apply nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said he was ``gravely disappointed'' by Babbitt's
comments, but that he will continue to try to find a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't jump to any conclusions,'' he said. ``If one road
turns out to be a dead end, you just try another road. But one road
did seem to turn out to be a dead end. There's no question about
that with his response.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and environmentalists are upset at Gorton's insistence
on linking the Elwha and Columbia/Snake river dams, which they view
as a politically driven attempt to position Gorton as the lone
champion of eastern Washington interests against a threatening
federal government. They point to statements such as one Gorton
included in a news release Thursday, in which the senator said
``the Pacific Northwest's economic foundation is still at risk of
being destroyed by the Clinton-Gore administration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no intent in Congress to take down the Columbia or
Snake River dams, and we should not... try to make this into some
hot-button event,'' said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. ``There is no
reason to do that, and I really hope Sen. Gorton backs down and we
can move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash, said he will use his position as
ranking Democrat on the House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee
to push for funds to remove the Elwha dams, and then attempt to
persuade Gorton to back down in conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope we can break this impasse,'' he said. ``As (former
Secretary of State) George Shultz used to say, nothing in this town
is ever over. We'll just keep working on this thing and see if
hopefully we can't find a way to go forward.''

UNDATED: anybody else.

<P>
   Eugenia Williams was 13 when she went to a neighborhood gym in
Atlantic City to learn how to box so she could defend herself from
the teasing of her older brother. Discouraged by the lack of
opportunity for female fighters, though, she later turned to
judging boxing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, she was certified by the U. S. amateur boxing
organization to judge amateur fights. All she had to do to gain the
work was read a 200-page book, pass a written test on the rules of
the sport and informally judge several bouts where her scores did
not officially count. She judged amateur bouts for five years until
becoming a professional judge in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' fortunes in the ranks of professional boxing judges,
she said in a recent interview, owed much to her relationship with
Lee, the IBF president. She said Lee identified her early on as a
promising prospect and that he became a kind of mentor. As a
professional judge, in fact, she became almost exclusively
associated with IBF fights.
</P>
<P>
   But the work was never highly lucrative. According to Williams'
financial records, she earned roughly $3,500 a year as a judge.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who makes $36,000 a year as a city clerk, lives with
her daughter and granddaughter in a modest white, vinyl-sided row
house a few blocks from the opulent casinos on the Atlantic City
boardwalk.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' bankruptcy filing, submitted to the court on Jan. 25,
listed two checking accounts with balances of $20 and $19
respectively, and she listed 18 individual credit card debts among
the $35,500 she owed creditors. Other than her house, with its
outstanding mortgage, she listed very few assets: a 1994 Pontiac
Grand Am, household goods and furniture worth $1,000, and jewelry
worth $250.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams was not required to declare her financial
difficulty to officials with the New Jersey Athletic Commission,
she did not volunteer the information, and no one ever asked. When
applicants apply for licenses with the boxing commissions in New
York and New Jersey, they are checked only for past criminal
records or current felony warrants. There is no inquiry into credit
status or questions about pending civil lawsuits against the
applicants.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, officials with the New Jersey commission even today say
they would not be interested in whether a judge, including one
about to decide a major prizefight, was financially vulnerable.
They say the question of a judge's being prone to criminality has
little to do with his or her financial affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't check for that,'' Rhonda Utley-Herring, a
spokeswoman for the commission, said. ``Nobody does. If a person is
of that mind-set, they're going to be corrupt anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL CUT BEGINS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   To law enforcement officials, as well as local and national
legislators looking into boxing reform, a judge in serious
financial straits should not be allowed to sit at ringside for a
multimillion-dollar prizefight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever a judge who is presumed to be financially vulnerable
shows the slightest hint of being beholden to the promoter or the
sanctioning organization in a fight they are judging, then that is
going to raise suspicions about that judge,'' Spitzer, the New York
attorney general, said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL CUT ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   To have been at ringside for a fight of the magnitude of
Holyfield-Lewis, Williams' resume was not outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said that she has judged more than 500 bouts, including
numerous title bouts for the IBF Others, though, have doubts about
her expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have never put Eugenia Williams in such a high-profile
fight,'' said Jon Robinson, president of the World Boxing Union, a
London-based organization that oversees many European title fights.
``It's one of the best fights of the year, and I would look for one
of the best officials that I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said he had essentially dismissed Williams last May
after her five years of work for the WBU Robinson said he had too
many other, superior judges to use. Williams said she left the WBU
because Robinson wanted her to pay $1,100 a year to remain a judge
with the organization and not work for any other sanctioning body.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Sulaiman, president of the World Boxing Council, another
sanctioning group, also said he was uncomfortable at the time with
Williams' judging the Holyfield fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the judge from the IBF wasn't well known,''
Sulaiman said of Williams. ``We would prefer someone with more
experience or more recognition. We never said we didn't want her to
judge the fight with regards to any dishonesty. We only said it was
based on experience and competency.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in fact, there is almost no mechanism to measure the
competency of judges in professional boxing. Judges licensed in New
York and New Jersey are required to attend annual seminars to
refresh themselves and sharpen their skills. But there are no
formal evaluations, no systematic ranking of judges by levels of
ability or accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, for instance, Larry Hazzard, the state athletic
commissioner, checks scorecards of judges during the year for
inconsistencies and handles formal complaints made against judges.
But Utley-Herring, the commission spokeswoman, said she could not
remember a judge's ever being reprimanded or dismissed for
incompetence or wrongdoing in the 15 years Hazzard has been
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' decision to judge the Robinson-Gatti fight last
December never came to the attention of the New Jersey commission.
Williams said she had come to know Robinson during his amateur
career when she judged several of his fights. She acknowledged that
her daughter called Robinson in the days after the fight from
Williams' home in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said she did nothing wrong in failing to disclose her
relationship with Robinson before the fight, which ultimately
established him as a top contender. She said she had often judged
fights involving boxers with whom she was friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when I was judging amateur fights when there
would be boxers I knew from Atlantic City,'' Williams said. ``They
all knew that they weren't going to get anything from Jean
Williams. The fact that I knew them didn't get in my way of giving
a fair decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are far from convinced this is an acceptable approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the biggest no-no's in amateur boxing,'' Ray
Silvas, chairman of the referees and judges committee for USA
Boxing, said of Williams' judging a friend's fight. ``If we find
out we will immediately disqualify a judge from doing any more of
that fighter's bouts.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey officials, having been made aware of Williams'
potential conflict, said they would explore ways of preventing it
from occurring.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of information should have been disclosed,''
Utley-Herring said.

UNDATED: Utley-Herring said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Williams was at ringside for the Holyfield fight because of the
IBF's Lee. All three main sanctioning organizations got to select a
judge for the fight, which was intended to unify the heavyweight
titles, and Lee said he chose Williams because he wanted a judge
who had not worked a Lewis or a Holyfield fight in the past.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact sanctioning organizations were selecting a fight's
judges disturbed people who have believed such a practice is
fraught with problems. In the 1984 investigation of boxing in New
Jersey, for example, investigators recommended that this practice
be abolished. They feared that a judge's loyalty to a sanctioning
body might make him or her apt to score the fight favorably for
that organization's champion.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation, however, was ignored by state legislators.
Frustrated investigators believe that was because officials feared
that promoters would take their fights elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a practical matter, if the sanctioning bodies aren't going
to have a role in selecting the judges, they're not going to
sanction championship fights and they're not going to come to New
Jersey,'' said Morley, who headed the investigation in New Jersey
in 1984. ``At the time we were looking at this, the people higher
up in the bureaucracy realized that. I think they caved in and said
we don't want to make it impossible to bring championship fights to
New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL CUT BEGINS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Lee said he would never give up the right to select judges for a
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appoint these officials with the approval of the local
commissions,'' Lee said. ``Now someone wants to come in and take
over that right from the sanctioning organizations. I'm not willing
to relinquish that to some of these commissions that only deal in
boxing on a part-time basis. Not when I'm providing training and
seminars to judges and I'm working with them all year around. I
know the officials. I train them and I license them. But I can't
tell you how they're going to score a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL CUT ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Gregory P. Sirb, president of the Association of Boxing
Commissions, a national umbrella group, has proposed some measures
that would begin to reform the monitoring and selecting of judges.
One proposal would be to create a championship pool made up of the
best three judges and best two referees from each state who would
be paid a standard fee for title bouts. Sirb's proposal will have
to be voted on by the state commissions that belong to the national
association.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't rocket science,'' Sirb said. ``We should be able to
fix this problem.''

EARNINGS AND REVENUE RISE AND STOCK PRICE STILL FALLS  
(DW)

<P>
   Pepsico reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings
Thursday, beating analysts' estimates by one cent.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, shares of the maker of Frito-Lay, Pepsi-Cola and
Tropicana fell after the company's chief financial officer, Michael
D. White, said Pepsico would spend $75 million to upgrade its
computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings from continuing operations were $373 million, or 25
cents a share, beating analysts' expectations of 24 cents a share,
according to the First Call Corp.. A year ago, Pepsi earned $377
million, or 24 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi took a charge of $40 million, or 3 cents a share, from
closing plants at its Frito-Lay North America operation.
First-quarter earnings per share also benefited from fewer shares
outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose 17 percent, to $5.11 billion from $4.35 billion.
Shares of Pepsi, which is based in Purchase, N.Y., fell $1.9375, to
$37.
</P>
<P>
   White said that future earnings might be a little lower than
analysts had been led to believe by the company's chairman and
chief executive, Roger A. Enrico.
</P>
<P>
   Enrico has moved to make Pepsi a large player in the packaged
foods business by spinning off the restaurant business, acquiring
Tropicana and divesting the company's soft drink bottling unit.
</P>
<P>
   During a question-and-answer session, he added, ``Let's show you
we can do 12 percent, or 13 percent, and then we can talk about
more,'' when asked whether earnings would be below the 15 percent
or so estimates made by Enrico over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   The spending on new technology, intended to put all of Pepsico's
divisions on compatible systems, struck some analysts as a
necessity, even though Pepsico said it planned to list the expense
separately on its earnings statement for this year. ``The irony
here is, they are doing the right thing,'' said Jennifer Solomon,
an analyst for Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil remained a trouble spot for the company's Frito-Lay
International division, although profits for the division still
managed to rise 3 percent, the company reported. White said in the
conference call that he expected to see ``a gradual improvement''
in the country's economic situation.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for Pepsi-Cola products in North America rose 4 percent,
to $613 million from $589 million. Profits also rose 4 percent, the
company said, from $165 million to $172 million.
</P>
<P>
   White said sales of diet products, including the company's
recently introduced Pepsi One, rose 10 percent in the quarter.
Pepsi-Cola, the flagship brand, declined 1 percent, he said. Prices
for concentrate rose in the quarter but were offset by increased
marketing support for the company's retail customers, he added.

DIARY CITED IN CASE AGAINST SUSPECTED NAZI
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The crumbling pages of a German soldier's wartime
diary are at the center of a new dispute in the government's case
against Jack Reimer, a retired Brooklyn businessman accused of
hiding his Nazi past.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for Reimer contends that two pages from the diary,
which had been kept for more than half a century by a former SS
officer who lives in Germany, may support Reimer's position that he
was not involved in Nazi atrocities during World War II, and should
not be deported.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. government lawyers say the diary proves nothing, and
they told a federal judge in Manhattan in papers submitted last
week that when they asked German authorities to search the former
SS officer's house last month to obtain the entire diary, the man
said he had destroyed it.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the diary comes as U.S. District Judge Lawrence
M. McKenna is preparing to rule on the government's request that he
revoke Reimer's citizenship, the first step in deporting him.
</P>
<P>
   The government has asked McKenna to rule that the two diary
pages are inadmissible, arguing that their contents are
inconclusive, and that without the rest of the diary, mean nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan and the
Justice Department's Office of Special Investigation in Washington
refused to comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Reimer's lawyer, former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark,
said McKenna should admit any defense evidence that would bear ``on
helping you find the truth about the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that for the government ``to make so much of so
insignificant a part of the case implies a lack of confidence in
their case.''
</P>
<P>
   During a trial before McKenna in August, the government offered
evidence that Reimer, now 80, had been a commander at an SS
training camp in Trawniki, Poland, and participated in the
liquidation of Jewish ghettos in Warsaw, Lublin and Czestochowa.
Later, he lied about his past to gain entry into the United States,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Reimer, a former Soviet army officer, denied any role in the
atrocities and testified that he had been taken captive by the
Nazis and forced to work as a bookkeeper in the Trawniki SS camp.
</P>
<P>
   After testimony ended, the judge put off issuing a decision to
allow Clark to go to Germany to interview an additional witness,
Rudolph Reiss, who was an SS man at Trawniki.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying in October before a German magistrate, Reiss
disclosed that he had kept a diary that mentioned Reimer's name.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Justice Department lawyer, Edward Stutman, who was
present, asked to see the diary, Reiss refused, the government has
said in documents submitted to the court.
</P>
<P>
   After the deposition ended, Reiss contacted Clark, he later
wrote to the judge, and they walked to a nearby restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He unwrapped a small decomposing date book which was in an old
creased piece of plastic,'' Clark wrote. ``He turned through a
number of pages. They appeared to contain very few entries.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said that Reiss showed him two pages, dated June 23, 1942,
that included Reimer's name. Reiss seemed to say that Reimer had
been sent from Trawniki to Lublin ``for some office purpose,'' and
had returned the same day, Clark wrote to the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Clark appeared to be suggesting that the entry confirmed
Reimer's testimony that he worked in the office at the SS camp.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors contend that the selectively disclosed pages do
nothing to prove Reimer's defense. The liquidation of the Lublin
ghetto, for example, occurred in March 1942, they said, for which
they have evidence of his presence.
</P>
<P>
   They also noted that Reiss had described Reimer ``as one of the
founders'' of the SS camp.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief summarizing their case, the government said there was
``uncontroverted documentary evidence'' of Reimer's role as an SS
officer who had ``exercised command authority in the Nazis brutal
liquidations of the Jewish ghettos'' in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has yet to respond to the brief. McKenna has not said when
he will rule.

 &HT;    Propane bombs, note new discoveries in shootings
 &HT;    By Chris Barker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Investigators scouring the abandoned
Columbine High School building found a large unexploded bomb on
Thursday, bolstering their theory that two suspected killers had
help carrying out their deadly rampage.
</P>
<P>
   However, no additional suspects have been identified, said Steve
Davis, a spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb found Thursday was one of 31 unexploded devices found
since the shootings, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb consisted of a 20-pound propane tank and gasoline can
in a duffle bag connected with wiring, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   If it had exploded, even more could have died.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the bottle was full, it would have been devastating,'' said
Sgt. Jim Parr of the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, residents of the Denver area visited a nearby park to
remember the 15 who died.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Revas and her daughter planted 13 crosses before a mound of
flowers _ nine painted blue for the boys and one teacher who died
and four painted pink for the girls.
</P>
<P>
   Two black crosses signifying Harris and Klebold were placed flat
on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't pound them in, I laid them down,'' Revas said. ``I
don't think they deserved to be with the others.''
</P>
<P>
   As authorities poured over interviews in an attempt to build
profiles of the two suspects, about 60 to 75 crime scene
investigators collected and catalogued evidence within the high
school.
</P>
<P>
   Although authorities were mum for a possible motive for the
crime, Davis on Thursday for the first time revealed a note had
been discovered at Harris's house.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to characterize it as a suicide note but said it had
been seized as evidence Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County School District officials announced that 1,965
Columbine students will finish the academic year together and
graduate May 22 at an as-yet undisclosed location within the
district.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want them separated,'' said Jane Hammond,
superintendent of the district.
</P>
<P>
   Although school officials had not toured the damage inside the
high school, Hammond said the district ``absolutely'' plans to have
students back in the building for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Some Columbine students who visited several growing memorials to
the victims in Clement Park said they felt a need to return to the
scene of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Others felt the building has been violated by the killings and
should be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they need to close it and leave it as a standing
memorial,'' said Joe Dreaden, a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Others accused school officials of ignoring red flags that
Harris and Klebold had been sending up for months.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Oakley, a 16-year-old Columbine student, said the two
suspects made a video in school that watched like a prologue to the
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's those guys in the school with play guns shooting jocks on
video,'' Oakley said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the suspects used video animation to add blood to the
production.
</P>
<P>
   Some survivors told authorities that Harris and Klebold targeted
athletes during Tuesday's shootings.
</P>
<P>
   A district spokeswoman refused to discuss the video but School
Board President Jon DeStefano said similar warnings are evident in
any U.S. high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe the schools have enough resources to address
the problems that exist,'' DeStefano said.
</P>
<P>
   Those warnings became ``our worse nightmare,'' at Columbine, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   DeStefano paid his respects to the families of the dead, and
praised Columbine staff for the way they handled the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They saved the lives of hundreds of children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Harris and Klebold used an impressive arsenal
to carry out their killing spree. Besides the bombs _ which were
found in the school, suspects' vehicles and their homes _ they
carried two shotguns, a semi-automatic rifle and a semi-automatic
handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators refused to confirm or deny a report that two of
the guns had been traced to a Denver dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities evacuated Columbine when the propane bomb was found
Thursday, a discovery Davis termed, ``disturbing,'' because the
building had already been swept for explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Investigating the crime scene has been painstaking for federal,
state and local authorities who must navigate an eerie sea of
abandoned possessions inside Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are literally thousands of backpacks in that school,''
Davis said. ``I think every kid must have been carrying a
backpack.''

DUBAI COLTS TEST CHURCHILL'S STRIP  
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ There was no nameplate on Barn 45 and no
chatter from the 10 stable hands who were flown here from Dubai to
tend to the Kentucky Derby's most mysterious horses. Instead, Sheik
Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum let Worldly Manner announce his
Godolphin stables arrival at Churchill Downs and the Kentucky
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Lean but corded with muscle, the big bay galloped on American
soil for the first time since September, floating through a lap
along with his stablemate and Derby entry, Aljabr. He is an
imposing physical specimen and looked well rested despite the
arduous flight and 48 hours in quarantine.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller Aljabr did not seem to enjoy his first trip around
the Churchill Downs oval, returning to the barn sweaty and lathered
around his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always like that,'' said Tom Albertrani, the Brooklyn,
N.Y.-born assistant trainer for Godolphin. ``He's an edgier colt.
It's going to take him a few days to get accustomed to the new
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bob Baffert-trained duo of Prime Timber and General
Challenge had swift six-furlong workouts here Thursday morning and
showed why they were likely to be the morning-line favorites. Prime
Timber ripped the distance in 1:12 3/5, then General Challenge
bettered the time at 1:12.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome _ a Real Quiet type move,'' Baffert said,
referring to last year's Derby winner. ``This is as hard as we'll
push him before the race.'' Baffert is seeking an unprecedented
third straight Derby victory.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge, however, appeared to work more effortlessly.
He clipped off the first quarter in 23 4/5 seconds, three furlongs
in 36 and a half in 48 3/5. Then Baffert asked the exercise rider
Dana Barnes through a radio headset to push him. General Challenge
finished the six furlongs in 1:12 and then galloped out a mile.
``Let him gallop out strong; keep going,'' Baffert told her through
the radio. It was satisfying enough for him to joke, of course.
``Well, I don't need the filly,'' he said, referring to Excellent
Meeting, whom he still may enter in the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Patin May Be Replaced
</P>
<P>
   The owner of Valhol said Thursday that he was moving closer to
replacing the jockey Billy Patin, who is under investigation for
allegedly using an illegal electrical device in winning the
Arkansas Derby on April 10. James Jackson, who has yet to collect
the $300,000 in purse money, said he reviewed the tape of the race
and agreed that it looked as if his jockey indeed dropped something
after crossing the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Arkansas Racing Commission releases the $300,000,
Valhol will not be eligible for the Derby because of the large
field. Entries are granted in order of graded stakes purses won,
and without the Arkansas Derby money, the horse has just $34,000 in
earnings.

OILERS LIKE ODDS IN GAME 2
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hollowness of an opening-night playoff loss lingered in the
Edmonton Oilers locker room ... and center Doug Weight just smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we'd like to win Game 1,'' Weight said. ``But we're
comfortable with where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Brash? Cocky? Nah, just experienced. The underdog Oilers have
had a way with Game 2s in the past two seasons, so the chance of
going down two games to none tonight in the second game of a
best-of-seven Western Conference quarterfinals series at Reunion
Arena hasn't entered their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I'd say? One thing: The first game has always
brought us belief,'' Weight said. ``We make some mistakes and we
realize we can play with this team. Forty points better, 30 points
better, they aren't tougher. We believe in ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers rode that philosophy to a seven-game upset of the
Stars two seasons ago _ an upset that began with a stunning 4-0
Game 2 victory at Reunion Arena. Last season, in round two, the
Oilers put another scare into the Stars by taking Game 2, 2-0, on
the strength of a first period in which they held the Stars without
a shot on goal.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Oilers have proved they are far from the eighth
seed that finished 36 points behind the top-seeded Stars during the
regular season. With a hard-fought Game 1 loss, the Oilers opened
the eyes of the Stars and sent a message that Game 2 will be a war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the players think, but \RGame 1\S would have
scared me,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, scared might not be the word, but the Stars definitely
were awakened by the performance of the Oilers, who laid out 64
hits, despite getting only 13 shots. That the Stars had more than
twice as many shots (31) on goal only underscored just how much
they need to improve their offense in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our track record in Game 2 against these guys hasn't been the
greatest in the world,'' Stars center Mike Modano said. ``The
energy level may trail off, but I think we'll definitely have to
get back up to where Game 1 was if we want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Intensity was key in the opening game of the series, a 2-1
victory by the Stars. The Stars matched the physical force of the
Oilers and even did a good job of keeping up with a team Hitchcock
calls ``the fastest in hockey.'' But the Stars fell short in one
department: finishing scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars took 31 shots on goal and fired another 21 high or
wide. That's 52 pucks that were flying somewhere near Oilers goalie
Tommy Salo, and yet only two found their way into the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you'd say we were nervous, but there's more
pressure on us to win any game at home to keep the home ice
advantage,'' Modano said. ``Because of that, you try to be
cautious, probably overcautious. You start worrying too much and
you start thinking too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars say their tendency to outshoot teams and not always
outscore them isn't a trend toward destruction. But in nine of
their 19 losses this season, the Stars followed a formula of
frustration; they outshot opponents and simply could not get enough
goals. The ultimate frustration came Nov. 4 against the San Jose
Sharks, when the Stars outshot the Sharks, 21-9, and lost, 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   It set an NHL record at the time for a loss with the fewest
shots against.
</P>
<P>
   So, do the Stars start worrying about possible frustration?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't try to shoot, you're not going to score,'' Stars
winger Benoit Hogue said. ``So, a lot of times we might be taking
shots from different angles that really aren't good scoring
chances, but sometimes the strangest shot is the one that scores.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said the Stars should continue the hard skating that
results in possession of the puck that results in a lot of shots on
goals. But he said the Stars have plenty of room for improvement in
the goal-scoring department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have more bang-bang plays around the net,''
Hitchcock said. ``We have to create more opportunities at critical
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Hitchcock said the Stars have to improve every facet
of their game, and he wasn't at all upset with how the team played
in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being the home team in Game 2, you can create a comfortable
gap or you can go back to the visitor's barn with everything being
revved up,'' Hitchcock said. ``No matter what happens in Game 1,
Game 2 has all the pressure on the home team. We have to accept
that and we have to be better.''

NATO STRIKES SERB STATE TV; MILOSEVIC'S RESIDENCE IS RUINED BY
MISSILES
</HEADLINE>
  (TOPS with NATO strike on Serb state TV; UPDATES throughout)  
(rk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ NATO knocked Serb state television off
the air in the middle of a newscast early Friday morning, leaving
the building that housed the main government propaganda arm in
flames, with reports of many casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the television building followed a more surprising
strike at President Slobodan Milosevic, when three NATO missiles
devastated his residence _ an elegant villa in the wealthy Dedinje
district at 15 Uzicka Street _ the most famous address in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   NATO had been debating for weeks whether or not to destroy state
television, and warnings had gone out earlier this week to American
television correspondents to stay out of the a complex at 10
Takovska Street, in the heart of the city and surrounded by
residential and commercial buildings.
</P>
<P>
   State television has been the main source of immediate news and
film footage for Western television correspondents. With the
damage, CNN and other networks were also unable to transmit
pictures from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Senior state television journalists have said they have
alternative transmission installations and expected to be able to
get back on the air, at least in some parts of the country, if NATO
blew up the main studios and transmission center.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told Studio B, the Belgrade city channel that is in a
different building and remains on the air, that ambulances and
firefighters were at the scene and that the wounded were being
taken out of the building, which houses Serb Radio and Television.
</P>
<P>
   Studio B is controlled by the relatively liberal Serbian Renewal
Movement, and it has been less rigid and has sometimes provided
more information than state television in its coverage of events
here.
</P>
<P>
   Although NATO sent a missile into Milosevic's bedroom, officials
insisted that it was nothing personal. The residence, an eclectic
two-story building of white stucco, with columns and rounded
windows described by its original owner as a little inspired by
Hollywood, the villa was built as a private house and finished in
1936.
</P>
<P>
   Tito appropriated half the house for himself in 1944, as he took
power in Belgrade, and it came to be thought of as the official
residence of Yugoslavia's president.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is a charred ruin. One entire side wall of the structure
is blown away, all the windows are broken, and many trees in the
surrounding parkland have been uprooted.
</P>
<P>
   There are gaping holes where the missiles pierced the walls,
flares of soot shoot from the arches of the empty window frames,
and chunks of concrete and broken glass are scattered over the
lavish grounds.
</P>
<P>
   NATO may have intended its missiles as a message to Milosevic,
who has not been sleeping at the house in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Tito, who is most associated with the house, is buried in a sort
of mausoleum 200 yards away in what is known as the House of
Flowers. That glassed-in structure was apparently not damaged in
the attack, which truly marked the death of the Yugoslavia Tito
built _ the country that deftly wove a path between Soviet East and
American West, borrowing from, yet independent of and even admired
by both Cold War foes.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials were livid in the name of Milosevic, and of
the past represented by his villa. They accused NATO of trying to
assassinate the leader of a sovereign state, and said the other
missiles, which hit at about 3:15 a.m., had struck the living and
dining rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has been avoiding the house ever since a
little-reported missile attack on a nearby building housing his
presidential guard, in which as many as 30 people are reported to
have been killed, Serb officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, for its part, claimed that the building was a vital link
in the military command system of Yugoslavia and that the strike
had nothing to do with Milosevic or its symbolic importance to the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   But the building was no radar station, and some Serbs reacted
with anger and incredulity.
</P>
<P>
   A Serb photographer said: ``This is simply demagoguery. Whether
one likes Milosevic or not, this is outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Serb journalist with the magazine Vreme said: ``This
building is part of our cultural heritage. Yesterday Tito lived
there, and today Milosevic does, but tomorrow it will be Pera
Peric.'' That is the Serb form of John Doe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If NATO wants to pretend now that it's hit at the heart of the
repressive regime and not the Serb nation, it's not true, because
they've only done this after a month of hitting civilian targets,''
the journalist said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, the old royal palace, the Beli Dvor, or White Palace, is
a ceremonial residence, where Milosevic, like Tito before him,
normally greets guests, but does not live.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has put the Beli Dvor off-limits as a target, in part
because a Rembrandt borrowed from the National Museum is on the
first floor. But the residence destroyed on Thursday is also a
listed building, on the Yugoslav register of protected cultural
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Goran Matic, a Serb government minister of the Yugoslav United
Left party led by Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic, was scathing
in a news conference. ``NATO committed a criminal act without
precedence _ an assassination attempt against the president of a
sovereign state,'' Matic said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and other Western officials called the building a
presidential command post and legitimate military target.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic himself is not a target,'' said the White House
spokesman, Joe Lockhart. ``The command and control center is.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry spokesman, Nebojsa Vujovic,
said the building had no military utility, and he challenged NATO
to find ``one wire or one button.'' He asked, ``Are their next
targets child care centers?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   About 24 hours earlier, NATO destroyed a building housing the
offices of Milosevic's party and that of his wife's, as well as the
radio and television studios and transmitters of stations belonging
to their daughter, Marija, and their friends.
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Krusevac, some 125 miles south of Belgrade,
Zivadinka Damjanovic, the director of an old-age home, was furious
about the attack on the residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO showed its real position when they destroyed the
president's house,'' she said to a small group of reporters
visiting the town. ``This was not his house, but an official one,
and it was built long before him.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack gave the lie to NATO's stated war aims, she said.
``The point is destruction, and not any kind of humanitarian
protection or intervention. It's very obvious they want to occupy
us and destroy us as a people.''
</P>
<P>
   Aleksandar Acovic, a wealthy engineer, built the villa. His
nephew, Dragomir Acovic, is currently the president of the Serbian
Heraldic Society and something of a monarchist.
</P>
<P>
   According to Acovic, the Nazis seized the house in 1941 when
they occupied the country. Tito confiscated half of it in 1944,
when he came to Belgrade, forcing the elder Acovic to sell the rest
to the state in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   The building is said to have one of the best air raid shelters
in Belgrade, which was apparently part of the original design.
Dragomir Acovic has said that on April 6, 1941, when the city was
bombed by the Nazis, the government held a Cabinet meeting in the
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Serb state television led its evening news on Thursday with the
building's destruction. A commentator called the attack ``the drop
that spills the glass of condemnation by the largest part of
justice-loving humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   It also cited the former Russian prime minister, Viktor S.
Chernomyrdin, for his disapproval of the attack and ``the barbaric
destruction of a country.''

CALLS FOR CHANGE RECEIVE A HEARING IN WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Muhammad Ali's muted presence packed a Senate
Commerce Committee hearing into federal boxing reform Thursday, and
through his friend, Howard Bingham, he said he could not remain
silent ``while the sport he gave his life to has become a
travesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, Bingham asked on Ali's behalf, are the National Football
League, National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball
regulated and run by commissioners, but boxing has been ``singled
out for total neglect and thrown to the wolves?''
</P>
<P>
   The desire for legislation to alter the sport's business
practices has accelerated since disputed scoring in the Lennox
Lewis-Evander Holyfield heavyweight bout last month produced a draw
rather than the clear victory for Lewis that most observers thought
they had witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   During the bout, Eugenia Williams, a judge selected by the
International Boxing Federation, scored the fight 115-113 for
Holyfield, the IBF champion. Since then, her skills, motivation,
financial need and eyesight have been questioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the main point of the Lewis-Holyfield controversy,''
said Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is a co-sponsor
of the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act, ``is that the shadowy
relationships between promoters and sanctioning organizations often
result in injustice and scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, if passed, would force sanctioning bodies to
establish objective criteria for ranking boxers rather than use the
mystifying systems that often defy explanation; prohibit the
sanctioning organizations from receiving payments from promoters
for other than previously established expenses; limit option
contracts with promoters, and require promoters to file complete
contracts with boxers with state commissions and the fees they
assess on the boxers.
</P>
<P>
   Eliot L. Spitzer, the New York state attorney general, added two
more measures, both of which would most likely remain under state
jurisdiction. He suggested the creation of an independent boxing
poll, like those for college football, to replace the sanctioning
bodies' rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer also recommended that the mode of scoring a fight be
changed, to eliminate an aberrant judge's score from each round.
Thus, if two judges score a round 10-9 for one fighter, and the
third scores it 10-9 for the second fighter, the score of the third
is tossed out.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts of McCain and Spitzer, who heads a boxing task force
for the National Association of Attorneys General, are designed to
eventually replace sanctioning bodies with a system backed by civil
and criminal penalties prescribed by federal law. Spitzer and Greg
Sirb, president of the Association of Boxing Commissioners, said
the states needed the foundation of federal law to keep promoters
from shopping fights to states with the weakest regulations.
</P>
<P>
   One dissenting voice in the hearing was Walter Stone, the IBF's
counsel. His testimony tried to divert the committee from the
rankings to the ``media's controlling influence over boxing,'' how
to define a fighter, and the failure of rival promoters to make the
best fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair to say sanctioning bodies are always the
problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain challenged Stone on how Vincent Pettway climbed the IBF's
welterweight ranking to became Felix Trinidad's mandatory
challenger in a May 29 title fight. Pettway has not fought anyone
with a winning record since 1995, and the bout is expected to be a
gross mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had every reason to think he was a good fighter,'' Stone
said about Pettway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you judge a fighter by the quality of his fighters?''
McCain asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I examined his record,'' Stone said. &QL;

   The New York Times says in an editorial Friday, April 23: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Earth Days go, Thursday was uneventful except for one
important decision by the Clinton administration that will improve
visibility in the country's wilderness and its national parks. The
decision, announced by Vice President Gore during a visit to
Virginia's Shenandoah National Park, gives states a firm, if
distant, deadline for eliminating the smoggy haze that now ruins
many of the country's most famous scenic views.
</P>
<P>
   Haze reduces visibility in the Grand Canyon from 128 miles on a
typically clear day to 68 miles on a typically hazy day, in Maine's
Acadia National Park from 74 miles to 19, and in Tennessee's Great
Smoky Mountains from 55 miles to less than 5. It is, in short, a
nationwide nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Browner, chief of the Federal Environmental Protection
Agency, has provided a generous timetable. States must submit
detailed cleanup strategies between 2003 and 2008. The deadline for
clearing the parks of haze is 2064. Some environmentalists complain
that her timetable is too lenient, but restoring the air in scores
of parks to what amounts to pre-industrial conditions will not be
easy. It will require big investments in new technology, cleaner
fuels, and perhaps even the closing of some of the older coal-fired
electrical utilities in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the industries most affected by the new rules _ the
utilities and the automobile companies _ are no happier with this
program than with the administration's previous efforts to clamp
down on air pollution. Those earlier actions were aimed at
protecting public health. Thursday's action is designed solely to
improve visibility. But the pollutants, the culprits and the
remedies are the same. So is the goal _ a nation with cleaner air.

 &HT;    Doctors, HMOs at odds over collective bargaining
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For doctors and health insurers, this was
supposed to be a quiet year at the statehouse, a time for both
sides to keep their powder dry after some ugly battles over HMO
laws in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But two bills that would give competing physicians the right to
band together to negotiate with health plans have revived the
politicking just as the session is entering its final weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Doctor groups are lobbying hard for the bills, which passed
committees in both chambers, as a check on the power of large
health plans to dictate fees and contractual terms. Insurers and
employer groups are complaining loudly that the pro-business
Republicans favoring the bills, including Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, are
opening the door for doctors to form labor unions in Texas and
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans carrying a collective bargaining bill . . . go
figure,'' said former Sen. Jerry Patterson, executive director of
the state's HMO trade association.
</P>
<P>
   Perry has asked the two sides to try and negotiate a compromise
and says that process is ongoing. But so far, they have found
little room for discussion and have been told that the Senate
version of the legislation, sponsored by Sen. Chris Harris
(R-Arlington), will go to the floor next week if no agreement is
reached, sources familiar with the negotiations said. The House
bill, sponsored by John Smithee (R-Amarillo), is expected to hit
the floor later.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has made me understand why it's not in the patient's
best interest that doctors can't talk to each other,'' Perry said.
``I want to make sure that physicians are able to exchange
information for the best interests of the patients, and I think
this moves us in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The bills would prohibit groups of independent doctors from
boycotting or striking as unions do, but would shelter them from
federal antitrust laws, which make any discussions about contracts
among competing entities a felony.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians would have to hire a third party to negotiate for
them, follow strict guidelines and agree to close supervision by
the state. Under the Senate bill, they could then work together on
a range of terms in their contracts including patient referral
procedures, dispute resolutions, timing of reimbursements, and, in
negotiations with the biggest health plans, the size of those
reimbursements. The attorney general would have to approve all
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The bills are based on model legislation drawn up by the
American Medical Association, which would like to see the right of
doctors to collectively bargain eventually established in federal
law. Washington state has passed a similar statute, but that
measure does not allow doctors to negotiate fees.
</P>
<P>
   Texas would be the first state to give doctors the right to
collectively negotiate fees.
</P>
<P>
   In analyzing the legislation, the Senate Economic Development
Committee acknowledged that allowing doctors to collectively
negotiate could create barriers to competition in health care.
Health plans say increases in doctors' fees would force them to
raise premiums.
</P>
<P>
   But physicians see the ongoing consolidation in the health
insurance industry reducing their leverage when it comes time to
draw up terms of contracts, including those terms that address the
way they care for patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``An independent physician negotiating with a
multibillion-dollar corporation is a bit like Bambi negotiating
with Godzilla. It doesn't happen,'' said James Eskew, an Austin
physician. ``The way they negotiate is they hand you a contract . .
. and say, `Tough. Sign it or get out of here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Eskew said his physician group had recently tried to negotiate
with a major health plan that wanted to drop reimbursements 20
percent, but the plan wouldn't return its phone calls. Yet he
conceded that doctors in Texas are also concerned that their
incomes could eventually decline as a result of cost-cutting in
health care, as he said they have in other states. ``I think it's a
coming problem in Texas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One expert in health law and antitrust agreed that the impetus
for doctors to collectively negotiate ultimately has more to do
with money than caring for patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always a little skeptical when I hear either insurers or
doctors say they have the patients' best interests at heart,'' said
Seth Chandler, professor at the University of Houston Law Center.
``Actually their interests lie closer to home.''

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
LOS ANGELES _ Scottie Pippen smiled and waved and kept driving,
seeming amused that media had gathered at the airport before the
Rockets' chartered flight Thursday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teammates feigned anger and hurled insults, assuming correctly
the crowd had not gathered to offer good wishes before tonight's
game against the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets seemed repaired, with bravado and banter back
aboard, as if leaving one terrible night behind them as they headed
for a brief road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it will not be quite that easy. Seeking a stretch run
before the playoffs, they were embarrassed by the Dallas Mavericks
on Wednesday night. Hours later, Pippen was arrested for suspicion
of driving while intoxicated, a charge he denied in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen was released on $500 bond at about 6:30 a.m. Thursday,
and though he did not attend Thursday's practice, he rejoined the
team in time for the flight to Los Angeles. And with that, the
Rockets hoped they could leave behind a terrible performance and
Pippen's legal troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 100 percent behind Scottie,'' Rockets forward Charles
Barkley said. ``He's my teammate. He's my friend. I'm 100 percent
behind him. I think he's fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie's going to be fine. Obviously, you're down a bit. You
keep going. It's something that happened. It's a distraction for a
second. He'll be fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're famous or in the limelight and you make a mistake
or do something wrong, everybody throws gasoline on the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, 33, had no comment other than issuing a brief statement
Thursday maintaining his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not intoxicated when arrested after the game last
night,'' Pippen's statement said. ``And I'm confident the evidence
will support me in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Pippen, the arrest can only make a trying season more
difficult. Signed to a five-year, $67 million contract, excluding
incentive bonuses, Pippen has struggled offensively throughout the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Averaging 14.1 points per game, he has scored in double figures
only four times in the past 10 games. Thursday, he made just two of
eight shots to score four points in the 109-95 loss to the
Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   But his arrest, though another bump in a rocky season for Pippen
personally, will not affect his status on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't make an assumption,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich
said. ``These things happen. I think it's unfair to make comments
when nothing has been established. You let the legal system do what
it does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sort of used to unexpected things happening, injuries. I
try not to lose composure. You can see a lot of things. Until you
find out all the details, you can overreact and get into a whole
situation that's not fair. It's not the right way to do things.
People love to make assumptions way before the facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a personal, legal matter. It happens to a lot of people.
Nothing has been decided about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen's teammates had a similar reaction, arguing his arrest
would be filed as a personal matter to be left far from the courts
and locker rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich said he would talk with Pippen about the issue.
Teammates said they would follow Pippen's lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things happen,'' Rockets center Antoine Carr said.
``It's a personal thing he has to deal with. We know what we have
to do. We have to go down there and play ball. It's part of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to tell him, like always, we love every player on
our team. If he needs us in any way, we've got his back. If he
wants us to stay clear, we'll stay clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley had spoken to Pippen on Thursday morning, and though he
said Pippen was down, Barkley expected Pippen would not let the
incident become a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in that little cell several times myself,'' Barkley
said. ``It's one of those things you get over with. You don't think
too much about it, unless you're in a cell with a guy named Bubba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something unfortunate happened. A mistake was made. It's over
with.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets would like to take the same approach with their
arrested performance Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chasing a valuable third playoff seed, they lost to a Mavericks
team with just two previous road victories all season to fall 2{
games behind the San Antonio Spurs. They remain just a game ahead
of the Lakers for the fourth seed and the first-round home-court
advantage that comes with it.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich called the performance a nightmare, the tape painful
to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to read too much into it,'' he said. ``I'm always
concerned. Your mind is always working. But I've learned you can't
obsess on things. You've got to address them. Try to fix them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it wouldn't have happened. I wish we would have been
more focused. I wish we would have run back and talked. We
addressed those things. We'll see where we're at.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I said is I thought the team needed to refocus like they
did 10 days ago. They got together (in a players-only meeting in
Minnesota) and talked about doing this thing together.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockets players decided that night to treat the remaining
regular-season games as playoff games, believing they could have a
profound effect on the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   As a third seed, they would face Phoenix or Minnesota in the
first round. A fourth or fifth seed would mean a first-round
meeting with the Lakers, Monday's opponent at Compaq Center in the
second of back-to-back games.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Spurs have swept the regular-season series with the
Rockets, they would hold a tiebreaker advantage should the Rockets
catch them. And if a third seed is unlikely at best, the Rockets
will have to come up with some other motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything can happen,'' Tomjanovich said. ``I'd say chances are
(third is out of reach), but I'm not going to assume it. Sometimes
the way we play, I think we can climb the ladder. On other nights,
I'm not sure we'll stay in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   One more win, or a Seattle or Sacramento loss, would clinch a
playoff spot and take care of that question. But the Rockets do
have something to achieve down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game matters,'' Barkley said. ``It's going to go down to
the last day of the season whether we're three, four or five. Last
night maybe cost us three. We have to hang on to the four spot.
It's kind of exciting because every game means something.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stunk up the joint last night. That's all I can see. We all
played terrible. A wise man told me one time, there's only three
inches from where somebody pats you on the back and kicks you in
the (butt).
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have highs and lows. It's over with.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets hope the same will be said for Pippen and his
toughest night as a Rocket.

EDITORIAL: INDONESIA'S RESPONSIBILITY IN EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Friday, April 23: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Deadly violence returned to East Timor last week, and militias
backed by Indonesia's army are clearly to blame. Their goal is to
thwart a plan by Indonesia's President, B.J. Habibie, to let
Timor's people choose between autonomy and independence. A
tentative cease-fire signed Tuesday is encouraging, but not enough.
The United States and other countries must insist that Habibie
disarm and disband the militias.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's 1976 annexation of the former Portuguese colony of
East Timor has never been recognized by the outside world or
accepted by Timor's people. Habibie wisely recognized that an
Indonesia struggling to recover from economic collapse and moving
toward democratic elections would be better off letting East Timor
go its own way. Indonesia and Portugal are negotiating arrangements
for a vote on autonomy. If the Timorese vote no, Indonesia would
concede independence. But this solution could fall apart if Jakarta
fails to stop the militias, which have acted with the blessing of
local army and police commanders. Washington must warn Indonesia
that international loans could be suspended unless it acts.
</P>
<P>
   The autonomy talks should also be completed quickly so that U.N.
monitors can be sent. These are critical days for East Timor. A
strong international message to Jakarta can make a difference. &QL;

EDITORIAL: CHALLENGE FOR A GOOD-TIMES BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Friday, April 23: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, before Mayor Rudolph Giuliani detailed his spending
plan for the next fiscal year, he and City Council Speaker Peter
Vallone reminisced companionably about the dark days when they had
been forced to slash the work force and worried about whether New
York City could maintain the balanced budget necessary to preserve
its financial autonomy. Now the city has a $2.1 billion surplus.
Both the mayor and Vallone deserve credit for their ongoing efforts
to keep the budget under control and bring down taxes.
</P>
<P>
   What they have not been able to do, however, is fix the
structural imbalance that shows up in projections for new budget
gaps in the future. Giuliani has not been fully successful in
creating the smaller, more efficient work force he envisioned, one
that would not automatically grow back to its old size as soon as
austerity ended. The head count of city workers has already inched
up near its former level, and productivity improvements have been
scattered. Giuliani has another chance to tackle that problem in
the upcoming labor contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   His job will be harder now, since new leaders have taken over
many unions and are eager to show what they can achieve. Giuliani
wisely ignored their demands that he set aside a large amount of
the surplus to cover wage increases. We hope he is successful in
his plans to pay for raises with new productivity initiatives. The
municipal work force must be both better paid and smaller if the
city is to reach real financial health.
</P>
<P>
   The council and mayor are proposing competing tax cuts, and they
will be able to argue the advantages of their respective stances
over the next few weeks. Their other major differences are over
popular areas like libraries and services for the elderly that
mayors cut every year, just to divert the council with the task of
restoring them. One other difference is Giuliani's proposal for a
school voucher program, which Vallone opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Even if diverting money from the public schools to pay for
vouchers were not a bad idea on its face, the legal and political
obstacles make it a dubious venture. Giuliani says he is willing to
talk about alternatives that would make it easier to improve the
public school system, like eliminating tenure for principals and
getting rid of the present board of education. Vallone, too,
expressed a desire to see the school system reformed. We suggest
that they focus on that issue rather than a fruitless fight over
vouchers.

TOBACCO LAWYERS LOOK AT BONDS TO SPEED FEES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to add byline and to change `issue' to `underwrite'
throughout.)   (jw) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of plaintiffs' lawyers, including some who have already
been awarded billions of dollars in fees for representing states in
tobacco lawsuits, are exploring the possibility of having bonds
issued so they can collect the money faster.
</P>
<P>
   The bond issue, should it go forward, would apparently be the
first used for speeding payment of lawyers fees, several of the
lawyers involved in the discussions said Thursday. The lawyers said
they had already contacted more than 10 major investment-banking
houses about their interest in issuing underwriting bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of recent settlements between states and the
tobacco industry to resolve lawsuits seeking to recover
smoking-related health care costs, cigarette makers are required to
pay the fees of the lawyers hired by the states.
</P>
<P>
   But the industry is not required to pay all the money at once.
The agreement calls for the companies to pay $500 million in fees
annually until the awards are paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Under those terms, the $8.2 billion in fees awarded by
arbitrators last year to lawyers representing three states _
Florida, Mississippi and Texas _ will take about 16 years before
they are paid out.
</P>
<P>
   Billions of dollars in additional fees that are expected to be
awarded by arbitrators over the next year or two will substantially
lengthen the payout period.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lieff, a lawyer from San Francisco whose firm represented
several states, said issuing having bonds issued would allow the
lawyers to get their money faster and with more favorable tax
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Lieff said the bonds would also insulate the lawyers from risks
if any of the cigarette makers participating in the settlement went
bankrupt. The cost of the bonds to investors could be discounted to
reflect that risk.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawyers involved in the group exploring the bond issue
include Richard Scruggs of Pascagoula, Miss., and Ronald Motley and
Joe Rice, members of the same law firm in Charleston, S.C. Along
with participating in the Texas, Florida and Mississippi cases, the
men represented more than 30 other states in cases against the
tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Borod, whose Boston firm represented Massachusetts and
other states, said the lawyers decided at a meeting in Washington
several weeks ago to approach investment banking houses about
issuing underwriting bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Borod said that the investment houses had until Tuesday to
submit proposals outlining how they would issue underwrite the
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know a lot of firms are working on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that based on the response from Wall Street, the group
of lawyers would decide whether to go forward with the bond issue.
Some of the firms involved, like Borod's, have not been awarded
fees yet but expect to get such awards in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   A number of states are also exploring the possibility of issuing
bonds. New York City is likely to become the first government in
the country to raise money based on future payments it will receive
from the tobacco settlement.

 !text! PASADENA _ While former Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano asked
for a few days before commenting publicly about his dismissal, team
president Tim Leiweke on Thursday formally announced the hiring of
UCLA head coach Sigi Schmid, arguably the best coach in college
soccer today.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Schmid received a three-year contract, but terms were not
disclosed during a press conference at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid never had a losing season in 20 years at UCLA. He has won
three NCAA titles, is the fifth-winningest coach in Division I
history (322-63-33, .810) and is a two-time NCAA Coach of the Year.
He also has more former players in Major League Soccer and more
players with the U.S. national team than any coach in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``His track record speaks for itself,'' Leiweke said. ``He's
really one of the great coaches in the history of the NCAA, and we
felt if the situation ever came where we had to make a move, that
he would be the natural candidate for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't bring him in here to ultimately become a failure. We
brought him here because he's been a success every place he's ever
been. And I'm quite confident he'll continue that here.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid, who was an assistant to U.S. national team coach Bora
Milutinovic during the 1994 World Cup, said he will let assistant
coach Ralph Perez coach the team Saturday against San Jose at the
Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   He said his decision to leave UCLA was the toughest in his
career, and Los Angeles is the only team he considered coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been lucky because I've been able to coach my entire
adult life in this city,'' Schmid said. ``I've spent a lot of years
at UCLA and I would not just leave it for any place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think the timing was right and the terms were right.
I've consulted with a lot of people.... I've talked to guys I have
played with in the past all the way to my brother. Everyone has
said this is the right move and the right time, and I'm just happy
to be here and getting to work as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy also has seven of his former players, including Cobi
Jones, Paul Caligiuri, Greg Vanney and goalkeeper Kevin Hartman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have complete confidence in this team,'' Schmid said. ``I
think there's a great level of talent here.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiweke said he felt there was a lack of communication between
the players and Zambrano.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had asked Octavio to work on creating a better relationship
and a better style of communications with the players,'' he said.
``It became pretty obvious in the past week that was still an
issue. The players wanted to be coached. They wanted to be
communicated with.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to be told what they're doing right and what they're
doing wrong and that wasn't happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players didn't feel that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, it's always been a healthy environment within the
club,'' said Hartman, who acknowledged he was happy with the hiring
of his former coach. ``They (ownership) obviously see things that I
didn't see from that perspective.

AGREEMENT BETWEEN WNBA AND PLAYERS FALLS APART 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By LENA WILLIAMS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Women's National Basketball Association announced
Thursday that the agreement in principle it reached last week with
the players union had fallen apart and, as a result, it was
postponing next Tuesday's draft.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown came only nine days after both sides hailed what
appeared to be an historic first contract for a women's
professional basketball league in the United States. In doing so,
the WNBA and its newly formed players union, which is represented
by the National Basketball Players Association, had managed to
avoid a labor dispute similar to last year's NBA lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reason,'' said Valerie B. Ackerman, president of
the WNBA, ``that was not possible. Instead, there is no deal and we
have no choice but to postpone the draft indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   The draft was for teams to select former American Basketball
League players and players coming out of college.
</P>
<P>
   In talks late Wednesday night, both sides said, there were
disagreements over certain provisions that they had not anticipated
during more than two months of bargaining and the final
negotiations that led to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The union said it was under the impression that players from the
defunct ABL would not be classified as rookies by the league, but
considered as veterans and allowed to negotiate their salaries
based on the veterans' scale.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA has said that for league purposes, the ABL players,
like veterans who have played overseas and joined the league, are
considered rookies.
</P>
<P>
   The union also took issue with the number of appearances players
would be required to make during the season. Union officials
claimed the two sides settled on a total of 12, but that the league
now says the figure applies only to appearances for league
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our mind,'' said Pamela Wheeler, director of operations for
the Women's Basketball Association and one of the union's chief
negotiators, ``this is an attempt to scare and intimidate the
players.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bruce Levy, an agent who represents players in both
the WNBA and the former ABL, the players thought their preliminary
agreement with the league gave them the right to hold out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they learned that players who had not signed a contract
with the league by the beginning of training camp would not be
allowed to play for the season,'' Levy said. ``That means that on
May 7, the league's lawyers could give us 70 veteran contracts and
say, `if in one week these aren't signed by your clients, your
clients are out of the league.' With that kind of threat, how much
negotiating can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler insisted that a deal could be made with no more than a
few hours at the bargaining table, but no new talks are scheduled. &QL;

AYALA CONSIDERS OPTIONS INSIDE THE RING AND OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTINGDON, Pa. - The afternoon sun glinted off the water in the
swimming pool as Tony Ayala Jr. basked in his second full day of
freedom. After being released from the Bayside State Prison in
Leesburg, N.J., on Tuesday following 16 years behind bars for a
rape he committed on New Year's Day 1983, Ayala, a former No. 1
junior middleweight contender, can now turn his attention to the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala was sitting poolside at the Philadelphia-area home of his
adviser, Dr. Brian Raditz, conducting interviews, soaking up sun
and trying to deal with the swirl of activity that has engulfed him
since his release.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is up in the air,'' Ayala said. ``I hope to be in
the ring by the summer. But first I have to get in the gym and see
where I'm at. I have a lot of hard work ahead of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala was 19 when he was a No. 1 contender. His contemporaries
were Sugar Ray Leonard, Roberto Duran and Thomas Hearns, and his
record was 22-0 with 19 knockouts. He is now 36, his black hair
thinning on top, and he has not had a professional fight since he
knocked out Carlos Herrera in the third round on Nov. 20, 1982. He
appears to be physically fit. If he returns as a junior
middleweight contender, some of his opponents will have been first
graders when he went to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala said he didn't follow boxing that closely when he was in
prison and he didn't really miss the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not like my dad, who has a real passion for the sport,''
he said. ``I don't love the sport. To me it's just a job. It's a
machismo thing. I love the challenge. I like knocking people out,
seeing their eyes roll back.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as returning, Ayala said he drew inspiration from George
Foreman, who took a 10-year hiatus from boxing before returning at
age 38 in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Foreman pushed the clock way back,'' Ayala said. ``He
made it possible to fight in your late 30s and 40s. If it wasn't
for George Foreman, I probably wouldn't even be standing here
talking about boxing. The fact that he did it makes me know that
it's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several questions surrounding Ayala's return. What
effect has the lengthy prison sentence had on his marvelous boxing
skills? Can he still muster the same ferocity that he fought with
now that he says he has conquered the demons that drove him to
commit violent crimes and led him to alcohol abuse and heroin use?
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychologically he's been right for a long time,'' said
Raditz, who was Ayala's psychologist when he was at Rahway State
Prison, now East Jersey State Prison, at the start of his sentence.
``His attitude is very good. It's a timing thing. If he feels good,
we'll pursue it. If he doesn't, then we'll look at other career
possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Raditz said there had already been offers for Ayala, who was a
peer counselor in prison, to do some counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala said that he would make all the final decisions about his
career, but that he had put his father, Tony Sr., who has trained
him since he was 5, in charge of setting up his training camp and
helping him select opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Sr. said he was not going to push Ayala at the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll work six rounds at a time,'' the elder Ayala said.
``We'll work on the little things that he missed when he was
incarcerated. Four to six weeks after he's been in the gym, he'll
start sparring.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala has not hired a promoter, but Lester Bedford, a boxing
promoter from Fort Worth, coordinated the media interviews for
Ayala Thursday and said he had made a formal offer to be Ayala's
promoter.
</P>
<P>
   There was a festive mood at Raditz's house Thursday. And Ayala
seemed to be enjoying his freedom. But he said he could not forget
about what he did.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not talk much about his remorse or wanting to
make an apology to his victim, because he said he believed it would
sound insincere. However, he said he wanted to apologize to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she came to me or if she had a representative come to me, I
would go talk to her,'' Ayala said. ``I would leave training camp.
If I was fighting De La Hoya, I'd cancel the fight. Forget De La
Hoya. She would be more important than him.'' &QL;

A NARROW VICTORY LEAVES QUESTIONS FOR U.S. WOMEN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By JERE LONGMAN

<P>
   HERSHEY, Pa. _ With the women's World Cup approaching in June,
the United States appeared to have lost its scoring touch and any
certainty that it was still head and shoulders above every other
team in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But after missing numerous opportunities Thursday night, the
Americans rescued a 2-1 exhibition victory over China two minutes
into extra time on a rebound shot by Tisha Venturini.
</P>
<P>
   Mia Hamm fired a low cross from the right side that Han Wenxia,
the Chinese goalkeeper, poked away. Venturini, who had entered in
the 90th minute as a substitute, pounced on the ricochet and
punched the ball into the net from seven yards out, awakening a
quiet crowd of 15,257 at Hersheypark Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit it as hard as I could across the goal and Tisha made
this unbelievable run from midfield,'' Hamm said.
</P>
<P>
   Venturini said: ``You know Mia is going to get there, so I just
kept running.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's play was seen by many as a potential preview of
the World Cup final, scheduled for July 10 at the Rose Bowl in
Pasadena, Calif. The teams will meet again Sunday in an exhibition
at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, who lost by 2-1 to China in Portugal's Algarve
Cup last month, dominated play in the first half but continued to
struggle with putting the ball into the net. Cindy Parlow pounded a
shot off the post in the seventh minute, then failed to lift a chip
shot over Han.
</P>
<P>
   In the 12th minute, Hamm made a brilliant feint to her left,
moved to her right around a Chinese defender but shot the ball just
wide left from 17 yards out.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm is considered the world's best player, and with 104 career
goals, she is only 3 shy of the women's career record. But it has
now been six games since she has scored a goal. But she set up both
American goals Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20th minute, the American defender Brandi Chastain won a
tackle near midfield and caught the Chinese defense too far forward
as she put the ball through to Hamm, who sprinted free down the
left flank. Wen Lirong had no choice but to drag Hamm down in the
penalty area.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Akers took the penalty kick and drilled the ball low
and to the left. Han, a substitute Chinese goalie who was playing
in only her seventh international match, guessed correctly and got
her hands on the ball, but she could not keep it out of the net.
</P>
<P>
   China, which failed to get a shot on goal until the 24th minute,
tied the game in the 59th minute when forward Sun Wen hooked a free
kick into the net from about 25 yards out.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans seemed headed for a draw as Hamm then missed twice
on free kicks, but her late blast left Venturini open for the game
winner. &QL;

RALPH J. PERK, A REPUBLICAN WHO LED CLEVELAND IN THE 1970S, DIES AT
85  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ralph J. Perk, a hard-luck mayor of Cleveland whose misfortunes
included accidentally setting his own hair on fire at a ceremonial
appearance, died on Wednesday at the Cleveland Clinic Hospice unit
of the Corinthian Skilled Nursing Center in Westlake, Ohio. He was
85.
</P>
<P>
   Perk, a Republican, was mayor from 1972 to 1977.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Cleveland, he was also self-made. He dropped out of
high school, managed to get some college education and peddled ice
in the Depression. He benefited from enthusiastic backing of
blue-collar voters in being elected a Cleveland Councilman and,
later, mayor.
</P>
<P>
   But even The Cleveland Plain Dealer acknowledged that he was
``probably best remembered nationally as the mayor with the flaming
hair, whose wife preferred bowling to dining at the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1972 that, as R.W. Apple Jr. has written in The New
York Times, Perk, ``at a ceremony designed to demonstrate his
solidarity with the city's working men, somehow managed to set his
hair alight with a blowtorch.'' He was wielding it to sever a steel
ribbon and thereby formally open a convention of the American
Society of Metals.
</P>
<P>
   Some months later, President Richard M. Nixon invited Perk and
his wife, the former Lucille Gagliardi, to a dinner at the White
House. But Mrs. Perk sent word that she could not attend because it
was her night to go bowling.
</P>
<P>
   Perk campaigned for election as mayor on an anti-tax platform.
After taking office, he oversaw the borrowing of nearly $130
million to pay the bills of the city, whose manufacturing
industries were battered by recession in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   He also reduced the work hours and pay of the city's employees
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, not long after Perk left office, Cleveland, with Mayor
Dennis J. Kucinich in charge, defaulted on its financial
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Perk lost to John Glenn, a Democrat, in a Senate race in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Lucille, whom he married 59 years
ago; a daughter, Virginia Bowers of Cleveland; six sons, Ralph Jr.,
a municipal court judge in Cleveland; Thomas, a councilman in
Valley View, a suburb of Cleveland; Kenneth, a member of the Valley
View school board; Michael, of Cleveland, an employee of the
Cuyahoga County Board of Elections; Richard, of Rocky River, west
of Cleveland, an employee of the Ohio Lottery Commission, and
Allen, of Gahanna, near Columbus; 16 grandchildren; five
great-grandchildren, and two brothers, Albert and George, both of
Cleveland.

WHITTINGHAM WAS GOOD-NATURED OFF TRACK, LEGEND ON IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now it is official: We all have to go sometime.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Whittingham had recently turned 86 when he passed
peacefully on Tuesday after a battle with leukemia. It was
uncharacteristic of him. He didn't lose many battles, on or off the
racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   The record shows Whittingham, nicknamed the Bald Eagle for his
trademark shaved head, was the sport's best big-race trainer. He
won the Santa Anita Handicap nine times. Most trainers don't get to
``run'' in the race nine times, let alone win that many. He also
won the San Juan Capistrano 14 times.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie started training during the Great Depression and didn't
get Derby fever until his later years. But when he got a taste of
Churchill Downs with Ferdinand in 1986, he came back to win it
again three years later with Sunday Silence and just missed with
Strodes Creek five years after that.
</P>
<P>
   What the record doesn't show is Whittingham's charisma and
kindness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can be nice when they feel like it or when they're in a
good mood,'' trainer Bob Baffert reflected this week. ``Charlie was
always the same. He was nice every single day.''
</P>
<P>
   A former Marine, Whittingham also could be a good-natured
roughhouser. He played hard as a young man, and even in his 70s
enjoyed a vodka or two. If he had too many, he might boast about
his fitness and literally beg to be punched in the gut. He might
also be the donor of a head butt, minus the football helmet.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter what hours Charlie kept away from the track, his
horses were never neglected.
</P>
<P>
   Once, after repeatedly trying to reach Whittingham by telephone
at Santa Anita, a frustrated reporter asked a stable hand for
advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do what everybody else does,'' the assistant offered. ``Call
him at the barn at 4 in the morning. That's when he reads the
paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Whittingham was unfailingly gracious to reporters, when he could
be cornered. When his stable was at its peak, he didn't have much
time to talk because he was trying to pay close attention to every
detail about each of his horses. Training racehorses is part
intuition. Trying to get inside the head of a horse is far from an
exact science, after all, and Whittingham was often called half
horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine with me,'' he said, ``as long as it isn't the back
half.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie didn't throw around one-liners like Baffert does, but
his sense of humor was wry and folksy, as you would expect from an
old-school legend. His best-known saying was used whenever a big
race approached and uncertainty hung in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big race tomorrow,'' he would say. ``I guess we'll find out
where Molly put the peaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he would grin, and his piercing blue eyes would sparkle.
</P>
<P>
   When he became ill, Whittingham wasn't able to spend as much
time with his horses, and his stable shrunk, eventually to be taken
over by his son, Michael. He didn't travel much, and when I saw him
a year ago, he no longer looked invincible. He was tired and
feeble, blind in his right eye and his left eye dull and watery. He
looked as if he was coming to the end of the race, but part of you
refused to believe he could ever be beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie commented in Jay Hovdey's outstanding 1993 book,
``Whittingham,'' that he would leave this world with his boots on.
He would stop training, he told Hovdey, ``when they put the pennies
on my eyes and plant me 6 feet deep.''
</P>
<P>
   Whittingham was at the races Sunday afternoon, died Tuesday
morning and will be planted 6 feet deep today.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps now he can finally solve that old mystery. Maybe he'll
find out where Molly put the peaches.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ Euki Binns has always found herself torn
between two loves: music and horse racing.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the latter has been winning the battle for her
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Binns, an accomplished pianist, is pursuing her dream of
becoming a jockey at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   Following her dream comes at the expense of her music career, an
endeavor her parents had expected her to follow. Binns even turned
down their offer to send her to the famed Juilliard School in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Binns' interest in racing wasn't a complete surprise to her
family. Her mother, Michi, was a jockey in Japan during her college
days.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Michi was one of Japan's leading riders until she was
forced to give up the sport after male jockeys at the track where
she rode went on strike in protest of her participation. She later
returned to college and earned a law degree.
</P>
<P>
   Euki Binns was playing the piano by age 5, and has since
mastered a number of instruments and won several music competitions
in her native Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to play the piano,'' said Binns, 21. ``For me, it's a
form of stress release. But I also love being outside with
horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Her music background has helped in her efforts to become a
jockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing the piano helps me have good hands on a horse,'' Binns
said. ``It's good training. I feel like I'm sensitive to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Binns began looking for work at racetracks after graduating from
high school. She found entry-level work at River Downs in
Cincinnati, then moved on to Turfway Park in Florence, Ky. Four
years ago, she ventured to one of racing's biggest tracks,
Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., and secured a job as an
exercise rider with one of the track's leading trainers, Frankie
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he was looking for riders and he would try me out
for a couple of days,'' Binns said.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days turned into four years. Binns was given the
opportunity to exercise top horses such as Pulpit, a favorite for
the 1997 Kentucky Derby until he was injured, and Arch, winner of
last year's Grade I Super Derby at Louisiana Downs in Bossier City,
La.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Binns left Brothers to travel to Lone Star Park in
an attempt to launch a career as a jockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason I came here was because there are so many big
shots who go to Churchill that I wouldn't have a shot to ride many
horses,'' she said. ``When you're learning, you want to get on a
lot of horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Before she left Brothers, the trainer helped her land her first
mount _ in January at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans. She rode
five more horses during the meeting, including her first winner.
</P>
<P>
   Business has been a little slower at Lone Star Park, where Binns
is seeking an agent to represent her and is getting to know the
local horsemen.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, she got her first Lone Star mount aboard Icee Hawk,
for Elliott Walden, one of the nation's leading trainers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a special race for the apprentice jockey because Julie
Krone, who was at Lone Star Park that day to close out her
illustrious riding career, won the same race aboard Dance to Fit.
As a result, Binns had an opportunity to spend time with Krone in
the women's locker room between races.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's another one of my mentors,'' said Binns, who placed
fifth in the race. ``She's so full of knowledge and is so willing
to pass it on.''
</P>
<P>
   Binns said her goal is to have a career like Krone, who won more
than 3,500 races and $81 million in purses during 18 years as a
jockey. While that might be far-fetched, one horseman at Lone Star
Park already believes Binns has the qualities necessary to someday
soar to those heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has everything it takes, all she needs is a chance,'' said
Jerry Quinn, an assistant trainer to Walden based at Lone Star
Park. ``She has a natural ability, and she's a hard worker. All she
needs is the horses.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The shameless sordid story can now be told only after an
extensive undercover investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Selig took the Dr. Faustus route and sold baseball's soul to
the devil.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is irrefutable.
</P>
<P>
   Faustus did business with Beezelbub in order to obtain one
moment of perfect contentment, but Selig's motives were much less
altruistic.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted a couple of sluggers to come along and break the
single-season home run record, which would allow baseball to reap
much in the way of public goodwill, marketing position and cold
hard cash.
</P>
<P>
   Selig definitely got what he wanted in Mark McGwire and Sammy
Sosa. But now the devil is extracting his due and it's doubtful
even Daniel Webster, the only lawyer ever to beat Old Scratch in a
court of law, can extract baseball from this mess.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence was right there in front of us if only we were
paying attention. The first clue came when George Steinbrenner's
team walked through the playoffs with hardly any opposition. That
right there is proof enough the devil had taken over.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the National League playoffs, completely ruined
by the underdog Padres. Instead of an exhilirating Braves-Astros
championship series, we got Kevin Brown and Trevor Hoffman instead.
No wonder the Padres play Hell's Bells when their ace reliever
enters the game.
</P>
<P>
   When spring training arrived, it became even more clear baseball
was possessed, particularly when Roger Clemens ended up playing for
Steinbrenner instead of his beloved home state.
</P>
<P>
   But it got worse. Andres Galarraga and Joe Torre were stricken
with cancer. Kerry Wood and Moises Alou were lost for the season.
Rafael Palmeiro had knee surgery twice.
</P>
<P>
   It was the spring training from you know where. But the regular
season hasn't been much better. Just look at the pile of bodies
heaped onto the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   From that rubble we pull out the final two pieces of evidence:
Barry Bonds and Cal Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds hurt? No way. He's never played less than 140 games in a
non-strike season in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows Dodgers owner Rupert Murdoch struck a pact with
the devil long ago and there was no way his team was going to win
the division unless the Giants lost their best player. That also
explains the Padres firesale and the Rockies interia. Randy Johnson
better be careful.
</P>
<P>
   How about Ripken? First his magnificent streak comes to an end,
then he goes on the disabled list for the first time in his career.
Pretty suspicious huh? Now consider who benefits the most from all
this.
</P>
<P>
   Who now has the longest consecutive games played streak in
baseball? Who is the center of attention in Baltimore now that
Ripken is and Will Clark are on the disabled list?
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle, that's who.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution rests.
</P>
<P>
   All evidence points back to Selig. He was the one who brought
baseball to the brink of disaster with his leadership during the
1994-95 players strike. He's the one who has desperately tried
everything to get baseball back including realignment, interleague
play and expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he came to the conclusion there were no earthly
solutions so he entered into an unholy conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Now we just need to figure out what Don Fehr's role in all this
is.

Oilers bring rugged style to the playoff party (For use by NYTimes
News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Defenseman Janne Niinimaa sounded very much like a
``SportsCenter'' anchor, save for his Finnish accent.
</P>
<P>
   He animatedly described hit after hit he and his Oilers
teammates delivered in Game 1 against the Stars on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``... Georges \RLaraque\S leveled \RJere\S Lehtinen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``... when \RMike Grier\S gets you in his bull's eye, bye,
bye.''
</P>
<P>
   ``... \RJason Smith\S got his licks in.''
</P>
<P>
   He skipped analysis of all 64 hits, instead being content to
predict that number to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it has to be that way. We're underdogs. We're coming
from behind, so we have to be desperate,'' Niinimaa said. ``So you
can look for the number of hits to go up.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Oilers center Todd Marchant: ``We'd like to take it as far
as it can go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'' includes him, although, his Oilers have a couple of
designated hammers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'' is the hard checks and constant banging that were so
prevalent in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as it can go'' is likely to be pushed to the limit
starting at 7:30 tonight at Reunion Arena when Game 2 begins. The
Oilers realize with only three skaters under 6 feet compared to
nine for the Stars, physical play is the best way to close the
36-point, regular-season gap between the teams.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Hammer, meet Mr. Nail.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers' designated hammers include defensemen Christian
LaFlamme, Smith and Niinimaa along with forwards Laraque and Grier.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest,'' Smith said, ``we all like to bang.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two Oilers players were without hits on Wednesday and one
was goalie Tommy Salo. Smith had a game-high 13 hits, with Niinimaa
adding another eight.
</P>
<P>
   If the Oilers have designated hammers, they also have designated
certain Stars players as nails.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to hit everybody,'' LaFlamme said, ``but
especially their best players, like \RMike\S Modano, \RJoe\S
Nieuwendyk, \RBrett\S Hull, Lehtinen and \RSergei\S Zubov.''
</P>
<P>
   His selections have a common theme. They are players perceived
as not necessarily physical.
</P>
<P>
   So much for perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding me?'' Oilers coach Ron Low asked. ``I thought
that Joe Nieuwendyk played his best game against us in a long, long
time. He played physical. Modano, too. Lehtinen got hit 15 times
and never showed a sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Said LaFlamme: ``If it's true, I didn't see it last game.''
</P>
<P>
   He instead watched Nieuwendyk punch back when tangling with him
in a second-period fray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's where the challenge comes,'' Nieuwendyk said.
``Teams will be physical on us, and I think it sends a message back
to them that if you hold your ground and you get physical back;
then they know you're not going away and it's going to be a long,
hard series.''
</P>
<P>
   Bumping and grinding dissolved into boarding and bleeding in the
final moments of Game 1, prompting Stars coach Ken Hitchcock to
send enforcer Grant Marshall in for a faceoff.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall isn't a center, he usually doesn't take faceoffs and
Low wasn't amused. He said that if the Stars weren't careful he'd
send in Laraque for a faceoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we could've had a real faceoff,'' Low said. ``If that's
the way you want to go, I have no problem with that. There is
nobody over there that matches up with Georges, so if you want to
get into that we can definitely go there. I have no problem with
that at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, I think Georges may invite him sometime before the
series is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Looks like 64 may just have been a beginning, after all.

NATO AND A NEW EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Friday, April 23: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The caterers and champagne producers may be disappointed that
NATO has scaled back its 50th anniversary gathering in Washington
this week because of the conflict in Kosovo, but the alliance need
not mourn the change. After unsuccessfully seeking a new purpose
since the end of the Cold War, NATO has found a difficult but
worthy challenge in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Abstract debates about NATO's role in Europe have suddenly given
way to tangible decisions about combating Slobodan Milosevic. A
month of warfare in the Balkans has exposed the strengths and
weaknesses of the alliance. This weekend is a fine moment for NATO
to consider how it intends to prosecute the war and to ponder how
to deal with eruptions of ethnic violence in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The threats and military doctrines that once defined NATO are
obsolete, and the alliance must recognize that its role now may be
as much offensive as defensive. Europe no longer faces a monolithic
threat from the East. Today the greatest danger comes from ethnic
conflict and regional satraps like Slobodan Milosevic. Threatening
the use of nuclear weapons, once the backbone of NATO plans to stop
a Soviet invasion, makes no sense in a place like Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO can play a critical role, as Kosovo shows. Even though
the air war lacks the approval of the United Nations Security
Council, it has the endorsement of NATO's 19 members _ 17 European
nations, Canada and America. That unity may come with some
hesitation about when and how intensely to attack, but Kosovo has
demonstrated that Washington and its allies can act collectively
against aggression, and act compassionately to assist hundreds of
thousands of refugees. The immediate issue before the alliance is
whether to open the invasion option by drafting plans for a land
campaign and sending ground forces to the Balkans. The answer
should be affirmative. Air strikes may yet compel Milosevic to seek
peace. NATO, in the end, may decide that the use of ground troops
is not justified, or may employ them as peacekeepers rather than
invaders if a political settlement is reached. But the alliance
should not preclude the option Friday. If nothing else, the
movement of troops, tanks and artillery, which is likely to take
two or three months, may cause Milosevic to reconsider his
position.
</P>
<P>
   The extended time required to assemble an army of at least
100,000 soldiers in the Balkans suggests that NATO needs a more
agile fighting force. Milosevic might have acted with greater
restraint had he feared the presence of more mobile ground forces
in Europe, even if NATO initially said it had no plan to use them.
Size and firepower may be less important than speed and
maneuverability in an era of regional and local conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and his NATO counterparts should also discuss
the sensitive issue of when it is appropriate for NATO to intervene
in a nation like Yugoslavia. When an aggressor strikes across
borders, especially those of a NATO member, the case for a military
response is usually clear.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo suggests that intervention may also be justified when a
tyrant orders a genocidal assault against his own people or drives
hundreds of thousands of citizens from their homeland. It would be
preferable for NATO to act with the approval of the security
council in such circumstances, and the alliance should move only
after diplomatic efforts fail. But there will probably be other
cases where action is required and security council support is
unattainable because Russia or China object.
</P>
<P>
   President Harry Truman and the leaders of a war-battered Europe
gathered in Washington at midcentury to meet the rising threat of
the Soviet Union. The alliance they formed helped preserve the
peace for five decades. At the close of the century, Clinton and
his allies must determine how to wage a small but dangerous war in
the Balkans and how to reshape NATO to serve a Europe that is
largely free but not yet immune to conflict. &QL;

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WHEN the Rockets returned to the court to start the second half
against Dallas on Wednesday, they looked as if they had turned out
for a graveside service. And when the fans began fleeing the
building with five or six minutes to go, you could almost read
their minds:
</P>
<P>
   ``Geez, maybe we should leave now, in case anybody tries to
slash our tires.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, among the sad-sack Mavericks, who led by 26 points in
the fourth quarter, you have never seen such gaiety, such
hand-slapping, such teeth. The Mavs, the comic, inept,
bottom-feeding Mavs, played the fourth quarter pretty much on
cruise control because they knew _ everyone knew _ that the Rockets
didn't have a meaningful run in them.
</P>
<P>
   You could build a circumstantial case that this was the kind of
game with the potential to drive a strong man to drink. But that
would be too easy, too cheap and perhaps too close to traffic
court.
</P>
<P>
   On what may well have been the sickest game of Houston's season,
it qualifies as theatrical overkill for Scottie Pippen to be
arrested some three hours later on suspicion of driving while
intoxicated. The recorded facts are these: Pippen was stopped for
running a red light, refused to take a Breathalyzer test, was
booked and released after posting a $500 bond.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that Pippen vigorously denied that he was
drunk, and by all accounts he cooperated with the police. Under the
minimum standards of public discourse, he is presumed innocent.
</P>
<P>
   But apart from the legal distinctions, one can't escape the
irony of the former Chicago Bulls player being singled out. If the
cops had reacted earlier, and checked out the scene at Compaq
Center, they might have busted the entire team on suspicion of
impersonating a championship contender.
</P>
<P>
   As the score mounted, as the game turned from a contest to a
rout to a party, the young Mavericks could not contain themselves.
It might have been sad, watching a sometimes great team catch a pie
in the face, if it hadn't felt so good. If the Mavericks appeared
to laugh out loud, it was not in derision, but in the pure joy of
self-discovery. Well, maybe a little bit in derision. This was
their first victory over the Rockets in 11 encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are eight games left in this Reader's Digest condensed
season, and the Rockets did not protect their home court, did not
gain ground on the Spurs or the Lakers in the race to the playoffs,
and did not pass go. It may be too late to wonder how much the
Rockets are second-guessing their decision to beam up Scottie. It
is certainly not too early. Pippen has been questioning himself
ever since he blew into town on a wave of headlines, hailed as the
team's latest transplanted superhero.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen could do everything that the retired Clyde Drexler could
do, has six rings and hair and is three years younger. But he has
spent a troublesome amount of time trying to fit into the Rockets'
system and asking such questions as, Why am I here? What is my
role? Whose team is this?
</P>
<P>
   Against Dallas, Pippen scored four points and, like his
teammates, was defenseless against the Mavericks, who have no star.
In a league that loves exotic names, what the Mavs do have is a
20-year-old German Wunderkind named Dirk Nowitzki, a 7-foot-6
Mormon named Shawn Bradley and a future franchise player in Michael
Finley.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Rockets are 12 games over .500 and feeling
depressed. The Mavericks are 12 games under, going nowhere and
loving their underdog status, their chance to be the spoilers.
</P>
<P>
   It seems like only a week ago that Pippen was taking charge,
exploding for 31 points against Portland, and announcing that he
had decided it was time to get aggressive, to fit himself into the
offense. By gosh, it was only a week ago. Time flies when you are
getting blown out by the dregs of the league.
</P>
<P>
   If an unfair portion of the blame for the Rockets' inconsistency
seems to fall on Pippen, we can only belabor the obvious: Life in
the NBA wasn't meant to be fair. The Rockets may be asking if they
are getting their money's worth from a contract that pays Pippen $8
million a season. Having lost in their bid to sign Antonio McDyess,
they could not believe their good fortune when they wound up with
the guy they said they really wanted, the guy who had been Michael
Jordan's sidekick and Air Apparent in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Do you suppose Scottie ever regrets leaving the Windy City? He
would have been The Man on a lesser team but perhaps the savior for
keeping the Bulls out of the cellar.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen clearly misses the triangle offense that was as familiar
to him as the ring in his ear. He has whined about the
predictability of the Rockets' offense, the old inside-outside
game, but no one complains about it when the gunners are hitting
the 3s and the team wins.
</P>
<P>
   And, no, we won't drink to that.

 &HT;    Poll suggests voters know Bush by name, not recordBy Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Two new polls show that Gov. George W. Bush's
popularity may be based more on name and image than substance and
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   A Texas Poll released today shows Bush winning favorable ratings
from 78 percent of the respondents, down a bit from the 81 percent
favorable rating in a February poll.
</P>
<P>
   But in an indication that he is not closely identified with any
initiative or accomplishment, 45 percent of the respondents
answered ``don't know'' or ``not sure'' when asked to name Bush's
top accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``While nearly half of all Texans can think of nothing to credit
as Bush's accomplishments while governor, for those who can,
education efforts top the list, with 19 percent citing Bush's
educational accomplishments,'' said Texas Poll Director Beverly
Barnum.
</P>
<P>
   Barnum also noted that the question about Bush's top
accomplishment was an open-ended one that required respondents to
come up with an answer, not choose from among suggested answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not surprising,'' she said of the 45 percent who couldn't
identify Bush with a particular issue. ``About half the people at
any time don't know much about anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush presidential exploratory committee spokeswoman Mindy Tucker
said the governor's high favorable ratings show that Texans
``appreciate the tone that he has set as a leader on a variety of
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And they do recognize that education has been his number one
priority,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   In another indication that Bush's popularity might be fragile,
an independent poll of New Hampshire Republicans shows that his
lead evaporates when a short biography is substituted for his name.
</P>
<P>
   The Reuters/Zogby Poll in New Hampshire was conducted two ways,
once with names and once without. When candidate names were used,
Bush piled up a huge lead, picking up 38.4 percent of the support
among the 309 likely Republican voters contacted this month.
Elizabeth Dole was second at 14.9 percent. Arizona Sen. John McCain
was third at 8.9 percent and former Vice President Dan Quayle was
fourth at 8.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the picture changed dramatically when names were removed and
short biographies were used. Bush dropped to 24.1 percent. McCain
shot up to second at 19.2 percent which, because of the 5.7
percentage point margin of error, puts McCain and Bush in a
statistical dead heat. Dole dropped to fifth place at 7.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky said the results show that the
Arizona senator ``is a very compelling figure and has a fantastic
story and personal background.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As more people get to know more about him they will find him
very appealing,'' Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential contender Gary Bauer picked up the most ground when
names were omitted. With names, Bauer finished 11th, last, with
support from 0.5 percent. Without names, Bauer moved up to fourth
with 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``blind'' version of the poll, Bush was described as a
recently re-elected governor of a ``large Southern state'' who has
a ``strong record on taxes and education and calls himself a
compassionate conservative'' and has ``strong appeal among
Hispanics and women.''

   Poll director John Zogby, whose firm conducted the survey for
the Reuters news organization, said the results should serve as a
warning to Bush, who will not hit the campaign trail until the
legislative session ends on May 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has to get out of the rose garden,'' Zogby said.
``That's a clear message. A lot of his support at this point in
time appears to be name recognition support, and there are other
people with biographies that can be very appealing to the public.
There could be some surprises here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said Bush's strong showing in the version of the poll
with names should not be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is, if he decides to run, his name will be on the
ballot, and people will know his name and his record,'' she said.
``Governor Bush recognizes he still has a lot of work to do. He has
not visited New Hampshire yet, and he looks forward to traveling up
there soon to tell them what he believes and hear what they have to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's first trip to New Hampshire won't come until June at the
earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby also noted that Bush's impressive team of New Hampshire
supporters, as well as a money-raising machine unmatched by foes,
leaves the governor well-positioned to shore up support when he
begins campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   The brief biographies used to describe the candidates in the
blind poll are intended to be ``fair and balanced and bland and
accurate,'' Zogby said.

   On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore's lead over
former Sen. Bill Bradley is virtually the same in both versions of
the poll. With names, Gore leads 52 percent to 35 percent. Without
names, Gore's edge is 53 percent to 33 percent.

<P>
   The Texas Poll's early test of Bush's presidential candidacy
showed him with a huge lead in the state.
</P>
<P>
   In a head-to-head primary matchup with Dole, Bush led 68 percent
to 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also indicates Bush would easily carry the state in a
general election matchup with Gore, 69 percent to 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Poll was conducted March 30 through April 17. The
margin of error for the poll, which includes responses from 1,003
adults, is 3 percentage points.
