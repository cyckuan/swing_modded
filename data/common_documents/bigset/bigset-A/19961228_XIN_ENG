<HEADLINE> US Durable Goods Orders Down in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. factories' orders for
durable goods unexpectedly fell by 1.6 percent in November, the
first decline in three months, U.S. Commerce Department reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that orders for durable goods totaled a
seasonally adjusted 171.8 billion dollars in the month, down from
a revised 174.6 billion in October. The advance of orders in
October was revised up to 0.5 percent, stronger than the initial
estimate of just 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
It was the first drop since orders fell 3.6 percent in last
August. Analysts said that it was a sign of slowdown of U.S.
economy as continued losses could result in declining production
and fewer jobs.
</P>
<P>
So far in 1996, U.S. orders for durable goods, those expected
to last more than three year, are 5.6 percent above those of the
same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the sharp decline in the orders was led by
orders for electronic and other electrical equipment which plunged
by 9.3 percent in November, reversing a 16.9 percent jump a month
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The transportation orders were unchanged in November after
falling 6.8 percent a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Excluding transportation, orders were off 2.2 percent, also the
first drop since August and the largest decline since a 2.4
percent decrease in January 1993.
</P>
<P>
Unfilled orders edged up 0.3 percent after gains of 1.2 percent
in October and 0.7 percent in September. It was the sixth increase
in the last seven months.
</P>
<P>
Shipments, a measure of current activity, also rose by 0.8
percent after falling 1.2 percent in October.

<HEADLINE> Army Chief: Israel not Close to War with Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli army's Chief of
Staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak said today that Israel is not close to a
war with Syria, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark following an earlier comment by his deputy,
Matan Vilna'i that "the likelihood of a war with Syria is greater
than it was a year or two ago."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Israel radio after visiting Israeli soldiers
wounded during the latest clashes with Hezbollah in south Lebanon,
Shahak said that "there is always erratically danger of war."
</P>
<P>
However, the chief of staff added that "alarming statements,
which were not true, must be stopped."
</P>
<P>
Today's Jerusalem Post quoted Vilna'i as saying that the
Israeli army has increased its preparedness for war in the wake of
the Syrian redeployment along Mount Hermon, between Israel and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Revealing the army's plan for 1997, Vilna'i said that the army
has replenished exhausted ammunition supplies, introduced
advanced artillery and upgraded tanks, and improved exercises.
</P>
<P>
Vilna'i said the military has been preparing for a
confrontation with Syria since August, when Syria moved a
division from Beirut, Lebanese capital, to the slopes of Mount
Hermon.
</P>
<P>
He said the army envisions a scenario whereby Syria
attempts a surprise attack on the Golan Heights with a
massive amount of ground troops and tanks.
</P>
<P>
The army's response, Vilna'i said, has twofold, first, it
has determined targets to attack within Syria should war
erupt; second, the army has increased the level of its
standing army while providing soldiers with more advanced
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The result is that the army has been able to respond to
threats on several fronts simultaneously, he said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy chief stressed that the army has not been on
alert for war, instead, the military is improving its
capability in case of such a development.
</P>
<P>
The standing army has increased 30 percent over the last
few years, Vilna'i said, and entire corps such as the air
force and intelligence depend solely on recruits.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the increased number of recruits has
been accompanied by a lack of motivation to serve in combat
field units among Israeli youth.
</P>
<P>
Vilna's said the benefits of a large standing army were
stressed during the recent tensions with Syria, adding such a
force could manage to repel a massive attack, including the
use of Syrian missiles, until the reserves are mobilized.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli army is a reserve army and this principle
has not changed," Vilna'i said.
</P>
<P>
"A standing army is very expensive," he said. "But, we
see the benefits of large, trained standing army, equipped with
the best weapons. It is the first line of defense."
</P>
<P>
Vilna'i said that during 1997 the Israeli army will receive
several F-151 fighter-jets, Israel's most advanced warplane, Black
Hawk helicopters, Merkava III tanks and MRLS artillery.

<HEADLINE> France Sends New Year's Gift to Iraq, Could Irritate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 27 (Xinhua) -- France today formally announced
its withdrawal from the Turkey-based allied force against Iraq, a
gesture which will please Baghdad but could irritate Washington.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry said in a communique that since the
humanitarian part initially described in the "Provide Comfort"
mission no longer exists in the mission of the new allied air
force, France will not participate in it.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and the United States agreed to replace the "Provide
Comfort" mission, launched at the end of the 1991 Gulf War by the
United States, Britain, France and Turkey, with a new allied force
with a six-month mission which will still be deployed in Incirlik,
southern Turkey, to protect the Kurdish population in northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anita Limido said that the
French decision would not affect the "excellent Franco-American
relations, marked by dialogue and compromise."
</P>
<P>
Tension has been high recently between France and the United
States over a number of issues, including the reform of the NATO
commanding structure, the naming of the U.N. secretary general,
and the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France has been urging the softening of
international economic embargo against Iraq, which has been in
force since the latter's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990,
including the latest application of the U.N. "Oil for Food" plan
with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
France, a major arms-supplier of Baghdad before the Gulf War,
is aiming to return to the country to take the bulk of its
reconstruction projects, and French oil groups of Total and
Elf-Aquitaine are eager to exploit two big oil fields in southern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Delegates of some forty French enterprises specialized in food
and agriculture will visit Baghdad in mid-January to discuss
cooperations between the two countries in such fields.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman described the
application of "Oil for Food" plan as a breakthrough in
normalization of relations between Iraq and the international
community, and called it "an encouraging sign."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France will continue to participate in the allied
"Southern Watch" operation launched simultaneously with the
"Provide Comfort," which imposes a no-fly zone on Iraq over its
territories south of 32nd north parallel.
</P>
<P>
France rejected a unilateral decision by the United States to
extend the no-fly zone to 33rd parallel in September, after U.S.
pounded Iraq with two rounds of missiles for attacking Kurds in
the northern provinces.
</P>
<P>
France has about six military aircraft among the 50 allied
fighters based in southern Turkey. They will end their mission in
the "Provide Comfort" operation by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> China, Russia Agree to Boost Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin today agreed to expand economic
relations between the two countries and increase trade volume to
20 billion U.S. dollars in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in the Kremlin with Li, Yeltsin said bilateral
economic cooperation has broad prospects and it is not a
conjecture, but practicable goal for the two sides to increase the
trade volume to 20 billion dollars in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia and China can establish long-term cooperation in
the fields of energy, manufacturing, space, transport, military
technology and China's Three Gorges dam project.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier expressed satisfaction with the development
of Sino-Russian relations in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Li recalled Yeltsin's historical trip to China in April and
stressed that it is a long-term policy for China to develop
strategic partnership with Russia.
</P>
<P>
He said his current visit to Moscow not only marks the
inauguration of a regular meeting mechanism between premiers of
the two countries, but will also yield several important
agreements, including Russia's supply to China of two Megawatt
nuclear power units and cooperation in banking and military
technology.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said he believed that the two-day working visit of Li
and the inauguration of the regular meeting mechanism between the
premiers would give positive impetus to cooperation between the
two countries in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said his country wishes to develop strategic
partnership with China and pass on such a relationship from
generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia's political parties and business circles all
want to make more contacts with the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
In the talks, Li appreciated Russia's consistency with its "One
China" policy which considers Taiwan as an inalienable part of the
Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said Russia will strictly stick to the presidential
decrees he had issued over this issue and will not establish any
official ties and make any deals with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He assured Li that Russia's position on the issue is consistent
and steadfast.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also declared that Russia will work with China to
complete the demarcation work at the eastern section of the
Chinese-Russian border by 1997 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Li, who arrived in Moscow on Thursday, became the first foreign
leader Yeltsin has met since his return to the Kremlin on Monday
after his bypass surgery on November 5.

<HEADLINE> PM: Lebanon Must Host Asian Football Event Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri called here today for a general mobilization in his
country for a "successful" hosting of the 12th Asian Cup finals of
football matches in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The success of the event is a success for all the country
and its failure is a failure for all the country," the prime
minister told a rally in his Beirut residence.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab
Emirates, last Saturday, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC)
decided to choose Lebanon as the host of the 12th Asian Cup
finals.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the rally organized by the Lebanese Footfall
Association and attended by government officials and foreign
diplomats, the prime minister praised the AFC's decision.
</P>
<P>
"This choice indicated the place where Lebanon has reached,
and indicated an international conviction that Lebanon has
seriously started the reconstruction process and has retrieved
confidence and position it deserved," Hariri underlined.
</P>
<P>
It was only a starting point to obtain the AFC's authorization
to host the final football matches, he said, and the more
difficult task is to make the event successful.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister called for national unity and continuous
efforts in order to make this "big and great event" successful.
</P>
<P>
The 11th Asian cup finals were held in the United Arab
Emirates last week. Lebanon was not among the 12 teams in the
finals.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government, which has made a stride in the
reconstruction of the war-devastated country, hopes that hosting
Asia's biggest soccer event will be a further boost to the
country's international image.

<HEADLINE> Banks Losing Market Share and Customer Satisfaction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Customer loyalty to U.S.
banks is declining, according to the 1996 survey of consumer
attitudes sponsored by American Banker, the daily financial
services newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The survey, the subject of a series running in the newspaper
through January 3, revealed that 49 percent of financial consumers
consider a commercial bank to be their principal institution.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in the 13 years the survey has been
conducted that this measure of customer loyalty has fallen below
50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Also for the first time, a sizable segment of the survey base
-- 18 percent -- said it had no primary financial relationship or
had one with a nondepository institution such as a securities
broker or mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that customers' satisfaction with their
principal institutions is generally sliding downward. The number
of people saying they are "very satisfied" dropped this year to 59
percent from 62 percent. The decline was more pronounced among
bank and credit union customers, while savings institutions and
non-depositories did a bit better than last year, according to
the survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted for American Banker by the Gallup
Organization in September and October. Gallup conducted telephone
interviews with a representative sample of 1,031 adult heads of
household, each maintaining at least one account at a financial
services institution.

<HEADLINE> Abrupt Descent of Cold Wave Reveals Homeless Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The abrupt descent of the cold
wave, which reduced temperatures to below minus 10 degrees in many
areas in France for several days, has revealed the problem of
homelessness in the country.
</P>
<P>
Five homeless people have been killed by the cold weather in
the past few days in France, most of them elderly people too weak
to resist the cold in their make-to-do shelters such as railway
stations, houses under construction, and caravans.
</P>
<P>
The French government has ordered public services to "be on
alert" to save homeless people from the cold wave, which is
expected to last for several days more.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000 emergency shelters have been provided to the
homeless during the past few days. In the Paris region alone,
2,800 shelters are set up, while a special telephone number has
been opened for calling night emergency rescue services.
</P>
<P>
However, local media said that these measures cannot cover all
the people in distress, because many of them are too far from the
"social circuits" to call for help.
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Monde said that more and more homeless people,
especially the elderly, no longer have either the strength or idea
to call for help.
</P>
<P>
The report said that although it is impossible to know whether
people living in caravans, forest cabins, garden shelters, or
squats have increased in the past few years, more and more young
people under 25 years old are beginning to live in such precarious
shelters.
</P>
<P>
Some families ejected from their apartments by their land-lords
have refused to take shelter in emergency houses, because the
families could be separated in these places.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus: Missing Persons' Issue Needs Effective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will urge an effective
U.N. operation in setting the issue of missing persons arising
from the 1974 Turkish invasion of the island, according to the
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides will send a letter to new
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan about the missing persons issue,
Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides told reporters here today.
</P>
<P>
The letter will deal with "the effective operation of the
U.N. investigative committee" on the issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
The letter will also contain a reply to a letter by the
outgoing U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali who,
according to press reports, suggested Clerides declare 992 missing
persons dead.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides said Annan's estimations should not be pre-judged
or taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
"We have the responsibility to contact him and tell him
our thoughts on how the issue should proceed," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,619 people were listed as missing persons
after the 1974 Turkish invasion and control of 37 per cent
of the island's territory following a short-lived coup seeking
union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. committee was set up for the issue, but not a single
case has been solved.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash alleged in March
this year that all missing persons have been murdered by
members of Turkish Cypriot paramilitary organizations during the
Turkish invasion.

<HEADLINE> China Respects Russia's Foreign Policy, Li Peng Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here today that China respects Russia's foreign policy and fully
understands its concern over the Northern Atlantic Treaty
Organization's proposed eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
At his meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin in the
Kremlin, Li said China does not favor a single-polar world and
believes that the formation of a multi-polar world could benefit
global peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Li was the first foreign leader received by Yeltsin, who
returned to the Kremlin after a heart surgery early last month.
</P>
<P>
"We do not need a dominator" in the world, said Yeltsin, adding
that "in the multi-polar world coming into being, there must be
neither leaders nor the led."
</P>
<P>
The Russian president believes that the establishment of
strategic cooperation partnership between Russia and China will
help create a multi-polar world.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said the Russian-Sino cooperation is going well in the
fields of disarmament, regional conflicts and the launching of
a new international political-economic order within the framework
of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Li told Yeltsin that Russia, a big power with huge potentials
and rich resources, should become an important "pole" in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said China and Russia share many views over the
international situation and China fully understands Russia's
concern over NATO's oft-stated eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader also stressed that China is ready to develop
friendly relations with all countries around the globe on the
basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng arrived here Thursday for a two-day working visit,
during which he was scheduled to hold talks with his Russian
counterpart Viktor Chernomyrdin and sign accords on bilateral
economic cooperation.

<HEADLINE> ITWF Stands for No Reform on African Ports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The International Transport
Workers Federation (ITWF) has resolved that no ports in Africa
should undergo any reform without consultations among key players
in the industry, the Kenya Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Resolutions passed at an ITWF-organized joint dockers and
seafarers conference held recently in Kenya's port city of
Mombasa noted, reform process like privatization of ports in
Africa without proper consultations might lead to negative
effect.
</P>
<P>
Representatives attending the conference from 17 African
states pointed out that there is no standard formula for port
restructuring that can be universally applied.
</P>
<P>
The conference heard the negative effects brought about by
privatization and other port reforms on the employment and
working conditions of dockworkers in the continent.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Tripartite International Labor
Organization (TILO) also noted the negative effects on social and
labor problems caused by Structural Adjustment Programs in the
shipping industry in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The TILO pointed out that exchanges of information and
cooperation between governments, employers and workers
representatives should precede the initial stages of reforms.
</P>
<P>
For efficient port reforms, the TILO added, all parties
affected by the reform should be involved in the process of
verifiable research, joint decision making and implementation.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, Secretary General of the Dockworkers
Union of Kenya Juma Khamisi was elected chairman for ITWF
African region for a four-year term.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 27 (Xinhua) -- China and Russia signed two
agreements on nuclear and banking cooperation here today.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Chinese Premier Li Peng and his Russian counterpart
Viktor Chernomyrdin attended the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Under the nuclear agreement, Russia will help equip a nuclear
plant in Lianyungang, a coastal city in eastern China, with two
Russia-made VVER-1000 reactors, each with a capacity of 1 million
kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
The plant is expected to go into operation at the beginning of
the coming century.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu, Palestinian Negotiators Discuss Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu met here this afternoon with Palestinian
negotiators to give finishing touches to an emerging agreement on
partial Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank city of
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The talks focussed on security aspects on the draft agreement
which is most likely to be initialed in a few days, according to
a report of Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli-Palestinian Joint Steering Committee,
headed respectively by Netanyahu's political adviser Dore Gold
and Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat, convened in a
hotel here.
</P>
<P>
Before his meeting with the Palestinian security officials,
Netanyahu said at a weekly cabinet session that he is optimistic
that the agreement on Israeli troop redeployment in Hebron will
be initialed early next week.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister told the cabinet that the main problem
holding up the agreement was the reopening of the 250-meter-long
Shuhada Street, which has been closed after a Jewish settler shot
dead 29 Muslim worshipers in the Ibrahimi Mosque in the city
center in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that the agreement will also include a buffer
zone separating six Jewish enclaves from the 120,000 Palestinian
citizens. But Erekat said this morning that no buffer zone will
be created in the city.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Dissident Ex-Prime Minister Arrives in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese former prime minister
Al-Sadeq Al-Mahdi and some of his family members, who fled their
country early this month, arrived here today from the Eritrean
capital of Asmara.
</P>
<P>
Al-Mahdi, also leader of the Al-Ummah Party, said upon his
arrival that he would stay here for at least a week and meet with
some Egyptian officials to discuss the future of the Sudan-Egypt
relations.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to meet with Egyptian Vice-Prime Minister and
Minister of Agriculture Youssef Wali who doubles as secretary
general of the ruling National Democratic Party chaired by
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
He will also hold talks with Prime Minister Kamal Al-Ganzouri
and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
On the reason of defecting Sudan on December 5, he said "I
tried to go on with my political activity from within Sudan, but I
encountered many obstacles."
</P>
<P>
"However, I secures some positive results, then left Sudan to
deprive the ruling regime of using me as a hostage," he said. He
would cooperate with his brothers in exile "to achieve the goals
of our people," he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked on the place where he reside outside Sudan, Al-Mahdi said
"I have not decided the matter so far."
</P>
<P>
He denied that he was aware of the U.S. material assistance to
the Sudanese opposition forces and said "I know that there is
assistance to the neighboring counties."
</P>
<P>
Cairo is the first leg in his tour of a number of Arab and
European countries that will take some three months, he added.
</P>
<P>
One of the aims of Al-Mahdi's visit to Egypt is to discuss with
the Egyptian leaders the relations between Cairo and Asmara with a
view to eliminating any misunderstanding between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Eritrean relations are somewhat cold due to
Asmara's belief that Cairo supports Yemen since the eruption of
the Eritrean-Yemeni dispute over the Hanish islands, south of the
Red Sea, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Al-Mahdi will also deliver several lectures on democracy in
Sudan, the human rights, the Egyptian-Sudanese ties and the policy
of the Islamic Front in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Al-Mahdi assumed the premiership in 1986 but was overthrown in
1989 in a bloodless coup staged by armymen deployed around the
capital. Coup leader Omar Hassan Ahmed Al Bashir named himself
prime minister after the coup.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Warns EU on Unfriendly Posture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria today warned the
European Union (EU) to desist from its unfriendly posture toward
it or face a review of relations between it and the European
countries.
</P>
<P>
If EU continues such posture, said Chief of General Staff
Lt.-Gen. Oladipo Diya, "our government may, in the same vein, and
in our national interest, be compelled to review its economic and
social relations with the European Union."
</P>
<P>
Diya made the remarks while addressing ambassadors and
representatives of the EU at the State House in the national
capital of Abuja.
</P>
<P>
He urged affected countries "to embrace the path of dialogue
with Nigeria rather than being confrontational in our mutual
interests," the News Agency of Nigeria reported.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the EU representatives in Nigeria have been
boycotting all major events of the military administration,
including those involving the head of state, General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Diya cited the presentation of the new draft constitution by
the Constitutional Conference to the head of state and the recent
patron's dinner of the Nigerian Institute of International
Affairs, both in Abuja, to back up his claim.
</P>
<P>
The latter, according to sources here, is an annual event
during which an important speech on the country's foreign policy
is usually made by the head of state.
</P>
<P>
Diya, the number two person in the military government next
only to General Abacha, also expressed displeasure with the
decision of the EU to slam sanctions on Nigeria after the hanging
of writer Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogonis in November last
year.
</P>
<P>
"Let me state that this continuing stance of the European
Union has clearly portrayed it as an unfriendly organization
working against the vital corporate interest of our country,"
Diya said, quoted by the official news agency.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the core interest of countries which
comprise the EU, in Africa and not least Nigeria, has been the
pursuit of purely economic objectives from colonial rule up to
the present.
</P>
<P>
In recent times, however, the EU has tried to compel Nigeria
to take actions and policies that would only enhance the
realization of their economic objective, "thereby blatantly
ignoring the country's national sensitivities and peculiar
circumstances," Diya said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "it is a matter of deep regret that in pursuit of
your policies, the European Union has deliberately ignored the
positive political and social programs embarked upon by this
administration which are crucial for the establishment of last
peace and stability in our relatively young nation."

<HEADLINE> China, Russia Vow to Push Forward Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin today vowed to push forward a
"strategic partnership" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is in Moscow for a two-day working visit, became the
first foreign leader Yeltsin has met since his return to the
Kremlin on Monday after his bypass surgery on November 5.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian people are in favor of a strategic partnership
between the two countries and Russia's political parties, social
institutions and business circles all hope for more contacts with
the Chinese side," Yeltsin told Li in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia wishes to pass on the strategic partnership with
China from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of strategic partnership between the two
countries is a necessity and will help bring about a multi-polar
world, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Li said: "To develop the relationship with Russia is by no
means an expedient, but a long-term policy of China."
</P>
<P>
President Yeltsin paid a historical visit to China in April
this year, during which the two countries agreed to establish a
strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Premier said China respects Russia's foreign policy
and fully understands its concern over the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's planned eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
Li said China does not favor a single-polar world and believes
that the formation of a multi-polar world could benefit global
peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin agreed with Li on the issue. "We do not need a
dominator" in the world, he said, adding that "in the multi-polar
world coming into being, there must be neither leaders nor the
led."
</P>
<P>
Li told Yeltsin that Russia, a big power with huge potentials
and rich resources, should become an important "pole" in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader also stressed that China is ready to develop
friendly relations with all other countries around the globe on
the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
In the talks, Li and Yeltsin agreed that the presidents of the
two countries hold a summit meeting in Moscow in the coming April.
</P>
<P>
Li said the forthcoming visit to Russia by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin would be of great importance to the further
development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said he is looking forward to Jiang's visit.
</P>
<P>
The Russian leader expressed satisfaction with the current
Sino-Russian relations. He said the two countries have pushed
their relations to a new level of development.
</P>
<P>
"The strategic agreements, achieved between us, are working,"
Yeltsin said, adding that Li's current Moscow trip to launch the
regular meeting mechanism between the Chinese premier and Russian
prime minister would give fresh impetus to the cooperation between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
At the one-hour meeting, Li and Yeltsin agreed to expand
economic relations between the two countries and increase
bilateral trade volume to 20 billion U.S. dollars in the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said bilateral economic cooperation has broad prospects
and it is not a conjecture, but practicable goal for the two sides
to increase their trade volume to 20 billion dollars in the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia and China can establish long-term cooperation in
the fields of energy, manufacturing, space, transport, military
technology and China's Three Gorges dam project.
</P>
<P>
In the talks, Li appreciated Russia's consistency with its "One
China" policy which considers Taiwan as an inalienable part of the
Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said Russia will strictly stick to the presidential
decrees he had issued over this issue and will not establish any
official ties and make any deals with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He assured Li that Russia's position on the issue is consistent
and steadfast.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also declared that Russia will work with China to
complete the demarcation work at the eastern section of the
Chinese-Russian border in 1997 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Moscow, Li was also scheduled to hold talks
with his Russian counterpart, Viktor Chernomyrdin, and sign
accords on bilateral economic cooperation.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief Urges Africa to Work toward Peace, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim today
called on African peoples to work harder toward achieving peace
and development in the African continent in the coming new year.
</P>
<P>
In a new year message, Salim said, ''1996 proved to be a very
difficult and trying year for africa,'' adding that ''despite the
tremendous amount of energy that our people and governments
deployed in 1996, the vagaries of poverty and under-development
and the tragedies arising from natural and man-made disasters
continued to haunt the continent.''
</P>
<P>
He recalled that although a number of African countries
witnessed an overall improvement in their economic growth, the
socio-economic performance of the continent, as a whole, "has
been poor in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
''The standard of living of our people continued to
deteriorate as a result of increasing poverty in our continent
and declining social and health conditions of the people in
general,'' Salim noted.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief called on African peoples to exert more
determined efforts to address the scourge of conflicts, saying
that ''the recent peace agreement in Sierra Leone gives us hope
that peace is not unachievable in some of our conflict-torn
countries when there is the determination and the political will
on the part of the parties in the conflict.''
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the faction leaders in Somalia will "seize the
opportunity in 1997 to stand above their clannish and personal
divisions and rivalries and rise to the challenge of peace and
national reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
he also hoped that ''the people of Burundi and especially
their leaders will rise to the challenge of bringing an end to
the fratricidal conflict and engage in serious negotiations aimed
at bringing new political dispensation which guarantees justice,
fairness and equality on the basis of democratic principles and
security for all.''
</P>
<P>
''We should also make 1997 the year of greater focus on
economic cooperation and integration,'' Salim said, adding, ''We
should endeavor more vigorously to put in place the African
economic community which is the African common house where unity
and solidarity could be further enhanced.''
</P>
<P>
Salim said, ''as we celebrate the end of 1996 and the dawn of
1997, we need to reflect on the basic objectives and principles
upon which our continental organization was founded.''
</P>
<P>
''One of the objectives we need to seriously address is the
need to promote African unity and understanding among our peoples
and governments,'' he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
''African states should not allow themselves to be divided at
the time when others are forging ahead in unity and strength,''
Salim stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today welcomed France's
withdrawal from the U.S.-led hammer force which maintain air
patrols over its northern Kurdish controlled area.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's official Al Thawa daily, organ of the Arab Baath
Socialist Party, said in an analysis that by refraining from
taking part in the Turkey-based operation in northern Iraq, France
is in fact consolidating its independence line.
</P>
<P>
It accused the United States of breaching international law by
launching "a systematic campaign in the service of its own
interests."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi dally was commenting on a decision announced by
French Foreign Ministry that it will not participate in the hammer
force to fly over the area in protection of rebel Kurds after
their failure against Iraqi government in the aftermath of the
1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
It said that France's pullout would deal a blow to the
"aggressive operation that has targeted Iraq's security and
sovereignty for five years."
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the French decision would give a boost in
the political relations between France and Arab countries without
U.S. interference or influences.
</P>
<P>
France was a major ally of the United States which drove Iraqi
forces out of Kuwait in February 1991 after its seven-month
occupation of its tiny neighbor. As a major pre-war trade partner
of Iraq, France has shown sympathy on suffering Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
It also refused to join the United States and Britain in flying
over the expanded no-fly zone in southern Iraq after U.S. missile
attacks against Iraqi air defense systems in early September this
year.

MAUPTO, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court today came
to the conclusion that defining Ide-Ul-Fitre and Ide-Ul-Adha as
national holidays in Mozambique will be unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
On may 4, the ruling Frelimo in the republic parliament
adopted a law despite the opposition from Renamo which defines
the two Islamic holidays as national holidays of the entire
country.
</P>
<P>
The law would become effective if President Joaquim Chissano
endorses it within 40 days. But the president postponed his
decision and preferred to wait until the Supreme Court rules on
the matter.
</P>
<P>
The court said it believes in equality and free religion.
Although the majority of Mozambicans believe in Islam, it is not
right to impose Islam onto others who believe in other religion,
said the court.
</P>
<P>
There are eight million Islam believers in Mozambique, two
million Catholics and 2.5 million Christians among a population
of 17 million in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Bahraini government
today freed two Qataris from three-year jail sentences, a senior
Bahraini official said.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed al Muttawa, Bahrain's State Minister for Cabinet
Affairs, said that Emir of Bahrain Sheikh Isa bin Suleiman al
Khalifa pardoned the two Qataris, Fahd Abdallah Al Bakker and
Salwa Jassim Mahmud Fakhri, from three-year jail sentences and a
fine of 1000 dinars (2650 U.S.dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
Muttawa said that the Emir made the decision because he highly
values the close relationship between the peoples of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The two men were arrested on December 2 and accused of
collecting information about "military sites, armaments and the
Hawar islands," the subject of a decades-old territorial dispute
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A Bahraini court Wednesday sentenced each of the two to three
years in prison and a fine of 1000 dinars. The two men later
appealed to the Emir for a pardon.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain boycotted a summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) held in Doha, capital of Qatar, earlier this month because
of the conflict with Qatar over the Hawar islands and the spying
case.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Urges US to Press on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa today called for an enhanced American role in the Mideast
region to guarantee just and permanent peace after Israel pulls
troops out of the West Bank city of Hebron under an imminent deal.
</P>
<P>
Asked for his assessment of the phase after the much-awaited
signing of the Hebron agreement, Moussa said it would open the
way for a "more important stage," which will lead to progress on
various peace tracks, either Syrian, Lebanese or Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
"The application of Hebron agreement would help rebuild
confidence which was lost due to events that took place in the
past six months," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli talks stalled in February after a wave of
suicide bombings in Israel. Syrians were outraged over the
Israeli hardline government's rejection of trading the occupied
Syrian Golan Heights for peace, as agreed by the former Labor
government.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli policy of expanding Jewish settlements on Arab
lands of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu also sparked loud Arab
outcry.
</P>
<P>
The top Egyptian diplomat expressed confidence that the U.S.,
the sponsor of the peace process initiated in 1991, would
pressure Israel to implement the signed agreements with the
Palestinians over the coming four years.
</P>
<P>
"I believe it will have many chances to stress the American
role, as a sponsor of the peace march, in guaranteeing execution
of Madrid conference principles which set bases of the whole
peace process on Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese tracks," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also urged follow-up steps to be taken
immediately to implement the 1995 Oslo accords signed by the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel.
</P>
<P>
"From now on we should not waste a single day as it is
important that a Palestinian state be established in 1999 at the
most," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the autonomy accords, the Palestinian-Israeli final
status talks would settle some vital issues such as a Palestinian
state, settlement, Jerusalem and refugees.
</P>
<P>
He said the American administration is invited to stress its
role in reaching a just, acceptable, equitable and permanent
peace, adding that this is the aspired American mission in the
next four years.
</P>
<P>
Asked what it expected of the European role to push forward
the peace process, Moussa asserted that the EU role is
important. "There is confidence in the area in this role due to
the strong links between countries in the region and European
states."
</P>
<P>
It is logical that Europe should contribute to the peace
process and not to limit its participation only to the economic
side, as the latter should be backed by a political role, Moussa
added.

TEHRAN, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran today unilaterally freed
724 Iraqi prisoners of war (POWS) as a gesture to improve its
relations with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the Iraqi
POWS, 700 Moslems and 24 Christians, were handed over to Iraqi
officials at the western border point of Khosrawi, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the representative of the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) were present at the
handing over ceremony.
</P>
<P>
It said that Iran released 9,974 Iraqi POWS unilaterally on
humanitarian ground in the past year.
</P>
<P>
The POW is the main issue which blocks the normalization
of bilateral relations between Iran and Iraq. The two neighbors
fought a blood war from 1980 to 1988.

<P>
Both sides accused the other of still holding large number of

<HEADLINE> Afforestation Will Aid the Poor, Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- More efforts are to be made in
China's forestry sector to aid the poor next year, Xu Youfang, the
country's Forestry Minister, promised during a just closed annual
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Afforestation will find more of a role to play in the
relatively poor middle and west regions, especially in the
mountain areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It will also be an important measure in helping the nation's
forestry sector to develop faster if we combine afforestation with
poverty relief," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mountain areas account for 69 percent of the country's total
land area and 56 percent of the nation's total population, with
many on the state's poverty list.
</P>
<P>
"90 percent of China's forests are in mountain areas and this
huge amount of wealth should be well protected and used to benefit
the local poor," the Minister said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry's plan, by the year 2000 as many as
15 million people will be absorbed into the forestry sector, and
the growth rate of the sector in mountain areas will reach 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the Minister, the role of forestry in aiding the
poor in mountain areas has attracted much attention from the State
Council, which at the beginning of 1996 decided to launch a
comprehensive trial project in 24 selected mountainous counties.
</P>
<P>
"The project is being directed by the Ministry of Forestry and
has now got to a successful start," the Minister said.

loans by September, 1997, said the sources, adding that an amount
of 391 dollars was expected to be released in three equal
tranches, hopefully in April, June and August next year.
</P>
<P>
The original amount of 600 million dollars, under the stand-by
arrangement (SBA) agreed upon by the government of Pakistan and
the IMF last year, was increased to 831 million dollars, following
negotiations between a Pakistani delegation and IMF
representatives in Washington earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The third tranche of 80 million dollars was disbursed last
week, signaling that there was no bottleneck in the disbursement
of funds under SBA, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF stopped the SBA loans early this year, alleging that
the Pakistani government doctored economic figures in order to get
the loans.

<HEADLINE> 1996: Stagnation, Confrontation Prevail in Israeli-Palestinian Peace Process (By Zhi Linfei) (Part I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Despite of the
unprecedented optimism emerging at the beginning of 1996, this
year has witnessed the worst Israeli-Palestinian crisis since the
two sides inked the Oslo accord in 1993.
</P>
<P>
A wave of suicide bombings by Islamic militants dramatically
changed the political map of the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process, which was marked with stagnation and confrontation for
most of 1996.
</P>
<P>
But when the year began, it was a different story. After
enduring the test of the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, the peace process gained huge momentum for a
final settlement of disputes.
</P>
<P>
The smooth holding of the first Palestinian election in January
was a giant step toward that direction. Moreover, Israel's new
leader Shimon Peres was determined to quicken the pace of
peace-making so as to realize his long-cherished dream of a
conflict-free and prosperous new Middle East.
</P>
<P>
When Peres decided late February to advance the elections
from late October to May 29, he apparently intended to take
advantage of the greater support his Labor party gained
from Rabin's assassination. Developments later proved the timing
of his decision could not be worse.
</P>
<P>
From February 25 to March 4, anti-peace Islamic militant
groups Hamas and the Jihad launched four suicide bombings in
Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Ashkelon, killing 58 people and wounding
hundreds of others.
</P>
<P>
The horrible scenes of the bombing attacks sparked nationwide
anti-government sentiment, erasing Peres' comfortable edge over
his right-wing challenger and Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu,
whose popularity plummeted because of the blame on him for Rabin's
murder.
</P>
<P>
Being an eloquent speech maker and shrewd politician,
Netanyahu marketed successfully to the security-conscious Jewish
state his vision for the future: peace with security.
</P>
<P>
Although Peres was defeated by Netanyahu in the May 29
elections by the thinnest possible margin of less than one
percent, that was more than enough to turn back the clock of the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Defying warnings by the Palestinian Authority (PA) and other
Arab countries, Netanyahu formed a right-wing coalition in June
and introduced a set of hardline policies that flatly rejected the
commonly accepted "land for peace" formula.
</P>
<P>
With stalled peace talks, continued closure of Palestinian
territories, settlement expansion and crackdown on Palestinian
activities in east Jerusalem, the Likud government wasted
little time in wearing out the patience of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Barely after the Netanyahu government passed the 100-day mark
in power, a large scale bloodshed was triggered off on September
25 by Israel's opening of an exit to the underground tunnel in
east Jerusalem. The three-day clashes between Israeli troops
and Palestinian protesters and armed policemen across the
territories killed more than 70 people and wounded nearly 1,000
others, creating the worst Israeli-Palestinian crisis since 1993.

<HEADLINE> 1996: Stagnation, Confrontation Prevail in Israeli-Palestinian Peace Process (By Zhi Linfei) (Part II) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 28 (Xinhua) -- As the only result of the
Washington summit between Netanyahu and PA President Yasser
Arafat, which was brokered by U.S. President Bill Clinton,
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators resumed talks in early
October on carrying out the signed agreement on Israeli troop
redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of trust, the two sides were locked in war of
words for most of the time over the lack of progress.
</P>
<P>
While Israel insisted on its right to conduct hot pursuits of
terrorists in whole Hebron after redeployment, the Palestinian
side demanded Israel's accurate implementation of the agreement
already signed.
</P>
<P>
The hope for a pre-Christmas deal was dashed again on
December 11 when three Palestinian gunmen killed a Jewish
settler mother and her son near Ramallah. In rare strong
reaction, Israel announced economic incentives to encourage
settlement expansion, a move denounced by the PA as "declaration
of war."
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Clinton's efforts to finalize a Hebron deal,
U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross returned to the region late
December in a renewed effort to bridge the gap between the two
sides. Under Ross' auspices, Netanyahu and Arafat met on the eve
of Christmas to pave the way for a final agreement.
</P>
<P>
Though few people now doubts that the Hebron deal could be
signed, but there is little to celebrate because this agreement
is only a long-delayed beginning rather than an end. And the fact
that it is so difficult to conclude talks on an already signed
agreement augurs ill for the impending permanent status talks.
</P>
<P>
The final-status talks will tackle far more complicated and
sensitive issues than the Hebron pullback, including the fate of
Palestinian self-rule areas, Jerusalem and Palestinian
refugees. Stalemate and confrontation will hardly be headed off.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the territories remains explosive with too
many time bombs planted. Continued stalemate in the peace talks,
Israel's settlement expansion and militant attacks by radicals
from both sides all could trigger another round of violent
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
However, two major factors should not be discounted: formation
of a national unity government in Israel and the U.S.' more active
involvement in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the hope for forming a unity government seems to
be slim because Netanyahu refuses to share his power with
Labor's Peres, his arch political rival. And this hope is also
fading quickly with the passage of time as Peres will leave the
political stage by the end of 1997 under an inner party deal
with his most hopeful successor Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
But if faced with political turmoils such as Hebron pullback,
Palestinian unrest or war with Syria, the Likud coalition might
collapse over the difference of opinions. In this case, Netanyahu
will possibly be forced to form a broad-based unity government
with the Labor to save himself from the crisis. Under such a
bipartisan government, the peace process would hopefully proceed
more smoothly than now.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the future of peace process, to a large extent,
depends on the role the U.S. will play. Many predict that
U.S. President Clinton, after recent re-election, will increase
pressure on both Israel and the PA to continue the peace process
which the U.S. has so vital interest in keeping it going.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps all eyes will focus in January on the new
U.S. Secretary of State Madelaine Albright, the tough-talking U.N.
Ambassador who will succeed the usually conservative and prudent
Warren Christopher. Many analysts have said that it is doubtful
if Albright, a new hand on the Middle East affairs, would play a
more aggressive role than her predecessor.
</P>
<P>
All in all, the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has undergone
a period of stagnation and confrontation, and the trend might
change when the Likud government genuinely revises its hardline
policies to bring the peace process back on track.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Hails Egypt's Role in Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's Advisor Ahmed al-Tayeb today praised Egypt for
its "foremost" role in breaking the impasse on the negotiations
with Israelis over the Israeli troops pullback from Hebron.
</P>
<P>
"There are several factors which led to the current change in
the Israeli stance, foremost among which is the attitude adopted
by Egypt," said the Palestinian official in an interview with
the Cairo-based "Sawt al Arab" radio broadcast this morning.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing efforts by Egypt has made Israel go back to the
original texts of 1995 Oslo agreement, thus helping achieve the
present progress on the Palestinian-Israeli track, he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with Israel in
1979, has been a pillar in the Mideast peace process and a strong
advocate of the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
Al-Tayeb stressed the need to continue the Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations till they "reach a formula for a protocol on working
out mechanism for implementing Hebron agreement."
</P>
<P>
He said that Arafat is expected to meet with Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai in Gaza Sunday in an effort to wrap
up an agreement on the Israeli troop redeployment from 80 percent
of the last West Bank town still under Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
If those topics are settled, a second summit meeting between
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu will be
arranged to sign the deal on New Year's Eve, he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the autonomy accords, the Israeli redeployment should
have completed last March. Netanyahu has insisted on better
security for the 450 Jews living in the heart of 100,000 Arabs in
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
A deal on Hebron would be the first major progress in the peace
process since the new Israeli government took office in June and
open the door for peace talks with Lebanon and Syria.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Airport Officially Opens to Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Three Gorges Airport,
which will serve the world's largest dam project with regular air
flights, officially opened today.
</P>
<P>
The first passenger aircraft successfully journeyed each way
between the Yichang-based Three Gorges Airport and Beijing's
Capital International Airport this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"The Three Gorges Airport will give a strong push to the
construction of the Three Gorges Project and the development of
local economy," Lu Youmei, president of China Yangtze Three Gorges
Project Development Corporation, said in Beijing before boarding
the return flight to Yichang.
</P>
<P>
Earlier an inaugural ceremony was held at the airport before
the South China Airlines flight took off for Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The airport, with a 2,600-meter-long and 45-meter-wide runway,
and a terminal building of 15,000 square meters, is capable of
handling 1.4 million passengers annually.
</P>
<P>
It can accommodate jumbo jets, such as Boeing-737s and
Boeing-767s, as well as TU-154s, MD-82s and other large and medium
sized aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The airport is 26 kilometers from the center of the Yichang
City and 55 km from the dam site in central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
The airport is linked with an expressway and close to a major
railway line.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the airport started in 1994 and ended in
October, with an investment of 685 million yuan (82.5 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The airport has already lined up flights to 11 major cities in
China.
</P>
<P>
Next year it will gradually open up flights to Huizhou,
Zhengzhou, Zhangjiagang, Changsha and Haikou, providing 46 flights
a week.
</P>
<P>
An expansion plan has also been made to extend the airport's
runway to 3,200 meters in the future, increasing its annual
handling capacity to five million passengers.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Ruling Party Calls for End to Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Lee Hong-koo, chairman of South
Korea's ruling New Korea Party (NKP), called on unionists here
today to halt their strikes, saying that their action "will bring
no benefit."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Lee said the on-going general
strike is causing public insecurity and inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
Defending the NKP's unilateral passage of the labor law reform
bill, Lee said that the national economy is at a crisis.
</P>
<P>
On December 26, the ruling party railroaded two controversial
bills on labor affairs and on the Agency for National Security
Planning (NSP) through the National Assembly in the absence of
opposition legislators.
</P>
<P>
The new labor law permits employers to lay off workers to
protect their firms from bankruptcy and to use workers at any time
within the boundary of 56 hours per week on a monthly basis. It
also puts off until the year 2000 multiple unions at the national
and industrial levels, which implies that the Korea Confederation
of Trade Unions (KCTU) will not be authorized until then.
</P>
<P>
The unilateral passage of the two bills by the NKP prompted
uproar from the opposition and labor unions. Opposition lawmakers
went into a sit-in protest in parliament, while labor union
leaders called a national strike.
</P>
<P>
So far, some 1.4 million workers or one tenth of South Korea's
work force from carmaker employees to subway locomotive engineers
have walked out or declared to stage partial or general strikes in
protest of the ruling party's unilateral enactment of
labor-related law revisions.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that his party will try to reopen dialogue with the
opposition to normalize the political situation.

<HEADLINE> China Wins 1,000 World Championships Since Return to IOC (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese athletes have landed
exactly 1,000 world championship titles since China returned to
the international sporting arena.
</P>
<P>
China's position was restored to the International Olympic
Committee in 1979, a senior Chinese official recalled today.
</P>
<P>
"China started a comprehensive return to the world sports arena
after the IOC announced the restoration of China's position in the
world sports body," said Wu Shaozu, minister in charge of the
State Sports Commission.
</P>
<P>
He was reporting on the country's sports achievements to
legislators at the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC) now in its 23rd session in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
With strong support from the Party and governments at all
levels, as well as with the efforts of sports people in the
country, the level of China's athletic standards has raised
dramatically in the past 17 years, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the number of world-level gold medals
China has won in the past 17 years accounted for 97.1 percent of
the 1,030 since the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chinese sports men and women have set or broken
681 world records since 1979, four times more than in the previous
30 years, according to the figures.
</P>
<P>
"Athletic sports are an important sign of a country's sports
level, overall state power and national spirit," Wu stressed.
</P>
<P>
Despite the rapid progress China has made in this aspect, it is
still obvious that the country's actual strength in the field of
athletics is not strong enough.
</P>
<P>
There are few events in which China displays a dominant
superiority, added Wu, expressing concern that the country will
face an extremely difficult situation in the upcoming Olympic
Games in 2000 in Australia.
</P>
<P>
China landed 16 gold medals in the Atlanta Olympics, and
numbered fourth in the winners' list. To earn better results in
the next Olympics, China is now restructuring its training
programs and management mechanism, according to the sports
minister.

<P>
Seven of the students also received bicycles as they have to
walk at least two or three hours to school everyday, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The move aims to help students who are capable and hardworking,
but have difficulty in getting support for their schooling, said
officials at the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese
Communist Youth League, which is a co-sponsor of the hot-line.

for regional security, with specific goals set concerning public
security.
</P>
<P>
He added that the system, together with strengthened management
of public security at grass-roots level, and the national
anti-crime campaign, have promoted the smooth progress of the
country's reform and modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Li suggested that governments at all levels pay close attention
to the implementation of the resolution in the year 1997, and
departments concerned should spare no effort in making their

<HEADLINE> Rebels Raid Village in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Some 30 heavily armed men of
the Abu Sayyaf extremist group today attacked a village in Basilan
province, Southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf, a major rebel group in the country, launched
the attack to avenge their colleagues who died a day ago in a
clash with government troops and police forces. They left after
wounding a woman and a six-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
The rebels swooped at the village hall and fired at the people
who were having a gathering there. Government troops and policemen
rushed to the area 30 minutes later and found the two victims.
</P>
<P>
Government forces clashed with about 200 Abu Sayyaf guerrillas
late Friday afternoon in Tantawan town not far away from the
village after the rebels released a hostage they held.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the rebel side suffered heavy casualties
and most of them had fled to the northwestern part of the island
province.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf has been challenging the Philippine government
by declaring that it rejects the peace deal between the government
and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), the largest
insurgency group in the country.
</P>
<P>
It said it will assassinate those government officials who
inked the peace agreement with the MNLF and MNLF chairman Nur
Misuari, who had become the governor of the Autonomous Region of
Mindanao Muslims.

LONDON, December 28 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major will announce plans in the new year to offer every adult in
the country free information technology training.
</P>
<P>
Under the computer training initiative, every person above
school-leaving age will be offered a voucher which they can
exchange for free training in information technology.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet Office and the Department of Trade and Industry are
co-ordinating government action in conjunction with computer
giants such as Microsoft, British Telecom and Dixons.
</P>
<P>
Training will be offered through outlets of these companies or
further education centers. The scheme will have a minimal cost to
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
Major believes that the proposals will outflank the Labor
Party, which has developed links with British Telecom to provide a
computer in every school.
</P>
<P>
"We don't think the children are so important. They are already
computer literate. We are targeting every adult," a Downing Street

<HEADLINE> Iraq Satisfied with French Withdrawal from N. Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today expressed
satisfaction with France's decision not to take part in the Hammer
Force headed by the United States in air surveillance over
northern Iraq in protection of rebel Kurds after the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued today, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry said
the French decision is a positive and important step which
expresses France's awareness of the illegitimacy of the decision
to impose a no-fly zone in northern Iraq by the Americans and
British.
</P>
<P>
France announced Friday that it will not take part in a new
program sponsored by the United States and Britain because
humanitarian aid is not longer part of the plan.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi statement said that the French decision is in harmony
with the repeated French assertions that the decision to impose
no-fly zones in both north and south of Iraq has nothing to do
with the U.N. or Security Council resolutions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The statement, quoted by the Iraqi News Agency, said that while
Iraq expressed appreciation for the French decision, it hopes that
France would view the no-fly zone in the south of the country from
the same perspective since this zone has been imposed in a unilateral
illegitimate decision.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the Gulf War, the United States, Britain and
France set up a no-fly zone in the north to protect the Kurdish
minority.
</P>
<P>
In early September this year, France refused to participate in
the operation flying over the expanded no-fly zone imposed by the
United States in the south of Iraq after the U.S. launched two waves of
missile attacks against the Iraqi air defense systems in the area
following Iraq's military intervention in Kurdish controlled
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of the Hammer Force, a multinational force in
northern Iraq, expires at the end of this year and the U.S. and
Britain will set up a new force to continue their operation in
northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Gets Its Share of Nile Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Egypt gets its complete share of
Nile water amounting to 55 billion cubic meters annually due to
its agreements with the Nile basin states, political advisor of
the Egyptian President Osama el-Baz has said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar entitled "Egypt and present and future
issues," held Friday night, Baz said the building of dams on the
Nile carried out by Ethiopia does not stir any concern to Egypt,
adding that Ethiopia, "a friendly country", is making use of its
share.
</P>
<P>
He noted that stability and development in Ethiopia boost
the Egyptian national security.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is ready to offer its experience in projects of
developing water resources and all fields of spheres of
development to Ethiopia, the Nile basin countries, or other
African states, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency quoted the
Egyptian official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 6,700-kilometer Nile rises in Uganda and Ethiopia and runs
through Sudan and Egypt until it reaches the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Under the quota agreement signed by the Nile basin countries,
Egypt is entitled to 55.5 billion cubic meters of Nile water,
which accounts for 90 percent of its total sweet water sources.
</P>
<P>
About 99 percent of the Egyptian population now live on the
fertile but narrow Delta of Nile, the lifeline of the drenched
country.
</P>
<P>
Baz also underlined the deep Egyptian-Sudanese
ties. "It is difficult to differentiate between Egyptian and
Sudanese interests, " he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Egyptian official accused Sudan of "working to
shake national security of Egypt and harboring terrorism
elements convicted in certain cases."
</P>
<P>
Despite its objections to the Sudanese policy, Baz emphasized
that Egypt does not accept imposing sanctions on Sudan so as not
to increase the suffering of the Sudanese people.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has accused Sudan of having orchestrated the 1995 aborted
attempt on the life of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Addis
Ababa and granting asylum to Egyptian extremists. Tensions
escalated as Sudan's demand to have larger Nile water quota
sparked loud outcry from Egypt.

FREETOWN, December 28 (Xinhua) -- A seven-member United
Nations technical assessment mission is leaving here to tour the
east, south and north part of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier-General Yokoshi Saksena, head of the team, said in
an interview that they are ''evaluating the need for a un
monitoring force in the implementation of peace accord between
the Sierra Leone government and the Revolutionary United Front."
</P>
<P>
In audience with President Tejan Kabbah on Friday, the UN

Kenema, and Makeni before his team proceeds to Abidjan ''for
direct talks'' with the RUF leader Corporal Foday Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
The team will be in Abidjan on Wednesday, diplomatic sources
said.
</P>
<P>
''The delegation would have to decide after talks with
government officials whether the UN should proceed with a
monitoring force or simply an observation team,'' one source
added.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will report back to the new United Nations
secretary general early in the new year, who will then forward
the findings to the Security Council, observers here said.

<HEADLINE> HK's Chinese Press Report Dismal First-Half Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Several leading publishers
of Chinese newspapers here yesterday reported a marked drop in
first-half net profits, reinforcing the highly competitive nature
of the local Chinese media sector, the South China Morning Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Oriental Press Group, publisher of Oriental Daily News, and
Sing Tao Holdings, which owns Sing Tao Daily, saw net profits dive
nearly 80 percent in the six months to September to some 30
million HK dollars and five million HK dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Culturecom, which publishes Tin Tin Daily News, even suffered a
loss of 19 million HK dollars against a net profit of seven
million HK dollars previously.
</P>
<P>
Things were no better for the publisher of Ming Pao Daily News,
Ming Pao Enterprise Corp., which also slumped into the red from a
huge net profit.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the disappointing results to the lingering
effects of the price war that ravaged the industry until the
middle of the year, said the English-language newspaper published
here.
</P>
<P>
The first shots in the war were fired in June last year when
The Next Media Group's Apple Daily hit the market at a price of two
HK dollars a copy.
</P>
<P>
The results forced analysts to revise full-year profit
estimates down, but some are expecting a recovery in the second
half and beyond.
</P>
<P>
"Since the price war ceased in July when Oriental Daily, Apple
Daily and some other Chinese papers returned their cover price to
the normal five HK dollars, a rebound should be realized in the
second half and next year -- given no more price wars," Michelle
Ho Ka-ki of Seapower Securities said.
</P>
<P>
Paper price falls and the revived property sector will also
help improve the industry, she added.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Four tombs dating from the 2nd
century B.C. have been discovered in the yard of the Greek
parliamentary building near Syntagma in downtown Athens.
</P>
<P>
The finding was made during construction work for an
underground parking lot, the local press reported today citing
sources at the Greek Archeological Service.
</P>
<P>
Experts said two tombs, located near the Tomb of the Unknown
Soldier in front of parliament, offer a valuable insight into the
organization and structure of the ancient Athenian city state.
</P>
<P>
Besides skeletons, the tombs contained funeral gifts. The items
have been transferred to the Archeology Department for
preservation and will eventually be exhibited at various museums.
</P>
<P>
The other two tombs and a human skull were located near
parliament's entrance gate facing Vassilisis Sofias Avenue.
Archeologists will "dig" up both within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
According to archeologists, all four tombs are from the
Hellenistic period spanning from the death of Alexander the Great
in 323 B.C. to the sack of Corinth by the Romans in 146 B.C.

<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping force
known as ECOMOG and its Commander Major-General Victor
Malu have been praised for the high standard of professionalism
demonstrated in the operations in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper "The Guardian" reported today the commendation
came from the new Chief Military Observer (CMO) of the United Nations
Obeserver Million in Liberia (UNOMIL), Major-General Sikander Shami
during his recent courtesy call to the ECOMOG headquarters in
Monrovia, capital of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Shami, a Pakistani, particularly praised Malu for his determination
to ensure the success of the Liberian peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The UN headquarters is full of nothing but praises for the
professional manner the force commander has been handling the
situation here in Liberia," Shami said, quoted by the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The UNOMIL chief said the UN technical team that visited Liberia in
October was particularly full of praises for ECOMOG, and Malu in
particular, in their report on the visit.
</P>
<P>
Shami assured that the UNOMIL would continue to work in close
liaison with ECOMOG and complement the work of the peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,000 out of the estimated 60,000 combatants in
Liberia have laid down their arms since the disarmament process
began on November 22 this year.
</P>
<P>
But ECOMOG officers said the faction leaders of the Liberian crisis
need to show more commitment to the success of the disarmament
exercise.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they assured that additional troops are expected
to arrive soon to beef up the strength of ECOMOG, thus promoting
the process of the exercise, which is scheduled for completion at
the end of January next year.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Newspapers Rap Revision of Japan's History Textbooks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Two official newspapers here
charged that Japanese right-wing politicians' attempt to scrap the
description of "comfort women" in history textbooks is part of a
conspiracy to revive militarism.
</P>
<P>
Rodong Sinmun and Minju Choson, of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK), said in their commentaries that the
recent attempt, by Japanese local politicians, also indicates the
risk of the country's political swing toward the right.
</P>
<P>
The comments were referring to a petition adopted on December
19 by the local legislature of Japan's Okayama Prefecture, which
called on the Education Ministry to delete the accounts of women
forced into sex slavery for wartime Japanese soldiers in next
year's textbooks for junior high schools.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Okayama prefectural assembly controlled by members
of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, similar petitions have
been reportedly submitted to several other local legislatures. And
some right-wing state politicians have been supportive.
</P>
<P>
However, historians say as many as 200,000 women, mostly
Koreans, were recruited and forced to become "comfort women" -- a
euphemism for sex slaves -- for the Japanese Imperial Army as it
swept through east and southeast Asia in the 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
The Rodong Sinmun commentary further pressed the charge that
most of the "comfort women" were ruthlessly killed in unparalleled
atrocities that brutally violated the principles of international
laws and trampled on the sense of justice and morality adhered to
by the international community.
</P>
<P>
The prime culprit of the crimes, the newspaper noted, was Japan
as a state.
</P>
<P>
The proposals to drop the "comfort women" description in
textbooks reflected the Japanese government's intent to conceal
historic facts and cheat the coming new generations of the
Japanese people into becoming "task forces" for the right-wing
politicians' ambition for relaunching aggression wars, it said.
</P>
<P>
In its commentary, Minju Choson pointed out that the "comfort
women" issue was a result of Japan's wartime state policy.
Therefore, how to describe it in history textbooks has become "a
touchstone" to check whether the Japanese government has the
intention to revive militarism.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper urged the Japanese government to extend state
compensation for the "comfort women" still alive, so as to show
its resolution of breaking off with its evil past.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Council Urges Regional Cooperation in Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of seven
South Asian countries adopted here today a declaration on the
promotion of regional cooperation in tourism.
</P>
<P>
The declaration, released at the end of a South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Tourism Council
meeting, called for a close collaborative relationship between the
tourism industry and government for promoting intra-regional and
international tourism in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC, grouping Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives,
Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, established its Tourism Council, a
private sector-based organization under the SAARC umbrella,
earlier this year to act as a regional governing body of tourism
business.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC Tourism Declaration called on South Asian tourism
operators and governments to treat the region as one single market
and promote it as a potential tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
It also urged South Asian governments to ensure easy travel for
SAARC citizens within the region by liberalizing the existing
restrictions, such as those on visa, currency exchange and air and
surface transport.
</P>
<P>
The two-day SAARC Tourism Council meeting, the latest of a
series of meetings after its establishment last June, was attended
by more than 70 representatives including government officials and
business leaders from all the seven SAARC member countries.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Shiite Leader Denies Plans for Islamic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's top Shiite cleric
has denied that Moslems have plans to set up an Islamic state in
Lebanon or dominate its political system, Beirut's Daily Star
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Mohammed Mehdi Shamseddin, head of the High Shiite
Council, made the remarks in an effort to eliminate signs of
mounting concern among the country's Christian community, the
Lebanese only English daily said.
</P>
<P>
"The overwhelming majority of Lebanese Moslems have no plans
to establish an Islamic state, Islamicize Lebanon or have
dominance over their Christian compatriots," Shamesddin was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanese Moslems do not consider themselves an independent
society. They see themselves part of the Lebanese society and
think that they would be politically and nationally deficient
without living in common with their Christian compatriots," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The cleric's assertions came on the heels of anxious
statements by Christians notables.
</P>
<P>
"The Moslems do not want to take anything allocated to
Christians by the Taif Agreement. They do not even want their
own share for themselves. They want to share public life with
their Christian compatriots," Shamesddin added.
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Taif Agreement, the national reconciliation accord
named after the Saudi Arabian city of Taif where it was mapped
out, has become part of Lebanon's constitution.
</P>
<P>
Some Lebanese Christians complained that the Taif Agreement
gave additional power to Moslems at the cost of a political
hegemony which the Christians had maintained for decades before
the civil war.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing called a Lebanese Moslem society and a
Lebanese Christian society," Shamesddin emphasized, "there is a
Lebanese society and a Lebanese people whose common sentiment is
national, not religious."

DHAKA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of Muslims
gathered today for the three-day biswa ijtema, the second largest
congregation of Bangladeshi Muslims after hajj, on the eastern
side of River Gurag near here.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 3 million Muslims from Bangladesh and other
countries poured into Tongi, a small industrial town in Gazipur
District, to listen to the lectures of Islamic scholars.

fasting of Holy Ramadan begins in the second week of January.
</P>
<P>
Religious scholars and experts from 70 countries are expected
to discuss Islam and problems of the Muslim world in the context
of the changing world.
</P>

<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban Militia
Friday captured the strategic town of Qarabagh and the Bagram
airbase north of Kabul, the local press said here today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that about 50 ousted government troops loyal to
Ahmad Shah Masood were killed and some 230 others captured by the
Taliban during the day-long fierce fighting.
</P>
<P>
The battle also left nine Taliban fighters dead and about 20
injured. Meanwhile, a Taliban helicopter was shot down by the
rival forces.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban launched the major offensive early Friday morning
backed by heavy artillery and fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
Qarabagh, some 40 kilometers north of Kabul, fell to the
Taliban on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban continued their advance and seized the Bagram
airbase, about 50 kilometers north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Bagram was captured by Masood forces on October 18 in a
counter-offensive weeks after it was overrun by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Since the Taliban ousted Masood's men and entered Kabul on
September 27, the region around Qarabagh and Bagram has remained a
theater of fighting between the two groups.
</P>
<P>
"If the Taliban continued to succeed, we will push forward," a
Taliban field commander said, adding, "If not, we will hold the
line and wait until spring."

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Negotiators Ready for Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Israelis and
Palestinians seem ready to make a year-end dash in their
marathon talks on the partial Israeli troop withdrawal from the
West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu held unprecedented
talks with top Palestinian security officials Friday afternoon on
the security-related issues in the long-delayed army
redeployment in Hebron while Israeli-Palestinian Joint Steering
Committee met in another hotel of the city.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu phoned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Friday night
to compare notes about the progress of the intensive
negotiations. He also decided to send his Defense Minister
Yitzha Mordechai to Gaza Sunday for further talks with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said at a weekly cabinet session that there would
be a buffer zone separating the Jewish settlement enclaves from
the surrounding Arab neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
According to the premier, the sticking point now lies in the
question of reopening the Shuhada Street. But he said that the
agreement will be initialed in a few days.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said at a
Palestinian Authority meeting Friday that Arafat had issued
instructions on finishing the Hebron agreement before the end of
1996.
</P>
<P>
However, Erekat said that he held talks with Dore Gold,
Netanyahu's political adviser during the steering committee
meeting, but the two sides still remain stuck over the demand
that Israel commit itself to a detailed timetable for further
withdrawal from the West Bank in accordance with the Oslo 2
accord.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said he hopes the difference would be ironed out in
the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Jibril Rajoub, head of the Palestinian Preventive Security
Service in the West Bank, said after meeting with Nwetanyahu
that the two sides are very close to completing an agreement as
subjects of contention are very limited.
</P>
<P>
Abu Mazen, PLO Secretary General and Arafat's deputy, traveled
to Cairo Friday night to brief Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa on the latest development of the Israeli-Palestinian
talks. He said at the Cairo airport that his visit would last 48
hours.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Sha'ath, Palestinian Minister of Planning and
International Cooperation, will be also expected in Cairo for
meeting with the Egyptian foreign minister.

<P>
AMMAN, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian companies have
signed some new contracts worth about 112 million U.S. dollars
for exports of food and soap to sanctions-hit Iraq, Jordan
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of Amman Chamber of Industry Khaldun Abu Hassan was
quoted by the paper as saying that the contracts were concluded
after the implementation of the oil-for-food deal between Iraq
and the United Nations, under which Iraq is allowed to sell 2
billion dollars worth of crude oil every six months to buy food
and medicines.
</P>
<P>
He said another contract for the sale of medicines will be
concluded in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Finance Minister Marwan Awad and Energy Minister
Hisham Dabbas are scheduled to go to Baghdad Sunday to discuss
the renewal of the trade protocol between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the year, Jordan cut its exports to Iraq
from 400 million dollars to 220 million dollars due to increased
Iraqi debts to Amman. But in November, Jordan agreed
to increase exports to Iraq, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The step was aimed at guaranteeing a share in the trade benefits
expected from implementing the oil-for-food deal.

<HEADLINE> Nepali PM to Seek Vote of Confidence in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba is determined to seek a vote of confidence for his
coalition government in the winter session of the House of
representatives, a local newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
The session will be convened soon after by-elections for five
vacant seats in the 205-seat lower house to be held on January 24,
the Kathmandu Post reported.
</P>
<P>
After his three-party government survived an opposition-tabled
no-trust motion in the house earlier this week, Deuba has been
under mounting pressure from the opposition and the ruling camp,
which demand that either he resign or mid-term elections be held.
</P>
<P>
The government lost majority support in the lower house Tuesday
though the no-trust motion was rejected with 101 MPs voting for
and 84 MPs against it. The motion required a majority of 103 votes
to pass in the house.
</P>
<P>
However, Deuba had earlier ruled out the possibility of his
resignation or fresh elections.
</P>
<P>
Deuba's Nepali Congress (NC) party, the main partner of the
three-party ruling coalition, is aiming to win at least four seats
in the January lower house by-elections, the paper quoted party
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The NC party currently has 86 seats in the house while the main
opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist,
CPN-UML) has 88.
</P>
<P>
If the NC becomes the single largest party in the house, it
could form a minority government by itself under the country's
constitution.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: 1996, Year of Harvest for PM Hariri </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri could have a complacent year-end with bumper harvests in
both political and economic fields in the passing year.
</P>
<P>
"Friends of Lebanon conference," a forum of donor countries
held in Washington on December 16, gave a generous new year gift
to Hariri, who masterminds this country's ambitious
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
After flying back from the United States, the billionaire
prime minister felt comfort partly due to the outcomes of the
Washington conference and partly since the grievances on
deteriorating living conditions of the people were muted.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the Friends of Lebanon conference promised to
provide to Lebanon 3.2 billion U.S. dollars in loans and grants,
including 1 billion dollars "available immediately" and 2.2
billion dollars in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Hariri proudly announced: "Lebanon is a big construction
site. The Lebanese pound has stabilized and is growing stronger
on a continuous basis. Inflation has declined from 120 percent to
less than 10 percent. Economic growth has averaged about 7
percent, while employment has increased by around 10 percent."
</P>
<P>
The Friends of Lebanon conference was the second chance in one
year for Hariri, 52, to show his international popularity to his
own people.
</P>
<P>
When Israel launched a large-scale blitz in south Lebanon in
April, Hariri toured Arab and Western countries to draw sympathy
for the country's adversity.
</P>
<P>
The 17-day Israeli blitz led to the killing of some 200
Lebanese and caused losses of 500 to 700 million dollars, and was
ended only after a cease-fire understanding was reached between
Israel and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, on April 26.
</P>
<P>
Domestically, Hariri emerged from the August-September
parliamentary election as the most remarkable victor, obtaining a
dual capacity as deputy in the House and head of the government
and becoming leader of one of the largest parliamentary blocs.
</P>
<P>
On November 7, a new Lebanese government, the third headed by
the Sunni prime minister since he first came to power in October
1992, was formed.
</P>
<P>
However, the previous two governments had been repeatedly
accused of paying little attention to the improvement of living
conditions as priorities had been given to the country's
reconstruction of war-devastated infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
In protest against Hariri's economic policies, labor unions
planned to stage a one-day strike and nation-wide demonstrations
on November 28, one day after the new government won an
overwhelming vote of confidence from the parliament.
</P>
<P>
But the protest actions were preempted by the government by
sending army and police forces to the street.
</P>
<P>
In the policy statement of his new government, Hariri for the
first time in four years shifted the priorities to solving social
and economic problems and administrative reforms.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government would continue the process of
reconstruction and rehabilitation, and would work hard to improve
living conditions of the people and create more employment
opportunities.

<HEADLINE> Army Helicopter Shot Down by Bandits in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- An army helicopter was shot
down by armed cattle rustlers with rocket fire on Thursday,
killing the Samburu District commissioner and two army officers,
the Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The District Commissioner, James Nyandoro, and two army
officers were following the trail of more than 600 cattle
rustlers who on the Christmas Day stole over 15,000 head of
cattle in Saburu District of northern Kenya and killed a German
tourist and injured three policemen.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that as the helicopter flew low so that the
officers could have a clear view of the valley, a den of cattle
rustlers, the rocket fire struck it from below.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted police sources as saying that following the
incident, two companies of the Kenyan army and police contingents
were sent to the district.
</P>
<P>
At least six helicopters were reportedly heading for the scene
yesterday morning, carrying reinforcement policemen from various
police stations in Rift Valley Province for the joint operation.
</P>
<P>
Nyandoro is the second high-ranking civil servant killed this
year on a security mission after former Eastern Provincial
Commissioner Ishmael Chelang'a died in a helicopter crash on July
27 in Marsabit Town when he led security personnel to Moyale and
Marsabit districts.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientist Call for End of Research into Smuggled Fossils </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Scientists across the world
have been urged by a top Chinese ornithologist not to carry out
research on smuggled fossils of a rare ancient bird.
</P>
<P>
Hou Lianhai said more than 100 pieces of Confuciusornis
fossils unearthed in China, which are of great scientific value in
the research of the origin of the bird, have been smuggled
overseas.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, over 200 pieces of the fossils have been excavated
in Sihetun, in Northeast China's Liaoning Province, said Hou, a
research fellow with the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and
Paleoanthropology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
During the 4th International Meeting of the Society of Avian
Paleontology and Evolution, held this June in Washington,
scientists worldwide showed concern about China's loss of
Confuciusornis fossils. At the same time they promised not to do
research work on the smuggled fossils of the ancient bird in
accordance with international practice, Hou said.
</P>
<P>
According to international practice, during the study of the
fossil of a vertebrate animal researchers should make clear of the
excavation spot of the fossil, the geological stratum in which the
fossil was buried, and the name of the person who found the fossil
to acquire a complete set of research material. Otherwise, the
conclusions drawn from the research will be incomplete and
inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
But Chinese scientists have discovered several theses on
Confuciusornis in science journals. Recently Hou again found a new
thesis on Confuciusornis, written in German language.
</P>
<P>
Hou, who felt indignant at the phenomenon, pointed out that all
the Confuciusornis fossils overseas are smuggled, and ``a just
scientist would refuse to make research on the smuggled fossils."
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that if scientists overseas have got such
fossils, they can display them, but it is better not to
make any research on them.
</P>
<P>
So far Confuciusornis fossils have been found in Asia, Europe
and America -- the major areas for the study of ornithology.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has shown great concern for the loss of
the precious fossils, and have adopted measures to protect the
excavation site in Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
Most important of all, the Chinese themselves should do
research on the Confuciusornis fossils as soon as possible, the
scientist said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange (KLSE) market ended higher this week, after a week of
range trading.
</P>
<P>
The week's trading was dominated by second-board counters in
the absence of institutional and foreign interest but gains in
selected blue chips helped push the benchmark above the
1,200-point level before the yearend.
</P>
<P>
The Composite Index was 3.94 points up to end the week at 1,209
and the Emas Index gained 2.15 points to 338.47 while the
Industrial Index was 14.5 points higher at 2,202.91.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said it was least likely that the benchmark could
reach the desired 1,250-point mark before the year is out but the
fact that the index was able to stay above the 1,199-level was
very comforting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, second board counters provided the main excitement
on the market by outperforming the main board in transacted
volume, with its index surging 23.4 points to close the week at
563.71.
</P>
<P>
The only incentive buyers had this week was the expectation of
a better trading performance in the first quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
On the KLSE, the main board volume this week was 227.834
million shares worth 1.385 billion ringgit (about 554 million U.S.
dollars) from 811.932 million shares valued at 4.407 billion
ringgit (about 1.7628 billion dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
The second board turnover stood at 151.73 million shares valued
at 1.576 billion ringgit (about 630.4 million dollars) as against
last week's 180.193 million shares worth 2.112 billion ringgit
(about 844.8 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Off-market deals amounted to 85.227 million shares worth
729.034 million ringgit (about 291.6136 million dollars) compared
with 416.589 million shares valued at 2.139 billion ringgit (about
855.6 million dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
One stock, Taiping Super, made its debut on the second board
while five counters were suspended during the week.
</P>
<P>
During the week, consumer products accounted for 35.668
million shares traded, industrial products 27.854 million shares,
construction 14.307 million shares, trading/services 47.388
million shares, infrastructure 3.254 million shares, finance 34.67
million shares, hotels 1.208 million shares, properties 52.095

<P>
SHANGHAI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- A floating dock, with 60,000
dead weight tonnages (dwt), today slowly hoisted a bulk freighter
out of the water in the Huangpu River, a tributary of the Yangtze
River in Shanghai, marking the operation of the dock.
</P>
<P>
An engineer with Shanghai Marine Transport (Group) Co., which

Shipyard of Jiangsu Province to build the dock entitled "Pudong",
at a cost of 140 million yuan since August of 1994 and the
building was just completed.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the dock is capable of hoisting ships of
22,000 dwt, receiving bulk freighters of 35,000 dwt and receiving
super oil tankers of 60,000 dwt for repairs, and receiving various
kinds of ships and boats for repairs under special conditions.
</P>
<P>
The completion of the floating dock will cater to the demand
for building Shanghai into an international navigation hub and
will be conducive to the development of shipping services in
Shanghai and other areas in east China.

<HEADLINE> Sharp Downturn Registered in Indian Exports Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- India registered only a
9.9-percent growth in its exports between April and October this
year compared with the corresponding period of last year, the
National Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
The United Front government had promised to achieve a moderate
exports growth of 18 percent in the current fiscal year ending
March 1997.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, exports grew by 26 percent during the first half
(April-September) of the last fiscal year and more than 20 percent
for the whole fiscal 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
The downward trend in exports growth, coupled with a rise in
imports to 6.4 percent during the first seven months of this
fiscal year, has created severe pressure on the balance of
payments, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Indian Minister of State for Commerce B. Ramaiah recently
admitted that if the current trend continued, trade deficit for
the whole year of 1996-97 would go up.
</P>
<P>
The country's trade deficit amounted to 4.539 billion U.S.
dollars in 1995-96 as against 2.028 billion in 1994-95.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Probe Manipulation of Stock Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
taken some fresh measures to bring stability to and ensure
transparency in the bear-hit capital market that continued to fall
sharply sending a panic wave among share investors for the last
five weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission (CSE), the regulatory
body of the stock market, has constituted a high-powered committee
to investigate allegations of manipulated and syndicated trading
on the securities market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dhaka and Chittagong stock exchange authorities have
decided to relax the circuit-breaker from today to overcome
problems faced by some issues due to the system that limits price
fluctuations to 5 percent on the trading floor.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, the 5-percent circuit-breaker will be
relaxed for certain issues for three consecutive days after the
book-closure of respective companies.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the steps to stabilize the capital market, small
investors, particularly those active in the curb market, are
planning to start a sit-in demonstration in front of the Dhaka
Stock Exchange (DSE) building on Sunday next week to protest the
unprecedented bearish market.
</P>
<P>
Trading on the Dhaka and Chittagong stock exchanges further
declined on Thursday at the closing of the week's business.
</P>
<P>
The DSE price index last week took a heavy beating and fell by
317.74 points to 2269.5 while it once climbed to more than 3500
points early last month.

<P>
MOSCOW, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng left
Moscow for home this morning after winding up his two-day fruitful
working visit to Russia.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Li Peng exchanged views with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin on issues such as bilateral relations and
current international situation.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Li, during his visit starting on Thursday, also held talks with
his Russian counterpart Viktor Chernomyrdin, thus officially
inaugurating a regular meeting mechanism between the premiers of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the talks, the two sides signed a number of
important documents including a protocol on principles of the
general contract regarding the construction of the Lianyungang
nuclear power plant in China and an agreement between the People's
Bank of China and the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Russia noted the importance of further
consolidation of bilateral cooperation in such areas as power
engineering, machine-building, aviation and space, transport,
agriculture and high technologies.
</P>
<P>
A final joint communique on results of the Chinese premier's
Moscow trip says: "the two sides are unanimous in their opinion

equality and trust, which aims at strategic interaction in the
21st century, corresponds to crucial interests of the peoples of
the two countries, keeps pace with the spirit of the times -- the
striving for peace and development, helps sound development of the
situation in the world and international relations, and formation
of a multipolar world."
</P>
<P>
The two countries also agreed to hold the next meeting between
the Chinese and Russian government heads in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In order to coordinate the work of the regular meeting
mechanism between the two premiers, a preparatory commission for
such meetings was set up, to be headed, as co-chairmen, by Chinese
Vice Premier Li Lanqing and Russian First Deputy Prime Minister
Alexei Bolyshakov.
</P>
<P>
Upon leaving Russia, the Chinese Premier sent telegrams to
Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin respectively, expressing his belief that
his meetings with them would further strengthen the trust between
China and Russia, and push forward the development of the two
countries' strategic partnership.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Outlines Financial Target for 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is expected to increase
its 1997 budget by 12.2 percent over that of 1996, with budget
deficit within 3.5 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP),
the local press reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Nguyen Sinh Hung made the statement at a
two-day finance conference in the capital of Hanoi, which ended on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hung said that the main tasks for 1997 included the renovation
of macro-economic policy and the mobilization of all potential
resources to serve the country's industrialization and human
development goals.
</P>
<P>
Thrift will be the key word for the finance ministry next year,
with the belt tightened in both consumption and production, and
the money saved will go to investment, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam will also strengthen accounting activities and
financial management in the state businesses next year.
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of the state budget in 1996 came from tax
revenue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the budget deficit of the year was equal to 3.1
percent of GDP, which was considered acceptable because it did not
harm macro-economic stability, according to press report.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Build Ganges Barrage for Water Storage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
decided to build barrages across the Ganges to preserve surface
water for the country's irrigation system, an official of the
Water Resource Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
The official said the newly signed India-Bangladesh Ganges
Water Treaty created opportunity for the removal of existing
ecological imbalance developed in the country during the last 21
years.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to elaborate on the barrage-building plan,
just saying foreign aid is essential as the country lacks the
needed fund.
</P>
<P>
The Ganges is a common river flowing from India to Bangladesh
and the latter for years complained that the Indian side was
withdrawing water through its Farakka Barrage during the dry
season.
</P>
<P>
Under a water accord signed early this month, India finally
agreed to share the Ganges water with Bangladesh between January
and May in the next 30 years.

<P>
JAKARTA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The number of people with
human immune deficiency virus (HIV) in Indonesia has reached 466,
including 112 acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)
sufferers, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Up till November 1996, 67 of the 112 people with AIDS in the
country have died, because an effective cure has not been found
the world over, an official who attended an AIDS seminar in Medan,
North Java, said Friday, reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of foreigners in Indonesia with HIV and
AIDS totaled 128, he added.
</P>
<P>
About 63 percent of the HIV victims were caused by heterosexual
contact, and women were proved to be more prone to HIV than man
due to sexual contact with different partners, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The result of a comprehensive study showed that 59 percent of
people with HIV were aged between 15 and 59 years, the time in
life during which one is usually most sexually active and
economically productive, he added.
</P>
<P>
The first HIV case in Indonesia was discovered in Bali in 1987.

<HEADLINE> India's Congress Party Rules Out Plan to Topple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- India's Congress Party
President Sitaram Kesri has assured the ruling United Front that
his party has no plan to topple the government in the near future,
the Hindustan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Harkishan Singh Surjeet, general
secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M), ,
called on Kesri on Friday, seeking to know whether the Congress
party planned to withdraw support to the United Front government
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Congress party sources said Kesri assured Surjeet that his
party had no such plan after the election of new Congress
parliamentary party (CPP) leader scheduled for January 3.
</P>
<P>
The election is expected to choose a successor to former prime
minister P.V. Narasimha Rao who resigned from the powerful CPP
leadership earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Kesri is understood to have, however, told Surjeet that the
Congress party would review the performance of the United Front
government periodically.
</P>
<P>
Surjeet, who is known to enjoy a personal rapport with Kesri,
apparently sought the views of the Congress party president
following speculations in the political circles that the United
Front government's days would be numbered after the January 3
elections of a new CPP leader.
</P>
<P>
The removal of Rao from the CPP leadership is widely believed
to be a major step for the rejuvenation of the 111- year-old
Congress party which suffered a major debacle in the general
elections held in April and May. The party is currently lending
outside support to the minority government led by Prime Minister
H.D. Deve Gowda.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Foreign Minister
Genady Udovenko said here Friday that one of the diplomatic goals
for next year would be to speed up integration with Europe and
enhance ties with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a working meeting, Udovenko said the greatest
achievement in 1996 was that Ukraine was recognized by Europe and
regarded as an important factor in European security and stability.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry announced in November that Ukraine might
apply for NATO membership. The announcement could be just an
warning to Russia not to press Ukraine too hard on the division of
the black Sea Fleet and the status of Sevastopol.
</P>
<P>
"The 1997 diplomatic policies should ensure our national
security and territorial integrity," the foreign minister
emphasized at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of
crude palm oil (CPO), tin and rubber ended the week mixed with
CPO and tin higher and rubber mixed.
</P>
<P>
CPO physicals ended the week higher on some short covering
activities following expectation of lower palm oil production for
December 1996.
</P>
<P>
Players expect palm oil production for December 1996 to
decrease between 20 and 25 percent due to prolonged rain in
producing areas, especially in the northern and southern parts of
Peninsular Malaysia, which might affect the harvest of oil palm
fruits.
</P>
<P>
Societe Generalle de Surveillance (SGS), a private cargo
surveyor, had also estimated that Malaysia's palm oil export
between December 1 and 25, 1996, would rise to 589,456 tons as
against 555,070 tons in the same period of last month.
</P>
<P>
December south closed 15 ringgit (about 6 U.S. dollars) higher
at 1,270 ringgit (about 508 dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
The Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) ended the week also higher
on strong buying interest.
</P>
<P>
At the week's close, the metal rose 12 sen (about 4.8 U.S.
cents) to 14.64 ringgit (about 5.856 dollars) per kilogram
compared with last week's final price of 14.52 ringgit (about
5.808 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The week's performance was mainly influenced by local factors
instead of the London Metal Exchange (LME) which was closed on
Wednesday and Thursday on Christmas and Boxing Day and this
prompted players to divert their attention to the local market.
</P>
<P>
The transaction on the local market this week was mainly
dominated by European, local and Japanese players.
</P>
<P>
Turnover for the week narrowed to 310 tons from 402 tons last
week.
</P>
<P>
The premium between the KLTM price and that of the LME widened
to 175 dollars per ton on Friday compared with a premium of 65
dollars per ton a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
However, the Malaysian rubber market ended the week mixed in
quiet trading as most players were still away for the Christmas
and New Year holidays.
</P>
<P>
January RSS One eased by one sen to 315 sen (about 1.26
dollars) per kilogram while SMR 20 added 1.5 sen to 309.50 sen
(about 1.238 dollars) per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Despite the quiet market sentiment, 2,000 tons of SMR 10 for
January shipment were made to Australia on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At present, the market was experiencing a shortage of raw
materials following the prolonged and unpredictable rain that has
affected latex production not only in Malaysia but also in
Thailand and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of raw materials is expected to boost rubber
prices in the near future coupled with the fact that most players,
particularly European buyers, were on long year-end vacation.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Bans Rallies in Next Year's electioneering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
decided to formally ban street rallies and convoys of political
supporters in trucks or motorbikes that in the past were the
highlights of the election period.
</P>
<P>
Announcing a new election campaigning rule on Friday, Attorney
General Singgih said electioneering could only take the form of
public assemblies, media broadcast, leaflets, flyers and other
printed matter.
</P>
<P>
The only materials campaigners can deliver during the election
campaign are the political contestants' programs which are based
on the state ideology Pancasila, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision to revise the election campaign rules
met with protests from two opposition parties, namely the United
Development Party (PPP) and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI).
The government insisted that mass rallies during past elections
usually turned into brawls.
</P>
<P>
In addition, according to the new rules, election campaigning
is to be conducted in specially designed zones. The regulation
divides the country into six campaign regions. Each day during
the proposed 27-day campaign period, each political grouping would
campaign in two regions.
</P>
<P>
The zoning is meant to prevent supporters of one political
group from running into another group's supporters, thereby
reducing the potential for clashes, he added.
</P>
<P>
Singgih, however, reiterated the need to maintain alertness. He
said public assemblies have to be held with proper permits, and it
was the responsibility of both the security officers and the
political contestants to safeguard the events.
</P>
<P>
He also said the police would have the authority to stop an
election campaign gathering when violations occur.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's general election will be held on May 29 next year
with 124,740,987 registered voters from all over the country,
according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The three officially-recognized parties, the ruling Golkar, PPP
and PDI will compete in the elections for 425 seats in the
parliament. 75 other seats are to be filled by members of the
Indonesian armed forces appointed by the president. The armed
forces do not cast votes in the polling.
</P>
<P>
Golkar has won each of the five general elections held in the
country since 1971.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Impose Anti-Dumping Duties on Steel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Commerce Ministry has
announced that it will impose preliminary anti-dumping duties on
structural steel and hot-rolled sheets imported from Poland,
Russia and Ukraine, a local daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Structural steel imported from Poland will be charged
anti-dumping duties at 25.9-51.99 percent of the C.I.F. prices,

</P>
<P>
Hot-rolled steel sheets imported from Russia and Ukraine will
be subject to anti-dumping duties of 33.92-45.56 percent of the
C.I.F. prices.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary administrative measures, which took effect on
Friday, are expected to remain against the three countries until
September next year before the government finalized its policy on
steel dumping.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also said that the Thai government will lift the
10-20 percent surcharge on import tariffs earlier imposed against
imports of the products under its commitment to the World Trade

<HEADLINE> Italian Researcher Finds Key to Fighting Hepatitis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 17 (Xinhua) -- An Italian researcher has
discovered the Achilles heel of hepatitis C, a potentially deadly
virus that infects an estimated 5 million people around the world
each year.
</P>
<P>
Patrizia Farci, director of Cagliari University's Center for
the Study of Liver Diseases, has identified the "nerve center" of
the virus, a protein called HVRI found in the virus' outer layer.
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time the C virus' target has been discovered,
and it brings us closer to a vaccine," Farci said.
</P>
<P>
Working with Robert Purcell of the National Institute of Health
in Bethesda, Maryland in the United States, Farci was able to
block the infection and the disease in chimpanzees. The findings
are published in the U.S. publication, Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"Now the challenge is to develop a prototype of the vaccine
which contains a mixture of portions of different proteins to make
the human body produce antibodies which will neutralize all the
variants of the virus spread throughout the population," Farci
said.
</P>
<P>
Hepatitis C is one of the most dangerous and widespread forms
of hepatitis. It is transmitted by contaminated blood
transfusions, infected syringes and even through sexual

<HEADLINE> Thai Navy Likely to Postpone Submarine Purchase Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Thai navy is ready to
delay its plan to purchase two submarines if asked to do so by
Defense Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, according to Thai navy
commander-in-chief Adm. Vijit Chammankarn.
</P>
<P>
"However, Chavalit has not said anything to me about this.
Since he has given the policy of being thrifty, we have to treat
this matter carefully," Adm. Vijit was quoted today by local
newspaper the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
"But I feel the submarines will not be bought during my tenure
because I have less than one year in service. In this case, I will
leave it to my successor to proceed with the project," Adm. Vijit
continued.
</P>
<P>
Adm. Vijit has ordered a committee considering the 17-billion
baht (680 million US dollars) project to continue with its study
and information gathering.

GUATEMALA CITY, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Guatemala has beefed up
security measures to guarantee the signing of a peace treaty on
Sunday that will end the central American country's 36-year-old
civil war.

have been deployed to patrol the streets of the capital city
against threats of violence and possible attacks from armed groups.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Deputy Defense Chief Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Deputy Chief of
Defense Staff, Lt. Gen. Armand Roy, was fired today over
"double-dipping" and ordered to repay 51,100 to 58,400 U.S. dollars
he had received.
</P>
<P>
Acting Chief of Defense Staff Vice Admiral Larry Murray decided
today that Roy had to "leave the forces and pay back
money...including interest," a military spokesman was quoted by
the local media as saying.
</P>
<P>
While he was in charge of the Quebec region between 1992 and
1995, the 54-year-old veteran collected money to run two
households, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
"He was posted as a senior officer...his wife was in another
area...Basically speaking, he was receiving two allowances and
this was deemed not appropriate," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
An anonymous letter received by the military in July 1995
prompted the investigation into Roy's expenses.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police was called in after the
military investigation but decided that "there was no reasonable
prospect for a conviction."
</P>
<P>
Military prosecutors also decided against legal action, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Roy will be eligible for a pension and severance pay. It is not
known whether he can appeal the firing.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels Demand Withdrawal of Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) has demanded the withdraw of all government troops
from Basilan in the Southern Philippines and the recognition by
the government of all its controlled territories as requisites for
the success of the peace talks next month.
</P>
<P>
Al Hai Murad, MILF vice chairman for military affairs, was
quoted today by local press as saying that unless the government
pulls out its troops from the province, bloody clashes will
continue.
</P>
<P>
"How can a ceasefire agreement last in such an area?" said
Murad, adding that the government negotiators should devise a
comprehensive ceasefire proposal that is beneficial to both
parties and recognize MILF-controlled areas if the government is
sincere in offering peace.
</P>
<P>
He said the MILF have about 120,000 regulars in 13 of its major
camps in seven provinces in Mindanao, the southern Philippines,
and 60 percent of them are armed with high powered rifles, machine
guns and rocket propelled grenades.
</P>
<P>
Military authorities, however, claim that the MILF only has
some 60,000 fighters scattered in Mindanao Island.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, one of the major rebel groups in the southern part of
the country, rejects the peace agreement signed last September by
the Moro National Liberation Front and the government and demands
separate peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The government has not made any response to the preconditions
set by the MILF. Executive Secretary Ruben Torres said earlier
that the government's technical committee will meet its MILF
counterpart in Maguindanao province on January 7.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides will discuss the ground rules of the
ceasefire agreement they are expected to strike.

<HEADLINE> Peru President Places Lima in State of Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori Friday declared a state of emergency in the capital city,
to strengthen his position in the 11-day-old face-off with the
rebels holding more than 100 hostages in the Japanese embassy
residence.
</P>
<P>
The order, which gave the army and police greater freedom of
action such as special arrest and search powers, suspended some
constitutional guarantees, including unimpeded transit throughout
the country and protection from house searches and arrests without
warrants.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori said he placed the capital under a state of emergency
for 60 days in order to protect the security and tranquility of
the capital.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested three suspected Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement (MRTA) guerrillas, two women and one man, outside the
besieged compound Friday.
</P>
<P>
All the three, who claimed to be vendors, were arrested after
false identification cards, maps, and plans were found in their
bags, police said.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen people have been arrested around the compound as
suspected rebels since MRTA guerrillas seized the residence on
December 17 taking more than 500 people hostage at a gala
reception.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have demanded the freedom of at least 300 of their
imprisoned comrades in exchange of the captives, including
government officials, diplomats and businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori has rejected the demands of the rebels, insisting that
they lay down their weapons and free all hostages.
</P>
<P>
The country's Congress voted unanimously Friday to support
Fujimori's policy of not negotiating with rebels and demanded the
hostages be freed unharmed.
</P>
<P>
So far, 103 prisoners, including two government ministers, the
ambassadors of Japan, Malaysia, Bolivia, Honduras and the
Dominican Republic, remained in the building as bargaining chips
of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The hostage crisis have aroused concern the world over. Japan,
with some 30 nationals held in the residence, sent to Peru two
military advisers, one of whom had reportedly once worked in the
Japanese embassy.
</P>
<P>
It also supported, along with the United States, an
international strategy to end the standoff.
</P>
<P>
The United States was willing to consider an international
strategy for ending the standoff, provided Peru played the leading
role, reports said. It was also providing technical support for
surveillance of the compound, police said.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin had suggested G-7 intervention
earlier this week.

<HEADLINE> Scientists on Development in Western China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Experts and scholars recently
gathered in Beijing to explore development strategies for China's
western areas.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 researchers from 34 natural science societies
participated a three-day symposium last week and handed over a
total of 148 academic papers on topics including energy,
transportation, agriculture, industrial structure, urban
construction for nine western provinces and autonomous regions,
said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
On the symposium, jointly sponsored by the China Association
for Science and Technology (CAST) and the China National Natural
Science Foundation (CANSF), Zhang Yutai, vice-chairman of the CAST
called for Scientists to actively conduct studies on western areas to
provide information for government's policy-making.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, their gross domestic product was 14.1 percent of the
nation's total, dropping 2.3 percentage points from 1990.
</P>
<P>
The government's policy is important in helping the west, but
the market law should not be neglected in luring capital,
technology and personnel to the west, Hu Angang of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences said.
</P>
<P>
"What should be done now is to take down regional blockades to
achieve the most rational allocation of resources, capital and
personnel, " Hu said.
</P>
<P>
To attract investment, western areas must immediately improve
their infrastructure, experts said.
</P>
<P>
They also noted that the western areas have good conditions for
agricultural and animal husbandry development.
</P>
<P>
Xu Shijun of the China Water Conservation Society suggested to
build more irrigation system in these areas.
</P>
<P>
He noted that about half of the farmland in the areas have no
irrigation facilities and often suffer from drought.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Ministry of Construction and local urban
construction research institutes suggested city groups be created
in western areas to improve economic development in rural and
pastoral areas.
</P>
<P>
These cities will act as bridges and windows in developing the
western region, they said.

The message came in a letter the group sent to the man

<P>
General Jaime Cuadra Somarriba, who is also a deputy in the

Police detained the messenger, identified as Johnny Ortiz
Galeano, at the residence of the yet-to-be defense minister in
Matagalpa, 130 kilometers north of the capital, Managua.
</P>
<P>
Cuadra Somarriba said he had communicated with the Matagalpa
police chief, Commissioner Orlando Aguilera, on the detention
which he held would hamper efforts aimed to bring the armed band
back into the community.
</P>

The police chief refused to release the messenger, saying he
was a criminal.
</P>
<P>
The future defense minister told reporters he would charge the
police chief with violating his parliamentary immunity.
</P>

Cuadra Somarriba, a liberal leader from the Matagalpa
department, was chosen by Aleman to be a mediator in the
demobilization of the armed group which demand social and
economic guarantees from the state.

into market-driven, profitable companies.
</P>
<P>

firms in the province," Wen Shizhen, Governor of the Liaoning
province, was quoted by today's China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning province is home to 1,260, or ten percent of country's
large and medium-sized State enterprises. They have been plagued
with the same problems afflicting many of their counterparts
across the nation: inefficiency, poor product mix and financial
setbacks.
</P>
<P>
Other Liaoning firms hope to follow the amazing turnaround of
the huge consortium, Wen said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last October, 228 firms in the province had
claimed bankruptcy, and 71 of them were large State-owned ones.

said a race official in Hobart.
</P>
<P>
Morning Glory must cross the finish line by 3.36 a.m. on Sunday
to break the 21-year race record of two days, 14 hours 36 minutes
and 56 seconds set by U.S. maxi ketch Kialoa in 1975.
</P>
<P>
In second place in the 630 nautical mile race was Hong Kong
pocket maxi Exile, eight nautical miles astern of Morning Glory,
with Australian maxi Amazon third a further two nautical miles
behind. Overnight, four more boats retired damaged, reducing the
original 95-boat fleet to 82.
</P>
<P>
If Morning Glory does break the record, it will get 237,000
U.S. dollars, the richest prizemoney for a record-breaking
line-honours win in a single ocean race.

<HEADLINE> Peru in Contact With Hostages' Countries of Origin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The Peruvian government is in
close contact with representatives and special delegates from the
countries whose citizens were taken hostage by the rebel Tupac
Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), the Peruvian Foreign Ministry
said today.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry communique said that since the day after the
MRTA stormed the Japanese ambassador's residence during a
reception on December 17, Peruvian diplomatic authorities had
maintained active personal and telephone coordination with the
special envoys and ambassadors of Japan, Germany, and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian authorities are also in contact with
representatives from Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile,
Malaysia, Poland, the Republic of Korea, Romania, the Slovak
Republic, the United Kingdom, the United States, Vatican and the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday the MRTA members released Guatemalan ambassador
Jose Maria Argueta following news that the Guatemalan government
and the rebel National Revolutionary Unity are expected to sign a
peace treaty on Sunday to end a 36-year-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
But the 20 MRTA members still retained 103 captives, including
some 30 Japanese.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori has flatly rejected the
rebels' demands that more than 400 of their comrades jailed in
Peru and other countries be freed, telling them to hand over their
weapons and release their captives if they want to avoid the use
of force.

<HEADLINE> Sky in Coastal City Qingdao Turn Bluer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Sky in the coastal city of
Qingdao has become much bluer thanks to effective control over
black smog discharged from chimneys.
</P>
<P>
In the past, as long as firms submit fees for excessive
discharge of black smog, they would be forgiven.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the local environmental agency ordered firms causing
air pollution to improve smog discharge facilities, otherwise the
firms would risk the danger of being shut down.
</P>
<P>
Because of the change of policies, many firms were forced to
renovate their furnaces. This year, 31 firms in the city made a
total investment of 80 million yuan (about 8.4 million US dollars)
in upgrading technology to improve the efficiency of fuel burning.
</P>
<P>
The environmental agency has also invested heavily in the
control of discharge of smog. This year, the Qingdao Environmental
Protection Bureau invested more than 26 million yuan in 16
polluting projects.
</P>
<P>
So far, discharge of smog in 95 percent of the total area in
Qingdao has been put under control.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Calls for Restraint After West Java Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
called on religious communities in the country to be more mature
and to help develop a harmonious inter-religious life.
</P>
<P>
"I believe most religious people in the country are quite able
to control themselves in the face of various religious issues that
have developed in our society," the president said here last night
during a celebration of Christmas day.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto's statement came a day after angry protesters attacked
police headquarters, supermarkets, and other public utilities in
Tasikmalaya, West Java.
</P>
<P>
The country saw social and political unrest throughout 1996,
the president said.
</P>
<P>
"We must continue to be watchful against groups in the society
who can foment unrest in the people's inter-religious relations,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
The West Java town of Tasikmalaya was Thursday rocked by
rioting during which 11 churches, 23 shops and 18 car were damaged
or burned by the rioters, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The riot started as a protest by thousands of Muslims against
alleged police mistreatment of three Muslim teachers there.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Post, an English newspaper, reported today that
three people were found dead Friday in Tasikmalaya.
</P>
<P>
However, commander of the Siliwangi Military Command Maj. Gen.
Tayo Tarmadi was quoted by Antara news agency as saying Friday
that there were no casualties in the incident.
</P>
<P>
The city, about 225 kilometer southeast Jakarta, has returned
to normal, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of Indonesia's 196 million people follow
Islam but the government gives equal footing to Islam,
Catholicism, Protestantism, Hinduism and Buddhism -- the five
religions recognized by the state.

<HEADLINE> Australian's Asia Policy Continues with Major </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December (Xinhua) -- The Australian government
under Prime Minister John Howard is continuing his predecessor
Paul Keating's Asia policy, but with major Adjustment notably in
the defense and security areas.
</P>
<P>
True to Howard's campaign promise that closer engagement with
Asia would be its highest priority of foreign policy, Australia
made diplomatic overtures to Asia soon after the Howard
adminstration came to power in March.
</P>
<P>
Within two hours of being sworn in, Foreign Minister Alexeander
Downer decided to send a special envoy to Kuala Lumpur to invite
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to make his first visit
to Australia in more than a decade. And Downer's first overseas
trip was made in April to Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Other Australian ministers visited Asian capitals one after
another and Prime Minister Howard himself also paid official
visits to Indonesia and Japan before visiting the United States.
</P>
<P>
But the government's goodwill diplomacy did not always meet
with success, because the Asians found there was still a gap
between the words and the deeds of the Australian government. As
they were assured of closer mutual benefical relationships, they
found their aid from Australia's trade enhancement scheme had been
cut.
</P>
<P>
In the economic field, the Howard government is committed to
strengthening its engagement with Asia as its economy is
increasingly integrated with Asian economies. Over 65 percent of
its exports are directed towards Asia, and half of its overseas
investments is located in the region, and six of its eight biggest
trade partners are in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade Tim Fischer listed
three ways through which his government was developing its trade
and investment links with economic partners. First of them was to
engage increasingly with the dynamic economies of the region,
working the tremendous potential to develop complementarities
between Australia and its regional partners.
</P>
<P>
In this effort, the Howard government emphasized stronger
bilateral links and personal contacts with key economic partners.
Over the past few months, an increasing number of unofficial
delegations toured Asia to develop economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Although Australia's exports to Asia were increasing, but its
share in the market was decreasing. For example, exports to East
Asia more than doubled in the decade to 1995, but its share in the
market tumbled from 4.1 to 2.6 percent. Australia has the greatest
comparative advantage in agricultural products and resources but
they were the slow growers in East Asia trade.
</P>
<P>
The growth areas of Australian economy during the past few
years were mainly linked to East Asia. However, the rapid growth
in East Asia's economies has not been matched in the country by
the sort of structural reform that would best enable it to take
advantage of the opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Howard government maintained that economic
engagement with Asia is its absolute and unshakeable policy, in
the belief that Australia's long-term prosperity and economic
security are closely linked with Asia.
</P>
<P>
However, the Howard government made major adjustments to its
Asia policy in the defense and security sectors. It attached
priority to its traditioal relationship with America and West
Europe. It took measures to revitalize and strengthen the 1951
Australian-New Zealand-US Treaty and
raise the level of its military alliance with Washington.
</P>
<P>
In July, Australian and US defense and foreign ministers held
talks in Sydney and decided to hold a military exercise in
Queensland next March, which was regarded as the biggest one since
World War II. Australian Defense Minister Ian McLachlan said this
was a symbol of Australia's support to the American forward
deployment in Asia.
</P>
<P>
More recently, a nationwide debate on immigration policy in
this country aroused general concern among Asian countries
especially in Southeast Asia. The debate was sparked off by
Independent MP Pauline Hanson who claimed Australia was in danger
of being "swamped with Asians" and opposed immigrants from Asia.
</P>
<P>
All this compelled Asian countries to take a "wait-and-see"
attitude as they need time to judge the trend of the Asia policy
of the Howard government.

<HEADLINE> Fierce Competition in Three Gorges Project Bidding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The cost of a hydro-electric
power generator to be installed in the power station of the Three
Gorges Project is similar to the price of a Boeing 737 jetliner, a
project official has revealed.
</P>
<P>
Companies worldwide have been engaged in cut-throat competition
in attempts to win the rights to produce and sell the high-power
generators to China through international bidding invited by the
overseer of the project.
</P>
<P>
In June, the overseer of the project, the China Yangtze River
Three Gorges Project Development Corporation (CTGPC), announced
in Beijing that China will buy hydro-electric power generators
from manufacturers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Big-name companies from Germany, France, Switzerland, Norway,
Canada, Russia, such as Siemens, ABB, GE, and Mitsubishi, have
bought tender documents, with some even forming consortia to
outbid each other.
</P>
<P>
It is rare for so many influential companies to participate in
a bidding competition, said a CTGPC official.
</P>
<P>
The official explained that it is "the huge commercial cost of
the equipment that has aroused worldwide attention, especially at
a time when the world market for generators is sluggish."
</P>
<P>
By December 18 companies from nine countries had beaten a 4 pm
deadline to deliver tender documents to the overseer of the
project, winning the rights to participate in the "bidding
Marathon" which will not end until next summer.
</P>
<P>
China is now evaluating the bid documents.
</P>
<P>
"The stable operation of a ready-made generator is what China
cares about most, and what bidders should focus on," the official said.
</P>
<P>
"Another decisive factor is the price," adding that "if a
bidder can get export credits or other loans from the government
and financial agencies, it will become more competitive."
</P>
<P>
The official disclosed that some companies or consortia have
won credit support from their respective governments or financial
agencies of their countries.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project, the world's largest hydro-electrical
project, plans to install a total of 26 generators. The first
group of generators are expected to be making electricity in the
year 2003.

KUNMING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Six Asian countries are making
efforts to reach a framework agreement to reduce barriers in
cross-border transportation along the Lancang-Mekong river
reaches, according to a recent international conference held in
Kunming, capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Noritada Morita, a planning official with the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), said that Asian countries have 33
transportation cooperation projects in the Lancang-Mekong river

to Laos' Savanakhet to Viet Nam's Hanoi, and a highway from
Bangkok to Viet Nam's Ho Chi Minh city and Vung Tau, will start
from next year and end in 2001. A highway linking China and
Myanmar is also under construction.

But the government's goodwill diplomacy did not always meet
with success, because the Asians found there was still a gap
between the words and the deeds of the Australian government. As
they were assured of closer mutual benefical relationships, they
found their aid from Australia's trade enhancement scheme had been
cut.
</P>
<P>
In the economic field, the Howard government is committed to
strengthening its engagement with Asia as its economy is
increasingly integrated with Asian economies. Over 65 percent of
its exports are directed towards Asia, and half of its overseas
investments is located in the region, and six of its eight biggest
trade partners are in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade Tim Fischer listed
three ways through which his government was developing its trade
and investment links with economic partners. First of them was to
engage increasingly with the dynamic economies of the region,
working the tremendous potential to develop complementarities
between Australia and its regional partners.
</P>
<P>
In this effort, the Howard government emphasized stronger
bilateral links and personal contacts with key economic partners.
Over the past few months, an increasing number of unofficial
delegations toured Asia to develop economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Although Australia's exports to Asia were increasing, but its
share in the market was decreasing. For example, exports to East
Asia more than doubled in the decade to 1995, but its share in the
market tumbled from 4.1 to 2.6 percent. Australia has the greatest
comparative advantage in agricultural products and resources but
they were the slow growers in East Asia trade.
</P>
<P>
The growth areas of Australian economy during the past few
years were mainly linked to East Asia. However, the rapid growth
in East Asia's economies has not been matched in the country by
the sort of structural reform that would best enable it to take
advantage of the opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Howard government maintained that economic
engagement with Asia is its absolute and unshakeable policy, in
the belief that Australia's long-term prosperity and economic
security are closely linked with Asia.
</P>
<P>
However, the Howard government made major adjustments to its
Asia policy in the defense and security sectors. It attached
priority to its traditioal relationship with America and West
Europe. It took measures to revitalize and strengthen the 1951
Australian-New Zealand-US Treaty and
raise the level of its military alliance with Washington.
</P>
<P>
In July, Australian and US defense and foreign ministers held
talks in Sydney and decided to hold a military exercise in
Queensland next March, which was regarded as the biggest one since
World War II. Australian Defense Minister Ian McLachlan said this
was a symbol of Australia's support to the American forward
deployment in Asia.
</P>
<P>
More recently, a nationwide debate on immigration policy in
this country aroused general concern among Asian countries
especially in Southeast Asia. The debate was sparked off by
Independent MP Pauline Hanson who claimed Australia was in danger
of being "swamped with Asians" and opposed immigrants from Asia.
</P>
<P>
All this compelled Asian countries to take a "wait-and-see"
attitude as they need time to judge the trend of the Asia policy
of the Howard government.

<HEADLINE> Former East German Sports Officials to Be Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Fifty leading sports officials
from former East Germany are to be charged with bodily harm for
supplying athletes with banned performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Berlin justice ministry said prosecutors
were preparing charges against about 50 sports administrators,
doctors and coaches and that the first charges could be brought
next year.
</P>
<P>
"The investigations are continuing," said Ruediger Reiff, the
justice ministry spokesman. "The charges being prepared are bodily
harm through doping of East German sportsmen."
</P>
<P>
The investigations, launched about 18 months ago, involve huge
amounts of documentation so, to make their cases more manageable,
prosecutors have focussed on swimming, cycling, athletics and
weightlifting.
</P>

East Germany won almost as many Olympic medals as the United

GUANGZHOU, December 28 (Xinhua) -- China's first
multi-functional automatic mechanical wrist watch, made by
Guangzhou Watch Factory, has passed appraisal by experts in
Guangzhou, capital of South China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
It makes China the third country capable of manufacturing
such sophisticated timepieces after Switzerland and France.
</P>
<P>
The newly-developed watch, which shows the month, week, day,
hour, minute and second, has far surpassed national standards
for being magnetic-proof, water-proof and shock-proof.
</P>
<P>
Automatic mechanical watches are the hope for the development
of China's watch industry, since batteries used for quartz clocks
and watches pollute the environment.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that the new product is more flexible compared
with these made by foreign countries due to its inventive

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Foreign Minister: OSCE Report Constructive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Milan Milutinovic said today that the report of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) on the results of
the recent local elections in Serbia was "good, constructive and
balanced."
</P>
<P>
He said the report's main point was exhorting for dialogue
within the system and for a constructive approach and discussion
within parliament between the authorities and the opposition,
according to the Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic also said the report confirmed the elections were
held in the best possible order, the greatest part of the people
were able to express their will, and the opposition had won in a
number of municipalities.
</P>
<P>
An OSCE delegation visited Belgrade last weekend at the
invitation of the Yugoslav government to look into matters
concerning election results and submitted a fact-finding report to
the OSCE chairman today. It confirmed that the opposition had won
most major cities in the local elections in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav opposition coalition Zajedno has claimed victory
in 14 out of 18 biggest cities in the November 17 local elections
and organized daily demonstrations over the past 37 days to
protest the annulment of the election results by the government,
causing a political crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic said, "When we look into the list of these
municipalities, it is clear that there was a certain measure of
confusion among mission members, which is understandable if we
know that they stayed in Belgrade only one day."
</P>
<P>
The most important thing, he added, was that the OSCE
delegation members "consider, as we do, that all problems should
be solved within our system."
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic repeated that the report had been assessed in its
entirety as very constructive and balanced.
</P>
<P>
"All in all, the first reaction is good, and we accept
suggestions as well-intentioned and constructive, because they
urge everything to be reviewed within adequate procedure, or
within the institutions of our system," he said.

<HEADLINE> US Population Up 2.3 Million During 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. will start 1997
with a quickly increasing population in the developed world, with
2.3 million people more than it had a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the country will open the
new year with 266,499,365 people, 0.9 percent more than it had in
the previous year. The agency figures that 3.8 million Americans
were born, 2.3 million died, about 809,000 new immigrants arrived
and 27,000 citizens returned during the year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a nonprofit group, the Population Institute, said
here today at a news conference that the global population growth
slows this year, from 100 million additional people last year to
fewer than 90 million this year.
</P>
<P>
An increase in family planning and the unusually large number
of old people worldwide now have contributed to the current
slowdown, the group said.
</P>
<P>
The institute president, Werner Fornos, also warned that 3
billion young people are about to enter their childbearing years,
which could send the world growth rate soaring again. The number
of young people in the surge equals the world population in 1960.
</P>
<P>
The group's year-end report comes at a time when the global
population is approaching 5.9 billion. Fornos also predicts that
policy decisions in the next few years will determine whether the
population steadies at 8 billion people or increases to 12 billion
in the next century.

two-day working visit here.
</P>
<P>
The communique said, Li and Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin "held fruitful talks on strengthening cooperation in
various fields between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Li also met with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and they
reached agreement on the arrangements for Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's visit to Russia next spring, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides believe that for China and Russia to establish a
21st century-oriented strategic partnership based on equality and
trust is in the fundamental interests of the two peoples, in
conformity to the trend of peace and development of the times and
is conducive to the healthy development of the world situation and
international relations and to the formation of a multi-polar
world," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
It said, "both sides believe that there exist great potentials
and broad prospects for cooperation in various fields between
China and Russia and to enhance cooperation in various fields is
conducive to the common development of the two countries."
</P>
<P>
In order to coordinate the work of the regular meeting
mechanism of heads of government of the two countries, the two
sides decided to set up a preparatory commission for the meetings,
with Vice-Premier of China's State Council Li Lanqing and Russian
Federation's First Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Bolyshakov as
co-chairmen, it said.
</P>
<P>
Under the framework of the commission, subcommittees will be
set up for cooperation in economy and trade and science and
technology, for cooperation in energy, and for cooperation in
transport. If needed, more subcommittees or working groups will be
created on the ground of consultations of the two sides, the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides declared that the talks between premier of the
State Council of the People's Republic of China, Li Peng, and
prime minister of the Russian Federation, Viktor Chernomyrdin, on
December 27, 1996 marked the official inauguration of the regular
meeting mechanism of the premiers of the two countries.
</P>
<P>

the agreements reached at a recent meeting of the Sino-Russian
Intergovernmental Commission for Trade, Economic, Science and
Technology Cooperation in Beijing.

exchanges and agreed that it is of great importance to further
strengthen cooperation in the fields of energy, machinery-making,
aviation and astronautics, transport, agriculture and advanced
science and technology.

<P>
They believe that with joint efforts, it is appropriate to
increase the bilateral trade volume to 20 billion U.S. dollars in
the next few years, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that the next meeting between the two
heads of government will be held in the second quarter of 1997 in

<HEADLINE> Dow Sets New Record at Yearend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Blue chip stocks on Wall
Street rose to record highs today as bond prices rose following a
report of weak factory orders.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 14.23 at 6,560.91,
surpassing its previous closing high of 6,547.79 on November 25.
</P>
<P>
The stock market is enjoying a yearend rally prompted by
investors who want to buy shares that have performed well this
year.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues led decliners by 7 to 4 on the New York Stock
Exchange. But volume was light, with just over 250 million shares
having changed hands today on the Big Board. Many investors are
absent following the Christmas holiday.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indexes were narrowly mixed. The Nasdaq composite,
under some pressure from profit-taking in computer stocks, fell
2.71 to 1,291.86. And the American Stock Exchange's market value
index was off 0.90 at 581.93.
</P>
<P>
But the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 list was up 0.48 at 756.30, and
the NYSE composite index rose 0.97 to 756.79.
</P>
<P>
Bonds rose this morning after the Commerce Department said
orders to U.S. factories for durable goods unexpectedly fell 1.6
percent in November, the first decline in three months, due
largely to shrinking demand for electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
Lower factory orders were welcomed by the financial markets
because they indicate that the economy is not growing at an
inflationary pace and that the Federal Reserve is less likely to
raise interest rates to cool inflation.
</P>
<P>
But the Labor Department reported that new claims for jobless
benefits fell by 15,000 last week to 335,000. Many analysts had
expected a mere 5,000 decline.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Company Buys Two European Paper Trades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch company KNP BT
(distribution, packing and paper) has recently bought two
paper-wholesale trades in Germany and Italy, with a joint turnover
of some 300 million U.S. dollars, reported today's Dutch newspaper
NRC Handelsblad.
</P>
<P>
With the takeover of Wihelm Seiler and Bunzl Italia, KNP BT
becomes the biggest paper seller in Europe.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the Dutch concern has reached an
agreement before Christmas with the British paper- and
plastic-manufacturer Bunzl on the buying of both wholesale trades.
</P>
<P>
KNP BT had made the highest offer in a sort of
auction-procedure and paid 61.6 million pounds (36.8 million U.S.
dollars) for both enterprises.
</P>
<P>
At the Amsterdam's Stock Exchange this morning, the KNP BT
share went up by 1.80 Dutch guilder (3.14 U.S. dollars) to 37.30
Dutch guilders (65.08 dollars), an increase of almost 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
At present, KNP BT shares the leading market position in the
European paper industry with the Franco-British Arjo Wiggins
Appleton (AWA), which sold 1.6 million tons of paper annually.
</P>
<P>
Both Seiler and Bunzl Italia are, according to KNP BT,
profitable. "We think that we are able to augment the profit by
synergy-effects which we suppose to see," a KNP BT spokesman was
quoted by the newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The takeover by KNP BT of Seiler and Bunzl Italia has to be
approved by the European Commission, which will give the judgement
within a few days. KNP BT expected no problem, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Russian Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng met
with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin here today, both
pledging to boost bilateral trade and economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Li and Chernomyrdin expressed satisfaction over the friendly
cooperation between China and Russia and discussed measures to
increase bilateral trade volume to 8 or 10 billion U.S. dollars in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Their meeting marked the beginning of the regular meeting
mechanism between the Chinese premier and Russian prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed that China and Russia, with huge
markets, enjoy grand prospects for economic cooperation as the two
economies are highly complementary. They agreed the two countries
should grasp the current favorable chance and give fresh impetus
to the further development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
They believed that it is possible to reach the target of
increasing bilateral trade volume to 20 billion dollar by the end
of this century, as proposed earlier by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and his Russia counterpart Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
At their meeting, they also discussed the possibilities of
cooperation in large scale projects in energy, machine-building,
space, aviation, transport, agriculture and military technology.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed to set up a joint preparatory commission
for the regular meetings of heads of government, to be co-chaired

<HEADLINE> Turkey Claims Rights to Multi-national Mission on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has the right to decide
the fate of a new U.S.-led multi-national force designed to
protect the Kurds in northern Iraq, the Foreign Ministry said
today.
</P>
<P>
A ministry statement said the country can decide the role,
capacity and time limit of the upcoming Reconnaissance Force,
which will replace the similar Operation Provide Comfort (OPC) on
January 1.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as a response to an announcement made
Thursday by the acting U.S. Statement Department spokesman John
Dinger that denied a substantial change between the OPC, which
also involves Turkish, British and French forces, and the new
force.
</P>
<P>
Both Turkey and U.S. will be able to terminate the new force in
the light of the actual situation, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to appease the disgruntled Iraqi administration, the
statement underlined that Turkey will not allow its territory to
be used for offensive operation against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish parliament approved Wednesday a cabinet motion
that demanded the termination of the OPC mandate after a heated
debate.
</P>
<P>
The OPC was established to provide an air protection for the
Kurds in northern Iraq against a possible attack from the Iraqi
government forces in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Since early this year, many Turkish government officials and
parliamentarians have been complaining that the OPC was
increasingly used as a protection umbrella by the Kurds in
northern Iraq, who have been fighting for independence from
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. and Turkish military officials suggested a
multi-national force to be stationed in southeastern Turkey as a
replacement of the OPC force.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides failed to agree on details regarding the new
force, and their discussions are reportedly to resume in Ankara in
January.
</P>
<P>
France, which has played an active role in the OPC since 1991,
unexpectedly announced today its withdrawal from the new force on
ground that it lacks a "humanitarian aid dimension."
</P>
<P>
Local opinions said that France made the decision because it
plans to develop trade relations with Iraq.
