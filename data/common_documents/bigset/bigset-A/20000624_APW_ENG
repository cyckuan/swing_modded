<HEADLINE> ConAgra to acquire maker of Chef Boyardee products for $1.6 billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARSIPPANY, N.J. (AP) - Food conglomerate ConAgra Inc. is buying
International Home Foods Inc. for $1.6 billion in cash and stock,
plugging gaps in its product line and possibly adding clout in
bargaining for grocery shelf space.
</P>
<P>
   The latest food industry combination was announced Friday. It
joins International Home Foods, the maker of Chef Boyardee pasta
products, Pam cooking spray and Gulden's Mustard, with ConAgra,
whose 100 consumer brands included such well-known names as
Butterball, Healthy Choice, Orville Redenbacher and Swiss Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ConAgra, of Omaha, Neb., has annual sales of more than $25
billion and also owns meatpacking and fertilizer businesses.
</P>
<P>
   International Home Foods, based in Parsippany, N.J., was formed
in November 1996 when a group of investors acquired the food
business of Madison, N.J.-based American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the deal works for both companies.
</P>
<P>
   Christine McCracken, who follows ConAgra for Midwest Research in
Cleveland, said, ''What this does is kind of fill the holes. They
were strong in ketchup, and now they have Gulden's.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will allow them to broaden their presence in the center
of the store and allow them to increase their leverage with grocery
retailers,'' McCracken said.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, International Home Foods shareholders
will receive $22 per share, half in cash and half in ConAgra stock.
</P>
<P>
   That represents a 43 percent premium over International Home
Foods' closing price of $15.375 a share on Thursday on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   International Home Foods' shares rose 34 percent Friday,
finishing up $5.25 at $20.625, while ConAgra shares declined 6.9
percent, losing 93.7 cents to finish at $18.938 a share.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, ConAgra will also assume $1.3 billion of
debt.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is subject to approval by International Home Foods
shareholders and regulatory agencies. It is expected to close in
the third quarter of calendar year 2000, the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Rohde, ConAgra's chairman and chief executive, said the
combination will ''create a company with $28 billion in sales,
strong growth prospects and attractive operating synergies.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal follows Unilever PLC's agreement to pay $20.3 billion
for Bestfoods Corp., the maker of Hellmann's mayonnaise and Skippy
peanut butter. Nabisco Group Holdings is currently reviewing bids
for itself and its 80.6 percent stake in Nabisco Holdings, which
makes Ritz crackers, Oreo cookies and Life Savers candy.
</P>
<P>
   John M. McMillin, at Prudential Securities Inc. in New York,
said the price was fair, but not as sweet as Bestfoods, which is to
be sold for 14 times cash flow and debt, compared with about eight
times for International Home Foods.
</P>
<P>
   ConAgra has 80,000 employees, while International Home Foods has
8,800.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the possibility of layoffs, ConAgra spokeswoman
Karen Savinski said, ''We can't be specific on that at this time
until our analysis is complete.''

<HEADLINE> German fight promoter describes role in $100,000 payoff  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A German boxing promoter says national pride
compelled him to funnel $100,000 to the IBF on behalf of
heavyweight Axel Schulz so the sanctioning body would mandate a
lucrative rematch with champion George Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony Friday of German-born businessman Wilfrid
Sauerland supports earlier testimony in the racketeering trial of
IBF founder Robert W. Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and other IBF officials are accused of taking $338,000 over
more than a decade in exchange for favors and rigged rankings, but
the bulk of that money stems from the machinations regarding
Foreman and Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   Sauerland, who now lives in Switzerland, said Foreman was
probably looking for an easy match when he picked his fighter,
Schulz, for a title defense. The disputed Foreman victory in April
1995 showed the champion underestimated the German, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sauerland said that during a meeting he had with Lee a month
after the fight, Lee was sympathetic: ''He also felt that the
decision was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, knowing that IBF rules permit a rematch after
controversial bouts, Sauerland said he was shocked when Schulz's
U.S.-based co-promoter, Cedric Kushner, told him the IBF wanted
$100,000 to sanction the rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Sauerland said he was reluctant to pay, but knew that Germany
was keen on Schulz becoming its first world heavyweight champion
since Max Schmeling in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole nation was looking at it,'' Sauerland said. ''I was
under a lot of pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I paid the money, I was not aware there could be a
conflict with U.S. law,'' said Sauerland, who is testifying with
immunity. ''I had no alternative but to pay because otherwise there
was no chance of Axel getting the rematch.''
</P>
<P>
   Sauerland said he withdrew $100,000 in dollars from one of his
Swiss accounts and delivered the cash to Kushner in a Las Vegas
hotel room in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The IBF ordered the rematch, but Foreman relinquished the IBF
belt instead of complying.
</P>
<P>
   Sauerland said he did not get his money back, but did not
complain because Schulz got a title shot in June 1996, losing to
Michael Moorer.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination by Lee defense lawyer Gerald Krovatin,
Sauerland acknowledged that the IBF was shortchanged on Schulz's
sanctioning fee from the Foreman fight.
</P>
<P>
   The fee, $10,500, was based on a reported purse of just $75,000
that Kushner negotiated with Lee, Sauerland said.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz's actual purse was either $350,000 or $500,000, Sauerland
said, which would have generated a much larger fee.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Foreman - a huge draw as the oldest heavyweight
champion - got a $10 million purse and paid the IBF a $150,000 as a
sanctioning fee.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctioning fees are charged by the IBF and the other two major
governing bodies for the sport in return for conferring their
titles.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing is a sideline for Sauerland, who said he operates
Afrotech AG, a business that supplies bottling equipment to the
soda and brewery industries in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner, who is expected to testify next week, has not been
charged. Since the Foreman-Schulz allegations surfaced with Lee's
indictment in November, he and his lawyer have declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman promoter Bob Arum, of Top Rank Inc. in Las Vegas,
testified two weeks ago that he used a middleman to get $100,000 to
the IBF to sanction the initial Foreman-Schulz title fight. An
exception was needed because Schulz was unranked.
</P>
<P>
   Sauerland's account squares with testimony from the
prosecution's key informant, longtime IBF ratings chairman C.
Douglas Beavers.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers testified in April that the rematch got the green light
from the IBF because Lee had him squeeze Kushner for $100,000.
Beavers said Kushner initially thought he was joking, even though
Kushner had been making periodic payoffs averaging $5,000 twice a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers said he drove from his home in Portsmouth, Va., and
collected a manilla envelope containing the money from Kushner at
his home in East Hampton, N.Y., in June 1995. The money was divided
into four packets, for himself, Lee, Lee's son, and Bill Brennan,
former IBF championship committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 66, of Fanwood, and his son, Robert Jr., 38, of Scotch
Plains, N.J., are the only defendants on trial. They face multiyear
prison terms if convicted of conspiracy, racketeering, fraud and
tax charges.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan, 86, of Warsaw, Va., past president of the U.S. Boxing
Association, a group that became the IBF, was severed from the
trial because of ill health.
</P>
<P>
   The IBF's South American representative, Francisco ''Pacho''
Fernandez of Colombia, remains at large.
</P>
<P>
   The Lee trial has finished its 11th week and is expected to last
into August. In the meantime, a court-appointed monitor is
overseeing the IBF, and Lee is barred from participating in IBF
affairs.

<HEADLINE> Chechnya's Refugees Can't Go Home  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   KARABULAG, Russia (AP) -- A week after he set off for Chechnya to
rebuild his life, Abubakar Sadayev was back in the filthy refugee
camp where he had sat for months, his dream of going home
shattered.
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of others who fled the war in Chechnya, Sadayev's
efforts to return fell apart because there was no way to feed his
family or keep them safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is shameful for me that I cannot feed my family, that I
cannot provide for them,'' said Sadayev, a stocky 40-year-old with
thinning black hair and deep brown eyes, who had a home in the
now-devastated Chechen capital, Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   At Soglasiye Camp, hundreds of men sit idly outside the drab
tents lining the muddy paths as women wash clothes and prepare
meals over smoky wood fires. Children, many dressed in ragged
clothing, run shouting and laughing, making up games without toys.
</P>
<P>
   The camp, one of several in the Russian republic of Ingushetia,
is home to about 5,000 Chechen refugees. Other camps present the
same dismal picture of refugees desperate to go home, but with no
way to live if they do.
</P>
<P>
   Chechens fear they could spend months or years in refugee camps,
in essence, becoming a people in exile.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went to Grozny. There aren't even walls left from my house.
... I have to choose -- either to die of hunger in Grozny or to try
to make ends meet in the camp,'' Sadayev said.
</P>
<P>
   About 250,000 Chechens fled from the war at the end of last
year, and some 200,000 are still in the refugee camps, unable to
return home, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Some 10 months after Russia began its offensive to crush Chechen
rebels, federal troops are bogged down with the guerrillas mounting
daily hit-and-run attacks. Moscow says the rebels are defeated, but
thousands of Chechen fighters show no sign of giving up their fight
for independence.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian authorities want the refugees to return to Chechnya,
insisting conditions are safe and they will be cared for. But
refugees who have returned found their homes destroyed, no work and
no food in a land torn apart by the war.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the relative safety of the camps, life is difficult. The
refugees get food handouts once a day, mostly soup or porridge.
Many complain of hunger or stomach problems because of the poor
quality of the food.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are tired of waiting for the war to end. I am tired of
begging for aid every day, of worrying about food for my
children,'' complained Zara Kadiyeva, a mother of three.
</P>
<P>
   The smell of human waste hangs over the camp. Tents are made of
rubber or tarpaulin that keep out the rain, but make the interiors
swelteringly hot. People walking on the narrow paths threading
through the tents sink up to their knees in slick, black mud.
</P>
<P>
   The few refugees who have money go to nearby markets to buy
food. Most of the refugees have sold their possessions, and now
have no money or any way of getting more.
</P>
<P>
   ''To feed my family I had to sell everything,'' said Aslanbek
Shalozhy, who had sold his television set and the few other
possessions he managed to get out of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   A few men find work at nearby farms or businesses, but complain
that they are forced to accept lower wages than the locals. Most of
the men sit in the camp, playing cards, talking or just staring
into space.
</P>
<P>
   ''All day long, I wander around looking for news. People who
come from Chechnya bring it. So the day passes,'' said Shirvani
Zakriyev.
</P>
<P>
   There is little talk these days about when the war will end.
Occasionally there are arguments about the conflict and the rival
factions competing for power in Chechnya, but most people avoid
talk of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Markha Magomadova, 21, dreams of going back to her classes at
Grozny University, but fears the capital is too dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here in the tents there is a bed at least. But they feed us
with such garbage that even pigs wouldn't eat it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While the men sit and brood, the women are busy all day long,
trying to keep their families' tents and clothing clean. Some sit
by the road, selling single cigarettes or candies, while others
trek into the surrounding hills to gather edible plants.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen men consider it unthinkable to do domestic work,
although a few admit quietly they would like to help.
</P>
<P>
   ''Women, they have something to do at least -- they clean, wash.
And I feel like a sponger,'' Zakriyev said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Carlos Lee hit a game-tying homer against Mariano
Rivera leading off the ninth and Jose Valentin singled home the
winning run later in the inning as the Chicago White Sox stunned
the New York Yankees 4-3 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, which outscored New York 42-17 in sweeping a four-game
series last week at Yankee Stadium, has won 17 of 21 overall.
</P>
<P>
   After the Yankees left the bases loaded against Sean Lowe (2-1)
in the top half, Lee hit Rivera's first pitch of the bottom half
for his 14th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Perry singled, advanced on Brook Fordyce's sacrifice and
Ray Durham's grounder and Valentin hit a broken-bat single over
second, raising his hands in his celebration as he headed to first.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera (2-2) blew a save for the third time in 19 chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, awaiting word on whether their trade to acquire
Juan Gonzalez from Detroit will be finalized, had taken a 3-2 lead
in the eighth on Bernie Williams' RBI single off Bobby Howry and
Shane Spencer's run-scoring double against Bill Simas.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera struck out Chris Singleton with two runners on in the
eighth but couldn't get it done in the ninth. The victory allowed
the White Sox move 8&AMP;frac12; games ahead of second-place Cleveland in the
AL Central.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago went ahead in the fourth when Paul Konerko grounded into
a double play with the bases loaded and Singleton blooped a single
to left-center in front of a diving Spencer.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill's ninth homer cut the lead to 2-1 in the sixth as
dark clouds and lightning surrounded Comiskey Park. the game was
then delayed 1 hour, 8 minutes by rain.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Ben Ford, making his first major league start,
allowed two runs and five hits in 6 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ford, who made eight relief appearances for Arizona in
1998, was called up Friday from Triple-A Columbus, where he was
3-0. He worked from the stretch the entire night, even when runner
weren't on base. It was his first major league start. ... Magglio
Ordonez had his career-high 14-game hitting streak stopped. ...
Jose Vizcaino, acquired Wednesday in a trade from the Dodgers, made
his first Yankees start at second base. Chuck Knoblauch, who made
his 14th error Thursday night, was the DH for the second time this
season.

Gore Makes Probe Transcript Public
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In sometimes sharp exchanges, Vice President Al Gore told
investigators that he does not know ''to this day'' that a controversial 1996
Buddhist temple event was a Democratic fund-raising event, a transcript released
Friday by the White House shows. Moving aggressively to respond to re-emergence
of the fund-raising controversy in his presidential campaign, Gore said he made
the transcript public so Americans can judge for themselves: ''I've told the
truth.'' Gore acted after word leaked that Robert Conrad, the Justice Department
prosecutor who questioned the vice president on April 18, is recommending that a
special counsel be appointed to probe the truthfulness of the vice president's

Backpackers' Hostel tore quickly through the wooden structure, sending guests
leaping from the second floor onto the roof of a neighboring clothing store.
Survivors complained that some of the windows were barred. Fire officials said
the building had regular safety checks and was equipped with smoke detectors,

   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Talks between Fiji's military rulers and gunmen holding 31

dampening hopes the captives would be released soon. But negotiations resumed in
the afternoon. Military commander Commodore Frank Bainimarama and rebel leader
George Speight met Saturday to look over the final draft of an accord which
negotiators on both sides said Friday would pave the way for the hostages'
release. But Bainimarama left the meeting after less than 20 minutes without
signing the accord, a military spokesman told The Associated Press on condition
of anonymity. Bainimarama returned to the meeting a few hours later, however,
signaling a resumption of talks.

<HEADLINE> House Backs Money For Tobacco Suit  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tobacco industry officials and their
congressional allies are upset with the bipartisan House vote to
provide the Justice Department with enough money to keep alive its
costly lawsuit against the nation's cigarette producers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're disappointed,'' said Peggy Roberts, spokeswoman for
Philip Morris Management Corp., parent company of Philip Morris
U.S.A., the nation's biggest cigarette maker.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said the Clinton administration ''can't get enough out
of the taxes we pay, and it's totally politically motivated to
punish us.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts' comments came after the House voted, 215-183, Friday to
let the Justice Department tap three other agencies for $12 million
next year to help pay for the litigation. Attorney General Janet
Reno has said that without the extra money she would have to drop
the legal action, which could net billions for the government,
because her department could not afford it.
</P>
<P>
   After the roll call, President Clinton said the House had
''voted decisively to support the interests of the American people
over those of the special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   But tobacco supporters in the House thought otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the way to promote the administration's political
agenda,'' said Rep. Robin Hayes, R-N.C. He said Clinton's effort to
raise cigarette taxes by 55 cents a pack didn't work, ''so he comes
in the backdoor with a lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks to recover an unspecified amount of money to
help cover the more than $20 billion that officials say the
government spends every year to care for millions of veterans,
senior citizens, and others with tobacco-related health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Still-unwritten Senate legislation might also contain language
denying the Justice Department the extra money. But the House vote,
along with a White House veto threat, would make its fate shaky.
</P>
<P>
   Joining 159 Democrats in voting for the extra money were 55
Republicans, largely from northern states and California. Voting
''no'' were 147 Republicans plus 35 Democrats, mostly from tobacco
growing regions. The House's two independents split.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy lobbying pitted cigarette makers against health, veterans,
senior citizens and other groups.
</P>
<P>
   The vote capped a topsy-turvy week that began when the House
voted 207-197 on Monday against letting the Justice Department
accept $4 million from veterans' health programs to pay for the
litigation. A day later, the House voted by voice to let the money
come instead from the Department of Veterans Affairs'
administrative budget.
</P>
<P>
   The pivotal difference was 25 Republicans, mostly from the North
and California, who voted ''no'' on Monday but ''yes'' on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was taking out of veterans'' in Monday's vote, Rep. Ralph
Regula, R-Ohio, one of the switchers, said in an interview. ''And
this vote wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's roll call was one of the few failures the tobacco
industry has suffered on Capitol Hill in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco allies scuttled the Senate's 1998 effort to levy $516
billion in new taxes on the industry and use the money for health
and anti-smoking programs. They also have resisted recent Clinton
proposals to boost the cigarette tax, and stymied efforts to let
the federal Food and Drug Administration regulate tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Following the $246 billion settlement the states reached with
tobacco companies in 1998, the Justice Department filed its own
lawsuit last September.
</P>
<P>
   The legal action is expected to cost the department $40 million
this year and next. To help defray it, the administration would let
the Defense, Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services
departments each contribute $4 million to Justice next year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Gore Continues With Fund-Raisers  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore held his head as he
heard Democratic financial heavyweight Water Shorenstein label
rival George W. Bush a ''lightweight, shortsighted hypocrite,'' a
comment that was rather sharp even if it did draw a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lighter moment as Gore determinedly worked his way
through a long list of high-dollar gatherings throughout the West,
even as new controversy was raging over his financial dealings in
the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore raised just over $1.1 million in a couple of fund-raisers
in Denver, before heading to northern California where he pulled in
an additional $1.5 million, $1 million of it at a San Francisco
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   All of it is ''soft money'' that will go to the Democratic
National Committee but would be eliminated under campaign finance
overhaul proposals Gore argues would be at the top of his list if
he's elected.
</P>
<P>
   He never fails to note that, even when supporters are shelling
out $25,000 apiece to rub shoulders with him.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're here at a fund-raiser and I'm grateful to all of you for
being a part of it, but I want you to know that part of my agenda,
indeed the first bill that I will send to the United States
Congress as president is the McCain-Feingold campaign reform
measure,'' Gore said at a San Francisco reception.
</P>
<P>
   It's an occasionally awkward scene with Gore at top-dollar
dinners and cocktail parties as controversy swirls around him. A
recommendation has been sent to Attorney General Janet Reno that an
independent counsel be named to look into Gore's fund-raising
practices in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has rejected that suggestion and on Friday
made public an April 18 interview with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides said they never considered cutting back on the
events, at least until the controversy eases, and said there's
nothing wrong with arguing against soft money while raising a ton
of that cash.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you argue for it on the campaign trail you should argue for
it in these settings,'' said spokesman Chris Lehane. ''Most of
these people who show up at these events believe in it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said the current round of money events had been scheduled
for weeks, and scrubbing them wouldn't be fair to the DNC. ''These
have been on the schedule for a long, long time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore routinely argues that backers of campaign finance reform
must live by the rules in place, until they can change the rules.
</P>
<P>
   He made that point in Denver, where donors paid $10,000 each for
a grilled steak and a garlic mashed potato dish. With candles
flickering in an elegant tent, and waiters pouring pricey wines to
local dignitaries Gore forged ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's some irony in me talking about that at a fund-raising
event, but I'm going to do that,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Greens Party Backs Nuclear Shutdown  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Germany's Greens party has endorsed a hard-won
government deal to shut down the nation's 19 nuclear power plants
despite cries of betrayal by many activists who wanted a quicker
phaseout.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Friday at a Greens congress in the western city of
Muenster bolstered the stability of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's
government. The Greens, the junior partner in the 20-month-old
coalition, have pushed for the ''nuclear exit.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder and utility executives agreed last week on a formula
to phase out the nuclear plants by about 2021 -- a deal endorsed by
Environment Minister Juergen Trittin of the Greens even though his
party had wanted the shutdowns to occur at least two years faster.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders, including Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer,
pleaded with delegates to back the deal, insisting the Greens
should take pride in reaching a goal pursued since their founding
two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course we want more. But we won't get more,'' Fischer
shouted in a speech interrupted by jeers and whistles from
hard-line anti-nuclear activists. ''I'm so fed up with this party
always tearing itself down.''
</P>
<P>
   Calls by some Greens for renegotiating the nuclear pullout were
''ridiculous,'' he said, and quibbling about details of the accord
was ''small-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegates voted 433-227 for a proposal by the party leadership
to accept the compromise. Rejection would have cast serious doubt
on the future of the coalition, led by Schroeder's Social
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many delegates objected to the deal, which sets no firm
date for ending nuclear power in Germany and left out Greens
demands for the phaseout to start before the next federal election
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a happy end for the anti-nuclear movement, it's more
like a mockery,'' said Undine von Blottnitz, a veteran campaigner
against plans for a national underground nuclear waste dump in
northern Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The largely pragmatic Greens leaders hailed the vote as a sign
of the former protest party's growing political maturity.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, delegates Saturday were to elect two new
party co-chairs and vote on changes in the Greens leadership
structure -- including a candidacy by Fischer for a seat on a new
16-member council to coordinate strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer, a former student radical turned statesman, has long
urged his party to take up new themes and run itself more
professionally, but has never run for party office.

<HEADLINE> Council Ban Prompts Russian Walkout  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council banned Yugoslavia
from participating in a debate on the Balkans, prompting a walkout
by Russia's U.N. ambassador and a bitter debate over Belgrade's
right to be heard when its leader has been indicted for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Before his dramatic exit Friday, Russia's U.N. Ambassador Sergey
Lavrov said ''gagging people's mouths'' set a dangerous precedent
and left the council's meeting without any ''practical meaning''
because a key Balkan player was not represented.
</P>
<P>
   The council's open session on the continuing threats to peace in
the Balkans was further complicated when China's deputy ambassador
walked out as NATO's former secretary-general Javier Solana started
to speak in his current job as the European Union's foreign and
security policy chief.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said Shen Guofang was apparently protesting against
NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in May 1999
during its bombing campaign to end the Serb crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo. Beijing rejects NATO insistence that the
bombing, which killed three Chinese journalists, was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Shen returned after Solana finished. Lavrov did not return. But
both countries filled their council seats with junior diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke urged council members to
exclude Yugoslavia's U.N. envoy Vladislav Jovanovic from the
debate, saying ''he represents a government whose senior leadership
has been indicted for war crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We recommend that the council state clearly and unequivocally
that it rejects the policies of hatred and war espoused by the
Belgrade regime, that it does not tolerate abuses of human rights,
and fully supports the efforts of the war crimes tribunal for
former Yugoslavia to prosecute all -- I repeat all -- of those who
have been indicted,'' Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   But the vote by the 15-member council was hardly unequivocal:
seven in favor of excluding Yugoslavia, four against and four
abstentions.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina's U.N. Ambassador Arnoldo Listre said his abstention
did not imply any support for the Belgrade regime but was based
''on serious doubts'' about the appropriateness of barring
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Lavrov reminded council members that under the U.N.
Charter, even a state that is not a U.N. member has a right to
participate when it is a party to a situation under discussion in
the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ''A very dangerous precedent has thus been created when states
that are unpalatable for political reasons are being isolated from
participation in the work of the United Nations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's envoy has spoken at Security Council meetings both
before and shortly after last year's indictment of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic on war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav envoy Jovanovic called the split vote ''a moral
victory ... and a confirmation that U.S. policy of aggression
against Yugoslavia ... is in conflict with the majority of
countries in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, Holbrooke raised the issue of Yugoslavia's U.N.
membership as another reason for its exclusion. Since 1992 when
four of its six constituent republics declared their independence,
Yugoslavia's membership has been in dispute and it has been
suspended from the General Assembly until its status is cleared.
</P>
<P>
   The procedural vote on Yugoslavia overshadowed the briefing by
Carl Bildt, the special envoy to the Balkans of Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, who warned that if international peacekeeping troops
left the Balkans today, there would ''in all probability be war
tomorrow.''

<HEADLINE> Records of Bush Guard Serive Sought  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush's campaign workers have
concluded that no documents exist showing he reported for duty as
ordered in Alabama with the Texas Air National Guard in 1972. They
are looking for people who served with him to verify his story that
he did.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Bush's Republican presidential
campaign, said he reviewed another 200-page packet of documents
last week from the National Guard's records repository in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have read it, and there is nothing earth-shattering,'' he
said. The campaign was looking for payroll records that would show
Bush reported for duty with the Guard in Montgomery, Ala., while
working on the unsuccessful Senate campaign of former Postmaster
General Winton Blount.
</P>
<P>
   The new records were mostly duplicates of documents obtained by
the campaign from the Texas National Guard headquarters in Austin
about 18 months ago. ''The official records were either lost or
misplaced or not filled out correctly or not deposited. We are not
sure,'' Bartlett said.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Trinidad, freedom of information officer for the Air
Reserve Personnel Center in Denver, said the military does not
retain the sort of records Bush campaign officials are seeking.
</P>
<P>
   ''His payroll records are not here,'' Trinidad said.
</P>
<P>
   The military saves only the most important personnel records for
50 years. Less important documents, including check stubs, are
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning in Tuscaloosa, Ala., on Friday, was asked at a
news conference about his 1972 Alabama service. His commitment to
the Texas Guard was adjusted to let him serve with the Alabama
Guard during Blount's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was there on a temporary assignment and fulfilled my
weekends at one period of time,'' Bush said. ''I made up some
missed weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't remember what I did, but I wasn't flying because they
didn't have the same airplanes. I fulfilled my obligations,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding on Bush's remarks later, campaign spokesman Ari
Fleischer quoted Bush as saying he did ''paper shuffling'' in
Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   ''He thinks it was desk work,'' said Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett said the campaign is now focusing its attention on
trying to locate people who served with Bush in late 1972 in the
187th Tactical Reconnaissance Group in the Alabama capital.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was surprised in late May when retired Gen. William
Turnipseed said Bush did not report to him, although the young
airman was required to do so. His orders, dated Sept. 15, 1972,
said: ''Lieutenant Bush should report to Lt. Col. William
Turnipseed, DCO, to perform equivalent training.''
</P>
<P>
   ''To my knowledge, he never showed up,'' Turnipseed said last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Bush served as a pilot in the Texas Air National Guard from May
1968 to October 1973, primarily flying F-102 fighter-interceptors
at Ellington Air Force Base, south of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   He received a three-month transfer to Alabama to work as
political director of Blount's Senate campaign. Blount, postmaster
general from 1968-71, was a friend of Bush's father, former
President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Bartlett said Bush remembers meeting Turnipseed and
performing drills in Montgomery sporadically during the campaign
and more frequently after the election in November and December.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush specifically remembers pulling duty in Alabama
at the end of the campaign,'' Bartlett said.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reviewed nearly 200 pages of Bush's
military records released by the National Guard Bureau in
Arlington, Va. They contained no evidence that Bush reported for
duty in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Stein, a political science professor at Rice University in
Houston, said the gap in the military record will become an issue
only if Bush's story changes.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's avoidance of the draft did not hurt him in his
1992 election campaign against Bush's father, a decorated World War
II veteran and the incumbent president, so a gap in Bush's military
records will not matter, Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is just not an issue, unless the very act of asking the
question forces the candidate to deceive or to lie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was honorably discharged to reserve duty in October 1973 to
attend Harvard Business School. He left the Guard for good in
November 1974, records obtained by the AP show.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Troy Glaus hit two home runs estimated at
a combined 878 feet and the Anaheim Angels also got solo homers
from Tim Salmon and Bengie Molina as they rallied past the
Minnesota Twins 8-3 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Seth Etherton (3-1) won his third straight start,
allowing three runs and six hits in 6 2-3 innings, the longest of
his six major league starts.
</P>
<P>
   David Ortiz got Minnesota's big hit, a two-run homer in a
three-run second that also included a wild pitch with Corey Koskie
on third.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Ryan (0-1), making his season debut, gave up five runs --
three earned -- and five hits in three innings. He had gone 7-0 for
the Twins' Triple-A team at Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon led off the third with a 427-foot drive to center for his
17th homer this season and 213th of his career. One out later,
Glaus hit a 443-homer into the left-field bleachers for a 5-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus led off the seventh against Johan Santana with a 435-foot
drive to center, his 22nd homer.
</P>
<P>
   Two pitches later, Molina hit his sixth homer and second in two
nights. It was the eighth time this season that the Angels have hit
at least four homers in a game. The club record of nine times was
set in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim tied the score with a three-run second, aided by
shortstop Christian Guzman's one-out fielding error by on a routine
grounder by Glaus. Adam Kennedy hit a two-run triple, his fifth of
the season, and scored on Bengie Gil's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Angels RHP Jason Vickson decided Friday to have
season-ending arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder next
Tuesday. ... Glaus needs five home runs in the next 16 games to
break Leon Wagner's franchise record of 25 homers before the
All-Star break, set in 1962. Wagner played his home games that year
at Dodger Stadium. ... No Angels starter has allowed more than four
earned runs in any of the team's last 16 games. ... Gil was a late
addition to the Angels' lineup after SS Kevin Stocker was scratched
because of a sore left knee.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire passed Mike Schmidt with his 549th
homer and Craig Paquette followed the second rain delay of extra
innings with a three-run homer as the St. Louis Cardinals beat the
Los Angeles Dodgers 9-6 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The first delay lasted 22 minutes and came before J.D. Drew's
game-tying, two-out single in the 11th.
</P>
<P>
   The second lasted 19 minutes with runners on first and second
and one out in the 12th. Paquette, who also had the game-winning
single in the ninth Thursday, then connected off Jeff Shaw (2-4)
for his seventh homer, giving the NL Central leader its ninth
victory in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes after the game ended, another downpour scattered
what fans remained.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire tied Barry Bonds for the major league lead with his 27th
homer, connecting on a 1-1 pitch from Matt Herges leading off the
eighth, a drive to straightaway center estimated at 411 feet.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit No. 548 Thursday against the Giants' Shawn Estes,
and has hit four homers in his last six games. Up next is Reggie
Jackson at 563.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Stechschulte (1-0), called up earlier in the day to replace
the injured Jesse Orosco, allowed two walks in two scoreless
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Paul LoDuca, who entered as a pinch runner in the ninth, homered
off Dave Veres leading off the 11th to put the Dodgers ahead 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Green's three-run homer off Matt Morris in the top of the
eighth had given the Dodgers a 5-4 lead. Green has reached base in
54 consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield homered for his fourth straight game, giving him
eight in 10 games and 25 this season. Adrian Beltre also homered
for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Benes struck out 10 for the third straight game, and Drew
also had a two-run homer and threw out a runner at the plate for
the Cardinals, who lost for only the third time in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Benes allowed five hits in seven innings, striking out his last
batters and retiring the final nine. Of the staff-high 19 homers
Benes has allowed, 13 have come with the bases empty.
</P>
<P>
   Drew's 12th homer in the fifth of Chan Ho Park snapped a 2-2
tie. He also had a perfect one-hop relay to the plate on Park's
two-out hit in the fourth to easily throw out Beltre. In the top of
the 12th, he robbed Gilbert of extra bases with a diving catch in
right center.
</P>
<P>
   Park, who allowed four runs and four hits in six innings, had
won his previous five starts. He walked his first three batters he
faced, complaining about footing on the rubber, and McGwire
followed with a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Dodgers C Todd Hundley (rib cage) began a rehab assignment
Friday night at Triple-A Albuquerque. Barring a setback, he is
expected to rejoin the Dodgers at home on Monday. ... The Cardinals
lead the major leagues with 123 homers. ... Sheffield had 25 hit in
his last 49 at-bats with eight homers, five doubles, 18 RBIs and 16
runs. ... Mike Piazza had the previous best Dodgers' home-run total
before the All-Star break, hitting 24 in 1996.

<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- David Bell hit a two-run homer and Alex Rodriguez
had a two-run double in a four-run fifth inning Friday night as the
Seattle Mariners beat Baltimore 8-3, the Orioles' seventh loss in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   With its fourth straight win, Seattle moved to a season-best 11
games over .500. Baltimore, matching its longest losing streak this
year, fell to a season-worst 11 games below .500.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Meche (4-4) won his fourth straight decision, including
three since coming off the disabled list June 13 because of arm
problems. Scott Erickson (4-4), who may be on the trading block,
lost for the fourth time in five decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 2-0, the Mariners struck for four runs with two out in
the fifth. John Mabry singled and Bell followed with his fourth
homer of the season. Rickey Henderson then walked, Stan Javier
singled, Henderson stole third, and Rodriguez's second double of
the game drove in both runners.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, the Mariners scored four more runs. Tom Lampkin
and Mabry had RBI doubles, Henderson singled in a run and John
Olerud was walked by Cruz Molina with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Conine drove in a run with a single in the fourth and Mike
Bordick had an RBI single in the fifth for Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Meche was taken out with an 8-2 lead after six innings. He gave
up two runs on six hits and a walk, while striking out four.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson was pulled after giving up three hits, two of them
doubles, to open the sixth. He surrendered seven runs on nine hits
and two walks.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Surhoff had an RBI single in the eighth to extend his
hitting streak to 17 games.
Notes: Orioles 3B Cal Ripken was given the night off by manager
Mike Hargrove because of his sore back. Hargrove used him as his DH
Thursday night. Hargrove said before the game that Ripken, 39, will
play Saturday and Sunday. Ripken underwent back surgery last
September. ... The Orioles, who have baseball's fourth highest
payroll at $81.5 million, have the worst road record in the majors
at 10-29, including seven losses in a row and 12 defeats in 13
games. ... Baltimore is 0-5 at Safeco Field. ... The Mariners sent
nine men to plate in the fifth and 10 in the sixth. ... Rodriguez's

<HEADLINE> Athletics 10, Royals 6  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- In the space of six pitches, the Oakland
Athletics showed why they're the hottest team in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Velarde, Jason Giambi and Ben Grieve hit consecutive
homers in the second inning and the A's won their ninth straight
game, defeating the Kansas City Royals 10-6 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland, which is 16-3 in June, has its longest winning streak
since a 10-game run in September 1992. The A's have scored 80 runs
in their last seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde hit his sixth homer of the season with one out in the
second off Royals starter Chad Durbin (1-3). Giambi hit his 21st
two pitches later, and Grieve hit his 14th -- his seventh in the
last 10 games -- three pitches after that.
</P>
<P>
   The A's scored four in the first on a two-run single by Grieve
and RBI singles by Jeremy Giambi and Eric Chavez, who agreed before
the game to an $11.75 million, four-year contract extension through
2004.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Giambi also had an RBI double in the seventh. Terrence
Long added an RBI single in the fifth and an RBI double in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Appier (8-3), who spent the first decade of his major
league career with the Royals before being traded to the A's last
July, allowed five runs and eight hits in 6 1-3 innings. He has won
his last five decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Jermaine Dye and Greg Zaun had RBI doubles for the Royals, who
have lost three straight and nine of their last 11 games. Zaun and
Rey Sanchez added RBI singles, and Joe Randa had two sacrifice
flies.
</P>
<P>
   Durbin got pounded for the second time this season at the
Oakland Coliseum, allowing seven runs on seven hits in two innings.
On May 16, Durbin allowed five runs and four hits while getting
just one out in a start at Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Durbin was recalled from Omaha of the Pacific Coast League on
Thursday night. He had been sent down to Omaha following that start
against the A's on May 16.
</P>
<P>
Notes: It was the seventh time in Oakland history the A's have hit
back-to-back-to-back homers, and the second time this season. The
A's also had three consecutive homers on June 16 at Kansas City
when Chavez, Miguel Tejada and Ramon Hernandez pulled off the feat.
... The A's have hit back-to-back homers nine times this season,
and seven of those have come against the Royals. ... Dye had two
doubles in the game, giving him 23 this season. ... Jason Giambi,
who came into the game tied for second in the AL with 70 RBIs, has
20 RBIs in his last 14 games. He went 3-for-3 Friday with two
walks, and now leads the AL with 67 walks. ... Long extended his
hitting streak to 12 games. ... The Royals have been outscored
93-49 by the A's in 10 games this season. ... Kansas City has
allowed a major league worst 124 homers this season. ... Kansas
City is just 11-20 against AL West teams this season. The Royals
have winning records against the other two divisions, as well as in
interleague play.

<HEADLINE> Ringling Circus Has Black Ringmaster  </HEADLINE>
By JAMIE STENGLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- As a little boy in New York,
Johnathan Lee Iverson would make his own costumes, line up a few
friends and put on a show for mom.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson's garb is a little more elaborate these days, his
friends bring animals along and instead of just his mother, ''The
Greatest Show On Earth,'' draws thousands of people each night.
</P>
<P>
   At 24, he is the youngest ringmaster for the Ringling Bros. and
Barnum and Bailey Circus -- and the show's first black man to
introduce children of all ages to the fantasy world of trapeze
artists, wild animals and death-defying feats.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see a big deal about it,'' Iverson said. ''If I were,
like, lime green, I could see the point of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like performing in anything else -- except your co-workers
are clowns and elephants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although circuses have long used performers of varying
nationalities, there were rarely blacks under the big top, said
Fred Dahlinger, director of collections and research at the Circus
World Museum in Baraboo, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been black perfomers in circus history back to the
1810s, but never in large numbers,'' he said. And even in the
audience, blacks used to be segregated from whites.
</P>
<P>
   Circuses in America date to 1768, Dahlinger said. Early on,
blacks were used as horse riders and animal trainers, but in the
mid-1900s the number of blacks in circuses declined. In the 1960s,
Ringling had troupes of black unicyclists and aerielists, but that
was about it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Philip McKinley, who discovered Iverson at a Wisconsin dinner
theater, said he was looking for a showman; race didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm always moved by talent first, all the rest is secondary,''
said McKinley, who is Ringling's director. ''In the world of the
circus, we're all multicultural anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Dahlinger said, multiculturalism usually refers only to
Europeans and Asians.
</P>
<P>
   ''Blacks are probably the least represented as far as the
numbers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, an Atlanta-based circus founded in 1996
features mostly performers of black and Hispanic descent.
UniverSoul Circus spokeswoman Paula Witt said the group wanted
children of color to see performers who look like them.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an urban circus,'' she said. ''It's not your traditional
circus.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson gave his first public performance at age 11 with the
Boys Choir of Harlem. He attended the Fiorello H. La Guardia High
School of Music and Art and Performing Arts in Manhattan (the
''Fame'' school) before heading to Connecticut's Hartt School of
Music, where he graduated in voice.
</P>
<P>
   McKinley discovered Iverson in Fort Atkinson, Wis., where
McKinley was directing a dinner theater Christmas show during the
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't think I'd be good at it, because I didn't think I was
the 'Ladies and Gentlemen type,''' Iverson said.
</P>
<P>
   But McKinley saw how Iverson, who stands at 6-foot-3, would fit
into the spangling red vest and black topcoat that marks him as the
leader of the show.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he walked in the door I knew there was something special
about him,'' McKinley said. ''The first thing I noticed about him
was his manner, then he opened his mouth and sang and it was
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinley had his proof at Iverson's first rehearsal with the
circus: the sound of Iverson's voice brought the practice to a
halt.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even the animals stopped and were listening,'' McKinley said.
''It was just kind of a peaceable kingdom moment that's frozen in
my mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''The company came onto the floor and stopped and applauded,''
he said. ''That doesn't happen in the circus.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson is in his second full year as ringmaster and has signed
on for another stint as ''the fantasy guy ... who guides you into
this big fantasy world.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't say 'The Greatest Show on Earth' as a catchphrase,''
he said. ''That's why people come. Where else are you going to find
greatness for 10 bucks?''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Iverson, a postal worker from New York, said her son was
an entertainer from the moment he was born.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a natural gift of his,'' she said. ''He would dress up as
some type of performer and put on a show. He would say, 'Mommy, I
have to perform.'''
</P>
<P>
   When her son was 7, he asked for money to go to the newsstand
and instead of a comic book, he returned clutching a show business
paper with advertisements for actors.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'See Mom, they want actors, you should sign me up,'''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   On March 26, 1999, when the circus was in New York, Iverson's
father, a fireman, died of a heart attack just three hours before
he was set to see his son perform.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't tell him till after the show,'' his mother said.
Iverson stayed with the circus after hearing the news.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'The show has to go on.'''

<HEADLINE> China Wary of Demands on WTO Terms  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- China has cautioned World Trade Organization
members against making ''unrealistic requests'' to Beijing as
negotiations for its entry to the global body near conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   China's chief WTO negotiator, Long Yongtu, said Friday he was
concerned about requests from a few members and urged those ''whose
priority interests have already been satisfied in bilateral
negotiations not to raise unrealistic requests at this final
stage.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We will never accept further requests that China should
undertake obligations exceeding those for ordinary WTO members, nor
will we allow the rights that we should enjoy to be impaired or
even deprived,'' he said in an address to the WTO working group on
Chinese entry.
</P>
<P>
   Long later declined to give details of the countries or requests
involved.
</P>
<P>
   China has already secured crucial agreements with the United
States and the European Union on joining the 137-member
organization that sets world trade rules.
</P>
<P>
   It has yet to clinch bilateral deals for its entry with
Switzerland, Mexico, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Ecuador. Long said
Friday it has finished negotiations with Costa Rica and ''basically
accomplished'' them with Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   ''The process is under control,'' Long said after the meeting of
the working group drawing up the agreement for China's entry. But
he declined to say whether he thought China would become a WTO
member this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a new sense of momentum,'' said Pierre-Louis Girard,
chairman of the working group. The group meets again next month.
</P>
<P>
   As for the outstanding bilateral agreements, ''it is expected
that these can be wrapped up and deals submitted in the coming
weeks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has been in negotiations for 14 years to join the WTO
and its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

<HEADLINE> Police Seek Man Seen Near Hostel  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS PASSA
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHILDERS, Australia (AP) -- Police were searching Saturday for a
man seen just outside a backpackers' hostel just before a fire
swept through the building, killing 15 young travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Police, however, stopped short of saying arson was the cause of
the blaze, which broke out after midnight early Friday in the
Palace hostel and quickly engulfed the two-story wooden building
where more than 80 backpackers were staying.
</P>
<P>
   As the survivors, most in their teens and 20s, set out flowers
and memorials to the victims, the first of the bodies was found on
the hostel's ground floor and removed. Forensic teams were waiting
for safety clearance to search the fire-gutted second floor, where
most of the victims are thought to be located.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Supt. Ken Benjamin said police were looking to interview
Robert Paul Long, 37, who was known to have frequented the Palace
hostel and was seen there Thursday night shortly before the fire.
</P>
<P>
   There have been reports that a man was ejected from the hostel a
week ago and made threats to several women at the hostel in the
days leading up to the fire. Benjamin, who earlier said police were
investigating the reports, did not say if Long was that man.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have issued a bulletin to police forces around the country
to see if we can find him,'' said Benjamin. ''We don't know where
he is at the present time, but we strongly believe he was at the
hostel before the fire started and that he can help us with our
inquiries.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior police said it was too early to assign a cause for the
fire, but they said they did not rule out arson.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze broke out in the back of the ground floor of the
100-year-old former pub, that had been transformed into a hostel 18
months ago on the main street of Childers, a town of 1,500,
Benjamin said.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy residents of the hostel escaped the fire. Ten of those
suffered minor injuries, most as they attempted to escape from the
upper level by jumping onto the roofs of nearby buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Police had earlier said three people were missing, but Saturday
said the 15 dead and those known to have escaped accounted for all
guests registered at the hostel.
</P>
<P>
   Dental records would be needed to help identify some of the
bodies, police said. The victims included seven people from the
United Kingdom, three from the Netherlands, three from Australia
and one each from South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin said it could be Sunday before all the victims' bodies
were removed from the hostel. The hostel's top floor was draped
with orange and yellow tarpaulins as teams worked to stabilize the
structure.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the victims had come to this town, situated 195 miles
north of the Queensland state capital of Brisbane, to pick fruit at
local farms to make some extra money on their travels around
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   A picnic bench in front of the hostel has become a shrine to the
dead backpackers. On Saturday, about 20 survivors gathered with a
Roman Catholic priest at the bench for an impromptu memorial
service.
</P>
<P>
   Among the carnations, roses and other flowers were
hand-scribbled notes in memory of the victims and a bunch of
bananas from one of the local fruit farms.
</P>
<P>
   One of the survivors, Leita Grindley of Britain, 19, remembered
waking in the middle of the night surrounded by flames.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just dread to think what those other people went through,''
said Grindley. ''I honestly didn't think I was going to make it out
of there.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin said investigations were continuing into reports that a
former resident of the hostel known to local townspeople may have
deliberately set the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those claims are all being looked into, but we have nothing
concrete to report at this time,'' said Benjamin. ''Any rumors or
allegations out there right now are just that.''
</P>
<P>
   Childers resident Shaune Hardy said he heard that a man had
threatened hostel guests.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were threatened that he'd come back and burn the place,''
Hardy said.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency officials have been inundated with calls from anxious
parents. Police asked all foreign backpackers in Australia to
telephone their families.
</P>
<P>
   Many survivors were taking sanctuary Saturday in Childers' local
cultural center, where they could send e-mails to their families
overseas and where counselors offered support.

<HEADLINE> Relatives Keep Up Fight For Elian  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME HERNANDEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Relatives of Elian Gonzalez are vowing to continue
their battle to keep the 6-year-old in the United States despite a
federal court decision that brings him one step closer to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are confident they are doing the right thing. They will
keep fighting for what his mom died for,'' Armando Gutierrez,
spokesman for the boy's Miami relatives, said Friday after the
12-member 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied a request for a
custody rehearing and emphatically said it would not look at the
case again.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any further requests for stays or for injunctive relief should
be directed to the Supreme Court,'' said the ruling, written by
Circuit Judge J.L. Edmondson. He said the appeals court will not
grant any further motions for a stay -- even putting the word
''not'' in boldface and large letters.
</P>
<P>
   The court said its earlier stay requiring Elian's father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, to keep Elian in the United States will dissolve
at 4 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Gregory Craig, attorney for Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
said he would meet with his client over the weekend to talk about
his plans for the coming week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Juan Miguel is grateful that the 11th Circuit has denied the
petition for the hearing and has lifted all stays and all
injunctions as of Wednesday afternoon of next week,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said: ''Now that the court has
conclusively upheld our decision, I am hopeful that this father and
son will soon be able to move on with their lives together.''
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the Atlanta-based court had ruled against
the relatives earlier this month. The decision to grant a rehearing
before the full court had to be approved by seven of the 12 judges;
none of the 12 even asked for a vote on the question.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez said the relatives will file an appeal with the U.S.
Supreme Court on Monday. Although the Supreme Court hears about 1
percent of the appeals it received, he said the family is not
daunted by the long odds.
</P>
<P>
   ''The family is very hopeful God will save Elian,'' the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the nine Supreme Court justices must agree to hear an
appeal. A single justice can grant a stay, or can opt to refer the
question of a stay to the full court. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy is
the justice assigned to hear emergency matters from the 11th
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued off the Florida coast on Thanksgiving Day
after his mother and 10 other people drowned when their boat sank
en route from communist Cuba to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives argue that the three-judge panel was wrong
to uphold an Immigration and Naturalization Service decision that
Elian should return to Cuba with his father. They said INS
decisions are not necessarily law and can be overturned by the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   But Bernard Perlmutter, a University of Miami law professor,
said it is highly unlikely that the Supreme Court would overturn
the appellate decision or even grant a hearing. He said the 11th
Circuit's earlier decision was based on a Supreme Court decision in
another case and it is not likely to reverse its course.
</P>
<P>
   ''The family should recognize that there is no purpose to any
further appeals and that to prolong this process is to engage in an
exercise in futility,'' Perlmutter said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of protesters Friday night gathered outside the
relatives' Little Havana home where Elian lived before he was
seized by federal agents April 22 and reunited with his father in
the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   ''This country is a disgrace,'' said Reinaldo Martinez, a Miami
painter who arrived within an hour of the court decision. ''This
entire case has been a theater between Clinton and the Cuban
government.''
</P>
<P>
   ''All Cubans have been betrayed,'' said Ana Terasa Bonnin,
another demonstrator. ''I am praying very hard for the appeal to go
through. I hope it's God's will for this child to stay here.''

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Poll Watchers Abducted  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- For the first time since independence,
Zimbabweans are faced with a real opportunity to change the face of
their government when they cast votes in two-day parliamentary
elections beginning Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But after months of political violence and intimidation, many of
the country's 5.1 million registered voters may fear ruling party
retribution if they vote for the opposition -- or if they vote at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ''Zimbabweans are really torn between hope and fear,'' said
Alfred Nhema, head of the political science department at the
University of Zimbabwe at Harare.
</P>
<P>
   The polls opened Saturday morning with lines of 50-100 people
waiting outside several voting sites. First results were expected
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy suffering its worst economic crisis ever,
conditions were ripe for the first serious challenge to President
Robert Mugabe's ruling Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic
Front party since it led the country to independence from
white-minority rule in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Though the 9-month-old opposition Movement for Democratic Change
has never been tested in an election, a recent poll showed them
winning 70 of the 120 seats being contested. But the party would
need at least 76 seats to have a majority, because Mugabe appoints
the remaining 30 seats in the 150-member parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe, whose term lasts two more years, is not on the ballot.
But the opposition tapped into strong voter anger with Mugabe when
it helped successfully campaign for the defeat of a February
referendum on a new constitution supported by the ruling party --
the party's first electoral defeat ever.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, more than 30 people have been killed and thousands
more injured in a wave of political violence that has been blamed
largely on ruling party militants. Many opposition candidates
campaigned surreptitiously for fear of retribution. Others fled
their districts altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups and opposition politicians worry about the
effectiveness of a campaign they say was largely intended to
frighten opposition supporters from going to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ''Already it's been unfair ... because the method of campaigning
has been so ruthless,'' said Koomalo Zwelithin, a 25-year-old
English teacher at Gloag middle school, about 200 miles southwest
of Harare, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its campaign, the government has held back teachers'
annual raises until after the election, Zwelithin said. But the
promise of a paltry salary increase will not affect his vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''All we're interested in is democracy. We want political
change, not just hazy economic change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This defiant attitude manifested itself in small ways through
the waning days of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The letters MDC were chalked on streets and painted on signposts
throughout the countryside. A guard at the State House
surreptitiously reciprocated when a young boy flashed him the
open-palm symbol of the MDC.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Schori, the leader of the European Union's 173-person
observer mission here, said Friday that he considered turnout the
most important factor in the election.
</P>
<P>
   In the last parliamentary election, in 1995, only 29 percent of
voters cast ballots. But that was a different era, when the country
had no serious alternative to Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   The political situation in the country has undergone a near
revolution since then, Nhema said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the past there was this mentality of boycotting the
elections,'' Nhema said. Now, ''people are excited about being
given an alternative voice.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Politicians Make Last Appeal  </HEADLINE>
By GARY SCHAEFER
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori made his final appeal
to voters Saturday before lower house elections, presenting his
three-party ruling coalition as a bastion of stability that would
power the economy into recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-day campaign before Sunday's vote to fill the 480 seats
in Japan's more powerful lower house of parliament has focused on
competing proposals for mending the troubled economy.
</P>
<P>
   Mori, head of the Liberal Democratic Party, has pushed hard on
the theme of stability. The government's two-year effort to jog the
economy out of the doldrums with massive fiscal spending is slowly
starting to show results.
</P>
<P>
   Electing the fractured opposition would put those gains in
jeopardy, Mori said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only choice is the coalition,'' he said during a campaign
stop in Yokohama, outside Tokyo. ''When political alliances come
and go, it's the people who end up suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeal appeared to be working. Recent polls suggested the
LDP was set to retain its grip on power, which it has relinquished
only briefly in the last 45 years. Newspapers show the LDP winning
241 to 263 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those numbers, there were some wild cards that could tip
the balance. A large chunk of voters was undecided in the approach
to the election, and surveys suggested turnout would be high --
meaning a larger anti-government vote.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition has focused on the downside of the government's
spending campaign: the ballooning public debt, which now totals
more than 130 percent of the country's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   The LDP wants to continue spending until the economy is firmly
in recovery, then start worrying about the deficit. The biggest
opposition party, the Democrats, however, are calling for a tax
increase to shore up the country's finances.
</P>
<P>
   Yukio Hatoyama, leader of the Democrats, urged Japanese while
campaigning near Osaka, western Japan, to vote for change.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want people to stand up and make their voices heard by
casting a vote,'' he was quoted as saying by Kyodo News agency.
</P>
<P>
   Mori also suffers from sinking support ratings for his Cabinet,
and has stirred controversy with several verbal gaffes.
</P>
<P>
   He was forced to apologize last month after he called Japan a
''divine country centered on the emperor'', conjuring up memories
of Japan's wartime emperor-worship. Mori came under fire days ago
for saying that undecided voters should stay home on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Mori's mistakes have provided ammunition for the divided
opposition parties, which agree on little more than disagreeing
with the government. But the opposition's lack of unity is also a
liability.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' proposal to cut public debt by lowering the
minimum tax bracket may not win many votes, Keiko Higuchi, a
professor at Tokyo Kasei University, said Saturday on Nippon TV.
</P>
<P>
   ''To ask people to take bitter medicine, you have to be a doctor
they can trust,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese also were disappointed that other issues received
little or no attention from candidates. The national Mainichi
newspaper, for example, said the financially troubled national
insurance system had been largely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The vote follows two months of political turmoil. Mori took over
on April 5 after then-Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi suffered a stroke
and fell into a coma. Obuchi died on May 14, and the government was
widely criticized for delays in announcing his illness to the
nation.

<HEADLINE> Despite jump in city reading scores, math numbers barely improve  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - City students improved only slightly on a
citywide mathematics test this year than last, with 67 percent
still failing to meet the Board of Education's standards.
</P>
<P>
   The increase of about one percentage point for third, fifth,
sixth and seventh graders contrasted sharply with the jump in
reading scores - more than five percentage points - released two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy issued a brief written
statement Friday in which he called the results ''disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the first year New York City adopted the state's method
of scoring and reporting standardized tests. The scoring is now
based on whether students achieve proficiency in the skills
demanded by the new state and city learning standards, rather than
on how city students compare with a fluctuating national average.
</P>
<P>
   Scores on the tests are grouped into four levels. On this year's
tests, which were taken in May, roughly 7,000 fewer students scored
in the lowest level than in 1999. The percentage of students in
that lowest level dropped to 30.8 percent, from 33.9 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
   While all of the city's 32 community districts posted gains on
the citywide reading test this year, only 24 of those districts saw
their math scores improve.
</P>
<P>
   District 26 in Queens posted the highest percentage of passing
students with 71.6 percent meeting the standards. Manhattan's
District 2 had the next best passing rate, with 61.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   District 85 - which is made up of schools taken over by the
chancellor because of poor performance - scored a 12.8 percent
passing rate. The lowest passing percentage for a complete school
district came in Manhattan's District 5, where 13.2 percent of
students met the standards.

<HEADLINE> Asian long-horned beetle is back, this time on the Lower East Side  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - It's back!
</P>
<P>
   The Asian long-horned beetle has reared it's ugly head again,
this time in a lower Manhattan playground.
</P>
<P>
   The insect, which weakens and eventually kills trees, was first
found in Brooklyn in 1996, and turned up last year in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest outbreak, beetles were found in three of 36 trees
in the Luther Gulick playground at Columbia and Delancey streets.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing you can do is chop down the tree, chip the wood
into tiny pieces and burn it,'' Parks Commissioner Henry Stern said
Friday. Stern sad the beetle has not been detected in Central Park,
but warned that more outbreaks were likely.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four years, more than 2,600 infested trees in
Brooklyn, Queens and upper Manhattan have been chopped down.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said early detection had helped contain the beetle.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to prevent the spread of disease,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bug burrows holes into the bark of trees, laying eggs in the
holes. The hatched larvae then burrow deeper, into the heartwood of
trees. When they reach adulthood, the beetles then dig there way
back out through the tree. Trees weaken and eventually die from
infestation.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces New Website  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A new computer system will offer one-stop
shopping for online information about the federal government,
President Clinton said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Logging on to one Web site, firstgov.gov, will yield links to
all federal information available publicly over the Internet,
Clinton said during a special ''Webcast'' that is similar to his
weekly radio addresses.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it's complete, firstgov will serve as a single point of
entry to one of the largest, perhaps the most useful collection of
Web pages in the entire world,'' Clinton said during the Web
speech, taped in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which should be up and running within 90 days, will
also offer individuals, small businesses and others a single source
for information about roughly $500 billion in government grants and
contract opportunities, the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether you want crucial information in starting a small
business, or you want to track your Social Security benefits, you
can do it all in one place, 24 hours a day, seven days a week,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The system is being developed by private sources and will be
given to the government at no cost.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will uphold the highest standards for protecting the
privacy of its users,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The site now features information about the coming service.
</P>
<P>
   The president also announced a competition for new ideas in
electronic government service. The nonprofit Council for Excellence
in Government will award up to $50,000 for the best ideas, he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks More For Drug Plan  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Armed with new estimates of soaring budget
surpluses, President Clinton is sweetening his proposal to help the
elderly pay for prescription drugs while branding a competing
Republican plan unworkable.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address Saturday, Clinton said he will
propose offering the benefit in 2002, a year earlier than
originally planned, and capping the annual drug cost for Medicare
patients at $4,000. He had not spelled out the extent of coverage
for ''catastrophic'' drug bills before.
</P>
<P>
   The president plans to send the revised program to Congress in
the next week, and will propose spending an extra $58 billion over
10 years to cover the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the money to do this now and do it right,'' Clinton
said. ''We should use a part of our hard-earned budget surplus to
meet America's most pressing priorities, like paying down the
national debt, strengthening Medicare and providing a prescription
drug benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House now estimates the plan would cost $253 billion
over 10 years. The estimate was about $195 billion when Clinton
laid out the plan in February.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to announce within days a colossal $1
trillion increase in projected federal surpluses. Sources have told
The Associated Press the figure would more than double, to $1.9
trillion, from the $746 billion the administration projected in
February. The figures exclude Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Announcement of an enhanced White House drug plan follows a week
of intense political maneuvering on an election-year issue
affecting 39 million elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans voted largely along party lines Thursday to
reject a Democratic plan for the drug coverage. House Republicans
muscled their own, different plan through the House Ways and Means
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP proposal calls for private insurance companies, backed
by hefty federal subsidies, to offer prescription drug coverage to
Medicare recipients nationwide. The bill includes subsidies for
low-income senior citizens, as well as those experiencing extremely
high costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic proposal would require that the government offer
a uniform prescription drug benefit under Medicare. Democrats claim
their plan offers the choice of affordable coverage to all elderly,
instead of only those deemed most needy.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats leading the effort in Congress include Sen. Bob Graham
of Florida, whose state is home to millions of retirees, and Sen.
Charles Robb of Virginia, who faces a strong re-election challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The rejected Senate plan is less generous than Clinton's, and
slightly less expensive at roughly $240 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton asked for cooperation from Congress, and said the Senate
debate offers bipartisan hope for an eventual deal.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the House GOP bill costs an estimated $40 billion
over five years.

<HEADLINE> Man lunges at police officers with ax, gets shot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Two police officers alerted to a home
break-in shot and wounded a man they said charged at them wielding
an ax over his head.
</P>
<P>
   ''Apparently, instead of putting the ax down, he brought it up
over his head and lunged toward the officers,'' said police
spokesman Sgt. Joe Sweeney. ''That's when the officers opened
fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Jennis, 40, was in fair condition at a hospital Saturday.
His injuries were not life-threatening. He faces possible weapons,
burglary and menacing charges.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the shooting appeared to be a ''completely
justified'' act of self-defense. It wasn't immediately clear how
many rounds the officers fired.
</P>
<P>
   A man and woman returning Friday evening to a house next-door to
Jennis' told police they found one of the front doors boarded over
and a sign warning that trespassers would be killed.
</P>
<P>
   Jennis then allegedly approached them holding an ax, they said.
Soon afterward, the couple called 911. When the officers showed up,
the confrontation took place outside his neighbors' house.
</P>
<P>
   Jennis has lived on the street since he was young, and neighbors
said his father died about a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   One neighbor, Larry Knickerbocker, recalled Jennis circulating a
petition about five years ago expressing concern that drug dealers
might be moving into the quiet neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was pretty hard to see a neighbor lying there,''
Knickerbocker said in Saturday's Post-Standard newspaper. ''This
was the guy who would snow-blow everybody's driveways in the
winter.''

<HEADLINE> Biopsy technique brings Canadian woman to Bridgeport  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - When Cynthia Blumenthal went for her
annual mammogram in March, it revealed a tiny lump in her left
breast.
</P>
<P>
   The lump was so small, it couldn't be detected with an
ultrasound. Using the mammogram as a guide, Blumenthal's doctor
performed a core needle biopsy, which showed she had cancer.
</P>
<P>
   When she went to see a surgeon near her home in Ottawa, Canada,
he told her she should have a lumpectomy and all the lymph nodes
under her arm removed.
</P>
<P>
   Then her cousin, an oncologist at St. Vincent's Hospital in
Bridgeport, told her she might be able to avoid having all her
nodes removed through a procedure called a sentinel node biopsy - a
relatively new technique that's being embraced by some surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   In the procedure, a radioactive isotope is injected into the
site of the tumor. The isotope then travels to the lymph node where
the tumor would be most likely to have spread. That node, called
the sentinel node, emits a radioactive signal to a Geiger
counter-like probe.
</P>
<P>
   Using the radioactive signal as a guide, the surgeon then
excises the sentinel node, which is examined in the laboratory. If
it is positive for cancer cells, all adjacent nodes are removed.
</P>
<P>
   But for many patients, the node is not cancerous, and the
procedure allows them to avoid removal of all the lymph nodes,
which can cause complications such as fluid retention, stiffness
and numbness in the affected arm.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal was all set to have the procedure done. But when she
asked her doctor about it, he said she would not be able to get it
done quickly in Canada, where it is performed in some teaching
hospitals but is still not widely available.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said it is still in the research stage and that the
surgeons are not comfortable with it yet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if she decided to have the conventional procedure - a full
node dissection - she was told she'd have to wait six weeks in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   So Blumenthal traveled about 500 miles from her home to
Bridgeport, where she had the procedure done at St. Vincent's
Medical Center within one week. Dr. Daniel Passeri, chief of
surgical oncology at St. Vincent's, performed the procedure. He
removed two suspicious nodes, but both tested negative for cancer.
Blumenthal was able to have the lumpectomy and node biopsy done on
an outpatient basis.
</P>
<P>
   ''They wanted to make sure it was localized and that it hadn't
traveled anywhere, and it hadn't,'' said Blumenthal. ''Everything
looks very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Passeri said that in most cases, if cancer has not invaded the
sentinel node, there won't be any cancer cells in any other lymph
nodes either.
</P>
<P>
   But some surgeons are still skeptical about the procedure
because of the potential dangers of missing the spread of cancer to
lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Krag, a professor of surgical oncology at the
University of Vermont who helped pioneer the technique, said much
more study is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a diagnostic procedure. The fact of the matter is
that conventional surgery of removing the lymph nodes eradicates
cancer nearly 100 percent of the time,'' Krag said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet sentinel node biopsies, which are also done for melanoma
patients, are becoming increasingly common for breast cancer
patients in the United States, according to the American Cancer
Society.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Vincent's, 40 have been done since 1998. At Bridgeport
Hospital, approximately 35 have been done since early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Smith, director of cancer screening for the American
Cancer Society, said the goal of sentinel node biopsies is to avoid
the potential post-surgical risks for breast cancer patients after
lymph nodes are removed, including lymphedema, where the arm gets
progressively bigger and patients lose mobility.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you've managed to do breast conserving therapy and tell the
patient she has outstanding prognosis ... but one arm is quite a
bit bigger than the other, then you've left her with a much more
visible sign of having had breast cancer than even if she's had her
breast removed,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's extremely traumatic and somewhat disabling as well,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, who had the procedure done in April, is now
finishing five weeks of radiation as a prophylactic measure. She
also must have regular checkups with a surgeon for the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
   Her doctor says that because of early detection, her prognosis
is excellent.
</P>
<P>
   ''She probably has a 90 percent cure rate,'' Passeri said.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal has decided to use her experience to urge women to
get regular mammograms. The American Cancer Society and the
American Medical Association recommend that women get annual
mammograms beginning at age 40.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm amazed at the number of women who are my contemporaries
who don't go for mammograms,'' Blumenthal said. ''These are
educated and professional women, but they're not going for
mammograms.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said she also is pushing the medical community in
Canada to give breast cancer treatments a high priority so women
can get procedures done quickly - whether they have a sentinel node
biopsy or a full node dissection.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just the relief that I felt it was going to be done quickly
was enormous,'' Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could have gone the other way just as easily, I think, but
the key here is early detection. I can't emphasize enough the
importance of women to get mammograms.''

<HEADLINE> Hartford police officer found guilty of perjury, drug possession  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A Hartford police officer has been
convicted of perjury and drug possession charges stemming from a
corruption probe involving eight officers.
</P>
<P>
   A six-member Superior Court jury found Officer James K. Meehan
Jr. guilty Friday of three counts of perjury, three counts of
possession of cocaine and one count of larceny.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old Meehan, who was suspended from the force after
the charges and now lives in Meriden, was one of eight police
officers- a state police trooper, five Hartford officers and two
New Britain officers, arrested in late 1994. Meehan is the son of
former Hartford assistant police chief James Meehan Sr.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan's arrest with the other officers stemmed from an 18-month
police corruption inquiry conducted by a one-man grand jury, former
Senior Superior Court Judge Arthur L. Spada, now state commissioner
of public safety.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Hartford defense attorney Michael Budlong attacked the
state's key witnesses, two drug dealers, two drug users and a
street criminal, as liars looking for leniency. But Assistant
State's Attorney Michael Gailor insisted their testimonies were
corroborated by one another, as well as by other witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Gailor relied heavily on a hair expert who found that an
examination of Meehan's hair in August 1994 showed he had been
using cocaine regularly. Budlong countered with another expert who
attacked the state's examination of Meehan's hair as outdated and
unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan's perjury convictions stemmed from charges that he lied
three times to Spada.
</P>
<P>
   His conviction came on the same day a Hartford police sergeant
was convicted of violating the civil rights of two prostitutes in a
separate police corruption probe.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Beauchamp, 35, was one of six officers indicted last year
after an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct within
the Hartford Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Beauchamp was the first of those indicted to go to trial. Four
others have pleaded guilty to similar charges. A sixth faces a
trial on civil rights charges later this summer.

<HEADLINE> State will not file criminal charges against Hartford business leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The city business leader accused of
improperly funneling state loans to his mistress will not face
criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Chief State's Attorney Chris Morano said Friday that he
would not seek an arrest warrant for Arthur Anderson, saying the
evidence did not meet the burden of proof for a criminal
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The decision means negotiations will resume to reach a monetary
settlement between Anderson and state Attorney General Richard
Blumenthal to settle civil allegations of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Morano was considering criminal charges based on a yearlong
investigation by Blumenthal, who found that Anderson had mishandled
state loans and diverted $200,000 in insurance claim money to Doris
Ford, a woman with whom Anderson had a secret relationship.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, Ford borrowed more than $600,000 to buy and
renovate four apartment buildings. The money was lent through the
Capitol Housing Finance Corp., a creation of the Hartford business
community to finance rehabilitation of low-income housing in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's company, Imagineers, was hired by CHFC to administer
the loan program. Anderson resigned last August from his position
as the program's state-appointed chief.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 and 1994, two of Ford's buildings were destroyed by
fire, resulting in more than $200,000 in insurance payoffs.
Blumenthal said Anderson let Ford keep that cash instead of making
sure it went to the state and the CHFC.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said Ford was continually in default on her CHFC
loans.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson also gave Ford more than $500,000 of his own money
between 1994 and 1998 to keep her quiet about their sexual
relationship, Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great to know the chief state's attorney has cleared
Arthur Anderson of any criminal wrongdoing,'' Anderson's lawyer,
John Droney, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Chief State's Attorney John Bailey disqualified himself from the
case Wednesday, leaving the decision to Morano. Bailey said he had
a potential conflict of interest because his condominium complex is
managed by Imagineers.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal has not taken Anderson to court, but has said he will
if Anderson does not reimburse the state for insurance money that
should have been applied against unpaid state and corporate loans
he arranged for Ford. Blumenthal has said the state should get at
least $200,000.

<HEADLINE> Family fights to change VA policy for vets' grave markers  </HEADLINE>
By CAREN BENJAMIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - When Agostino Guzzo died two years ago, his
wife Sandra made what she thought was a simple request to the
Department of Veterans Affairs: give her a grave marker to honor
his military service.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew how much having served meant to him, how much this
country meant to him,'' said Guzzo, whose husband emigrated from
Italy as a boy and joined the Army when he was 19.
</P>
<P>
   But the DVA turned her down, citing a policy dating back to the
Civil War that only allows markers or headstones for veterans in
unmarked graves.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was so surprised,'' said Guzzo, who began a quest with her
family to change the policy and gained a victory last week when the
Senate backed their effort.
</P>
<P>
   The department will give a headstone or grave marker with a
veteran's name, dates of birth and death, and military branch
affiliation to the family of any eligible veteran in an unmarked
grave in any cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Guzzo, who lived in West Hartford, Conn., and died at age 70 in
April 1998, was not eligible because he was encrypted in a
mausoleum that included his name.
</P>
<P>
   After the DVA turned down the family's request, Guzzo's son Tom
started writing letters to anyone he could think of.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got on the Internet, I talked to anyone who would talk to
me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998 he spoke with Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,
who promised to help if he was assured the bill would benefit more
than one family.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd learned the Guzzos were not a special case.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are people like them all across the country who should
be able to place their fathers, brothers and uncles in final
resting places with a clear indication they served their country.
It's the least we can do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd took on the cause but the process moved slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Guzzo pushed on, once driving to meet Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn., face-to-face to get his promise of support.
</P>
<P>
   The measure passed as an amendment to the Senate's version of
the Department of Defense Authorization Bill but still must be
squared with the House plan, which does not contain the grave
marker provision.
</P>
<P>
   The DVA has expressed some reservations about the bill, though
in general supports it.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our experience, the requirement that a veteran's grave be
unmarked is, as a practical matter, difficult to enforce and easily
circumvented,'' the department's Assistant Secretary Dennis Duffy
wrote to Senate Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Arlen Specter,
R-Penn.
</P>
<P>
   For example, families of veterans will request the markers, then
furnish their own headstone as well, Duffy said. Department rules
prohibit ''double-marked'' graves.
</P>
<P>
   The DVA opposes a section of the bill that would make it
retroactive out of concern that would overwhelm the agency's
resources. The department also opposes a provision that would allow
a marker to be placed somewhere other than a graveyard, saying it
is inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   So Sandra Guzzo waits. She has tried to hang an American flag on
her husband's mausoleum but was told by the cemetery to take it
down.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, she wrote a letter to her husband of 40 years
that was read at his funeral. She believes it explains why it is
important for her to get the marker.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to bring out what it was all about, why he was even
put on this earth, what he accomplished and didn't accomplish, just
reflecting on his life,'' she said. ''But now he's gone and this
one thing, a thing I think is very significant, is still not
finished.''

<HEADLINE> Soggy spring a blessing for TPC at River Highlands  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA TOMMELLEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROMWELL, Conn. (AP) - The soggy spring has made the greens
greener and the rough rougher at the TPC at River Highlands, and
conditions couldn't be better for the Greater Hartford Open, said
course superintendent Tom DeGrandi.
</P>
<P>
   The $2.8 million tournament, sponsored by Canon, tees off
Thursday. Pretournament activities begin Monday.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a year makes.
</P>
<P>
   DeGrandi and his 34-member grounds crew had to contend with the
drought of '99 to get the course ready in time for last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had guys who had webbed feet by the end of the year, because
that's all they did was water,'' he said Friday as staff put the
finishing touches on the course. ''We almost ran out of water. This
year we spent all of our time cutting grass. It's really been a
perfect year as far as water goes.''
</P>
<P>
   About a 6&AMP;frac12; inches of rain fell in the first three weeks of June,
well above the average of 3&AMP;frac34; inches.
</P>
<P>
   That's makes it easy for DeGrandi, but tough for the pros. The
3&AMP;frac12;-inch rough sports a healthy, thick mixture of blue fescue and
ryegrass.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest impact on the players is our density of rough,''
said DeGrandi. ''I think they're going to be very pleased with the
appearances, and those who miss the fairways, challenged to do what
they need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The field won't include Tiger Woods, but has drawn the man who
beat him earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Sutton won the Tournament Players Championship in March,
outdueling Woods down the stretch at TPC at Saw Grass in Ponte
Vedra Beach, Fla. He also led the Americans to the 1999 Ryder Cup
victory with his 3-1-1 match record.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Geiberger will try to become the first back-to-back
champion. The GHO was his first and only win on tour and he did it
in record style, setting 54 and 72 hole marks in a three-stroke
victory over Skip Kendall last year.
</P>
<P>
   The field also includes Davis Love III, Fuzzy Zoeller, Mark
Calcavecchia, Justin Leonard, Paul Azinger, Steve Jones, Billy
Andrade and Scott Hoch.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the tournament also plays into optimal conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''In New England, it doesn't get any better than the third week
of June,'' said DeGrandi, a Manchester resident.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament turns into a 24-hour job for DeGrandi, overseeing
his fourth GHO.
</P>
<P>
   ''During the tournament, I sleep here. No sense going home,'' he
said. ''My wife bought me a really cool inflatable mattress.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't mind the inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have the best job in the world,'' he told a reporter while
standing on the sunlit putting green. ''Right now, you and I are
standing in my office.''

<HEADLINE> Measure aims to keep troubled moms from abandoning babies  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The infant girl was found alive and crying
inside a plastic bag in New Brunswick last year.
</P>
<P>
   The baby boy, bundled in blankets, was left in a car seat in a
Sears parking lot in Hackensack in February.
</P>
<P>
   The newborn boy, wrapped in a red T-shirt, was abandoned last
October on the doorstep of a Camden home.
</P>
<P>
   These babies lived. Others die.
</P>
<P>
   A newborn boy was found on New Year's Day, lying amid litter
near Paterson railroad tracks. He later died.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps the best-known case was the infant who died in 1996
after North Jersey teen couple Amy Grossberg and Brian Peterson
threw him into a trash bin outside a Delaware motel.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, five babies have been abandoned in New Jersey,
according to Andy Williams, spokesman for the state Division of
Youth and Family Services.
</P>
<P>
   The little boy in Paterson was the only one to die.
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers are hoping to prevent mothers from abandoning
their newborns with a ''Safe Haven'' bill that passed legislative
committees in both houses last week. Gov. Christie Whitman's staff
said Friday she supports the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Part public relations, part changes to current law, the bill
would make it unlikely that parents who safely deliver an unwanted
child to a hospital or police station would be prosecuted. Instead,
they could simply leave an infant younger than 30 days old and walk
away - no questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, a parent could be charged with endangering the
welfare of a child, a second-degree offense that carries a penalty
of up to 10 years in prison, said Chuck Davis, spokesman for the
state division of Law and Public Safety.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, many of these parents are never prosecuted - unless
they harm the baby or the baby suffers injuries from being
abandoned, said John B. Dangler, Morris County prosecutor and
president of the County Prosecutors Association of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the child's safe and in good health, I don't see anybody's
going to pursue criminal prosecution,'' Dangler said. ''DYFS would
get involved and may take steps to terminate the parental rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The most high-profile child abandonment cases usually involve
babies who die, such as the Grossberg baby. But other children are
quietly abandoned and found before any harm comes to them.
</P>
<P>
   Child advocates and bill sponsors say the measure will send a
message to desperate mothers that they can relinquish a child in a
safe place.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most baby abandonments occur when a mother feels she has no
place to turn,'' said Marie Tasy, director of New Jersey Right to
Life. ''They act out of panic, desperation and fear. They have
often tried to hide the pregnancy. This bill will offer them an
alternative to baby abandonment, without fear of prosecution, as
long as they leave them in a safe place.''
</P>
<P>
   To work, the bill has to be publicized, child advocates say. So
the measure would earmark $500,000 for a 24-hour hotline where
callers could get information about the Safe Haven law and
adoption. The measure also calls for a public education campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more recent cases of child abandonment in New Jersey
involved a Paterson mother of five.
</P>
<P>
   One cold February night, Michelle Booker took her newest baby
and four other children - ages 1, 2, 3 and 4 - to McDonald's for
dinner, according to published reports. Then, she drove the kids to
a Hackensack shopping center where she spent $86.15 on warm clothes
and other necessities for the infant.
</P>
<P>
   She put her newest baby in a car seat in the Sears parking lot,
in a place where someone would quickly find him. Then, she watched
from her car until someone discovered the boy, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A secretary, Booker was charged with child endangerment. She was
released on her own recognizance, but could face a possible 10-year
prison sentence. Bergen County prosecutors say they plan to pursue
the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''She allegedly left a baby in a parking lot in the middle of
winter at 9 o'clock at night,'' said Patricia Baglivi, assistant
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports, the father of all five children had
married another woman and was not helping Booker raise the
children.
</P>
<P>
   Ceil Zalkind, associate director of the Association for Children
of New Jersey, said it is uncertain if the bill would help mothers
like Booker.
</P>
<P>
   ''People who abandon children are desperate,'' said Zalkind.
''They're certainly not thinking about options, and I'm not sure
that having this option means they would use it. But if someone
does take advantage of it, it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill co-sponsor Assemblywoman Charlotte Vandervalk, R-Bergen,
said the measure would not shield a parent who hurts a child. She
expects the bill to pass both houses before the Legislature starts
its summer recess at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   ''The key point is that it offers the mother anonymity,'' she
added. ''We're hoping that by saying the mother's name will not be
released that will motivate some mothers to turn the baby over
alive and safe, as opposed to just throwing the baby away.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman spokeswoman Jayne O'Connor said the governor endorses
the concept but may seek some delay in the law.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have some technical amendments that we are working out with
the Legislature,'' O'Connor said. ''The governor is in agreement
that we have to do something more to address the problem of
abandoned babies.''

<HEADLINE> Greens Party Elects 2 New Leaders  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Germany's environmentalist Greens party on
Saturday elected two new co-leaders who have the backing of Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer, a move to further professionalize the
protest party serving in its first-ever national government.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, Fischer, a prominent Greens member and one of
Germany's most popular politicians, ran for a party post for the
first time. He won a seat on a new 16-member strategy council,
giving him a platform from which to urge the Greens to become a
more effective political force.
</P>
<P>
   The new Greens co-leaders are Renate Kuenast and Fritz Kuhn,
both 44. They called their win at the party convention in the
western city of Muenster a new beginning for the Greens.
</P>
<P>
   The vote comes on the heels of the party's approval Friday of a
deal to shut down Germany's 19 nuclear plants by about 2021. The
issue had been one of the party's main goals since its founding
more than two decades ago, and the new leadership is expected to
set new objectives for the Greens in their governing coalition with
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we must find ourselves and reinvent ourselves without
losing ourselves,'' Fischer told party members.
</P>
<P>
   Said Kuhn: ''We must make clear that we aren't simply the
radical version of the Social Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   The two new Greens leaders face the task of bringing together
the more radical elements of the party -- who had threatened to
reject the nuclear plant deal because it didn't live up to the
party's original demands -- and the more practical-minded wing
prodded by Fischer to become an organized political force.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhn is considered a close confidant of Fischer and is one of
the party's leading strategists and experts on economic issues. He
has said he wanted the Greens to become the ''social-ecological
modernization party,'' and that ecological projects shouldn't have
to mean lost profits for companies.
</P>
<P>
   Kuenast's political orientation is a little more to the left -- a
likely asset in dealing with that branch of the party. She has led
the Greens faction in Berlin's city government and was on the team
that negotiated the coalition agreement between the Greens and
Social Democrats after the 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The two are seen as stronger leaders than the two previous party
heads -- Antje Radcke and Gunda Roestel, who didn't run for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The Greens have come under increasing pressure to deliver after
losses in last month's state elections in North Rhine-Westphalia,
Germany's most populous state, where they dropped from 10 percent
to 7.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Vatican Criticizes China on Bishops  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCES D'EMILIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- The Vatican on Saturday sharply attacked
China for ordaining bishops without Pope John Paul II's approval,
warning Beijing that the practice would hurt efforts to normalize
relations between China and the Holy See.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican missionary news agency Fides reported that an
ordination was scheduled in Hanzhou, China, on Sunday for the Rev.
Matthew Cao, whose appointment to the bishop's post was not
approved by the pope. Vatican approval of Cao's ordination ''wasn't
even sought,'' Fides said. It described the priest as a member of
China's state-sanctioned Patriotic Church.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriotic Church doesn't recognize papal authority,
including the right to name bishops. Roman Catholics in China loyal
to the pope have risked persecution, and some pro-pope clergy who
lead the underground flock have been jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls, who did not mention Cao
by name, said unapproved ordination of bishops ''represents a
painful wound to ecclesial communion and a grave violation of canon
law.'' He said ''harsh sanctions'' can greet both the bishop
carrying out the ordination and the new bishop.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Vatican spokesman didn't use the word
excommunication, Fides said it appeared that was what was meant by
''harsh sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Such ordinations, Navarro-Valls said, ''place further obstacles
on the tormented path toward normalization'' of relations between
China and the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican's sharp words came four months after China's
state-controlled Catholic church ordained five bishops in defiance
of the pope on the same day that the pontiff was elevating 12 men
to bishop's rank in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   China and the Vatican broke formal relations in 1951, when the
Communists kicked out missionaries and forced Catholics to sever
ties with Rome.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Rebels Release Hostage  </HEADLINE>
By PAT ROQUE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels released one of 21 mostly
foreign hostages they have been holding in the southern Philippines
for two months, an official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Aventajado, the government's chief negotiator, identified
the Malaysian man as Zulkurmain Bin Hashim, 29. Authorities were
planning to take him Saturday night to Manila.
</P>
<P>
   Aventajado said no ransom was paid, adding that the release was
''a gesture of goodwill'' by the Muslim separatist Abu Sayyaf
group.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are still holding three Germans, two French, two
Finns, two South Africans, a Lebanese, eight other Malaysians and
two Filipinos they seized April 23 from the Malaysian diving resort
of Sipadan. The rebels brought them to the southern Philippine
island of Jolo, an hour away from the resort.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is the smaller, but more violent, of two Muslim
rebel groups battling Manila to set up a separate Islamic nation in
the impoverished southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, presidential Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora
said negotiators would offer the Abu Sayyaf government projects
instead of ransom.
</P>
<P>
   The government has a policy of not paying ransom to kidnappers.
On Monday, Zamora said the Abu Sayyaf rebels have demanded at least
$1 million for each captive but he stressed that the government
would stick to its policy.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the Malaysian was the biggest break so far in the
two-month hostage crisis that has brought international attention
to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations appeared to have soured two weeks ago after the
rebels separated their Caucasian captives from the Asians because
of fears of a military rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Aventajado said he was informed that the rebels
have reunited the hostages in one camp in the Talipao area of Jolo.
</P>
<P>
   In previous meetings with negotiators, the rebels have focused
on political demands, including a separate Islamic state,
protection of traditional fishing grounds from large trawlers --
many of which are foreign-owned -- and the formation of a commission
to examine the problems of Filipino Muslims living in neighboring
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Former Libyan ambassador Ashad Abdul Rajab Azzarouq, one of the
government negotiators, said the rebels have welcomed an offer from
a private Libyan foundation to put up schools, hospitals and work
projects in Jolo.
</P>
<P>
   Still, government representatives have said, on condition of
anonymity, that at least two of five Abu Sayyaf commanders are
interested primarily in a big ransom.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders, Galib Andang, known as Commander Robot, and
Mujib Susukan, control the hostages on Jolo, an impoverished
predominantly Muslim island of 500,000 people about 590 miles south
of Manila.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the hostages have fallen ill, though doctors have
brought medicine and food.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in General Santos, a major southern Philippine city,
a series of bomb explosions killed one woman and injured 37 other
people Saturday. Seven bombs exploded within a span of 20 minutes
outside commercial establishments, including a hotel and three
banks, said regional police chief Manuel Raval.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody claimed responsibility for the bombings, but Raval blamed
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the larger Muslim separatist
group.
</P>
<P>
   The bombings came a day after the military captured a major MILF
camp straddling Maguindanao and North Cotabato provinces north of
General Santos.

<HEADLINE> For Use AMs Sunday, June 25, and Thereafter  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE WATSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTHAMPTON BEACH, N.Y. (AP) - Lt. Col. Graham Buschor narrates
a story with the same thirst for detail he needs for mapping out
treacherous helicopter rescue missions - the kind that he and his
fellow Air National Guardsmen hunger for and like to call
''sporty.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard - this is what we do for a living,'' Buschor, 38,
said haltingly. ''Like I've said before, we're not that special.
We're your neighbors, your friends, the people you pass on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not heroes''
</P>
<P>
   But these ''non-heroes'' from the 106th Rescue Wing of the New
York Air National Guard - who have operated for years in virtual
anonymity out of a tiny airfield in Westhampton Beach - are on the
verge of stardom. The highly anticipated film ''The Perfect Storm''
premieres Friday, recounting the true tale based on the
best-selling book of the same title that documented the wicked
marriage of storms that rocked the East Coast in 1991, leaving a
trail of death and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The unit, home to some 850 full- and part-time Air National
Guard members, may have received more attention in previous weeks
than at any time in its history, including the unit's searches for
the remains of TWA Flight 800 and John F. Kennedy Jr.'s private
jet.
</P>
<P>
   Once the media buzz hyping the unit as supermen settles down,
life will return to normal at the base. The pilots and parajumpers
- who make up part of an elite combat rescue team - can go back to
their everyday lives as the Clark Kents of the rescue world.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a group of weekend warriors. A quarter are full-time
Guard members, and many part-timers spend at least a day per week
at the base, some as much as 130 days a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We train and train and train,'' Buschor said. ''It gets
boring, but it becomes apparent why you do it when you're on a
mission.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 287 civilians owe their lives to the 106th since 1975,
and that doesn't count saves made in combat. When the United States
becomes embroiled in conflicts, the squad flies its HH-60 Pave Hawk
helicopters and an accompanying C-130 refueling plane into enemy
territory to pluck downed fighter pilots from enemy soil.
</P>
<P>
   Most people living on Long Island have little knowledge of this
hidden gem. Actually, many in the military don't know either.
</P>
<P>
   ''I sort of stumbled onto the base.... I'm from Long Island - I
had no clue it was here,'' said Lt. Col. Mike Canders, a
44-year-old helicopter pilot with the squad.''
</P>
<P>
   So where did they come from? The base began as a flying club and
became the 394th Bomb Group during World War II. Pilots from the
394th received a French medal, the Croix de Guerre with Palm, for
participating in the Normandy invasion. During the Cold War,
parajumpers (better known as PJs) were dropped behind enemy lines
to take photographs of key locations.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it's one of three Air National Guard units conducting
civilian rescues; the others are in California and Alaska.
Generally, the Coast Guard does water rescues and forest rangers
handle lost mountaineers. The missions too extreme for others get
passed to the Air National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the success of the mission comes down to the PJs.
They are called ''the tip of the spear'' because they focus on the
target and are the first to strike.
</P>
<P>
   The men - under military regulations no women can be PJs -
enroll in a two-year program aptly known as ''Superman
University.''
</P>
<P>
   Within 12 weeks, the original class of about 100 gets pared down
to 10 or 15, all striving to wear a graduate's beloved maroon
beret. Candidates - some of whom already have been Navy Seals or
Army Rangers - are tested to the point of exhaustion, then pushed
still harder. They run and do calisthenics for 20 hours a day, then
sleep for a few precious hours.
</P>
<P>
   But the real testing takes place underwater.
</P>
<P>
   For example, candidates must repeatedly swim 50 meters
underwater. About 30 meters in, an instructor ''harasses'' the
swimmer, grabbing them, pulling on their mask, even striking them.
Swimmers can break the water's surface once during the testing; a
second time and the candidate is ejected from the program.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, swimmers refuse to acknowledge their need to breath.
Eventually, the body tries to protect itself and prevent water from
entering the lungs. That's when an involuntary reflex constricts
their esophagus, knocking them out.
</P>
<P>
   ''You look for a guy like that,'' said PJ Ken Smith, 32.
''That's a sign of mind over matter, of having a strong heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Unconscious swimmers are yanked from the water and resuscitated
with an oxygen tank. They get 10 minutes to recover before they
return to their water tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Once the class is whittled down, the real work begins. PJs spend
several different sessions, usually lasting four weeks, turning
them into highly skilled soldiers. Their primary talents are
jumping from planes - sometimes under extreme conditions like
leaping from 30,000 feet and pulling their ripcord at 3,000 so they
slip under enemy radar - and performing medical procedures, such as
inserting chest tubes or conducting field amputations. They also
train for mountain and deserts rescues.
</P>
<P>
   Graduates are sent to one of the three bases where they extend
their training through repetition and the prodding of cagey vets.
Then they wait for their first mission, which may be a simple
medi-vac from a vessel in the Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   If they are lucky, it's as extreme as Buschor's second-most
famous undertaking, a 15-hour, 1,600-mile adventure off of Nova
Scotia, which set an unofficial record for the longest unplanned
helicopter flight. A freighter sank, putting 30 sailors into the
sea. By the time the helicopter arrived, sharks had killed nearly
all, but the crew saved one man (a second was saved by a passing
ship).
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something special to pick someone up who is in trouble
and bring them back to their families,'' said Canders, who is
credited with 10 ''saves.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the squad's part-timers hold everyday jobs. Some are
cops or correction officers, others are airline pilots or company
executives. Some became doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, they work together, and they play hard together.
Summer barbecues are frequent, and someone is always around to
share a beer. There's also a shoulder to lean on, and people can
spot marital strife, family woes, or just plain depression if the
person doesn't let on soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guys I feel closest to are the para-rescuemen out here,''
said Smith, 32, who also is on the New York Police Department's
scuba team. ''We can all share something no one else can.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 30, 1991, those bonds were put to a fierce test during
what became known as ''The Perfect Storm,'' a-once-in-a-100-year
nor'easter that forced several ships and boats to issue distress
calls. One was the Andrea Gale, a 75-foot commercial fishing vessel
that eventually sunk, drowning everyone on board.
</P>
<P>
   Author Sebastian Junger focused on the Andrea Gale but also
wrote about a helicopter from the 106th known as Jolly 110, which
was copiloted by Buschor. The crew was returning home at night
after being unable to get a sailor off his boat when the Jolly 110
encountered 100 mile per hour winds that made it impossible to
refuel with the C-130. Realizing that the helicopter wouldn't make
it back, pilot Dave Ruvola decided to ditch and Buschor issued the
mayday call.
</P>
<P>
   PJs Arden ''Rick'' Smith and John Spillane, along with Buschor,
leaped into a sea where some waves reached 100 feet. Ruvola, along
with engineer Jim Mioli, remained onboard to set the aircraft down.
Both then escaped from the sinking helicopter
</P>
<P>
   Buschor wound up on his own. Somehow in the pitch darkness of
night and earsplitting winds, Ruvola, Mioli and Spillane found each
other. They were in bad shape; Spillane had several broken bones
and Mioli was the only one not wearing his survival suit.
</P>
<P>
   ''The wind is howling, you're getting hammered by waves every
few minutes, you're swallowing gallons of water, which makes you
vomit and then get the dry heaves,'' said Buschor. ''I wasn't
confident. The way I looked at it, we were screwed.''
</P>
<P>
   Four hours after going into the ocean, a search plane spotted
Buschor's emergency strobe light. Soon after, a 205-foot Coast
Guard cutter, the Tamaroa, found Buschor being tossed like a toy by
the waves.
</P>
<P>
   Ten Coast Guard crewmen volunteering to stand on the deck,
untethered and holding on for dear life, pulled him aboard once he
latched onto a cargo net, dislocating several of his fingers in the
process. Ruvola, Mioli and Spillane came out about an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, scores of aircraft and ships scoured the ocean but
never found Rick Smith. Many speculate that he and Spillane leaped
from about 70 feet, landing in-between waves because they couldn't
see the turbulent ocean. Unlike Buschor, neither wore night-vision
goggles, which might have enabled them to time their jump and land
on the crest of a wave about 10 feet down.
</P>
<P>
   The death was the first for the unit during a mission. Three
members were killed while training years earlier when a helicopter
flew into a mountain.
</P>
<P>
   An Air Force review of the Jolly 110 mission found the crew
wasn't at fault. Some minor protocol changes were made, but the
main improvement came from technical advances: now pilots can use
the Internet to check weather patterns, when before they waited for
faxes of weather reports.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years later, the 106th has moved on. But a mural on a wall
in the PJs locker room depicting the rescuers' mantra remains a
constant reminder of the past - and the potential future.
</P>
<P>
   The motto?
</P>
<P>
   ''So that others may live.''

<HEADLINE> 4 Wounded in Israeli Border Gunfire  </HEADLINE>
By BUTROS WANNA
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli troops opened fire Saturday
across the Lebanese-Israeli border as some 200 people demonstrated
and two tried to cross the fence, witnesses said. A union activist
said three Jordanians and a Lebanese celebrating the end of Israeli
occupation were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Tarek Tahboub, head of the Jordanian Doctors Association, said a
delegation of 150 people representing 14 Jordanian associations was
visiting the Fatima gate separating Lebanon and Israel when the
soldiers opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   Tahboub said a member of the Jordanian delegation joined by
about 50 Lebanese and Palestinians stood along the border fence
shouting ''Allahu Akbar,'' or God is Great, when Israeli soldiers
emerged from a border outpost. One of them opened fire at the
crowd, injuring the four people, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no provocation from our part. We did not throw
stones, we did not cut through the fence. We were just shouting in
celebration,'' Tahboub said from a hospital in Marjayoun where the
wounded were treated and released. Marjayoun is six miles north of
the Fatima gate border fence.
</P>
<P>
   A witness at Kfar Kila, however, said members of the delegation
were shouting anti-Israel slogans and that two people, whose
affiliations were not known, attempted to cross the border fence.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli soldiers fired warning shots in the air, then aimed at
their legs when the two did not retreat, the witness said,
insisting on anonymity. He said rubber bullets and live ammunition
were fired.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman provided the same
description of the shooting, but did not say what kind of bullets
were used.
</P>
<P>
   A Jordanian government statement issued in Amman said ''attacks
on unarmed Jordanian citizens are unjustified and unacceptable
under any circumstances and make us suspicious of the good
intentions (of Israel).'' Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel
in 1994. The Jordanians who were visiting Lebanon oppose their
country's peace with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's incident was the most serious since Israel completed
its troop pullout from south Lebanon on May 24. The gate at the
Lebanese village of Kfar Kila has been a gathering spot for the
curious and angry, who have regularly let loose with stones and
insults at an Israeli outpost 15 feet across the border. Four
others have been wounded there by Israeli gunfire since the
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The violence underlines the fragility of security conditions in
the newly liberated Lebanese territory, where anti-Israel
guerrillas are now in control.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group that led the fight
against Israeli occupation, hinted at retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will know how to deal with it with the required wisdom and
at the appropriate time and place,'' said a Hezbollah statement
issued in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese government, which has yet to take over parts of
south Lebanon now under de facto guerrilla control, denounced the
incident as a ''criminal act.'' It ''shows Israel's continued
aggressive policy against Lebanon and its people,'' Prime Minister
Salim Hoss said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Among the wounded Saturday was Ali Abu Sukar, secretary-general
of the Jordanian Engineers Association and a leading anti-Israel
activist in Jordan. Tahboub said Abu Sukar was hit in the back by a
bullet. The two other wounded Jordanians were identified as Ghassan
Abu al-Haj and Rashid Ramahi, also of the influential Jordanian
Engineers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Sukar, who heads a committee opposed to normalization of
ties with Israel under the 1994 peace treaty, is also a leading
member of the Islamic Action Front, the political arm of Jordan's
largest opposition group, the Muslim Brotherhood Movement.

<HEADLINE> Stone Signs on for Basic Instinct 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Sharon Stone has changed her mind and signed
for a reported $15 million to reprise the defining role of her
career.
</P>
<P>
   Stone has said for many years she would not take part in a
sequel to ''Basic Instinct,'' the 1992 thriller in which she teamed
with Michael Douglas. Douglas played a policeman who becomes
sexually involved with Stone's murder suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas is not returning for the sequel, leading to speculation
that his character may have been killed off by Stone after the
conclusion of the first movie, which ended with them making love
while an ice pick rested ominously nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Also not returning are Joe Eszterhas, who wrote ''Basic
Instinct,'' and director Paul Verhoeven.
</P>
<P>
   Daily Variety reported Friday that ''Basic Instinct 2'' will be
financed and produced by Mario Kassar and Andy Vajna. The story, by
''Desperately Seeking Susan'' screenwriters Leora Barish and Henry
Bean, is to be filmed this fall for release in late 2001 or early
2002.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now that the project is in the hands of our original producers
and my old friends Mario and Andy, I felt assured that the project
will be made with respect to the spirit of the original,'' Stone
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PIGEON FORGE, Tenn. (AP) -- Country singer Dolly Parton had mixed
feelings at the groundbreaking for a $20 million water park next to
her Dollywood theme park.
</P>
<P>
   Razing of the 35-acre site in Parton's hometown began Friday,
uprooting trees more than a century old.
</P>
<P>
   Parton acknowledged that progress came at a price, but that she
was trying to be sensitive to the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''You always hate to tear up land,'' Parton said. ''But in order
to progress and provide things for people to do, you kind of have
to sacrifice. We are doing whatever we can to save some of these
beautiful trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Parton's transformation from country singer and actress to theme
park impresario has turned her corner of the Great Smoky Mountains
into a tourist mecca of hotels, malls, amusement arcades and
restaurants.

<HEADLINE> Britney Spears Museum Planned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KENTWOOD, La. (AP) -- Two residents of Britney Spears' hometown
have created a museum at the request of her fans.
</P>
<P>
   Sections of the Britney Spears Museum will be devoted to her
early childhood, her tenure as a Mouseketeer, and her present
status as a chart-topping pop singer. The museum, which will be
part of the existing Kentwood Museum, also will include a gift
shop.
</P>
<P>
   Spears' parents have donated some childhood dresses and other
items, said Sandy Reed, who is volunteering to establish the
museum.
</P>
<P>
   She and another coordinator, Kathy Bryan, met earlier this month
with Spears' manager and accountant, and both liked the idea, Reed
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd love to say, 'And the opening date will be...' but we're
not to that point yet,'' Bryan said.
</P>

   She said the idea for the museum was a response to phone calls
from fans to state and local tourism councils.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actress Fran Drescher is expected to be
released from a hospital Sunday or Monday after surgery to remove a
cancerous tumor from her uterus, her manager says.
</P>
<P>
   The 42-year-old co-creator and star of the sitcom ''The Nanny''
underwent surgery Wednesday at Cedars Sinai Medical Center.
</P>

   ''She's 100 percent fine. She won't require any post-operative
chemotherapy or other treatment,'' manager Elaine Rich said Friday.
''Her doctors are delighted that everything was removed and she
will need no further treatment. She feels grateful and lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Drescher and her ex-husband, Peter Marc Jacobson, created and
produced ''The Nanny,'' which aired on CBS from 1993 to 1999. She
appeared in dozens of television shows and nine films including
''Saturday Night Fever,'' ''Ragtime'' and ''This is Spinal Tap.''

<HEADLINE> Jefferson Airplane Suing Member  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The 60s psychedelic band Jefferson Airplane
is suing one of its founding members, Paul Kantner, alleging that
he's using the band's name without permission.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three months, guitarist and singer Kantner has hired
another founder of Jefferson Airplane, Marty Balin, and other
musicians to perform the band's album ''Volunteers,'' working under
the band name Jefferson Airplane Volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the documents filed with the lawsuit, at least one
female vocalist has been performing the parts of Grace Slick, the
Jefferson Airplane singer who belted out the band's most famous
line: ''Feed your head,'' in its 1967 acid-inspired hit, ''White
Rabbit.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an extremely successful band and we're trying to protect
the name and it is just not right to have some girl singer singing
Grace Slick songs. I'm sure she's a very nice singer, but she is
not Grace Slick,'' said Bill Thompson, the Jefferson Airplane
manager and a shareholder of Jefferson Airplane Inc., the band's
corporate name.
</P>
<P>
   No telephone numbers were listed for Kantner or his band's
promoter.
</P>
<P>
   The new band gave shows in at least San Francisco, New York City
and Mill Valley, according to the federal lawsuit, filed Thursday.
Kantner told the New York Post that the tour was ''a random thought
that took on a life of its own.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Kantner signed an agreement promising not to use the
words ''Jefferson'' or ''Airplane'' for commercial ventures unless
the other shareholders of Jefferson Airplane Inc. gave him
permission. Kantner remains a shareholder of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson Airplane was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of
Fame in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Aid Used vs. Rebels, Drugs  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Lobbying skeptical lawmakers for a huge
aid package for Colombia, U.S. officials repeated it until they
were blue in the face: The money, they insisted, is for fighting
drugs, not rebel insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   But on the ground in Colombia, where the proposed aid would
finance an unprecedented military push into jungles flush with
rebels and cocaine, that distinction is not so sharply drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials here see U.S. helicopters and trainers as a
way to battle drugs while simultaneously depriving leftist
guerrillas and rival paramilitary militias of the cash cow that
finances their violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''They'll keep growing unless we act, gaining more resources to
buy arms and recruit people,'' Colombian Defense Minister Luis
Ramirez said in an interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Destroying the coca crops they tax and protect, Ramirez added,
''will indirectly solve the problem of paramilitary groups and the
guerrillas by taking away their principal source of financing.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Congress agreed this week on the outlines of the $1.3
billion aid package for this South American country that produces
90 percent of the world's cocaine and a growing amount of its
heroin.
</P>
<P>
   While some details need to be finalized, Washington appears
firmly committed to providing dozens of helicopters and Green Beret
trainers for two new 1,000-strong army units that will try to
retake Colombia's coca-growing south.
</P>
<P>
   Once remote areas are ''secured,'' police planes will fumigate
the cocaine-producing plants from the air while civilians officials
implement projects to help poor peasants grow alternative crops or
to resettle them elsewhere in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The country's largest guerrilla band, the leftist Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, sees the aid package as a thinly
veiled counterinsurgency effort. Critics believe it will only
inflame a 36-year conflict and undermine fragile peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Operations will center in Putumayo, the state on Ecuador's
border that produces two-fifths of the country's coca. One
1,000-man U.S.-trained counternarcotics unit is already stationed
at a base there -- and surrounded by an estimated 10,000 rebel and
paramilitary fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez downplayed the risk of major fighting as the troops hit
the jungles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't expect to find huge armies of guerrillas and
paramilitaries, but a well-armed group of five people can do a lot
of damage to a fumigation airplane,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still to be determined in Capitol Hill negotiations are what
kind of helicopters Colombia will receive: sophisticated Blackhawks
approved by the House or cheaper ''Hueys'' approved in the Senate.
Ramirez made a plea for the Blackhawks, saying their speed, range,
high-altitude ability and troop-carrying capabilities are needed
for Colombia's jungle and mountain terrain.
</P>
<P>
   While predicting minimal bloodshed, Ramirez is bracing for
potentially violent protests when as many as 50,000 residents of
Putumayo are driven from the area in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Most are migrant coca pickers, he said, although about 10,000
are coca farmers who'll need assistance -- some of it provided in
the U.S. aid package -- to plant new crops.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Ramirez rejected predictions that if coca production is
eliminated in Colombia it will simply shift to neighboring
countries like Peru, Ecuador and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Those countries, he said, don't have hardened drug mafias and
entrenched guerrillas and paramilitary fighters willing to protect
the crops to the death.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be difficult to replicate Colombia's situation in any
other country,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Leaping-mules act canceled amid complaints  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LACKAWANNA, N.Y. (AP) - High-diving mules might not be making
much of a splash this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The ''World's Only Hi-Diving Mule'' show, one of the most touted
acts at the Lackawanna Festival in suburban Buffalo, was scrubbed
Friday after organizer Tim Rivers refused to allow veterinarians to
assess his act - which could have led to seizure of the animals by
an animal-protection group.
</P>
<P>
   It's still up in the air whether the show will go on either
Saturday or Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Erie
County said it has gotten complaints from several hundred residents
about the diving act - in which mules plummet from a deck between
12 and 30 feet high into six feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   Two veterinarians alerted by the group attended the three-day
festival to observe the mules. ''We would have to wait until the
show takes place to determine whether any cruelty is happening or
not,'' the group's spokeswoman, Gina Browning, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   State law mandates that if cruelty is found, the animals must be
taken from their owner, said the group's executive director,
Barbara Carr. Veterinarians could intervene if they decide that the
force of impact and stress on the animals constituted cruelty, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Festival officials, however, were attempting to bring in state
veterinarians or veterinarians from local racetracks who have
expertise in horses so that the show might take place Saturday or
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until we can get a small panel of vets to make a fair
decision, we'll hold off,'' Angelo Iafello, the city's recreation
director, told the Buffalo News. ''That way everyone will feel more
at peace and comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivers, who owns the Citra, Fla.-based show, said the mules are
not punished for not wanting to dive, are not rewarded for diving
and actually enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   The mule act, however, has landed him in trouble elsewhere. A
1994 statewide injunction prevents him from performing mule-diving
in Illinois.

<HEADLINE> War Correspondents Return to Korea  </HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Correspondents who covered the Korean
War gathered Saturday in Seoul to share their experiences and help
mark the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the three-year
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Invited by the South Korean government, the graying former war
correspondents attended luncheons and visited Inchon and other
famous battle-sites during their weeklong visit. The anniversary is
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Among those participating in Saturday's discussion was retired
Associated Press correspondent Bill Shinn, 81, who scooped the
others by first reporting Gen. Douglas MacArthur's Inchon landing
in September 1950. Also here was Max Desfor, 87, a former AP
photographer who won the Pulitzer prize for his work during the
war. Desfor's picture of refugees crawling across a blown-up bridge
is probably the best-known Korean War picture.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Prendergast, 84, who covered the Korean War as a Time
Magazine correspondent, talked Saturday about his most horrendous
experience of the war: seeing dozens of American POWs who had been
shot to death in cold blood.
</P>
<P>
   Prendergast was following American troops pushing communist
invaders back to the north in the spring of 1951.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were going up the road and an officer came and took us to
the field. There were about 50 American soldiers shot to death by
Chinese or North Korean soldiers,'' said Prendergast, of Trappe,
Md. ''They were all stripped of their clothes. They were completely
naked.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford M. Poats, a 78-year-old former United Press
correspondent, said he was moving with a heavy flow of civilian
refugees ahead of the communist onslaught in July 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Two South Korean military trucks, loaded with crouching
prisoners in white peasant clothes, passed by him and veered off
into the field. In the back of the 2&AMP;frac12;-ton trucks were policemen who
had the muzzles of their rifles on the back of some of the
prisoners. Poats followed the trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard rifle shots. My gosh, they were shooting prisoners in
the truck and then kicked them onto the field. In several cases,
they shot the prisoners and then for some reason hit them with the
butts of their rifles and then threw them out,'' said Poats, of
Falls Church, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Historians say South Korean military police summarily executed
thousands of leftist suspects without trial in the early weeks of
the war for fear they might collaborate with the advancing
communist forces.
</P>
<P>
   Even more gruesome, Poats said, was seeing South Korean officers
shooting to death their own injured men because they lacked medics
or transportation. They feared that the wounded might fall into
enemy hands with vital intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could walk or you were dead. I saw that happening several
times,'' Poats said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Poats and Prendergast saw ''radical differences'' in the
ways that war correspondents covered the Korean War and the Vietnam
War. While American journalists in Vietnam indulged in disclosures,
they were ''part of the team'' with the American troops in Korea by
not reporting anything that could damage the morale of the
soldiers, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of their most vivid memories were how they were called to
duty on June 25, 1950, a Sunday, when North Korea invaded South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Prendergast, then a third secretary at the U.S. Embassy in
Seoul, was tending to the lawn at his Seoul home, one of the old
Japanese-style houses left by the defeated Japanese colonialists at
the end of World War II and used by U.S. embassy staff. His office
called him in.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until he saw South Korean soldiers moving in
trucks holding up tree branches with both hands for camouflage, and
two enemy planes strafing near the embassy and the South Korean
government headquarters, that he realized a war had started. The
U.S. embassy burned all its papers and evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Prendergast returned home in August. But he came back to Korea
in October 1950 as a Time correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   Poats was playing tennis in Tokyo when his office called him in
that Sunday. After he landed in Korea, Poats said he once wrote a
story and attached the typewritten pages to the legs of two
pigeons, hoping they would carry the copy to his Tokyo UP bureau.
</P>
<P>
   He also intended to ridicule the U.S. military, because it
allowed only one phone line for dozens of journalists and the line
rarely got through.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, the pigeons did not show up in Tokyo. The joke
among the correspondents was that the AP sabotaged them,'' Poats
said, referring to the rival news agency.

<HEADLINE> Haitian Groups Condemn Election  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Haiti's business and religious
groups on Saturday joined opposition parties and the international
community in condemning election results that gave former President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide's party control of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot endorse results that correspond neither to electoral
law nor to generally accepted norms,'' said the declaration
broadcast by 17 organizations, including the Chamber of Commerce,
the Association of Haitian Industrialists, the Roman Catholic
Bishops Conference and the Protestant Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Final results from the May 21 local and legislative elections
were published this week. They showed Aristide's Lavalas Family
party winning 16 of l7 seats in the 27-seat Senate during
first-round balloting and 26 seats in the 83-member House of
Deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Since Lavalas is leading in most lower-house races where a
second round is necessary, the party is likely to control both
houses of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties said they would boycott the second round,
which was postponed indefinitely this week. They have called for
new elections, charging that the vote count was rigged to ensure a
victory that would make Haiti virtually a one-party state.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide is favored to win presidential elections later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, the Organization of American States, Canada,
France and the United States all have condemned Haiti's method of
calculating first-round Senate winners.
</P>
<P>
   Under Haitian law, candidates must win a majority to avoid a
second round of voting. But officials counted the votes of only the
top four contenders and not the others who ran and may have gotten
a few votes.
</P>
<P>
   Those missing votes created an erroneous winning percentage
count, observers say, giving at least eight of 16 Senate seats to
Aristide candidates who otherwise would have to face a second
round.
</P>
<P>
   French Ambassador Yves Gaudeul warned that international aid
could be reduced or halted as a result.
</P>
<P>
   ''Haitian authorities had better understand we aren't joking,''
said Gaudeul, the top EU representative in the island nation.
</P>
<P>
   Some $100 million in EU aid already is suspended pending a new
Parliament. International creditors have also frozen $400 million --
desperately needed money in this impoverished Caribbean country.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti's Electoral Council has adamantly affirmed its exclusive
right to determine the results, and Lavalas Family spokesman and
Senator-elect Yvon Neptune on Friday called the reaction of the
international community ''a colonial reflex.''
</P>
<P>
   Haiti hasn't had a Parliament since January 1999, when
Aristide's protege, President Rene Preval, dismissed lawmakers to
resolve a power struggle and promised new elections.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy Seeks Break From Milosevic  </HEADLINE>
By ALEN MLATISUMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's regime should no longer represent Montenegro at the
United Nations, the foreign minister from the junior republic in
the Yugoslav federation said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from New York, where he attended an open session of the
U.N. Security Council on Friday, Montenegrin Foreign Minister
Branko Lukovac told reporters he hopes international powers will
support the pro-Western republic's position on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have submitted a document to the United Nations claiming
Serbia should no longer be allowed to represent Montenegrin
policies and interests here,'' Lukovac told the Vijesti and
Pobijeda newspapers in the Montenegrin capital, Podgorica.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro enjoys independence from Belgrade in all but name.
But its reformist leadership, bitterly opposed to Milosevic, has
refrained from declaring full independence, fearing a possible
armed conflict with Milosevic's supporters. And Serbia, the larger
republic and Milosevic's power base, has retained dominance over
Montenegro in Yugoslav embassies abroad as well as in its seat at
the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-Milosevic media in Serbia on Saturday blasted the
Montenegrin document circulated at the U.N. as a ''serpent's egg.''
A chief Milosevic ally in Montenegro, Predrag Bulatovic, declared
Lukovac's move ''a shameful act ... aimed primarily at breaking up
Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   In comments carried by Dan, a pro-Milosevic daily, Bulatovic
warned that ''such behavior directly influences peace and
stability'' in Montenegro. He said his party would raise the issue
at the next session of Montenegro's parliament Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the Friday session of the Security Council, Yugoslavia was
banned from participating in a debate on the Balkans after U.S.
Ambassador Richard Holbrooke urged council members to exclude
Yugoslav envoy Vladislav Jovanovic. Holbrooke said Jovanovic
''represents a government whose senior leadership has been indicted
for war crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic and his four top aides were indicted last May by the
U.N. war crimes tribunal at The Hague for atrocities in Kosovo,
Serbia's southern province dominated by ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The exclusion of the Yugoslav envoy prompted a walkout by
Russia's U.N. ambassador. A subsequent walkout by China's deputy
ambassador further complicated the session. Both countries have
remained supportive of Yugoslavia and opposed to NATO's bombing
campaign last year.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's Lukovac, who attended the Security Council session
in an informal capacity, said he met Friday with Holbrooke, who
''reiterated the U.S. stand that Montenegro's stability and
security were of U.S. interest.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We shall continue our endeavors to have our viewpoints heard
in the U.N.,'' Lukovac said. ''The international community has
supported our peaceful role in the region -- we therefore expect it
to stand by our struggle to voice our own policies and stands.''

<HEADLINE> Navy Ready To Resume Vieques Bombing  </HEADLINE>
By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The U.S. Navy said Saturday it was
ready to resume bombing on Vieques island in the biggest exercise
since a fatal accident prompted a yearlong occupation of the target
range.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters vowed to block the exercises, and a general assembly
of citizens was convened for Saturday afternoon outside the gates
to the range's Camp Garcia to discuss strategy. Protesters were to
be chosen to trespass onto the range, but only after the bombing
has begun, said activist Hector Pesquera. He said organizers didn't
want a spontaneous rush of demonstrators that could put lives in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the camp, police and military guards could be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the duty of every Puerto Rican and Vieques resident to go
inside (the range) and stop the bombing,'' said protester Miguel
Gonzalez Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy was to give at least two hours' notice to fishermen on
the outlying island to stay clear of the Atlantic Fleet bombing
range, said Lt. Jeff Gordon, who added that all permits were in
place for the exercises. The warning was to be broadcast by radio
and posted at Vieques' U.S. Post Office, Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Five warships will fire up to 600 rounds at the range and
aircraft will drop between 550 and 830 dummy bombs -- including
500-pound and 1,000-pound bombs -- during two to five days of
exercises, according to plans filed by the Navy. The plans called
for bombing to start ''approximately'' Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said this week that the Navy is not obligated to say
exactly when the exercises would begin -- an apparent attempt to
ward off protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition has mounted since news was published last week of
plans for the biggest exercise yet since an April 1999 bombing
accident killed a civilian on the range. That accident led to an
occupation of the range before federal officials evicted the
protesters last month. Since then, more than 200 demonstrators have
been arrested for trespassing on the range.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders say five decades of live bombing have caused
environmental damage, contaminated water supplies, stunted tourism,
destroyed fishing grounds and led to a high cancer rate.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy says Vieques is the only place its Atlantic fleet can
hold simultaneous land, air and sea exercises using live fire
before deploying abroad.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has ordered the Navy to use dummy bombs
instead of live munitions and to abandon Vieques by May 2003 if the
island's 9,400 residents vote to expel it in a referendum expected
next year. If the Navy wins, it gets to use live munitions again.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a U.S. District Court Judge ruled the exercises posed
no danger to citizens who live roughly 10 miles away from the
target area.

<HEADLINE> White-Led Parties Ally in S.Africa  </HEADLINE>
By GREG MYRE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- South Africa's two largest
white-led parties announced Saturday they would unite with the aim
of building a stronger opposition to the governing African National
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party and the New National Party, the second and
fourth largest parties in the current parliament, said their union
would be called the Democratic Alliance, the South Africa Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
   The two parties share ''the desire to build a political movement
that is home to South Africans from all communities and that will
effectively challenge the ANC for political power.''
</P>
<P>
   However, their combined forces will command only a fraction of
the seats controlled by the dominant ANC.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's parliamentary elections, the Democratic Party won
38 seats and the New National Party captured 28, compared to 266
for the ANC.
</P>
<P>
   Both white-led parties have sought to reach out to the black
majority in South Africa with only limited success.
</P>
<P>
   The New National Party was the successor of the National Party,
which formally introduced apartheid and ruled South Africa for more
than 40 years until the first all-race elections in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal Democratic Party opposed apartheid during the era of
white rule, and has been able to attract some black support in the
post-apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Leon, the leader of the Democratic Party, will head the new
alliance. Marthinus van Schalkwyk, the head of the New National
Party, will become the deputy leader.
</P>
<P>
   The parties agreed there was an urgent need for opposition
groups to join forces to challenge to the ANC.
</P>
<P>
   However, whites account for only a little over 10 percent of the
population in South Africa, and without strong support from blacks,
the new party will have a limited electoral base.

<HEADLINE> President revises earlier drug plan, tapping project surpluses  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) - President Clinton wants to use $58 billion
from the growing budget surplus to help senior citizens pay for
prescription drugs in 2002, revising an earlier proposal and
offering more generous Medicare benefits than current Republican
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the money to do this now and do it right,'' Clinton
said Saturday in his weekly radio address, broadcast during a
fund-raising trip in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should use a part of our hard-earned budget surplus to meet
America's most pressing priorities, like paying down the national
debt, strengthening Medicare and providing a prescription drug
benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton outlined the package he intends to send to Congress this
week: a drug subsidy in 2002, a year earlier than he first proposed
and House Republicans are offering, and a $4,000 cap on an
individual's annual out-of-pocket medicine costs, compared with
$6,000 under the GOP plan.
</P>
<P>
   The updated White House plan caps a week of intense political
maneuvering on an election-year issue affecting 39 million elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans voted largely along party lines Thursday to
reject a Democratic plan for the drug coverage. House Republicans
pushed their version through the Ways and Means Committee. A floor
vote is expected this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear that you can't have modern health care without
access to lifesaving pharmaceuticals,'' Rep. Nancy Johnson, who
heads the Ways and Means human resources subcommittee, said
Saturday in the GOP's weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, R-Conn., said that while more then two-thirds of older
Americans have some prescription drug coverage under health plans,
an estimated 12 million have none at all.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is simply morally wrong in the world's most prosperous
country,'' she said. ''No senior should have to choose between
filling their prescription and putting food on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, the federal insurance program for the elderly and
disabled, does not cover prescription drugs. Most senior citizens
have some kind of coverage through private health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is proposing to spend $58 billion more over 10 years
than the $195 billion total estimated in his initial plan in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, the president is expected to announce a $1 trillion
increase in projected federal surpluses. Sources have told The
Associated Press the figure would more than double, to $1.9
trillion, the $746 billion the Clinton administration projected in
February. The figures do not include Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The White House long has planned to spend part of that surplus
on a drug benefit and part on a tax cut. In political speeches,
Clinton says Republicans want to squander the money on a much
bigger tax cut that would be unaffordable if the surplus dries up.
</P>
<P>
   Under the GOP plan, ''If we don't have this projected surplus
we'll be back in the soup'' of deficits, Clinton said during a
political speech Saturday in Los Angeles, where he wound up a
three-day fund-raising tour.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's health care adiviser, Chris Jennings, said the new
White House proposal to spend some more of the surplus on drug
coverage is not at odds with that criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not saying spend it all on a drug benefit, by any
means,'' Jennings said. ''There's lot's of resources left.''
</P>
<P>
   A House Republican leader, Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma,
countered in a statement Saturday that senior citizens ''do not
deserve partisan wrangling'' from an administration ''looking only
for recognition as their days in the executive branch quickly fade
away.''
</P>
<P>
   The House GOP proposal calls for private insurance companies,
backed by hefty federal subsidies, to offer drug coverage to
Medicare recipients nationwide. The bill includes subsidies for
low-income senior citizens, as well as those experiencing extremely
high costs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and congressional Democrats, who have proposed slightly
different plans, would require the government offer a uniform drug
benefit under Medicare. Democrats claim only they offer the choice
of affordable coverage to all elderly, instead of only those deemed
most needy.
</P>
<P>
   The rejected Senate plan is less generous than Clinton's, and
slightly less expensive, at roughly $240 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the House GOP bill costs an estimated $40 billion
over five years.

<HEADLINE> Americans rule the Internet -- but not for long  </HEADLINE>
By ANICK JESDANUN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Say ''hello'' to a World Wide Web that is truly
that. From content to culture, the Internet - born of American
government need - is rapidly losing its U.S. flavor as more
computer users connect from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S.-based search directories now accomodate speakers of
languages such as French and Chinese. Sports sites highlight soccer
rather than baseball. A few American e-commerce services, such as
Amazon.com, accept payment by EuroCard.
</P>
<P>
   These changes come as the United States cedes more control over
Internet addresses and other policies. The California-based
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers will elect
officers by continent this fall, as one way to limit the influence
of U.S. representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's more awareness on the part of Americans than the
Internet isn't ours alone,'' said Steve Jones, a communications
professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. ''We're not the
only ones out there.''
</P>
<P>
   As a creation of the Defense Department and U.S. universities,
the Internet at first drew mostly American bureaucrats and
academics.
</P>
<P>
   Though its founders assigned domain names for some 250 countries
- such as .uk for the United Kingdom or .no for Norway - U.S.
domination continued even when the Net became more commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the U.S. could have invented a device to export their
culture and their policies and the whole fabric of the American
experiment, they couldn't have done better,'' said Don Heath,
president of the nonprofit Internet Society in Reston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   A strong private sector made this domination possible, said
David Colton at the Information Technology Association of America
in Arlington, Va. Private phone lines in this country allow cheap
connections to the Net, and business entrepreneurs provide money
for risky start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   With few users outside the United States, foreign companies had
little incentive to produce their own content. And with scant local
content, foreign residents had little incentive to connect.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as a year ago, many Europeans avoided the Internet,
viewing it as ''an American toy,'' said Liesbeth Hop, president of
Pro Active International, an Internet research group based in
Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   Most U.S.-based retail sites are in English and deal in U.S.
dollars. They also typically require credit cards, she said, even
though Europeans are used to billing or cash on delivery.
</P>
<P>
   However, foreign businesses have been busily moving onto the
Internet, especially in the travel industry. ''It's still
considered a very American network, though we are making it ours at
the moment,'' Hop said.
</P>
<P>
   And programmers around the world are developing software to
translate text into other languages, although there still are kinks
that make mistakes such as changing Bill Gates to ''invoice of
fences.''
</P>
<P>
   Global Reach, a marketing firm in San Francisco, found English
the native language for only half the online population.
Researchers at Angus Reid Group in Vancouver, British Columbia,
estimate that the U.S. online population recently dropped below 50
percent of the world's total for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   That proportion will keep shrinking, said Gus Schattenberg, an
Angus Reid vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Engineering Task Force, a U.S.-heavy standards
group, is studying an alphabet with accent marks and non-Roman
characters; a major hurdle is existing equipment that fits only the
world of English.
</P>
<P>
   Even the U.S. legal climate is under attack. The European Union
allows each member to stop U.S. companies from collecting personal
data on the Internet unless the United States passes stronger
privacy laws.

<HEADLINE> WEEKLY FARM: Garlic's sweet smell of success  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Americans are getting a taste for garlic.
</P>
<P>
   Consumption of garlic, once shunned as the ''stinking rose,''
more than tripled during the 1990s because of its growing
popularity in foods and as a dietary supplement or herbal remedy,
the government says.
</P>
<P>
   ''It had a bad reputation. People shied away from it or didn't
put it in food because it was supposed to give you bad breath,''
said Roberta Dowling, who runs a Cambridge, Mass., cooking school.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now chefs realize the attributes of using garlic and how it
can do wonderful things for food.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans consumed 3.1 pounds of garlic per person in 1999,
compared with 1 pound in 1989, the Agriculture Department's
Economic Research Service reports.
</P>
<P>
   To meet that demand, acreage devoted to domestic production of
garlic rose during the decade from 16,000 acres to 41,000 acres, or
about 64 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Ranch, a Gilroy, Calif., farm that accounts for 10
percent of the nation's acreage, has increased annual production
from 10 million pounds to 60 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Garlic-flavored everything is everywhere in the grocery
store,'' said Patsy Ross, a spokeswoman for the farm.
</P>
<P>
   Garlic, like broccoli, is increasingly viewed by consumers as a
''functional food'' with special nutritional benefits, the USDA
report said. ''Garlic has proven itself as a popular food and
nutrition item and is gaining scientific credibility as a
significant contributor to good health,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides livening up recipes - the herb long has been popular in
Italian, Chinese and other ethnic cuisines - research suggests that
garlic has several potential health benefits. Garlic contains
nutrients such as vitamins A and C. But one of the most important
ingredients is believed to be allicin, a sulfur-bearing compound
that gives garlic its pungent aroma.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have found that garlic can be an effective
anti-coagulant to prevent blood clots and strokes - so much so that
patients are advised to warn their doctors that they are taking it
- and lower blood cholesterol levels. Other research indicates it
could help prevent colon, stomach and prostate cancer, and
scientists are studying its effect on memory and the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in garlic has been so high that Cornell University
Medical Center set up a toll-free telephone number several years
ago to field questions about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Garlic does have some interesting effects on a variety of body
processes. How significant they are still needs to be explored,''
said Jennifer Nelson, director of clinical dietetics for the Mayo
Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs are using garlic in a wide range of foods and condiments,
said Dowling, who runs the cooking school. Half the recipes in her
school's 15-week course on basic food preparation contain garlic.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly popular is a puree of roasted garlic, which can be
added to stews and soups or used in salad dressings and meat rubs,
Dowling said. ''Roasted garlic is something you never saw 20, 25
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Some adventuresome chefs even convert it into caramel and use it
in desserts.
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident, by the way, that garlic is popular in
countries with warm climates. Humans began using garlic and similar
herbs, such as onions, to kill bacteria and other food-borne
pathogens that proliferate most readily in warm weather, Cornell
researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Garlic, onion, allspice and oregano kill all bacteria, and
several other spices, including cinnamon and thyme, can destroy 80
percent of the microbes, the scientists said.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Head, Montenegro Leader Meet  </HEADLINE>
By JADRAN KAPOR
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBROVNIK, Croatia (AP) -- Pro-Western Montenegrin President Milo
Djukanovic apologized to Croats and residents of this ancient
walled city Saturday for Montenegro's involvement on the side of
the Yugoslav army in Croatia's 1991 war of secession.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to express ... my sincerest apologies to all citizens
of Croatia, and especially of Dubrovnik ... for all the pain and
suffering and material losses inflicted by Montenegrins,''
Djukanovic told reporters after a meeting with Croatian President
Stipe Mesic.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks by the Yugoslav army and Serb paramilitary troops on
Dubrovnik and its surroundings were launched from Montenegro, and
hundreds of Montenegrins participated in bombing the city during
Croatia's war to secede from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic's apology Saturday came as part of an unprecedented
rapprochement between Croatia and Montenegro, one of only two
states left in the Yugoslav federation. It was the first time
leaders of the former and current Yugoslav republics met since
Croatia broke from the federation, which also once included
Slovenia, Bosnia and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic placed much of the blame for the 1991 fighting on
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and his regime. But he added
that Montenegro ''has paid a dear price.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have paid in the lives of our people, the severance of
traditional good ties between Croatia and Montenegro and our
banishment from the international community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Djukanovic was prime minister of Montenegro during the
war, he later split from Milosevic and is now in strong opposition
to the Yugoslav president. He and Mesic are both pro-Western
reformers who want to lead their states out of isolation and into
mainstream Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic's apology Saturday was likely to make a big impact on
Croats, who feel relations between the neighbors cannot normalize
before complete reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a small step for Europe, but a big step for Croatia
and Montenegro toward European integration,'' Mesic said.
</P>
<P>
   For Montenegro, establishing ties with Croatia means going
against its federal partner, Serbia. Serbia remains loyal to
Milosevic despite his having been blamed for the Yugoslav wars and
indicted by the U.N. war crimes tribunal for atrocities in Serbia's
southern Kosovo province.

<HEADLINE> Issues that fell through the cracks in 2000 session  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - They rallied. They chanted. They held vigils
outside the legislative chambers. They got arrested outside the
governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   But disabled people and their advocates were unsuccessful at
getting the Legislature and Gov. George Pataki to get New York to
sign on to a federal program allowing some mentally and physically
impaired people to remain eligible for Medicaid while earning up to
$45,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Medicaid buy-in was one of a host of significant
issues the Legislature did not address before concluding its
regular 2000 session on Friday. Others included reforming campaign
funding rules, easing the Rockefeller Drug Laws and streamlining
the state's court system.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the disabled thought for a time a non-Albany
player would be decisive in their struggle for the Medicaid bill.
The federal program they were trying to get the state to enroll in,
the Work Incentives Improvement Act, was authored by Republican
U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   When Lazio entered the U.S. Senate race in May against Democrat
Hillary Rodham Clinton, buy-in supporters hoped the Republican
state Senate and Pataki would seek to give Lazio a political boost
by having New York join a program he helped create.
</P>
<P>
   But it did not happen.
</P>
<P>
   ''This combined two major issues that everyone agrees on -
making sure that New Yorkers get appropriate health care coverage
and people get the opportunity to work,'' said Brad Williams of the
state Independent Living Council. ''How you can't be for something
that important to what is probably the largest constituency or
segment of society in New York, I just don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' group formed a coalition with the Association of
Psychiatric Rehabilitation Services and Housing Works, an AIDS
advocacy group, to lobby for the buy-in.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he was sympathetic to the aims of the coalition. But
he argued that no one could show how the state was going to pay for
the $13 million or so a year participation in the program would
cost initially.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Rosenthal, one of nine people arrested last Wednesday
when demonstrators chained themselves to the entrance of Pataki's
office at the Capitol, said advocates hope the Legislature will
return late this year and vote to join the buy-in program.
Supporters of the bill believe Pataki is ''whispering'' to
legislative leaders that it is the right thing to do, according to
Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think our civil disobedience episode was intended to put the
governor on notice that we want that to be something more than
hints,'' said Rosenthal, head of the Psychiatric Rehabilitation
Services group.
</P>
<P>
   Williams spoke the motto of all those disappointed by
legislative inaction in this or any session: Wait 'til next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not going away,'' he declared. ''The issue is not going
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Other issues not addressed by the Legislature during its regular
2000 session included:
</P>
<P>
   - Superfund. Despite what Pataki's conservation commissioner
called an ''immediate and clear'' need to do something, there was
no agreement to refinance the state's Superfund toxic chemical
cleanup program. The Pataki administration says the fund will run
out of money by March 2001. Legislators think there will be time in
2001 to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   - Campaign reform. Lawmakers and Pataki did nothing to curtail
political spending and fund-raising or make other reforms to the
campaign system in New York, despite criticism from ''good
government'' groups. ''The most glaring omission this session,''
said one government reform advocate, Blair Horner, of the New York
Public Interest Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   - Minimum wage. The state Senate declined to vote to raise the
state's hourly minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.75. Senate Majority
Leader Joseph Bruno noted that the state only last year coupled its
minimum wage with the federal standard and said future increases in
New York should be made when Congress and the president raise the
wage nationally.
</P>
<P>
   - Casinos. The Assembly balked at the last minute at considering
a bill stipulating that the state Legislature and local residents
should get a role in deciding on the siting of Indian casinos on
non-native lands in New York.
</P>
<P>
   - Rockefeller Drug Laws. No concessions were made to the many
critics of the anti-narcotics statutes which can allow a first-time
drug offender to get up to life in prison. Key legislators
continued to have doubts about the political and law-enforcement
effects of easing the laws.
</P>
<P>
   - Cameras in court. Despite the prodding of the judge in the
high-profile trial of the New York City police officers who shot
immigrant Amadou Diallo to death - Justice Joseph Teresi declared
the law banning cameras from New York courts invalid - the
Legislature did not agree on a bill to set up new cameras-in-court
rules in New York. It is now up to trial judges on a case-by-case
basis to decide whether cameras will be let into court or not.
</P>
<P>
   - Court reform. A bill to streamline the state's massive and
confusing court system again failed in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   - Debt reform. Pataki failed to win over the Democratic Assembly
to starting the process of amending the state constitution to put
into that document debt-control measures created by the Legislature
and governor as part of the 2000-01 state budget.
</P>
<P>
   - Police conduct. Several high-profile cases involving injury or
death to civilians at the hands of New York City police officers
failed to convince the state Senate of the value of bills Assembly
sponsors said would make officers throughout the state more
sensitive to the people they protect.

<HEADLINE> Human Rights Group in Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Three observers from Europe's leading
human rights watchdog returned to Chechnya on Saturday after local
authorities said they had resolved a dispute over who would guard
them.
</P>
<P>
   The three Council of Europe observers had left the Chechen town
of Znamenskoye on Friday for a town just outside the rebel
republic, saying they wanted Justice Ministry guards rather than
military or police escorts, a Russian spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was their only demand,'' spokesman Lyoma Khasuyev said.
</P>
<P>
   The observers are the first international group allowed to have
a presence in Chechnya since the war in the breakaway republic
began nine months ago. They arrived Friday in Znamenskoye, where
they were to work in the offices of Russian President Vladimir
Putin's human rights envoy.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Iiskola, a Finnish member of the observer team, denied
they had left for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not been threatened, our safety has been guaranteed,''
he said on Finnish YLG radio. He said he had left to accompany a
friend to an airport on the Russian side because they didn't want
to use a military airport inside Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow on Saturday, Council of Europe Secretary-General
Walter Schwimmer and Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini met
with Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov. Putin said
Russia would listen to European criticism of the war but would not
compromise national interests.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will always insist on our national interests, but we attach
importance to the Council of Europe's view on human rights,'' Putin
was quoted as saying by Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has
suspended Russia's voting rights and called for expelling Russia
from the organization because of accusations of human rights
violations by Russian troops in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has dismissed the accusations as interference in its
internal affairs, and for months refused to allow any international
presence in Chechnya. But in April, facing possible suspension from
the council, Russia agreed to allow a full-time mission at
Znamenskoye.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops are not engaged in large-scale battles in
Chechnya anymore, but they continue to bomb and shell rebel
positions in Chechnya's southern mountains. Rebels have fought back
with ambushes, remote-control mines and car bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Chechnya is the second in a six-year period.
Independence fighters expelled Russian troops from Chechnya in a
1994-96 war, but the troops returned in September after
Chechnya-based Islamic militants seized villages in the neighboring
Russian region of Dagestan. The government also blamed Chechens for
a series of apartment bombings last year that killed about 300
people.

<HEADLINE> BC-NJ--Feds-Fowler,620  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) - Federal prosecutors and IRS agents are
investigating possible tax evasion and money laundering charges
against former elections commissioner Jerry Fowler, a newspaper
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler faces trial in November on state charges that he skimmed
payoffs from inflated voting machine contracts.
</P>
<P>
   At least five federal subpoenas have asked for financial
documents related to contracts and companies named in the state
indictment, The Times-Picayune reported, quoting unidentified
sources.
</P>
<P>
   It said the subpoenas are related to Fowler's involvement with
voting-machine contracts and with a Natchitoches yogurt company
that state prosecutors say was used to launder Fowler's share of
alleged kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is in its early stages, the newspaper quoted
its sources as saying. It is not uncommon for investigators to
spend more than a year on research before deciding whether to seek
indictments.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said those subpoenaed include Florida businessmen
Ralph Escudero and Glenn Boord, who pleaded guilty in August 1999
to funneling more than $1 million in payoffs between 1992 and 1998
to Fowler and his co-defendant, New Jersey businessman Pasquale
''Pat'' Ricci. Authorities have said Fowler purchased 122,000
voting machine counters over the years from Ricci's Moorestown,
N.J., company, Independent Voting Machine Services.
</P>
<P>
   Escudero and Boord were partners in Uni-lect Inc., a Florida
company that prosecutors say sold voting machines and parts at
inflated prices to the state Elections Department. Prosecutors say
the men often delivered $20,000 bundles of cash to Ricci and Fowler
during secret monthly meetings at hotels, restaurants and airports
in New Orleans and Baton Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoena orders the former Uni-lect owners to deliver
hundreds of documents to special agents of the Internal Revenue
Service's criminal division June 29 in the grand jury room at U.S.
District Court in Baton Rouge. The subpoena asks for all documents
related to the Elections Department, Fowler and Ricci. It also asks
for documents related to Independent Voting Machine Service Co.,
which supplied parts to the Elections Department.
</P>
<P>
   A separate subpoena was sent to the Elections Department, which
released a copy of the subpoena to The Times-Picayune after a
public records request.
</P>
<P>
   The Elections Department's subpoena asks for all records related
to voting-machine purchases and to contracts for hauling the
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Another subpoena requesting financial documents was sent to
lawyers who completed legal filings related to the yogurt company,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler's attorney, Michael Small, said he was aware that some
subpoenas had been sent, but did not know any details about the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in New Orleans also have explored the Fowler
case, the newspaper quoted its sources as saying. It was not clear
why both the New Orleans and Baton Rouge offices have looked at the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The federal probe of Fowler comes as Small and other defense
attorneys are preparing for pretrial hearings in the state
corruption case.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler is charged with four state counts of felony malfeasance
in office, four of money-laundering conspiracy and one of filing
false public records. The case is scheduled to go to trial Nov. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler lost his re-election bid in November, three months after
his indictment, ending his 20-year hold on a state office that he
took over when his father, Doug Fowler, decided to retire in 1979
after occupying the post for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler has said he is innocent and has called his indictment ''a
politically motivated character assassination aimed at destroying
me.''

<HEADLINE> Switzerland To Try for U.N. Bid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) -- Switzerland's government will likely
try in 2002 to win voters' approval to join the United Nations,
President Adolf Ogi said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will win,'' Ogi told U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
during a visit to the northwest city of Basel.
</P>
<P>
   Although Switzerland hosts the second U.N. headquarters in
Geneva and belongs to some U.N. agencies, such as the World Health
Organization, the neutral Alpine country has refrained from joining
the full United Nations and is only an observer of the U.N. General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1986 referendum, 75 percent of Swiss voters turned down a
previous initiative to join.
</P>
<P>
   The General Assembly will meet next week in Geneva to review the
U.N. global campaign against poverty. The Swiss government paid $3
million to cover the additional cost of holding the session outside
New York, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Assad Moves Toward Syria Presidency  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- The ruling Baath Party elected Bashar
Assad to the post of secretary general of its executive on Saturday
-- bringing the 34-year-old another step closer to taking over the
presidency left vacant by his father's death.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous vote for Assad to head the 21-member regional
command came a day before parliament was expected to approve his
nomination for the presidency. The two-day session was also
expected to set a date for a presidential referendum, in which
Assad was likely to be the only candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Since the June 10 death of his father, President Hafez Assad,
the parliament, the Baath Party and state-controlled media have
been promoting Bashar Assad as Syria's next leader.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the death, the 250-seat Baath-dominated
parliament lowered the minimum age for president from 40 to 34 --
making Bashar eligible for the post. The party nominated him as
their chief, and newspapers and the state propaganda machine began
churning out editorials, posters and banners declaring Bashar the
nation's hope for the future.
</P>
<P>
   The Baath Party has ruled Syria since 1963. Hafez Assad carried
out a bloodless coup in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, prosecutors filed corruption charges Saturday against
two former Cabinet ministers and a businessman who allegedly
skimmed large amounts of money on a 1996 government transaction to
buy six Airbus-320 passenger planes. The deal led to ''big
financial losses'' for Syria, the official Syrian Arab News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth party in the case -- former Premier Mahmoud el-Zoubi --
committed suicide May 21 as he was about to be served a judicial
summons. He had resigned in March after 13 years in the post.
</P>
<P>
   El-Zoubi's deputy prime minister for economic affairs, Salim
Yassin, his transport minister, Mufeed Abdul Karim, and businessman
Mounir Abu Khadour have been referred to the Economic Security
Court for trial, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have urged the state carrier, Syrian Arab Airlines,
and the Transport Ministry to sue the men to regain the money. The
report did not say how much money was lost or how the men were
believed to have embezzled it.

<HEADLINE> Albright Begins Visit to Poland  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
arrived in Poland's capital Saturday to join foreign ministers from
some 100 countries for discussions on human rights and democratic
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day conference on democracies, to begin Monday, is to
focus on strengthening international institutions and sharing
experiences on how to build enduring democratic structures.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates are also expected to issue a joint declaration at the
end of the conference, which was being sponsored by Poland, the
United States, the Czech Republic, Chile, India and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Before the conference opens, Albright is to travel Sunday to the
Baltic port city of Gdansk -- the birthplace of the Solidarity
movement that led Poles and other East European nations in toppling
communism. There she is to receive an honorary degree from the
Gdansk University in recognition of her contribution to building
democracy in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Gdynia, Albright will join Polish Prime Minister Jerzy
Buzek for a ceremony to name a warship after the 18th century
Polish and American hero, Kazimierz Pulaski. The frigate to bear
Pulaski's name is a gift from the United States to Poland's navy.
</P>
<P>
   Poland, which managed to restore a democratic system after more
than four decades of communist rule, joined NATO last year, along
with Hungary and the Czech Republic.

<HEADLINE> Penguins Coated in Oil in S.Africa  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- Volunteer workers collected
hundreds of oil-coated penguins and prepared to scrub them clean
Saturday, a day after a tanker sank off Cape Town's coast and
unleashed a large oil slick.
</P>
<P>
   The Panama-registered Treasure went down Friday about six miles
offshore, carrying 1,300 tons of fuel oil and 130,000 tons of iron
ore.
</P>
<P>
   Survey teams reported small dollops of oil rising to the surface
Saturday, and a large slick extending toward nearby Robben Island.
The rocky outcrop, now a nature reserve and home to a large penguin
colony, was previously used by the apartheid government to house
political prisoners, including former President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   As of Saturday afternoon, no oil had reached Cape Town's
beaches, which are among the country's most popular tourist
attractions.
</P>
<P>
   The penguins slathered with oil were being gathered from Robben
Island and mainland beaches to be scrubbed clean at a
rehabilitation center run by the Southern African National
Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation expected to collect up to 1,000 oil-drenched
penguins on Saturday alone. It warned that the spill could have a
devastating effect on the aquatic bird population.
</P>
<P>
   ''The initial oil slick covered their main feeding ground and
most penguins will be swimming through oil to get back to Robben
Island,'' the foundation's Estelle van der Merwe said.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 19,000 penguins on Robben Island, and many more
live along South Africa's coastline.
</P>
<P>
   Officials trying to contain the oil from spreading said there
were some encouraging signs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The flow is not constant and the quantities are not large,''
the South African Maritime Safety Authority said in a statement.
''It is anticipated that the latest reports will confirm the vessel
is still intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities hope oil remaining in the Treasure's fuel tanks can
be pumped into another vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Before sinking, the Treasure developed a 17-by-10 yard hole in
the hull -- apparently either from rust or a crack related to its
age.
</P>
<P>
   The ship, heading from China to Brazil, was too large to be
brought into the Cape Town harbor for repairs, and authorities
ordered it towed offshore to reduce the risk of oil pollution.
</P>
<P>
   After two hours under tow in heavy seas, the towrope ripped
loose from the Treasure's deck. The ship then drifted eastward and
sank. All 29 crew members were airlifted to safety.

<HEADLINE> Serb Attack Suspect Said Sheltered  </HEADLINE>
By KATARINA KRATOVAC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A key opposition party in Serbia
accused Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's police Saturday of
sheltering a suspect in last week's attempted murder of the party's
leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian Renewal Movement, whose leader Vuk Draskovic was
wounded in a June 15 attack in Montenegro, demanded in a statement
that Milosevic's police ''turn over the terrorists'' wanted by
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The statement followed reports that Dusan Spasojevic, 31, who
has been implicated by Montenegrin police as a third suspect in the
Draskovic shooting, was hospitalized at a Belgrade clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Spasojevic's lawyer, Slobodan Milivojevic, told the Glas
Javnosti daily that his client had intended to travel to Montenegro
to turn himself in, but his health ''suddenly deteriorated'' two
days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Spasojevic, a real estate investor from Belgrade, suffers from
chronic heart disease, the lawyer added. He quoted Spasojevic as
saying he was in Belgrade on the night Draskovic was attacked,
undergoing treatment at a clinic he visits regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Glas Javnosti did not specify at which clinic the suspect was
being treated.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic was grazed by two bullets at his summer home in
Montenegro, Serbia's junior partner in the Yugoslav federation.
According to Montenegrin police, six suspects sneaked up to the
verandah and fired eight .32 caliber bullets at the opposition
leader through a window.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Draskovic has added to the political tensions in
Serbia, where the government has recently launched a major
crackdown against opponents. On Saturday, police prevented an
anti-government gathering by the student-run Otpor, or Resistance,
group in the southern town of Leskovac, detaining six people.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic has accused Milosevic's secret service of being behind
the attack. Montenegrin authorities, who are at odds with
Milosevic's regime in Belgrade, have remained silent on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian Renewal Movement echoed Draskovic's accusations
Saturday, saying that ''stories about sudden heart attacks ...
launched by Belgrade police, are an apparent attempt to protect the
terrorists by those who employed them.''
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic's lawyer, Borivoje Borovic, told Belgrade B2-92 radio
Spasojevic's hospitalization was a ''farce.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Serbian police had an obligation to turn him over,'' he said.
''It is obvious that he enjoys protection by Serbian police.''
</P>
<P>
   After the murder attempt, Montenegrin police detained two
suspects, Milan and Ivan Lovric, who are currently being held in
one-month custody during pretrial court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Police also implicated Spasojevic and a fourth man in the
attack, as well as two unidentified persons. All four were reported
to have fled to Serbia. Montenegrin police have demanded they be
handed over.
</P>
<P>
   The Lovrics, who are cousins, denied in a closed-door hearing
Thursday that they had anything to do with the attack, as well as
any knowledge of Spasojevic and the fourth identified suspect,
their lawyer Nikola Martinovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Spasojevic's attorney told Glas Javnosti his client learned from
media he was a suspect in the Draskovic shooting and ''reported
himself willingly'' to the Belgrade police last week.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper also quoted a Belgrade police press officer, Col.
Mijodrag Gutic, as saying Serbian police were ''at the full
disposal'' of their Montenegrin colleagues and were taking steps to
arrest the fourth known suspect.

<HEADLINE> Physical Therapists Try To Recoup  </HEADLINE>
By ELIZABETH A. DAVIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Bill Gentile quit his job as a high school
physics teacher to enroll in physical therapy school, fully aware
that the formerly thriving field was in turmoil because of changes
in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ''I definitely took my time in terms of choosing my next career.
I was weighing several options,'' said Gentile, who will graduate
from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in August. ''I
chose physical therapy irregardless of the job market. It was
simply: 'This is really interesting to me.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, attractive starting salaries and an
abundance of jobs made physical therapy one of the most popular and
promising career choices.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997, a new limit on Medicare reimbursements threatened
jobs and led to shorter working hours. Unemployment rose and
applications to schools declined.
</P>
<P>
   A slow recovery appears to have begun, helped by a moratorium on
the Medicare limits that took effect in February. Salaries have
remained fairly high, averaging about $56,600 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''At one time, we were touted as the No. 1 job with a seller's
market. Now it is a buyer's market,'' said Jan Richardson,
president of the American Physical Therapy Association and head of
Duke University's physical and occupational therapy department.
</P>
<P>
   About 90,000 physical therapists nationwide work in hospitals,
private clinics, nursing homes and homes. Their patients include
recovering heart attack and stroke victims, surgical patients,
athletes, children with developmental problems or cerebral palsy,
and anyone else needing rehabilitation from injury or disease.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the field peaked in the mid 1990s. Top-notch
students encouraged by career counselors and reports of attractive
starting salaries competed for spots in small bachelor's or
master's programs. They usually had several job offers before
graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy new physical therapy programs were accredited after 1995
to meet the demand, and there are 218 today, according to the APTA,
which has since suggested a moratorium on new programs until 2003.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997, the Balanced Budget Act for the first time capped
the amount that Medicare could reimburse outpatient facilities for
therapy. A Medicare recipient was allowed only $1,500 a year for
speech and physical therapy, plus $1,500 for occupational therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Work days were shortened for some physical therapists --
especially those in skilled nursing facilities and home health care
agencies -- and salaries dropped.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some patients needing long-term care were denied
placement in nursing homes. Some facilities turned away patients or
had to strictly monitor their care to ensure that Medicare was
covering their costs.
</P>
<P>
   College physical therapy programs were hit hard.
</P>
<P>
   ''When those changes occurred, we saw a very quick response from
applicants,'' said Darlene Sekerak, director of the Division of
Physical Therapy at UNC-Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think everyone has experienced a decrease in applications,''
said Jody Cormack, a therapist and director of clinical education
at the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Applications for 40 places in UNC's program peaked at 600 in the
mid 1990s, but last year there were 225 and this year only 165,
said Sekerak. USC, however, has been able to fill its 80-person
doctoral program, Cormack said.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Washington in Seattle used to receive seven to
eight applications for each physical therapy class position, but
this year got just four per slot, said the program's director, Mark
Guthrie.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for therapists, the Medicare cap proved hard to
enforce. Congress placed a two-year moratorium on the cap under the
Balanced Budget Refinement Act that took effect Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The APTA, which only recently began tracking employment
nationally, watched unemployment among therapists jump from 1.2
percent in October 1998 to 3 percent in April 1999 and 3.2 percent
in October 1999. After the moratorium, the rate dipped to 2.9
percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   ''There seems be a swinging of the pendulum already,''
Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of the UNC students who graduated last August
had physical therapy jobs six months later. About one-fourth of
USC's students had job offers before graduation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This year students are finding jobs much quicker,'' Cormack
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gentile is confident he will find a job after he graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is pretty difficult to get a job but, nonetheless, I wanted
to do this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While there may be fewer applicants to schools, ''the folks that
are left really and truly want to be PTs,'' Guthrie said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat in Cairo To Discuss Mideast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat flew to
Egypt on Saturday from Tunisia, where he had blamed Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak for a lack of progress in the peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat was in Egypt for discussions Sunday with President Hosni
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   The essential problem, Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted
Arafat as saying before leaving Tunisia, ''is Barak's insistence
not to delegate to the Israeli negotiators the necessary mandate
during the talks with the Palestinian side.''
</P>
<P>
   He also cited ''Israel's procrastination in implementing the
signed agreement,'' for a lack of results, MENA reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians and Israel have a self-imposed September
deadline for reaching a permanent peace accord, but remain far
apart on key issues such as the status of Jerusalem, borders, and a
return of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross, arrived in the
region Thursday to assess prospects for a Mideast summit in
Washington during which Barak and Arafat would try to formulate the
outlines of a peace treaty. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
was expected to join Ross this week.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent Arab columnist, meanwhile, quoted Arafat on Saturday
as saying he might leave the Palestinian territories for either
Egypt or Tunisia if no agreement is reached with the Israelis soon.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in Al Hayat newspaper, Jihad al-Khazen said Arafat told
him that ''if pressure continues on him, he will head the advice of
his assistants and move to either Cairo or Tunis and leave Barak to
solve his problems with the Palestinians, like Hezbollah.'' The
reference was to Hezbollah guerrillas, who spent decades wearing
down Israel's will to occupy south Lebanon; Israel left last month.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has made similar threats in the past of a Palestinian
revolt against the Israelis if he abandons the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's headquarters were in Tunisia before the Palestine
Liberation Organization moved to Gaza following the 1993 Oslo peace
agreement he signed with then-Israeli Prime Minister Yizhak Rabin.
During his visit, Arafat met with PLO officials in Tunisia and with
the Tunisian president, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.

<HEADLINE> Passenger at Newark Airport dies of meningitis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Health officials on Saturday were notifying
some passengers who landed here Friday on a flight from Israel that
they might have been exposed to meningococcal meningitis by a
fellow passenger who died after arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were 13 people on the flight that were identified as
sitting in close proximity to the young man,'' Rita Manno,
spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior
Services, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   All but one of the 13 - who were from New Jersey, New York,
Pennsylvania and Illinois - had been notified by Saturday afternoon
that they should see a doctor as a precaution and possibly consider
preventive antibiotic therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no reason to believe that there are any further cases
of meningitis, whatsoever,'' Manno said, terming the notifications
a precautionary measure.
</P>
<P>
   The stricken passenger, Joseph Ferraro, 20, of Rochester, N.Y.,
died at 7:07 p.m. Friday, about two hours after he arrived at
Newark International Airport on El Al flight 17 from Tel Aviv, said
Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and
New Jersey. Port Authority police were notified Ferraro needed help
and took him to Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, where he died,
Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   The El Al jet carried 416 passengers and 19 crew members.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was notified of
the cause of Ferraro's death, mainly because his fellow travelers
were from multiple states, Manno said. The Port Authority also
notified the New York and New Jersey health departments and other
agencies, and the New Jersey state epidemiologist, Dr. Eddy
Bresnitz, contacted health officials in the other states involved.
</P>
<P>
   Meningococcal meningitis is a bacterial infection of the
membranes around the brain and spinal cord. The symptoms include
fever, neck stiffness and headache.
</P>
<P>
   It is transmitted only through close contact, such as
transmission of saliva through kissing or sharing utensils. Routine
preventive therapy includes treatment with antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no danger to the general public here or to the
passengers on that plane because the contact has to be intimate''
to spread meningitis, Manno said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Ferraro had been on a visit to Israel, apparently on a
group bus tour sponsored by a Jewish youth group. She said the CDC
had identified 89 people on the tour with him, some of whom were
still in Israel and some of whom had returned to the United States,
and was notifying those travelers of the possible risk to them.
</P>
<P>
   Manno said she did not know how Ferraro had contracted
meningitis.

<HEADLINE> Longtime activist now fights for herself  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - It has come to this for Alice Green: After
decades of working to keep others out of prison, she is fighting to
get herself into prison.
</P>
<P>
   State prison officials have labeled the 56-year-old activist a
security risk and curtailed prison access for Green and her
advocacy group, the Center for Law and Justice. Workers there have
been barred from visiting with groups of inmates. Green - in
typical fashion - is fighting back and speaking out.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here I am,'' she said during a recent interview, ''this
five-foot-two grandmother who somehow or another fomented this
unrest.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Green has been stirring things up for years as one of
the most visible and controversial activists around the state
Capitol. She has fasted on sidewalks. She has told Gov. George
Pataki to stop leading a Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade. She
regularly speaks out on racism and prisoners' rights - sometimes
with caustic language.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a sampler from a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   On the prison system: ''We know that prisons are reserved for
people of color.''
</P>
<P>
   On Martin Luther King Day: ''It's not so we have this day set
aside so politicians can exploit his image.''
</P>
<P>
   On race and criminal punishment: ''When any middle-class white
person does something it's poor judgment or indiscretion. When
blacks do it, it's a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Such talk has made Green an irritant to many at the state
Capitol. A New York Post editorial praising her banishment from
prison common areas described Green as an ''obnoxious activist.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, soft spoken in conversation, says it is merely a matter
of fighting for what she believes is right. Her justice center,
created in 1985, counsels people charged with crimes, conducts
educational workshops in minority communities and teaches young
people about their rights and responsibilities. She handles some
3,000 letters from inmates a year, reading them before bed.
</P>
<P>
   Her causes are many, but a common thread is the belief that the
criminal justice system is ravaging minority communities and
families. She sees a vicious cycle - blacks are perceived as
threats and are more apt to be arrested. Once arrested, longer
sentences keep them in the system. And public perceptions harden.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they look at a prison system and they see almost all the
people there are people of color, it affects their perception of
me,'' she says. ''Whether I'm looking for employment or I want to
live next door to you because that image is there - the stereotype
of black people being criminals and dangerous people to live next
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Green was born in a tiny Adirondack town called Witherbee, where
she was the only black girl in her class. She came to Albany in the
'60's as a college student and for the first time began taking part
in anti-war and civil rights demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Green went to school to be a teacher, but later decided she
should get her masters in social work. Her stint as a social worker
convinced her that crime and punishment had a tremendous effect
among the people she worked with. So she went on to get her
doctorate in criminal justice. She is now an adjunct at the
University of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Green has served as legislative director for the New York Civil
Liberties Union and was a deputy commissioner of probation for Gov.
Mario Cuomo. She quit the Cuomo post to protest the
administration's prison-building binge, and has done her criminal
justice work since then on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Dare, president of the Urban League of Northeastern New
York and an admirer of Green's, said: ''There are very few people
who represent those people caught in the criminal justice system,
and represent them well.''
</P>
<P>
   Green garnered wider press attention in 1998 when she ran for
lieutenant governor on the Green Party line, with Al Lewis - aka
''Grandpa'' from ''The Munsters'' television program from the '60s
- heading the ticket. She also has made headlines in a series of
confrontations with Pataki on Martin Luther King Day.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Green persuaded the new governor to give up his
position in the front of the King Day parade. Things got rougher on
King Day '98 when demonstrators, including Green and her husband,
tried to unfurl a banner critical of the governor's prison
policies. Green and her husband were arrested for disorderly
conduct. The charges were later dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Green believes that incident was the beginning of the slow boil
that got her access curtailed from state prisons. A planned visit
to Attica in '98 was canceled suddenly, she says, and an
administrator told her she was a ''radical'' opposed to prisons.
Green told a news conference Wednesday she sensed the governor had
a vendetta against her.
</P>
<P>
   State prison officials say the action was not based on the 1998
incident, but on information indicating Green's group helped
encourage inmates to strike on or around Jan. 1, 2000. There were
fliers circulating among prison inmates late last year urging a
protest of state parole policies and other grievances.
</P>
<P>
   There were no inmate strikes around New Year's Day, although
emergency response teams were stationed near prisons throughout the
state to deal with possible strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections Commissioner Glenn Goord wrote Green a letter in May
saying she and her group posed ''a clear threat to the safety and
security of correctional employees and inmates.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The commissioner's primary responsibility is to make sure that
our people come to work every day and go home to their families and
relatives at night and protect the safety and security of
inmates,'' said Goord's spokesman, James Flateau. ''In the
commissioner's mind, she challenged that.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Goord's decision, Green can still see inmates one-on-one
in prison visiting rooms, but has been denied permission to meet
with groups of inmates in common areas.
</P>
<P>
   Flateau said the law gives the commissioner discretion over who
can make those group visits. Other advocates continue to have group
access to prisons, he said, including critics of the criminal
justice system like Roman Catholic Bishop Howard Hubbard of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ''The line that you do not cross is when you go from advocacy to
inciting,'' Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
   Green strenuously denies that she tried to rile inmates and says
she is not aware of any employees from her center doing so. She
says the ban keeps her from doing important work - prison visits
for legal work, workshops and lectures - and has a chilling effect
on other prison advocates.
</P>
<P>
   She called a news conference Wednesday to say she will continue
to press for a hearing, even though prison officials have told her
she is not entitled to one. She has asked prison officials for a
copy of the evidence against her. She said she will consider a
lawsuit if the ban is not rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   Green admits this comes at a bad time. She has lost so much
ground on issues already - there are more prisons, parole has been
tightened, inmate services have been reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people say to me 'You've got to be frustrated. It's
getting worse. You have no power.' And they're absolutely right,''
she says. ''But the only alternative is to do nothing, and that I
can't even imagine.''

<HEADLINE> Spanish Arrest 21, Seize Cocaine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Spanish Civil Guards with help from the
U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency seized a freighter carrying more than
2 tons of cocaine in the Caribbean, arresting 21 people in the
operation, authorities said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cape Verde-registered freighter ''Paul'' was intercepted
Wednesday near France's Martinique Island with about 2.2 tons of
cocaine, though police suspect the crew threw part of the smuggled
drug into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The drug was heading to the Spain's northwestern region of
Galicia with a street value of $194 million, a police statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nine people were arrested aboard the ship, while four others
were detained on or near the freighter, EFE state news agency
reported. No nationalities or identities were released.
</P>
<P>
   Another eight people suspected of being part of a
drug-trafficking organization were arrested in different northern
Spanish towns in connection with the bust.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Threaten More Roadblocks  </HEADLINE>
By MELISSA EDDY
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Austrian environmentalists ended their
29-hour blockade of a main mountain highway Saturday but threatened
future roadblocks if new limits are not placed on heavy truck
traffic passing through the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Since Friday, hundreds of demonstrators had blocked the Brenner
highway, which runs over the Austrian Alps between Germany and
Italy on one of Europe's main north-south routes. The highway was
open for traffic Saturday afternoon after the blockade came to an
end.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, villagers and politicians supported the
protest. It was organized by a group called ''Transitforum Tirol,''
which is demanding that the EU allow Austria to set its own
regulations on how much truck traffic be allowed to use the Brenner
highway. The group accuses the EU of violating existing transit
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz Gurgiser, who heads the Transitforum, told the Austria
Press Agency on Saturday that the group will launch unannounced
blockades of the highway if measures are not taken to protect the
delicate Alpine environment.
</P>
<P>
   Before Austria joined the EU in 1994, a transit agreement was
signed limiting the number of heavy trucks that could cross the
republic's Alpine highways. But the EU has long ignored the limits
and traffic along the highway has nearly doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring Switzerland has solved its Alpine pollution problem
by building up its rail system to carry trucks over the mountains.
Because the trains run on electricity, they generate considerably
less pollution than the fuel-burning vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   In Switzerland, trains carry three times as much freight over
the Alps as trucks do -- practically the reverse of the situation in
Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Vienna has talked about forcing more trucks off the roads and on
to the rails, but EU regulations prevent them from doing so. The
Austrians have tried to raise tolls on the roads to discourage
truck traffic, but this has also sparked protest from the EU.
</P>
<P>
   The current transit agreement between Austria and the EU runs
out in 2003. Alpine dwellers and environmentalists are hoping to
see improvements in the next version.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not accept that as of 2003 truckers will be allowed
free access to Alpine highways,'' Transitforum leader Fritz
Gurgiser said.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Tie In Newsweek Poll  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrat Al Gore and Republican George Bush
each had 45 percent support in a Newsweek presidential poll
released Saturday, with 10 percent of registered voters undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also asked about the candidates' ideas for changes in
the Social Security system to keep it viable in coming decades.
While most surveyed did not know which candidate had proposed what
plan, the vice president's was approved by 67 percent of the
respondents, while the Texas governor's drew 51 percent support.
</P>
<P>
   Only 18 percent knew Gore wants to create a supplemental savings
program, with workers allowed to put up to $2,000 a year in
tax-deductible savings with matching government contributions based
on income. Just 34 percent knew Bush would allow workers to invest
some of their Social Security payroll taxes in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The random telephone survey by Princeton Survey Research
Associates of 750 adults was conducted on June 22-23. The margin of
error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The results were consistent with the most recent Newsweek poll,
taken June 1-2. It showed a statistical dead heat, 44 percent for
Bush and 43 percent for Gore, with 13 percent undecided.

<HEADLINE> Tamil Party: 500 Civilians Killed  </HEADLINE>
By DILIP GANGULY
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- A moderate Tamil political party on
Saturday accused the Sri Lankan government and separatist rebels of
killing at least 500 civilians during fighting in the country's
north.
</P>
<P>
   The Tamil United Liberation Front, or TULF, said shelling and
aerial bombing in the Jaffna peninsula left ''hundreds of civilians
grievously wounded,'' and caused immense destruction to civilian
property.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time a Tamil party made a categorical statement
about war casualties in the north, the major arena in Sri Lanka's
17-year insurgency. The government denied that its military had
targeted civilians; the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The TULF issued the statement after its executive committee met
in the capital, Colombo, but it did not say how it got the
information about the civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Although the battle for Jaffna has eased, 40,000 government
soldiers were still stationed there anticipating attacks by the
Tamil Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Sri Lankan military always takes utmost care that
civilians are not affected in any military operation,'' government
spokesman Ariya Rubasinghe said, and called the Tamil party's
accusation ''unfounded.''
</P>
<P>
   It was impossible to check on the allegations independently, as
reporters are barred by both the government and the rebels from
visiting the war zone, and telephone links to the northern
peninsula have been cut.
</P>
<P>
   International aid agency workers have said many civilians were
wounded in shelling and a handful of them were killed. In addition,
hundreds of thousands have been forced to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The Tamil political party also appealed to both the sides to
negotiate an end the conflict, saying civilians needed to resume
their normal lives in Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the rebels rejected a government invitation to give
up arms and join an Interim Council to govern Tamil majority areas.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have said they would accept nothing less than the
establishment of a separate nation for the island nation's 3.2
million minority Tamils, who they say are discriminated against by
the majority Sinhalese.

<HEADLINE> Five plead guilty in racially motivated attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CENTRAL ISLIP, N.Y. (AP) - Three men and two women have pleaded
guilty to attacking a black man from New Jersey outside a Long
Island bar solely because of his race.
</P>
<P>
   While being questioned by authorities Friday, all five admitted
they hurled racial slurs at Gregory Jean-Pierre at the Road House
Pub in Centereach last Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Manganello, 21, Nicholas Leocata, 23, and his brother,
Joseph Leocata, 27, of Centereach, N.Y., all pleaded guilty to
second-degree attempted assault and aggravated harassment. Raechal
Dunham, 22, and Bobbie-Jo White, 27, also of Centereach, pleaded
guilty to aggravated harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Pierre, 24, of Plainfield, N.J., and two white friends were
taunted by a large group when they entered the bar. The bar's owner
threw everyone out, and the assault began in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Pierre and his friends tried to escape, but members of the
crowd, wielding beer bottles, set upon him and one of his friends,
Brian Moran, 27, of Coram, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The Leocata brothers and Manganello admitted punching and
kicking Moran. The three escaped into a store where one of the men
worked, but the attackers broke down the door and continued the
assault, police said. The third man was not injured.
</P>
<P>
   In return for their pleas, the Leocatas are to serve 90 days in
jail, 700 hours of community service and three years' probation.
They also must attend a racial-sensitivity course at the Suffolk
Probation Department.
</P>
<P>
   Manganello got the same sentence, but he is to serve only 30
days in jail. Dunham and White are to be sentenced to three years'
probation and 280 hours of community service and must attend the
racial-sensitivity course.

<HEADLINE> New Haven man cleared in Central Park attacks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - A New Haven man who surrendered to New
York police in connection with the Central Park attacks following
the National Puerto Rican Day Parade has been cleared of criminal
charges, the New York County District Attorney's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Aerial Boxill, 28, was released but remains under investigation
by the district attorney's office, said spokeswoman Barbara
Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have evaluated the case and we have decided not to
prosecute ... now,'' Thompson told the New Haven Register. ''We're
still investigating this defendant's participation ... and if
additional evidence surfaces, we will evaluate and consider
charging the defendant at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxill surrendered to detectives Thursday, while two New York
men were apprehended by police. All three were charged with one
count of sexual abuse and one count of riot. Two others were
arrested and charged with sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Police are still seeking 17 suspects in the June 11 attacks.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury also indicted a ninth man on Thursday in connection
with the assaults on 57 women, who have told police they were
doused with water, chased, stripped, molested or assaulted. Several
others have reported being victims of robberies or attempted
robberies.

<HEADLINE> Central Europe Seeks Cooperation  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   SZEGED, Hungary (AP) -- A decade after abandoning communism, most
central European countries are still struggling to catch up
economically with the continent's more affluent Western states, 16
foreign ministers said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from countries of the Central European
Initiative were meeting in southern Hungary to discuss regional
issues and how to become more competitive with their Western
European neighbors, especially the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no vacuum in economic life, but there is very fierce
competition,'' said Janos Martonyi, foreign minister of Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Only two states at the convention, Italy and Austria, were EU
members. The others -- Albania, Belarus, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Czech
Republic, Hungary, Macedonia, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia,
Slovenia and Ukraine -- spoke of an urgent need for globalization
and integration of the European community.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 countries have a combined population of 230 million and a
total gross product of $2 trillion. But these factors alone are not
enough, delegates said.
</P>
<P>
   The less fortunate countries, particularly those affected by
recent wars in the Balkans, ''need to show they can help
themselves,'' said Stefano Pontecorvo, a representative of a U.S.
initiative called Stability Pact to develop the region.
</P>
<P>
   The pact has earmarked $1.1 billion for the region's
infrastructure, and almost as much is envisaged for developing the
private sector, education, media, environmental protection, refugee
return and other needs.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia's foreign minister, Tonino Picula, said his nation was
anxious to see specific benefits from the pact's 200 or so planned
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia was absent from the meeting, due to the international
isolation of its hard-line President Slobodan Milosevic. But the
country's problems were not ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Belgrade regime moves Serbia (the main Yugoslav republic)
farther away from the international community,'' Martonyi said.
''We cannot sit back with our arms crossed and do nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   A final document adopted at the meeting suggested support for
Serbia's democratic forces, but gave no fresh ideas on what to do
with the rogue leader and his regime, which has been outlawed by
the West. The other Yugoslav republic, Montenegro, was praised for
breaking with Milosevic's central government.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to show to the Serbian people that the international
community ... is not against them,'' said Romania's foreign
minister, Petre Roman, referring to last year's NATO bombing
launched to end Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic Albanian
separatists in Serbia's Kosovo province.

   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- A Red Cross official confirmed today that the gunmen
holding Fiji's deposed government hostage in parliament released their four
remaining female captives, including a minister in the ousted Cabinet. The four
women were among 31 hostages being held at the parliamentary complex in the

   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Fierce fighting between Muslims and Christians
flared for a fourth day in the capital of the Maluku Islands on Saturday,
leaving at least six people dead, officials said. Five Muslims and at least one
Christian soldier were killed when gangs of each faith exchanged gunfire and
fought with swords and spears early in the day in Ambon. The street battle took
place not far from a police complex that was set on fire when fighting erupted
Wednesday. Saturday's deaths brought to at least 41 the number of people killed

   ABOARD AIR FORCE TWO (AP) -- Al Gore accepts a federal court decision that
moves Elian Gonzalez closer to returning to Cuba, an aide to the vice
president's campaign said today. ''We're going to respect the decision of the
court,'' spokesman Chris Lehane said aboard Air Force Two as Gore flew from San
Francisco to Miami. ''At this point, we'll wish what's best for the boy,''
Lehane said. Many political observers feel Gore's standing with Cuban American
voters, particularly in South Florida, has been hurt by the Clinton

year prompted a yearlong occupation of the target range. Protesters vowed to
block the exercises, and a general assembly of citizens was convened outside the
gates to the range's Camp Garcia to discuss strategy. Protesters will be chosen
to trespass on to the range, but only after bombing has begun, said activist
Hector Pesquera, who added organizers don't want a spontaneous rush of
demonstrators that could put lives in jeopardy.

Clinton Seeks More For Drug Plan

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton wants to use $58 billion from the
growing budget surplus to help senior citizens pay for prescription drugs in
2002, revising an earlier proposal and offering more generous Medicare benefits
than current Republican plans. ''We have the money to do this now and do it
right,'' Clinton said today in his weekly radio address. Clinton outlined the
package he intends to send to Congress this week: a drug subsidy in 2002, a year
earlier than House Republicans are offering, and a $4,000 cap on an individual's
annual out-of-pocket medicine costs, compared with $6,000 under the GOP plan.

Saturday from Tunisia, where he had blamed Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak for
a lack of progress in the peace negotiations. Arafat was in Egypt for
discussions Sunday with President Hosni Mubarak. The essential problem, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency quoted Arafat as saying before leaving Tunisia, ''is

MENA reported.

already were in the bidding for Fusaichi Pegasus' potentially lucrative stud
career, with talk he might race only once more, in the Breeders' Cup Classic at
Churchill Downs in November. ''I've heard as high as $60 million,'' said Rich

<HEADLINE> NJ Airport Man Dies of Meningitis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Some passengers who landed on a flight from
Israel were notified Saturday that they might have been exposed to
meningococcal meningitis by a fellow passenger who died after
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials identified 13 people on El Al flight 17 from
Tel Aviv who were sitting in close proximity to the stricken
passenger, Joseph Ferraro, 20, of Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   All but one of the 13 had been notified by Saturday afternoon
that they should see a doctor as a precaution and consider
preventive antibiotic therapy.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known how Ferraro had contracted meningitis, but
health officials said there was no reason to believe there were any
further cases.
</P>
<P>
   Meningococcal meningitis is a bacterial infection of the
membranes around the brain and spinal cord. The symptoms include
fever, neck stiffness and headache. It is transmitted only through
close contact, such as transmission of saliva through kissing or
sharing utensils.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro died at 7:07 p.m. Friday, about two hours after he
arrived at Newark International Airport. Police were notified
Ferraro needed help and took him to a hospital, where he died.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro had been visiting Israel on a group bus tour sponsored
by a Jewish youth group. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention identified 89 people who were on the tour with him and
were notifying them of the possible risk.

<HEADLINE> Meatpacker Recalls Ground Beef  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Canadian packing plant of IBP Inc.
voluntarily recalled 46,000 pounds of ground beef products Saturday
because of possible contamination with E. coli 0157:H7, the second
recall in two days for the United States' largest beef processor.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service
said IBP-Lakeside Packers in Brooks, Alberta, produced the products
May 31 and shipped them to Kansas, Kentucky and Tennessee, as well
as to locations in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   All products sold in the United States were packed in 10-pound
vacuum-packed tubes, with eight tubes per case. Shipping cases were
marked L0231BH, L0311BH, L0791BH. Tubes under recall are marked
003800152A (or B), with one of the following codes: 81 GRD BEEF; 86
GRD BEEF; 73 GRD BEEF.
</P>
<P>
   The inspection service said the possible contamination was
discovered in laboratory tests by a customer in Canada and reported
to Canadian authorities, who relayed the warning to the USDA.
</P>
<P>
   No ailments have been reported from any of the recalled meat.
</P>
<P>
   In a release, the Lakeside plant said most of the beef was to
have been processed by grocers or restaurants before being sold to
consumers, which means no brand names or product codes are
available for home checks.
</P>
<P>
   IBP acquired the Lakeside Farm Industries in 1994, IBP's first
wholly owned subsidiary outside the United States. IBP is based in
Dakota Dunes, S.D.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, IBP recalled 266,000 pounds of ground meat produced
May 13 at a plant in Geneseo, Ill., also for possible E. coli
0157:H7 contamination.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria can cause bloody diarrhea and dehydration.
Children, the elderly and people with suppressed immune systems are
the most susceptible.
</P>
<P>
   The government recommends cooking all ground beef to at least
160 degrees to destroy bacteria.

<HEADLINE> Papa John Harassment Suit Dismissed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- A harassment case involving Papa John's
chief executive officer John H. Schnatter has been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Lesli P. Workman, 30, sued Schnatter, 38, and the pizza chain in
May 1998, alleging sexual discrimination, conspiracy, intentional
infliction of emotional distress, defamation and harassing
communications.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit and a counterclaim filed by Schnatter were dismissed
June 5. Judge John Potter, who had ordered mediation, said the
lawyers for each side told him the case had been settled.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys declined to say whether they had settled the case.
</P>
<P>
   In her lawsuit, Workman claimed that Schnatter sent her roses,
stopped by uninvited, threw rocks at her window and continually
made sexual advances even after she told him she could not have a
relationship with a married man.
</P>
<P>
   Schnatter countersued, alleging that Workman pursued him, sought
his personal advice, wanted him to pay her credit-card bills and
tried to extort $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Schnatter founded Papa John's in 1985 and has amassed a fortune
of more than $300 million.

<HEADLINE> El Al Passenger Dies of Meningitis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Some passengers who landed on a flight from
Israel were notified Saturday that they might have been exposed to
meningococcal meningitis by a fellow passenger who died after
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials identified 13 people on El Al flight 17 from
Tel Aviv who were sitting in close proximity to the stricken
passenger, Joseph Ferraro, 20, of Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   All but one of the 13 had been notified by Saturday afternoon
that they should see a doctor as a precaution and consider
preventive antibiotic therapy.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known how Ferraro had contracted meningitis, but
health officials said there was no reason to believe there were any
further cases.
</P>
<P>
   Meningococcal meningitis is a bacterial infection of the
membranes around the brain and spinal cord. The symptoms include
fever, neck stiffness and headache. It is transmitted only through
close contact, such as transmission of saliva through kissing or
sharing utensils.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro died at 7:07 p.m. Friday, about two hours after he
arrived at Newark International Airport. Police were notified
Ferraro needed help and took him to a hospital, where he died.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro had been visiting Israel on a group bus tour sponsored
by a Jewish youth group. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention identified 89 people who were on the tour with him and
were notifying them of the possible risk.

<HEADLINE> Whitman outlaws nudity at Cape May beach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Nudity is now a no-no along all but one
patch of the Jersey shore.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman closed a legal loophole that made clothing
optional along a stretch of the Cape May shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   The only exception to the law is the clothing-optional Gunnison
Beach at Gateway National Recreation Area on Sandy Hook, which is
part of the National Park system.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Jersey's beaches are the cleanest, most family-friendly
beaches in North America. We have an obligation to keep them that
way,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   With her signature, the governor formally approved special
legislation that outlaws nude bathing at Higbee Beach.
</P>
<P>
   A 300-foot section of the beach in Lower Township had been
exempt from state and local laws banning nudity.
</P>
<P>
   About 650 acres of the beach and dune preserve is federal
property, where the local restrictions did not apply.
</P>
<P>
   Area residents have long complained of sexual activity and lewd
behavior by tourists attracted to the nude beach.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials recently pointed to several Internet sites that
apparently promoted the beach and its all-natural option.
</P>
<P>
   ''I signed the legislation to completely ban nude sunbathing
last night, before summer tourism kicks into high gear at the
shore,'' Whitman said in statement released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a million and one appropriate things to do at the
beach. Nude sunbathing and lewd behavior on public property are not
among them,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Department of Fish, Game and Wildlife officials, who
help patrol the beach, have reported arrests for illegal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But beachgoers complain that new laws should target lewd
behavior, not the nudity.
</P>
<P>
   The law Whitman signed clarified an earlier law that ensured no
one can disrobe on government-owned land. The original law decreed
that a town could forbid nudity on ''state-owned lands within its
borders,'' but did not include federal land.
</P>
<P>
   The revised measure allows towns to prohibit nudity on all land
''under the jurisdiction of the state,'' which includes both state
and federally owned properties.
</P>
<P>
   Higbee Beach is leased to Lower Township, and therefore falls
under the state's jurisdiction. Gateway National Park is supervised
by the National Park Service.

<HEADLINE> Groom uses 'Net to bring wedding to parents  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) - Dan Abashian would have loved to have
his parents at his wedding Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But he would rather they be healthy enough to stick around
longer term so when illnesses prevented them from coming to the
wedding, Abashian turned to the Internet to bring the wedding to
them.
</P>
<P>
   He and new bride Nancy Housel arranged for a videographer to
film the wedding then contacted a local business to stream the feed
onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Cables were run in the church and at the local hospital where
Abashian's mother was recovering from cancer surgery. His father,
recovering in Jupiter, Fla., after chest pains and pacemaker
surgery, will watch from there as the couple says, ''I do.''
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony also was broadcast co-workers in Rochester and
family and friends as far away as Germany and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Aerie, pastor at First Congregational Church in
Binghamton, said he has never done an Internet wedding before.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you can use a technology like that to make a difference
in people's lives, it's tremendous,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> New Canadian Party Chooses Leader  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY (AP) -- Members of the Canadian Alliance voted Saturday
to chose a leader for the new political party they hope will unify
conservatives and topple the governing Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
   The result of the vote, expected late Saturday night, should
indicate whether the Alliance and its core support from the former
Reform Party has been able to poach disgruntled Conservative Party
members.
</P>
<P>
   Before launching the Alliance three months ago, the Reform Party
had grown to become the official opposition in Parliament. Alliance
leaders say the new movement offers Canadians a change after seven
years of Liberal Party rule under Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
</P>
<P>
   Saying it stands for true representative democracy -- illustrated
by its one-member, one-vote system to choose a leader instead of a
convention of delegates -- the Alliance stands for the fundamental
conservative principles of decentralized federal power, low taxes
and reduced debt.
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty over how the new party would deal with volatile
social issues, such as abortion, has illustrated the divisiveness
within Canada's political right, similar to the ideological rifts
among U.S. conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Four major candidates were vying for the leadership post
Saturday, with the winner to become the opposition leader in
Parliament and a major challenger for prime minister in
parliamentary elections next year. If none of the candidates gets
50 percent of Saturday's vote, a runoff between the top two will be
held July 8.
</P>
<P>
   Glitches and irregularities marred early voting, which began
Wednesday by telephone from remote areas and Quebec province. Some
members complained they never received security information needed
to cast a telephone vote, while others in eastern Quebec's Gaspe
region said they had received membership cards though they never
joined the Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   One candidate, Tom Long, apologized for what he called
overzealous party workers who purchased hundreds of the $6.50
memberships for people without telling them.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance's chances for defeating the Liberals depend on its
ability to grow in Ontario, the most populous province, as well as
in Quebec and other eastern regions.
</P>
<P>
   When it formed in March, almost all of its 70,000 members were
from the Reform Party, which in its 13 years has never won a
Parliament seat west of Manitoba. The Alliance says it now has
200,000 members, making it Canada's largest party. But this week's
irregularities cast doubt on that figure.
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party founder and leader Preston Manning engineered the
Alliance's creation as a way to forge a nationwide conservative
movement by attracting disillusioned supporters of the Conservative
Party, which last governed under Brian Mulroney in the 1980s and
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Manning and Long, an Ontario political strategist, both ran in
Saturday's leadership contest, along with former Alberta Treasurer
Stockwell Day and British Columbia politician Dr. Keith Martin.

<HEADLINE> Dallas' JFK Memorial Rededicated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The John F. Kennedy Memorial was rededicated
Saturday in a ceremony that paid homage to the assassinated
president.
</P>
<P>
   Since the memorial's dedication in 1970, its concrete walls had
become stained and chipped. The monument was further tarnished by a
recent graffiti attack.
</P>
<P>
   The three-month restoration attempted to bring the monument
closer to its original state and included the installation of
interpretive panels to help answer questions posed by visitors over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   The panels detail the concept behind the memorial's boxlike
structure -- an ''open tomb'' tribute to someone whose remains lie
elsewhere. Kennedy is buried in Arlington National Cemetery near
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The monument, which consists of four 30-foot-high concrete
walls, is located two blocks east of where the president was killed
by a sniper's bullet on Nov. 22, 1963. Inside, an 8-by-8-foot slab
of gray granite is inscribed with JFK's name.
</P>
<P>
   Services and materials for the $80,000 restoration were donated
by 10 construction-related companies.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Candidate Stages Rally  </HEADLINE>
By TRACI CARL
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Battling last-minute charges of illegal
foreign financing, Mexico's top opposition candidate for president
was closing his campaign in the capital Saturday with a mass rally
in the country's central plaza.
</P>
<P>
   In the final weekend of campaigning before the July 2 election,
Vicente Fox of the conservative National Action Party was in a
statistical dead heat in the polls with Francisco Labastida of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has governed
Mexico for 71 years.
</P>
<P>
   Shouting ''not one minute more of the PRI,'' a crowd of 50 Fox
supporters set fire to a Labastida campaign flag at the city's
independence monument before a planned march to the city's Zocalo
plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida drew 150,000 to the plaza last weekend for his last
campaign rally in Mexico City. A third candidate, Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, plans a rally there Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a T-shirt that read ''Democracy for Mexico Now,'' Lilia
Barajas said she was voting for Fox because the PRI hadn't been
able to improve the lives of Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are tired of promises that aren't fulfilled,'' she said,
watching Fox supporters dance in the streets to pounding pop music.
She complained that many Mexicans were still poor, and ''wanted to
be able to survive in a dignified way.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Fox again appealed to Cardenas' backers to join him
in toppling the governing party, known as the PRI. Cardenas is
running a distant third in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cuauhtemoc has no chance at all to win,'' Fox said during a
speech Friday in the Gulf coast oil city of Ciudad del Carmen.
''Let us unite the vote of the opposition to sink the candidacy of
Labastida and achieve great agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox suggested that Cardenas was leading his followers to
''collective suicide'' by refusing to unite the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, meanwhile, referred to Fox as a delinquent for
allegedly accepting campaign contributions from abroad, which is
banned in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we are seeing is what sort of patriotism or nationalism
somebody can have when he becomes a delinquent by accepting
resources from abroad,'' Cardenas said Friday in the northern city
of Monterrey.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI on Friday submitted a formal complaint to the Federal
Electoral Institute accusing Fox of receiving foreign
contributions, and offered copies of checks they said proved the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's aides insisted they have not received foreign funds and
said the checks were not evidence of it.
</P>
<P>
   They also accused the PRI of the very banking secrecy laws that
they have used as a reason for refusing to reveal the names of
prominent people whose debts were assumed by the government in a
massive bank bailout.

<HEADLINE> US Envoy Seeks Troop Withdrawl  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- U.S. envoy Dennis Ross met Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators Saturday to try to reach agreement on
Israeli troop withdrawals and other issues, American and
Palestinian officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ross met at an undisclosed location Saturday night with
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and his Israeli counterpart Oded
Eran, an American official said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The outstanding problems include release of Palestinian
prisoners from Israeli jails, opening of a second ''safe passage''
for Palestinians across Israeli territory, the Palestinian demand
for control of an airfield near Jerusalem and the third Israeli
troop withdrawal in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has proposed that the third troop redeployment be merged
with the permanent peace agreement, which the two sides are now
negotiating. The Palestinians say this would be a violation of the
interim accord.
</P>
<P>
   The redeployment was to have taken place on Friday but the
Palestinians agreed to postpone it until July 7 at the request of
the United States, Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
   Erekat submitted to Ross a list of 230 Palestinian prisoners
whom the Palestinians want Israel to release under the interim
agreement. Israel recently released three prisoners as a goodwill
gesture, which the Palestinians dismissed as patronizing.
</P>
<P>
   Eran asked Erekat for a report on collection of weapons by the
Palestinian Authority from opposition and other civilian groups as
required by the interim agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In last month's clashes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
civilian members of Yasser Arafat's Fatah group opened fire on
Israeli soldiers. Opposition groups such as Hamas are also known to
have firearms and sometimes carry them at demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Ross arrived in the region Thursday to assess prospects for a
Mideast summit in Washington during which Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat would try to
formulate the outlines of a peace treaty. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright was expected to join Ross this week.
</P>
<P>
   A final peace agreement will have to deal with the most
difficult issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including the
future of the Palestinian refugees, the status of Jerusalem and the
permanent borders.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat flew to Egypt on Saturday from Tunisia, where he blamed
Barak for a lack of progress in the peace negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Man gets 10 years in robbery of nun  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PATERSON, N.J. (AP) - A Passaic man was sentenced to 10 years in
prison for his role in the beating and robbery of a nun who was
attacked during her early morning walk.
</P>
<P>
   Giovany Rubio, 24, had been acquitted of robbery and assault in
May, but convicted of conspiracy to commit robbery in the Dec. 14,
1997, assault on Sister Maria De Lillo.
</P>
<P>
   De Lillo, a 59-year-old teacher with the Blessed Sacrament Roman
Catholic Church, was taking an early morning walk when she was
attacked. Her assailant beat her, stole a gold ring from her finger
bearing the mark of a crucifix and three chains from around her
neck, leaving her on the sidewalk with a broken nose, bleeding on
the brain and bruising. She was hospitalized in critical condition
following the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ''What was taken from her were the only material objects that
meant anything to her,'' Robert Pringle, the county senior
assistant prosecutor, said at the Friday sentencing. ''Most
important was her crucifix ring that she wore as a symbol to her
devotion to God - the same way I wear my wedding ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubio's attorney argued that Rubio's co-defendant, Juan
Giraldez, was solely responsible for the attack. Giraldez pleaded
guilty and was sentenced to seven years in exchange for his
testimony against Rubio.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors presented eyewitnesses who named Rubio and said
specks of the nun's blood were found on his coat.
</P>
<P>
   State Superior Court Judge Joseph J. Riva said Rubio was at risk
to commit another crime, and said that the jury's decision to
convict him on the conspiracy charge indicated members did not
believe Rubio's claim that he was asleep in bed at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ''This defendant could not see fit to express to Sister Maria
how sorry he is for what occurred,'' Riva said. ''That tells me
that he lacks remorse and compassion even today.''

<HEADLINE> Niagara Falls tower to be refurbished, not demolished  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. (AP) - A recommendation to renovate the
Prospect Point observation tower next to the American Falls is due
within a month, parks officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The state has pulled back on a $20 million plan to demolish the
tower, called ''hideous,'' ''a monstrosity,'' and ''a bridge to
nowhere,'' by Gov. George E. Pataki in 1998 when he first announced
plans to tear it down.
</P>
<P>
   The demolition plan included high-speed elevators to take
tourists to the Maid of the Mist boats but State Parks Commissioner
Bernadette Castro told The Buffalo News the project would be too
costly and dangerous to carry out.
</P>
<P>
   Castro said a ''panel of experts is still studying every
alternative'' to the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The state is considering installing faster elevators and
shortening the tower. The elevators currently take visitors to the
top of the 280-foot tower for views of the American and Canadian
falls and to the bottom of the gorge and to the Maid of the Mist
sightseeing boats.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the new elevators was to cut down on
lines for the Maid of the Mist tour boats. The proposed elevators
would have carried 2,500 people to the gorge every hour compared
with about 800 people an hour in the peak summer season, said
Jonathan M. Schultz, Maid of the Mist Corp.'s vice president of
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The waiting time to get aboard the boats from the U.S. side can
be as long as two hours in the summer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Maid of the Mist Corp. two years ago said it would
contribute $5 million toward the cost of the project, since the
tower is the only access on the U.S. side to the boats. Now, the
company is waiting to see what the state decision will be, said
Maid of the Mist president James V. Glynn.
</P>
<P>
   Once heralded as an engineering marvel, the observation tower at
Prospect Point between the Rainbow Bridge and the American Falls
has been a sore point for years.

Clinton Seeks More Money For Drug Plan

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton wants to use $58 billion from the
growing budget surplus to help senior citizens pay for prescription drugs in
2002, revising an earlier proposal and offering more generous Medicare benefits
than current Republican plans. Clinton outlined the package he intends to send
to Congress this week in his weekly radio address today: a drug subsidy in 2002,
a year earlier than House Republicans are offering, and a $4,000 cap on an
individual's annual out-of-pocket medicine costs, compared with $6,000 under the

   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- A Red Cross official confirmed today that the gunmen
holding Fiji's deposed government hostage in parliament released their four
remaining female captives, including a minister in the ousted Cabinet. The four
women were among 31 hostages being held at the parliamentary complex in the

<HEADLINE> Green Party Adopts Platform  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN K. PAULSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The Green Party adopted a platform Saturday
focusing on political reform, human rights, the environment and
corporate responsibility as members prepared to nominate consumer
advocate Ralph Nader for president.
</P>
<P>
   While delegates to the national convention of the Association of
State Green Parties debated their platform, Nader said his 50-state
tour had given him ''the distinct feeling that America wants a
change, a change from the dominance of the two major political
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader said the major parties offer little more than
''Band-Aids'' for health, child poverty, job security and other
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party is focusing on people who feel left out of the
democratic process because ''money counts more than citizen
participation at the grass roots,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nader said that four years ago, when he sat out most of the
campaign as the Green Party candidate while the party tried to get
organized, fewer than 50 percent of the eligible voters cast
ballots. He said the Green Party is counting on some of those
nonvoters this year to pull support from the two major political
parties and force them to face the issues.
</P>
<P>
   Nader also criticized Republicans and Democrats for refusing to
include him in debates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Neither George W. Bush nor Albert Gore want to face new ideas.
They want to keep the presidential election an insider game,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two others, Jello Biafra and Stephen Gaskin, also are seeking
the Green Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The platform, which passed by more than a two-thirds majority,
included a major change over term limits. Platform chairman Steve
Schmidt said the party abandoned term limits this year and came out
in favor of proportional representation, which he said gives
independent voters more power.
</P>
<P>
   The 317 delegates from 39 states also rejected an attempt to
delete support for the Brady gun-registration bill from the
platform. Nevada delegate Sandi Rizzo told conventioneers it would
be ''political suicide'' for a Green Party candidate in her state
to support gun control, but delegates refused to debate the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said the party also supported the right to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   The platform also endorsed gay and lesbian rights in housing,
jobs, civil marriage, benefits and child custody and the right to
openly embrace sexual orientation.

<HEADLINE> Undecided May Control Japan Vote  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH COLEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Only one hurdle stands between Japan's ruling
coalition and victory in Sunday's lower house elections: a legion
of undecided voters.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori's Liberal Democrats are in a
position of strength ahead of the vote. Polls show them with firm
chances of holding onto power, and the opposition has failed to
present a credible challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The only question mark left as polls opened Sunday morning was a
large chunk of voters who have not yet decided whom to cast ballots
for -- a volatile bunch that could conceivably tip the scales
against the government. In a recent survey in Asahi newspaper, 52
percent of respondents said they supported no party, and 70 percent
of those said they were still undecided whom to vote for.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few days ago, Mori -- in the type of verbal gaffe that has
typified his short term in office -- said he hoped the undecided
would stay in bed on election day.
</P>
<P>
   At his final campaign stops Saturday, Mori pushed hard on his
top election theme: that the Liberal Democratic Party and its two
coalition partners are the only ones who can provide the stability
needed to see Japan through its economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to make sure that the economy is in recovery and to
push economic reforms,'' he told a crowd outside a train station in
a residential Tokyo neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Barring an unexpected exodus of undecided voters to the
opposition, however, the ruling party should not face much trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the premier's unpopularity and the still-weak state of
the economy, the conservative LDP on its own is expected to win at
least 241 seats, a simple majority of the 480-seat chamber. Polls
show that majority could reach as high as 263 seats.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the 12-day campaign has been the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Japan logged a year of economic growth -- a slight 0.5 percent --
in the fiscal year that ended March 31 after two years of
shrinkage, part of a series of signs showing the economy may be
coming to life after a decade-long slump.
</P>
<P>
   But troubles remain. The unemployment rate is still at 4.8
percent, near a record high, and bankruptcies are rising. Corporate
restructuring and other social problems are believed to be behind
the country's rising suicide and crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   The LDP and its coalition partners have vowed to continue a
massive, two-year fiscal spending program aimed at propelling the
economy into recovery. Mori has already ordered work on another
supplemental budget.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, meanwhile, has focused on the hefty price-tag
for that policy: a public debt that totals more than 130 percent of
Japan's gross domestic product. The Democrats, the largest
opposition party, are pushing for a tax increase to shore up
government finances.
</P>
<P>
   ''Japan is teetering on the edge of a cliff, and only the
Democratic Party can show the people how to turn the situation
around,'' party leader Yukio Hatoyama said to a crowd gathered in
the rain outside a Tokyo train station Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the opposition has struggled to put together a credible
alternative to LDP rule. Hatoyama has been coy about who his
coalition partners would be, and it is difficult under any
circumstances to win votes by promising a tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that interest is high in the election, which
follows a tumultuous couple of months in Japanese politics.
</P>
<P>
   Mori took over on April 5, days after then-Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi suffered a stroke and fell into a coma, provoking a
succession crisis. The government delayed telling the nation of
Obuchi's illness for a full day, and accusations of a cover-up
dogged the first month of Mori's rule.
</P>
<P>
   Mori's selection as prime minister also quickly came under fire.
The premier had never held the posts of foreign or finance
minister, two jobs considered stepping stones to the prime
ministership, and he was widely criticized as a policy lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   He also has had a hard time avoiding controversial statements.
He told a religious group that Japan was a ''divine nation'' and
was so severely attacked for conjuring up memories of Japan's
wartime emperor-worship that he called a special news conference to
explain himself.

<HEADLINE> Royals 8, Athletics 3  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- The Oakland Athletics built a nine-game
winning streak on home runs and big comebacks. When their offense
fizzled Saturday against a pitcher making his first start of the
season and three relievers, the streak ended.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Quinn hit a three-run homer and Luis Ordaz added three RBIs
with a two-run single and a sacrifice fly in the Kansas City
Royals' 8-3 win over the A's.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland, which hit .368 during the winning streak and averaged
more than 10 runs a game, was held to two extra-base hits -- a
first-inning double by Jason Giambi and a double by Randy Velarde
in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reichert, making his first start of the year after 26 relief
appearances, allowed one run in four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Bottalico (7-1) pitched the final 2 2-3 innings for the
win, surviving a bases-loaded jam in the seventh when first baseman
Mike Sweeney made a leaping grab of Eric Chavez's liner to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn's eighth homer of the season knocked Heredia out in the
sixth. Ordaz had his two-run single in the fifth, when the Royals --
who broke a three-game losing streak -- also got an RBI single by
Jeff Reboulet.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Heredia (9-5) allowed six runs and eight hits in 5 1-3
innings. He's 2-4 at home this season, 7-1 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Giambi, Miguel Tejada and Velarde had RBI singles for the A's.
</P>
<P>
   Giambi, who went 3-for-4 with a walk, has reached base safely in
nine consecutive plate appearances before striking out in the
ninth. He went 3-for-3 with two walks in the A's 10-6 win over the
Royals on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Giambi, who had a homer and two doubles on Friday night, is
hitting .500 (19-for-38) against the Royals this season.
</P>
<P>
Notes: A's pitching coach Rick Peterson was ejected in the sixth
by plate umpire Gerry Davis, the first ejection for Oakland this
season. ... The nine-game winning streak matched the fourth longest
in Oakland history and was the longest in the AL this season. ...
Quinn's homer was just the eighth allowed by Heredia in 94 innings
this season. ... Oakland's Terrence Long extended his hitting
streak to 13 games with a pair of singles. ... Bottalico, who began
the season as the Royals' closer but lost the job in May, leads
Kansas City in wins and his five saves leave him just one behind
Jerry Spradlin for the team lead. ... Giambi, who came in second in
the AL with 72 RBIs, has 21 RBIs in his last 15 games.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Raises Millions in Talks  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton probably wishes he got paid
by the word. Just one of the 10 fund-raising talks he gave in
recent days would have brought him a little over $181 per bon mot.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a 20-minute, 2,761-word nightcap speech to an
affectionate crowd that brought in an estimated $500,000 for
Democrats -- and he got to listen to Lionel Ritchie sing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wound up a West Coast fund-raising circuit unusual for
its vigor and its unabashed employment of the president as his
party's most successful and tireless rainmaker and headed back to
the White House Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
   In three days and three cities, Clinton talked for his supper 10
times to raise an estimated $4.2 million for Democratic candidates
and the party's national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Supper was beef filet for a select group of 50 at that
Democratic National Committee dinner with Ritchie on Friday night,
and rack of lamb for 60 in San Diego the night before. Donors paid
$5,000 and $10,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gave some version of his standard political pep talk at
each stop -- praising Vice President Al Gore as effective and
visionary and claiming that Republicans are promising far more than
they can responsibly deliver in this fall's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ''You need to tell people when you leave here, I'm glad I went
there yesterday, because I understand clearly now that this is a
really important election,'' Clinton said at a brunch reception
Saturday to benefit Sen. Dianne Feinstein's re-election campaign.
''I understand clearly that there are real differences with real
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the speech was a little dog-eared by Version X on Saturday
afternoon, or maybe Clinton was as hot and fidgety as the crowd at
the Feinstein party, but he cut the last money speech short -- to a
mere 1,050 words.
</P>
<P>
   He waxed wordier a short time later at a speech to state
Democratic organizers which netted no money. He also took sharper
aim at Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive GOP presidential
nominee, as part of his standard claim that the GOP is trying to
appear more moderate than it really is.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't see them passing out copies of the Texas Republican
platform, do you?'' Clinton said. He noted that while in Texas last
week, a friend described to the platform to him this way: ''It was
so bad that you could get rid of every fascist tract in your
library if you just had a copy of the Texas Republican platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not identify the friend or what it was about the
platform that he considered so bad.
</P>
<P>
   But he added a note about Bush. ''I noticed their leader didn't
go to the (state party) convention and he didn't repudiate it,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who has been making a point of saying there is no
need for negative campaigning, appeared to catch himself right
after his remarks about Bush and the platform.
</P>
<P>
   ''I say that in a good-natured way,'' he said. ''I don't think
we have to have negative campaigns and I don't think we should.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Texas state party convention earlier this month, some
delegates said they quit donating money to the party because of its
strong stand against gay marriages and there also were
disagreements between religious conservatives and moderates over
the platform's strong stand against abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Other items include calls for elimination of high estate taxes
and income tax penalties for married couples, private investment of
some Social Security money and keeping the U.S. military out of
foreign countries that are not a direct threat to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, Clinton raised $1.5 million at an exclusive
gathering at the Los Angeles home of Republican Mayor Richard
Riordan to help underwrite the nominating convention that Democrats
will hold in Los Angeles in August.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also met privately with donors and supporters to try to
raise money for the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's tour took him from fancy hotel ballrooms in Phoenix
and San Diego to the palatial, tastefully illuminated lawns of
music promoter Kenneth ''Babyface'' Edmonds in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   He also helped Democrats collect relatively small checks at
events held in a hot, loud outdoor tent in San Diego and a hip
Hollywood club called the Garden of Eden in Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Deal Gets Home-Cage Advantage  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Lance Deal's victory lap was even slower
than usual, but the bulky thrower wanted to savor every last cheer.
</P>
<P>
   Deal, 38, is retiring after this season, and Saturday's
Prefontaine Classic was his last meet in front of the fans that
have cheered him for the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was sort of the beginning of the end,'' said Deal, the
American record-holder in the hammer throw.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of respect, race organizers awarded Deal jersey No. 1,
and he was the last competitor in the order. He had the event won
by the second of six rounds, but he saved his most powerful throw
for last -- a heave of 262 feet, 11 inches. He has the top two
American throws this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just trying to give something to the people who stuck
around,'' said Deal, whose U.S. record is 270-9.
</P>
<P>
   Deal was helped by the absence of the 1996 Olympic gold
medalist, Hungarian Balazs Kiss, who was not able to enter the
country because of a visa problem.
</P>
<P>
   Deal, who will be 39 when the Olympics begin in mid-September in
Sydney, wants to spend more time with his wife and 7-year-old
daughter, Sarah. He also plans to stay involved with the sport by
helping to develop a safer throwing cage.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his enormous popularity in Eugene, Deal has never
competed in the spotlight at Hayward. The hammer area is off to the
south of the main stadium. At the Atlanta Olympics, where he won a
silver, the hammer was held in the infield, where fans can see it
better.
</P>
<P>
   Deal has always been bothered by his event's low profile at
Hayward, but meet organizers fear that someone could get seriously
injured if a 16-pound hammer and chain were to fly out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Those fears were partly realized Saturday when a hammer
official, Loren Swanson, was hit by the chain portion of the
apparatus after it was thrown by Patrick Suter of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson, who made the mistake of running directly into the
hammer's path instead of away from it, suffered a compound fracture
of his right forearm. He was taken from the field in an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   ''That kind of took the fun out of it,'' Deal said. ''The
official saw the ball and made a mistake you only make once, and
tried to outrun it. You never want to turn your back on the ball.''

<HEADLINE> California Rep. Tours Sports Book  </HEADLINE>
By ANGIE WAGNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Congressman Robert Matsui looked up at the sea
of red, green and orange lights and spotted the odds on Tiger Woods
winning the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   The California Democrat might not know a lot about sports
betting, but he knew a sure thing when he saw it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe I'll bet my house on it,'' he said Saturday while
touring the sports book operation at The Mirage hotel-casino on the
Las Vegas Strip.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate over whether college sports betting should be
banned heats up in Congress, Matsui, in town for a private
gathering, wanted to see for himself how sports books operate.
</P>
<P>
   Matsui, who had never seen a sports book before, got a crash
course in how bets are taken in and paid, how odds are set and how
regulated the betting is.
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda Acuna, assistant race and sports book director at The
Mirage, showed Matsui how a gambler's driver's license is scanned
into a computer if a bet of more than $10,000 is made. That high of
a bet has to be reported to the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything here is so well controlled by our state,'' Acuna
said, giving Matsui a tour.
</P>
<P>
   Matsui said he was impressed with the sports book operation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something that should remain,'' he said, looking up at
the huge televisions showing various sports. ''We shouldn't tamper
with this. This has probably the greatest enforcement and control
than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   A Senate committee voted in April to ban betting on college
sports -- a practice legal only in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would outlaw betting on Olympic, college or high
school athletic events. Though there is little legal betting on the
Olympics and none on high school sports, Nevada's gambling industry
accepts bets on college sporting events that do not involve a
school in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada gambling industry took in $2.3 billion in sports
wagers in fiscal 1999, with 30 percent to 40 percent bet on college
sports.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the amateur sports betting ban have said it would
help in the broader fight against illegal gambling on college
campuses. Those opposed to the bill say it will just spread illegal
gambling because legal gambling would be taken away.
</P>
<P>
   The House has not yet held hearings on a similar bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a form of entertainment,'' Matsui said. ''It's totally
regulated and should be able to continue on.''
</P>
<P>
   Matsui is a co-sponsor of a bill proposed by Reps. Shelley
Berkley, D-Nev., and Jim Gibbons, R-Nev., that calls for a study of
illegal gambling. Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., sponsored a similar bill
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Berkley said she invited Matsui to the sports book because she
wanted him to see how regulated gambling is in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this was very successful,'' she said after the tour.
''He will be a strong advocate for Nevada's position.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Feldman, spokesman for Mirage-owner MGM Grand, said showing
members of Congress Nevada's sports books is the only way they can
understand the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Jacobsen of San Diego was monitoring the horse race he bet
on Saturday as Matsui and Berkley made their way through the sports
book.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love this town,'' he said, listing his winnings for the day.
</P>
<P>
   As for banning one of his hobbies, Jacobsen said it wouldn't
solve anything.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are going to go back to bookies.''

<HEADLINE> Mexican Candidate's Rally Starts  </HEADLINE>
By TRACI CARL
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Battling last-minute charges of illegal
foreign financing, Mexico's top opposition candidate for president
closed his campaign in the capital Saturday with a mass rally in
the country's central plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Chanting ''Fox! Fox! Fox!,'' crowds poured through the narrow
streets of the city center and nearly filled the massive Zocalo
plaza for Vicente Fox of the conservative National Action Party.
</P>
<P>
   In the final weekend of campaigning before the July 2 election,
Fox was in a statistical dead heat in the polls with Francisco
Labastida of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which
has governed Mexico for 71 years.
</P>
<P>
   Shouting ''not one minute more of the PRI,'' a crowd of 50 Fox
supporters set fire to a Labastida campaign flag at the city's
independence monument before taking part in one of several marches
to the Zocalo.
</P>
<P>
   The noisy, flag-waving crowd for Fox appeared to equal the
150,000 Labastida drew to the plaza last weekend for his own final
campaign rally in Mexico City. A much larger percentage of the
Labastida supporters, however, had been trucked in by the party.
</P>
<P>
   A third candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, plans a rally there
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a T-shirt that read ''Democracy for Mexico Now,'' Lilia
Barajas said she was voting for Fox because the PRI hadn't been
able to improve the lives of Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are tired of promises that aren't fulfilled,'' she said,
watching Fox supporters dance in the streets to pounding pop music.
She complained that many Mexicans were still poor, and ''wanted to
be able to survive in a dignified way.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Fox again appealed to Cardenas' backers to join him
in toppling the governing party, known as the PRI. Cardenas is
running a distant third in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cuauhtemoc has no chance at all to win,'' Fox said during a
speech Friday in the Gulf coast oil city of Ciudad del Carmen.
''Let us unite the vote of the opposition to sink the candidacy of
Labastida and achieve great agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox suggested that Cardenas was leading his followers to
''collective suicide'' by refusing to unite the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, meanwhile, referred to Fox as a delinquent for
allegedly accepting campaign contributions from abroad, which is
banned in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we are seeing is what sort of patriotism or nationalism
somebody can have when he becomes a delinquent by accepting
resources from abroad,'' Cardenas said Friday in the northern city
of Monterrey.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI on Friday submitted a formal complaint to the Federal
Electoral Institute accusing Fox of receiving foreign
contributions, and offered copies of checks they said proved the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's aides insisted they have not received foreign funds and
said the checks were not evidence of it.
</P>
<P>
   They also accused the PRI of the very banking secrecy laws that
they have used as a reason for refusing to reveal the names of
prominent people whose debts were assumed by the government in a
massive bank bailout.

Veterans Mark 'Forgotten War'
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) -- Fifty years after North Korea attacked the South as
Koreans slept, Korean War veterans from the United States and elsewhere gathered
at former battlegrounds this week to remember. The war lasted three years, cost
millions of lives and left a small peninsula nation divided. One American
veteran brought the South Korean flag he saved from his days as a U.S. marine in
the early 1950s; another returned to the port city of Inchon where his flotilla
launched the daring landing that would change the course of the 1950-53 war.

were taken out under heavy police escort and delivered to their homes if they

   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- When Secretary of State Madeleine Albright makes her
third trip in a month to the Middle East this week, she would like to invite
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to a
summit with President Clinton. But Albright does not think either the Israeli or
Palestinian leader is ready to go to the summit with a reasonable expectation
that an agreement could be hammered out with Clinton's hands-on intervention, a
senior U.S. official familiar with her thinking said Saturday. She also realizes
that a summit cannot be delayed until the two leaders are nearly in accord, said
the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton wants to use $58 billion from the
growing budget surplus to help senior citizens pay for prescription drugs in
2002, revising an earlier proposal and offering more generous Medicare benefits
than current Republican plans. Clinton outlined the package he intends to send
to Congress this week in his weekly radio address today: a drug subsidy in 2002,
a year earlier than House Republicans are offering, and a $4,000 cap on an
individual's annual out-of-pocket medicine costs, compared with $6,000 under the

   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Battling last-minute charges of illegal foreign

Chanting ''Fox! Fox! Fox!,'' crowds poured through the narrow streets of the
city center and nearly filled the massive Zocalo plaza for Vicente Fox of the
conservative National Action Party. In the final weekend of campaigning before
the July 2 election, Fox was in a statistical dead heat in the polls with

<HEADLINE> Cayuga tribe enters casino sweepstakes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - A casino operator is hedging its bets in
its drive to build a gaming center in New York, contacting a third
Indian tribe as it searches for a partner.
</P>
<P>
   The Cayugas are the latest tribe in the state to be approached
by Catskill Development LLC about operating a casino and the
harness-race track at the Monticello Raceway in Sullivan County.
</P>
<P>
   Clint Halftown of Erie County, spokesman for the Cayuga Nation,
said the tribe is reviewing a proposal for it to operate a casino,
the Syracuse Newspapers reported in Saturday's edition.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd A. Kaplan, a spokesman for Catskill Development LLC,
declined comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Halftown said the Cayugas' governing body has not seen details
of the proposal or made a decision on whether to consider the
casino idea.
</P>
<P>
   The Sullivan County casino would be about 90 miles northwest of
New York City on Route 17, closer to the city than casinos in
Atlantic City, N.J. and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''It almost looks like the developers down there are going down
the list of the Six Nations tribes. We must be next in line after
the Oneidas and Mohawks,'' Halftown told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Rex Hackler, spokesman for the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs,
said his office has not seen anything on a Cayuga-Catskill
Development partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Oklahoma, said it was
interested in a Catskill casino, chief Jerry Dilliner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneida Nation was the first tribe approached in 1995 but a
disagreement over profit sharing led that tribe to strike out on
its own and open Turning Stone Casino Resort on reservation land in
Verona, Oneida County.
</P>
<P>
   Around September 1995, the developers turned to the St. Regis
Mohawks of Northern New York. But the Mohawks, who opened a casino
of their own on their St. Regis reservation on the U.S.-Canadian
border in March 1999, hooked up with Park Place Entertainment, one
of the world's largest gambling companies.
</P>
<P>
   The state Assembly Friday delayed action on a measure requiring
legislative and local authorization before Indian tribes can open
gambling casinos on non-tribal lands. Currently, only the
governor's approval is required. The state Senate passed the bill
last week.

<HEADLINE> Avs Trade Ozolinsh to Carolina  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Faced with difficult negotiations in trying to
re-sign All-Star defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh, the Colorado Avalanche
traded him to the Carolina Hurricanes on Saturday in a deal also
involving defenseman Nolan Pratt and four draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   Ozolinsh, a restricted free agent who made $4 million last
season but who slumped in the latter stages of the playoffs, became
expendable after the Avalanche signed veteran defenseman Ray
Bourque to a one-year, $5.5 million contract on June 14.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sad to see him go because he is a quality player,''
general manager Pierre Lacroix said. ''There was a lot of interest.
''The last five years, it has been pretty clear that we are
building for the future while winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven other key Avalanche players are due new contracts for next
season, putting a burden on Colorado's already hefty payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the NHL entry draft on Saturday, the Avalanche dealt
Ozolinsh and a second-round pick (No. 32) to Carolina for Pratt and
the Hurricanes' first three picks (Nos. 14, 47 and 63).
</P>
<P>
   With the 14th choice, Colorado selected center Vaclav Nedorost
of the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Ozolinsh, 27, is one of the better offensive-minded defensemen
in the NHL. The Latvian had 52 points including 16 goals last
season, his eighth in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Lacroix insisted that potentially difficult talks with Ozolinsh
had ''nothing to do with'' the trade, and said the organization,
even with new ownership, has no intention of cutting costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt that the timing was there to make that kind of
decision,'' he said. ''I called Sandis before we announced it. It
was not a fun call to make. It's the nature of the business, and we
have to live with it. I'm sure he understands.''
</P>
<P>
   By dealing Ozolinsh and moving up in the draft, Lacroix was able
to obtain a player he coveted. Because Boston took Colorado's
first-round choice at No. 27 in the Bourque deal, the Avalanche
would have been without a first-rounder.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt, 24, was Hartford's fourth choice in the 1993 draft. In 64
games last season, the 6-foot-2, 195-pounder had three goals, one
assist and 90 penalty minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pratt will add a physical presence to our defensive corps,''
Lacroix said.

<HEADLINE> Coyotes Acquire May From Canucks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- The Phoenix Coyotes acquired left wing
Brad May Saturday from the Vancouver Canucks for future
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes general manager Bobby Smith said May signed a multiyear
contract but would not disclose financial terms.
</P>
<P>
   May, 28, had nine goals, seven assists and 90 penalty minutes in
59 games last season. He was obtained by the Canucks in February
1998 in a trade with Buffalo for Geoff Sanderson.
</P>
<P>
   May was the Sabres' first round draft pick in 1990 and had a
career-high 309 penalty minutes in 69 games as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   The rugged forward scored a career-best 18 goals in 84 games in
1993-94 and has 1,556 penalty minutes in 571 career NHL games.

<HEADLINE> Gore Accepts Court's Elian Decision  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Al Gore accepts a federal court decision that moves
Elian Gonzalez closer to returning to Cuba, an aide to the vice
president's campaign said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to respect the decision of the court,'' spokesman
Chris Lehane said aboard Air Force Two as Gore flew from San
Francisco to Miami for a Demoratic fund-raiser and party dinner.
''We have a judicial process in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, we'll wish what's best for the boy,'' Lehane
said.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in Florida, Gore went to the toney Miami Beach home of
Phil Levine, chairman of On Board Media where gave his standard pep
talk to couples paying $5,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest in a string of high-dollar events in the past few
days, Gore brought in $250,000 in ''soft money'' for the Democratic
National Committee, sticking to main campaign themes.
</P>
<P>
   He also was the featured attraction at a $125-per-person dinner
in suburban Bal Harbour that raised $500,000 for the state's
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane, meanwhile, renewed his assault on Sen. Arlen Specter,
R-Pa., for disclosing a Justice Department official's
recommendation that an independent counsel be named to look into
Gore's 1996 fund raising. Lehane labeled that a ''smear tactic'' of
leaking confidential information.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the 12-member 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta denied a request by the 6-year-old Elian's Miami relatives
for a custody rehearing and said it would not look at the case
again.
</P>
<P>
   The court said it would grant no further delays, and its earlier
stay requiring Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to keep Elian
in the United States will dissolve at 4 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Father and son are staying in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Many political observers feel Gore's standing with voters,
particularly in South Florida, with its large Cuban American
population, has been hurt by the Clinton administration's efforts
to return Elian to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Gore believes a family court, rather than federal judges, should
decide the case -- a position counter to the administration's. He
also broke with the administration by supporting legislation to
grant permanent resident status to Elian, his father and other
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said the issue has been debated and settled and that Gore
did not plan to address it during his campaign swing Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was expected to discuss Social Security and Medicare,
issues important to Florida's sizable elderly community.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats outnumber Republicans in the state, which has 25
electoral votes, fourth most in the country. But a Florida poll in
May put Republican George W. Bush at 47 percent and Gore at 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush's brother, Jeb, is Florida's governor, Gore's
strategists contend they can run a competitive race in the state.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - The U.S. Navy has canceled a demonstration
of the F-14 Tomcat because the team that was to fly the fighter jet
was killed Sunday in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The Tomcats were to be part of the Syracuse International Air
Show on July 8 and 9. On Sunday, though, pilot Lt. William Joseph
Dey and radar intercept officer Lt. David Erick Bergstom died when
the F-14 plunged into woods near the airport in Willow Grove, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The men flew from the Fighter Squadron 101 stationed at Oceana
Naval Air Station in Oceana, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was told that was our pilot,'' Syracuse Aviation
Commissioner Charles Everett said Friday. ''They have several
teams, and that was the one that crashed.''
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's crash, the Navy said it had no plans to ground
its F-14s or to cancel participation in air shows. The cause of
Sunday's crash is under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Gentry Wins Women's Trap Title  </HEADLINE>
By KEITH PARSONS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Cindy Gentry is going to her second straight
Olympics. This time, she gets to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry, of Stone Mountain, worked as an official in the shooting
events in the 1996 Atlanta Games. On Saturday, she won the women's
trap title -- and lone spot on the U.S. Olympic team -- at the USA
Shooting National Championships and Final Olympic Team Selection
Match at Wolf Creek Trap and Skeet Range.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was really something to come back four years and later
and make the Olympic team,'' Gentry said.
</P>
<P>
   Scores from a spring trial at Fort Benning were added to totals
from this event.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Bade and Josh Lakatos qualified for the two men's trap
spots on the U.S. team, repeating what turned out to be their
medal-winning appearances from 1996. Lakatos won the silver and
Bade the bronze in those Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say it was harder to make the team this time,'' said
Bade, who won the men's trap national title. ''There was more
pressure this time, so I think Josh and I both earned our spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Bade handled the pressure well, missing just two targets in his
final 100 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''I started kind of slow, but there at the end, I just got in a
rhythm,'' said Bade, who trains at the U.S. Olympic Center in
Colorado Springs, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry entered this competition 12 points behind leader Joetta
Dement but steadily made up ground each day.
</P>
<P>
   In the final round Saturday, Gentry's score of 92 was three
points better than the next highest, and 13 more than Dement.
Theresa DeWitt finished second overall, eight points behind Gentry.
</P>
<P>
   Dement had back-to-back 79s on the final two days and dropped to
third. She and DeWitt are both members of the U.S. Army
Marksmanship Unit at Fort Benning.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Herman finished third in men's trap, five back of
Lakatos.
</P>
<P>
   Lakatos said he was lucky to finish the competition after he
suffered back spasms Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't even walk, much less shoot,'' said Lakotos, who
lives in Pasadena, Calif. ''For some reason, we had a late time
Friday, so I got some treatment and was able to go. I couldn't bend
my knees or bend over, I just had to stand straight up and try not
to move.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm surprised I was even shooting. So to make the team, that
is really a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   In other events Saturday, Colombian Andres Torres took a
six-point advantage in men's running target, and Terry Anderson of
Dallas holds a one-point lead on John Bickar of Colorado Springs in
rapid fire pistol.

   In Saturday's other game, Portugal beat Turkey 2-0 at Amsterdam
on a pair of goals by Nuno Gomes. Portugal plays Wednesday against
the winner of Sunday's game between world champion France and
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Totti put the Italians ahead in the 33rd minute and Inzaghi
scored in the 43rd.
</P>
<P>
   ''This team has shown real character and a great will to win,''
Totti said.

   Italy's only European title was in 1968, when it beat Yugoslavia
in the final.

<P>
   ''Some thought reaching the quarterfinals was impossible, and
we're happy with what we've accomplished,'' Italy coach Dino Zoff
said. ''But we have to play much better.''

   Hagi, playing his 125th game for Romania, was given a yellow
card early in the second half for a foul that forced Antonio Conte
out of the game. He was ejected by Portugese referee Vitor Manuel
Melo in the 60th minute after diving in an attempt to get a penalty
kick, and then arguing when he didn't get the call.
</P>
<P>
   Romania, which reached the quarterfinals by rallying past
England 3-2 earlier in the week, was missing team captain Gheorghe
Popescu, out of the competition with a ruptured calf muscle, and
Cosmin Contra, Dan Petrescu and Adrian Ilie, all serving one-game
suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   At Amsterdam, Gomes scored his first goal with one minute
remaining in the first half, deflecting a cross from Luis Figo past
goalkeeper Rustu Recber with a diving header.
</P>
<P>
   In the 56th minute, Figo got by Hakan Unsal with a fake and put
a precision pass on the foot of the unmarked Gomes, who tapped the
ball into an empty net.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey had been down a man since the 29th minute when Alpay
Ozalan was sent off for hitting Fernando Couto when both were down
after a duel for the ball in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Couto missed a penalty kick in the final minute of the first
half, shooting the ball straight at goalkeeper Vitor Baia.
</P>
<P>
   Because of rain, the roof of Amsterdam ArenA was closed for the
first time in the tournament,

<HEADLINE> Astacio Trial Delayed for Witnesses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The delay in a domestic violence trial for
Colorado Rockies pitcher Pedro Astacio avoids interrupting his
career and gives his defense team time to locate key witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''We filed a motion on behalf of Pedro to continue the trial
because of the unavailability of some witnesses,'' said his lawyer,
Jeffrey Springer. ''The victim had no objection to the motion.''
</P>
<P>
   Astacio's trial was postponed from July 5 to Nov. 15. ''It's in
the middle of the baseball season, and I don't think he should be
forced to have his career jeopardized more than a doctor or a
construction worker or anyone else,'' Springer said. ''There's
nothing unusual here. There's no wheeling and dealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockies officials have not been involved in Astacio's defense,
Springer said.
</P>
<P>
   Astacio, 30, initially pleaded guilty to third-degree assault
but was allowed to withdraw the plea after immigration officials
began proceedings to deport him to his native Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Astacio was arrested Aug. 12, one day after his estranged wife
told Greenwood Village police he hit her in the right eye during an
argument at the home they shared until their separation a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Navy Hasn't Resumed Vieques Bombing  </HEADLINE>
By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The U.S. Navy by Saturday evening
had not carried out plans to conduct a military exercise on Vieques
island, as up to 200 protesters threatened to invade the range if
bombing started.
</P>
<P>
   According to plans the Navy filed with the Puerto Rican
government, five warships plan to fire up to 600 shells at the
range and aircraft would drop between 550 and 830 dummy bombs --
including 500-pound and 1,000-pound bombs -- during two to five days
of exercises to start ''approximately'' Saturday. The exercise
would be the largest since a fatal accident last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one more triumph in the fight against the Navy,''
activist Hector Pesquera said at a meeting of protesters Saturday
near the Navy facility, Camp Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Navy spokesman Lt. Jeff Gordon would not say when the exercises
would begin. He said the Navy typically gives two hours' notice to
warn area fishermen. But Gordon said this week that the Navy is not
obligated to do so -- an apparent attempt to ward off protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters still have vowed to block the exercises. They will be
chosen to enter the range, but only after bombing has begun, to
avoid a spontaneous rush of demonstrators that could put lives in
jeopardy, Pesquera said. Inside the camp, police and military
guards could be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Activist Carlos Zenon compared the tense situation to a
''psychological war,'' but said the protesters would not give up.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're prepared for tonight or whenever it happens,'' Zenon
said. ''If the Navy comes to the range, we are going to interrupt
the exercises -- it's now or never.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition has mounted since news was published last week of
plans for the biggest exercise since a Marine Corps jet fired two
bombs off target and killed a civilian guard on the range in April
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of protesters invaded the range in protest, some camping
there for more than a year. Federal officials evicted them last
month. Since then, more than 200 demonstrators have been arrested
for trespassing on the range.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders say five decades of live bombing have caused
environmental damage, contaminated water supplies, stunted tourism,
destroyed fishing grounds and led to a high cancer rate.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy says Vieques is the only place its Atlantic fleet can
hold simultaneous land, air and sea exercises using live fire
before deploying abroad.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has ordered the Navy to use dummy bombs
instead of live munitions and to abandon Vieques by May 2003 if the
island's 9,400 residents vote to expel it in a referendum expected
next year. If the Navy wins, it gets to use live munitions again.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a U.S. District Court Judge ruled the exercises posed
no danger to citizens who live roughly 10 miles away from the
target area.

<HEADLINE> Bogota Discotheque Shootout Kills 11  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- After a young woman refused his offer to
dance, a man returned to a Bogota discotheque early Saturday and
fatally shot 11 people with an Uzi submachine gun, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Five people were wounded in the shootings at the Remicencias
dance club located in a tough, south Bogota neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was an act of intolerance by a drunken man,'' city police
chief Gen. Argemiro Serna told a news conference, where he showed a
police sketch of the assailant and offered a $7,500 reward for
information.
</P>
<P>
   Serna said the killer, a young man in his 20s, left the bar in
an angry huff after exchanging words with the male friends of the
woman who turned him down. He then returned with two friends,
pulled out the Uzi, and sprayed bullets around the club.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the dead are men, and two are women. Their ages ranges
from 19 to 35.
</P>
<P>
   Police had the bar cordoned off Saturday morning as they pulled
out the last victim on a stretcher while onlookers wept. A huge
bloodstain was visible in the entranceway of the four-story
building housing the club.
</P>
<P>
   The blood bath evoked memories of another a 1987 shooting in
Bogota, when 17 people were killed by a deranged war veteran who
opened fire in an upscale Italian restaurant.

<HEADLINE> Presbyterians To Debate Gay Unions  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY BREZNICAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Presbyterian leaders gathering here
this week will debate whether to ban blessings of same-sex unions
even if the ceremonies stop short of marriage, the latest
ecclesiastical conflict over recognition for gay and lesbian
couples.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the annual meeting of the Presbyterian Church
(U.S.A) hope a consensus reached at the weeklong gathering that
convened Saturday will unify factions of traditionalists and
reformers threatening to fragment the church over the issue of
homosexual unions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The differences are real and serious ... and I hope the
discussion will enable us to focus on the fundamental nature of our
responsibility,'' said the Rev. Clifton Kirkpatrick, who is
required to remain neutral on policy debates in his supervisory
position in the denomination's General Assembly
</P>
<P>
   The 560-member General Assembly is the chief policy-setting body
for the 2.6 million-member church.
</P>
<P>
   Issues of gay rights have dominated other major religious
gatherings this year. The United Methodist Church last month upheld
its doctrine banning gay ordination and the sanctioning of same-sex
unions. In March, the Central Conference of American Rabbis voted
to let rabbis choose to preside at same-sex union ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Homosexual advocates said they are optimistic that the
Presbyterians will decide to permit recognition of same-sex couples
because recent rulings by the church high courts have favored gays.
</P>
<P>
   ''This church is so close to doing right. But then, they've had
27 years of discussion. It's time to decide -- are we welcome in
their churches, or are we not?'' said the Rev. Mel White, of the
largely homosexual Metropolitan Community Churches based in West
Hollywood that are not Presbyterian.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Presbyterian delegates, or commissioners, will meet
Tuesday to discuss proposed amendments to the denomination's Book
of Order, or constitution, that seek to explicitly prohibit
same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth proposal up for debate suggests that churches be
permitted to determine their own policies on ministering to gays
and lesbians, said the Rev. Charles Proudfoot, a spokesman for the
assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's recommendations will go to the full assembly
later this week, where approval would require a simple majority.
</P>
<P>
   If the measures are passed, they would go before the ordained
Presbyterian ministers and elders nationwide for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents to same-sex unions argue the church should not condone
homosexual couples because their lifestyles conflict with biblical
principles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe same-sex unions are just a way to get people to
start approving of (gay) marriages, and that's just not
appropriate,'' said the Rev. Greg Loskoski, of Savannah, Ga., a
member of the committee debating the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of same-sex unions plan to protest at the convention,
saying church discrimination against gays and lesbians prevents
them from fulfilling their faith.
</P>
<P>
   Soulforce, a multi-faith coalition of gays, lesbians and
supporters, has scheduled a protest Sunday where dozens expect to
be arrested while forming a human chain and blocking one of the
many entrances to the convention center following the Presbyterian
convention's opening worship service.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gays and lesbians across this country are saying that if the
church can't grow up and accept reality, then we don't need the
church,'' said White, co-founder of Soulforce. ''We can find ways
to worship on our own.''

<HEADLINE> Tigers' Gonzalez Not Gone Yet  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Another day passed and Juan Gonzalez remained
with the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who would be sent to the New York Yankees from Detroit
in a tentative 3-for-1 trade, was in the starting lineup for
Saturday night's second game of a day-night doubleheader against
the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers have agreed to trade Gonzalez for outfielder Ricky
Ledee, minor league left-hander Randy Keisler and highly touted
prospect Drew Henson, who's expected to be Michigan's starting
quarterback this season. Gonzalez, has the power to block the deal
because of his no-trade clause.
</P>
<P>
   However, a source familiar with the negotiations speaking on the
condition of anonymity, told the AP that nothing would be decided
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who has given conflicting statements in the past few
days about his future in Detroit, said before Saturday's opener
that there were no developments in his situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing new. Nothing new. Nothing new,'' he repeated to
several reporters in a hallway adjacent to the Tigers' clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez went 0-for-4 and struck out three times in the first
game. Rather facing reporters between games, Gonzalez sat on a golf
cart in a tunnel inside Jacobs Field and talked with some ballpark
employees.
</P>
<P>
   As Sunday's initial 72-hour deadline for working out a deal
approached, people tried to guess what might happen next.
</P>
<P>
   While a TV cameraman filmed Detroit's posted lineup card, some
of the Tigers wondered if something had already transpired.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is this the last lineup Gonzo's in with us or something?''
asked Gregg Jefferies.
</P>
<P>
   Tigers manager Phil Garner felt equally out of the loop.
</P>
<P>
   ''You guys know more than I do about what is going on,'' Garner
told reporters after Detroit's 8-1 loss.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, Yankees manager Joe Torre refused to comment on the
possible
</P>
<P>
   deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to talk about it,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees clubhouse has been buzzing all weekend with talk
about Gonzalez joining the World Series champions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I personally think it takes a special kind of individual to
play here,'' said center fielder Bernie Williams, who played Little
League with Gonzalez in Puerto Rico. ''I'd say it's the best place
to play when you're winning. But it can also be hard. I'm not
surprised that some players don't want to be exposed to the
aggravation of playing here.''

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays Not in Hunt for Sosa  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- The Toronto Blue Jays said they are not in the
running to get Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't even talked to Chicago,'' Toronto manager Jim
Fregosi said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Sun, citing an unnamed major league source, said
Saturday that the Blue Jays have offered the Cubs left fielder
Shannon Stewart, right-hander Roy Halladay and a minor league
shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a shame because I had to approach these players and tell
them it was untrue,'' Fregosi said.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams reported to be trying to trade for Sosa are the New
York Yankees, New York Mets and Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is hitting .319 with 20 home runs and 65 RBIs this season,
one in which he has been criticized by Cubs manager Don Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun said the shortstop in the proposed deal would be either
Cesar Izturis from Triple-A Syracuse or Felipe Lopez from Double-A
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the Blue Jays played down a report that had
them offering the Cubs a three-player package of Halladay, center
fielder Jose Cruz and minor league right-hander Leo Estrella.

<HEADLINE> Albright Hopes Limited on Mideast  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- When Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
makes her third trip in a month to the Middle East this week, she
would like to invite Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to a summit with President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright does not think either the Israeli or Palestinian
leader has a reasonable expectation that an agreement could be
hammered out with Clinton's hands-on intervention at a summit, a
senior U.S. official familiar with her thinking said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   She also realizes that a summit cannot be delayed until the two
leaders are nearly in accord, said the official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Israeli-Egyptian summit President Carter held in 1978
at Camp David, Md., Clinton in any case would have a lot of work to
do to get Barak and Arafat together on a settlement that deals with
the future of Jerusalem and Palestinian aspirations for a state.
</P>
<P>
   Albright believes Clinton, like Carter, should be prepared to
take a risk on a summit that could blow up, the official said. But
the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and the late Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin were a lot closer when former Secretary of
State Cyrus R. Vance invited them to the summit 22 years ago and
they accepted.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Palestinian-Israeli dispute is a lot more
complicated than the one then between Israel and Egypt. And even
Carter had to do some serious mediating and then make a trip to the
Middle East before the 1979 peace treaty was signed.
</P>
<P>
   Sadat could insist on recovering all the land Egypt had lost in
the 1967 Six-Day war with Israel and get every bit of it for a
peace treaty. Arafat may have to settle for less.
</P>
<P>
   So, Albright's trip, which begins Tuesday evening in Jerusalem,
is a negotiating mission, not simply one of issuing invitations to
be hosted by Clinton after the July 4th holiday.
</P>
<P>
   And, the senior U.S. official said, there may not be enough of a
basis for an agreement between them at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Albright needs word from both Barak and Arafat that they are
ready to make the ''hard decisions'' that are necessary for a
compromise accord, the official said. And Arafat, particularly, has
not yet accepted the notion that neither side can get 100 percent
of what it wants.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, now in control of about 40 percent of the West Bank and
Gaza, is demanding virtually all of the territory as well as East
Jerusalem, where he would set up his capital. Barak has signaled he
is prepared to yield more of the West Bank and some suburbs of
Jerusalem, and accept a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   But the gap between them remains wide. Also, the issue of
Palestinian refugees demanding at least compensation on the grounds
they were uprooted by the establishment of a Jewish state in 1948
remains unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been telling Arafat that with
U.S. help he has a chance to reach some of his goals, although he
is holding out for realization of all of his dreams, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's Mideast specialist, Dennis B. Ross, has preceded her
to the region for talks with the two sides. They have agreed on
Sept. 13 as a deadline for an agreement, and Clinton has made peace
in the Middle East his No. 1 foreign policy priority.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, meeting with U.S. Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo on
Friday, said more Palestinian flexibility would achieve an
agreement ''that would serve the interests of both sides,''
although ''neither side would achieve its dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright flew to Poland on Saturday from South Korea for a
100-nation conference on democracy.

<HEADLINE> Awards Honor Indian Film Stars  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA MICHELSTEIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- There was no shortage of glitz and glamour
Saturday as Bombay's biggest films stars were honored at the
International India Film Awards, their cinematic equivalent of the
Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   The love story ''Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam'' picked up three top
prizes including the award for best picture. The film's leading
lady, Aishwarya Rai, a former Miss World, won the best actress
award while Sanjay Leela Bansai won for best director.
</P>
<P>
   Sanjay Dutt was named best actor for his role as a vendor in the
murder tale ''Vaastav.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Miss Universe Sushmita Sen took home the best supporting
actress for her role in ''Biwi No. 1'' and Anil Kapoor won best
supporting actor for the film ''Taal.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 Indian movie stars were among 3,000 guests
attending the ceremony at London's Millennium Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said they hoped to gain international recognition for
Bollywood, the nickname given to Bombay, which boasts the world's
second largest film industry after Hollywood. The awards show was
to be broadcast to 122 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights was the presentation of a lifetime
achievement award to martial arts legend Jackie Chan.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is so exciting to be here,'' said Chan. ''I'm good at
action but not so good at speeches. I don't only do action and
comedy you know. I'm a good singer and I'm not too expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Actor Sunil Dutt and musician Lata Mangeshkar received standing
ovations when they received honors for invaluable contributions to
India's cinema.
</P>
<P>
   ''I owe this to the people of my country who give great love to
me,'' Dutt said, accepting his award.
</P>
<P>
   The film ''East is East'' also won an award for outstanding
achievement in international cinema. India produces between 600 and
800 films every year.

<HEADLINE> Police Break Blockade in Colombia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Riot police on Saturday broke up a road
blockade by Colombian Indians protesting oil exploration by a U.S.
company.
</P>
<P>
   A representative of the U'wa Indian tribe claims two of the
protesters were shot by police. Their wounds were not
life-threatening, Yurisa Tegria told The Associated Press by
telephone from Cubara, a town near the Venezuelan border where the
incident occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Police denied that account, saying an officer fired one warning
shot in the air when a protesters went for his gun. National police
operations director Gen. Alfonso Arellano said nobody was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians were trying to prevent trucks from reaching the
construction site where U.S.-based Occidental Petroleum Corp. is
preparing to drill over a field thought to hold huge crude
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The 8,000-member U'wa nation has been fighting for more than
five years to halt the company's plans, at one point threatening
mass suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The U'wa say drilling violates the sanctity of the earth, and
will bring guerrilla violence to their homeland. The government
says the group is being intransigent, and argues a major new oil
find would benefit most Colombians.

<HEADLINE> Mutiny 4, Fusion 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Mamadou Diallo scored two goals and
Carlos Valderrama had three assists to lead the Tampa Bay Mutiny
past the Miami Fusion 3-2 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The victory avenged the Mutiny's 4-1 loss to the Fusion on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's second goal and 15th of the season gave Tampa Bay a 2-0
lead at the 48th minute. Valderrama broke through the Miami defense
and sent a pass to Eric Quill on the left wing, where Quill
centered a pass to Diallo, who headed it in a shot from the 6-yard
box.
</P>
<P>
   Miami cut the deficit to 2-1 in the 68th minute when Jay Heaps
kicked in a shot inside the 6-yard box off a corner kick from
Martin Machon.
</P>
<P>
   But Tampa Bay struck back at the 76th minute on Kevin Anderson's
goal. Anderson received a pass from Valderrama and unleashed a
25-yard shot into the upper left-hand corner of the Fusion goal.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Williams scored Miami's second goal at the 90th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay remains in second place in the Central Division with a
9-8 record and 27 points. Miami is third in the Eastern Division at
6-8-4 and 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Mutiny took a quick lead when Diallo scored at the eighth
minute of the match. Mutiny midfielder Steve Ralston centered a
pass to Diallo, who headed in a 10-yard shot past Fusion goalkeeper
Nick Rimando.
</P>
<P>
   Miami had its best first-half scoring opportunities in the final
minutes as Henry Gutierrez and Welton took open shots that were
stopped by Tampa Bay goalkeeper Scott Garlick.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had players ejected in the first half and were forced
to play 10 a side.
</P>
<P>
   Miami defender Tyrone Marshall was red-carded at the 31st minute
for fouling Diallo from behind. Tampa Bay's Chad McCarty was sent
off nine minutes later after fouling Welton from behind.

   MIAMI (AP) -- Tonya Edwards scored 12 points and Jennifer Gillom
added 10 as the Phoenix Mercury routed the expansion Miami Sol
67-44 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Brandy Reed, Bridget Pettis and Lisa Harrison each had eight
points for Phoenix, which has won three straight to improve to 8-3.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (4-8) tied the WNBA record for fewest field goals (14) and
set a team record for lowest field-goal percentage (22.6). The 44
points are the fewest ever allowed by the Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   Milena Flores led the Sol with eight points and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   She hit a 3-pointer with 9.6 seconds left to keep Miami from
tying the WNBA record for fewest points in a game of 41 set by
Sacramento against Detroit on Aug. 11, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix led 39-17 at the half, with the Sol tying the franchise
record for fewest points in an opening half.
</P>
<P>
   Miami missed 10 of its first 12 shots, while Phoenix made seven

<HEADLINE> Brewers 2, Braves 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Jamey Wright outpitched Greg Maddux to win his
third straight start in the Milwaukee Brewers' 2-1 victory over the
Atlanta Braves on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Wright (4-1) scattered five hits, struck out seven and walked
five in eight innings. He has won his last five starts against the
Braves and improved to 3-0 at Turner Field despite entering with a
6.17 ERA in two previous starts in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wickman pitched a perfect ninth for his 10th save in 11
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux (9-2), who pitched his third complete game, had won five
straight decisions and had not lost since Los Angeles beat him 4-1
on May 3. Maddux gave up six hits, walked one and struck out five.
</P>
<P>
   Jeromy Burnitz gave Milwaukee a 2-1 lead in the fourth with his
15th homer, a 454-foot shot to right field -- the longest in Turner
Field history.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones hit a homer off Wright into the left-field seats to
give him 100 for his career -- the fifth-fastest player to reach the
mark.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux fell behind 1-0 in the first after a line drive hit by
Ron Belliard hit off his left knee. Belliard was awarded second
base on a balk by rookie catcher Fernando Lunar.
</P>
<P>
   Plate umpire John Shulock called the balk after Lunar set up
outside the right line of the catcher's box. Braves manager Bobby
Cox was ejected by Shulock for arguing the call.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux walked Geoff Jenkins and gave up a single to Burnitz
before Charlie Hayes hit an RBI grounder.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ryan Klesko held the previous record for the longest homer
at Turner Field. Klesko hit a 449-foot shot against Arizona on
Sept. 3. ... The balk call was related to complaints made Friday
night by Brewers manager Davey Lopes regarding the size of the
catcher's box. WTBS showed the box measuring a regulation 43 inches
Saturday, but four inches too wide Friday. ... Wright hit Chipper
Jones on the inside of his left foot with a pitch in the fifth.
Jones talked briefly with trainer Jeff Porter but remained in the
game. ... Brewers C Henry Blanco caught Chipper Jones trying to
steal second in the first and then nailed Reggie Sanders in the
sixth.

Vieques Protesters Claim Victory
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Protesters claimed victory today after the U.S.
Navy did not begin a planned bombing exercise on Vieques island -- the largest
since a fatal accident prompted a yearlong occupation of the target range.
''This is one more triumph in the fight against the Navy,'' activist Hector
Pesquera said at a meeting of protesters today near the Navy facility, Camp
Garcia. About 200 protesters had said they would invade the range if bombing
began. But by this evening, the exercise, which the Navy had earlier said would
begin ''approximately Saturday'' had failed to materialize.

the vote. Polls show them with firm chances of holding onto power, and the
opposition has failed to present a credible challenge. The only question mark

<HEADLINE> Veterans Mark 'Forgotten War'  </HEADLINE>
By JEAN H. LEE
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) -- The war lasted three years, cost
millions of lives and left a small peninsula nation divided. But it
fell between World War II and Vietnam, earning it the moniker of
''Forgotten War'' in the annals of American memory.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years after North Korea attacked the South as Koreans
slept, Korean War veterans from the United States and elsewhere
gathered at former battlegrounds this week to remember.
</P>
<P>
   One American veteran brought the South Korean flag he saved from
his days as a U.S. marine in the early 1950s; another returned to
the port city of Inchon where his flotilla launched the daring
landing that would change the course of the 1950-53 war.
</P>
<P>
   ''I take exception to the ignominious label of 'Forgotten
War,''' said retired Rear Adm. William T. Thompson, who brought
Navy veterans to South Korea for Sunday's 50th anniversary of the
outbreak of the war. ''It was a cornerstone in the fall of
communism. It was the first time we stepped up to Stalin to stop
his attempt at world domination.''
</P>
<P>
   But as veterans revisited old battle sites and peered across the
Military Demarcation Line to communist North Korea, celebrations
for Sunday's anniversary were muted, with both Koreas seeking small
but symbolic ways to begin repairing five decades of enmity.
</P>
<P>
   During last week's historic inter-Korean summit, North Korean
leader Kim Jong Il announced that he had canceled war anniversary
celebrations. The South canceled its military parade and battle
reenactments as well earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the truce village of Panmunjom along the world's most
heavily fortified border, propaganda broadcasts that earlier
pierced the countryside quiet were halted.
</P>
<P>
   In the capital of Seoul, hundreds of uniformed veterans saluted
the dead at the National Cemetery. Under sunny skies, they prayed,
burned incense and laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown
Soldier, the most prominent monument in the vast cemetery where
50,000 Korean War dead are buried. The veterans were from South
Korea, the United States, Britain and other countries that
comprised a U.N. force fighting North Korean and Chinese troops.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the capital, jubilation over signs of
reconciliation overshadowed bitterness over the war.
</P>
<P>
   Seoul's vendors hawked key chains and T-shirts featuring Kim
Jong Il and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung in the embrace that
took the world by surprise. Department store mannequins are dressed
in the Mao-inspired jackets that just years ago might have branded
the designer a communist and landed her in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ''When countries have been at war for 50 years and they're
concentrating on peace rather than war, then I would think that
doves and olive leaves are a little more important than parades and
the display of military power,'' Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y.,
said Saturday. Rangel, who described his one-year tour in Korea as
''a nightmare,'' was traveling with 12 other Korean War veterans
visiting South Korea for the war anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Machado, a U.S. Navy veteran from Fresno, Calif., said
simply returning for the first time since the war and seeing this
once dusty, ravaged country transformed into a bustling, thriving
democracy was commemoration enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember Inchon being devastated -- nothing there,'' Machado,
68, said Friday during a trip to Panmunjom. ''I remember young
children starving to death, begging. I used to fill my pockets with
everything I could and give them to the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Seoul, with its skyscrapers, luxury cars, restaurants and
five-star hotels, looks nothing like Korea of war years past, he
said. Other veterans crinkled their noses, remembering the stench
of manure and the bitter cold of Korean winters.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Korean people are doing well, and that makes me feel good.
We did the right thing,'' Machado said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The men and women who died over here did not die in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   As his tour bus rumbled past live minefields in the
Demilitarized Zone, the 2.5-mile-wide buffer zone that divides
North and South, retired U.S. marine Neal Mishik recalled his time
serving as a radio operator in 1951-52.
</P>
<P>
   The fields, tucked in among verdant rice paddies, reminded him
of the day he learned, by relaying messages, that one of his
friends had stepped on a live mine. ''He went home the short way --
the dead way,'' he said soberly.
</P>
<P>
   Looking out at one of two villages in the DMZ, the North's Gi
Jong Dong, which U.S. soldiers call ''Propaganda Village,'' Mishik
waved at the jumble of buildings that rise through the haze like an
abandoned Hollywood set -- impressive but empty.
</P>
<P>
   ''You see the village and the streetlights, but there are no
people and no traffic over there,'' said Mishik, 69. ''It's
eerie.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the conference room where the North and South hold
general-level talks, Mishik craned his neck to see outside a window
to where a North Korean soldier in olive green stood idly, his
hands at his sides.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's my good friend over there -- he hasn't changed in 50
years,'' he said wryly.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean soldiers, in contrast, stood on guard, arms
akimbo in a tae kwon do stance, their eyes hidden by dark glasses.
Across the way, tourists on the North Korea side, usually Russians
and Chinese, snapped photographs of the visitors on the South's
side.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the placidity at Panmunjom and the recent warming of
relations between the Koreas, Thompson, 77, warned against
forgetting that more than 36,000 Americans and more than 2 million
Koreans were killed during the war.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a realistic situation,'' he said, noting that the two
sides signed an armistice in 1953 that did not technically end the
war. ''The war still isn't over.''

<HEADLINE> Reds 11, Padres 5  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Barry Larkin homered twice and had a
career-high five hits Saturday night as the Cincinnati Reds beat
the San Diego Padres 11-5 for only their fourth victory in 17
games.
</P>
<P>
   The win kept Cincinnati 7&AMP;frac12; games behind St. Louis in the NL
Central. The June slump has left the Reds with their biggest
deficit since they finished the 1998 season 25 games out.
</P>
<P>
   After losing to the Padres four times in the last eight days,
the Reds fulfilled manager Jack McKeon's pregame wish for a big
early lead by scoring five runs in the second inning, then
coasting.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin was the catalyst, scoring four times to match his career
high. He got plenty of help from the entire the lineup and the Reds
reached double digits for only the second time in a month.
</P>
<P>
   Dante Bichette and Dmitri Young each drove in a pair of runs and
Ken Griffey Jr. extended his hitting streak to eight games with an
RBI single in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Villone (7-4), scratched from his scheduled start last
Thursday because of a cut on his left index finger, gave up eight
hits and four runs in five-plus innings for his first win since May
20. The left-hander had lost his last three decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Elmer Dessens pitched the last four innings for his first career
save.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Nicholson hit a solo homer off Villone in the fourth for
his first major league hit and Ruben Rivera added a two-run shot in
the fifth, running the Padres' two-game home run total to seven.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Boone, who homered three times in a 10-7 Padres victory
Friday night, went 2-for-5 against his former team. He's 10-for-21
in five games at Cinergy Field this season with five homers.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Gwynn, who expects to have arthroscopic surgery on his
painful left knee next week, was out of the starting lineup for a
sixth consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds took control by sending 10 batters to the plate for
five runs and a 6-1 lead in the second inning. Matt Clement (6-7)
walked three in the inning, raising his total to 58, second-most in
the NL. One run scored on Wiki Gonzalez's passed ball.
</P>
<P>
   Young completed the inning with a two-run triple that bounced
off the base of the wall in right-center and frightened a pigeon
resting nearby on the warning track, causing the bird to take
flight.
</P>
<P>
   Clement, who allowed three solo homers in an inning during an
8-7 win over the Reds last Sunday, gave up Larkin's seventh homer
leading off the fourth inning. Larkin added a two-run shot in the
seventh, drawing an ovation that lasted until he came out of the
dugout to wave to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
Notes: San Diego's Damian Jackson started in left field for the
third time in his career, all in the last week. ... Gwynn's 534th
double Friday night left him one away from tying Lou Gehrig for
22nd on the career list. ... Eric Owens had three hits, leaving him
with 14 multihit games in his last 22 starts. ... Reds second
baseman Pokey Reese left in the third inning after spraining his
ankle. Precautionary X-rays were negative. ... Dessens' infield
single in the seventh ended an 0-for-24 skid by Reds pitchers since
June 5. ... Larkin had four hits in a game 17 times previously,
most recently last June 6 at Kansas City.

   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Mamadou Diallo scored two goals and
Carlos Valderrama had three assists to lead the Tampa Bay Mutiny
past the Miami Fusion 3-2 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The victory avenged the Mutiny's 4-1 loss to the Fusion on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's second goal and 15th of the season gave Tampa Bay a 2-0
lead at the 48th minute. Valderrama broke through the Miami defense
and sent a pass to Eric Quill on the left wing, where Quill
centered a pass to Diallo, who headed it in a shot from the 6-yard
box.
</P>
<P>
   Miami cut the deficit to 2-1 in the 68th minute when Jay Heaps
kicked in a shot inside the 6-yard box off a corner kick from
Martin Machon.
</P>
<P>
   But Tampa Bay struck back at the 76th minute on Kevin Anderson's
goal. Anderson received a pass from Valderrama and unleashed a
25-yard shot into the upper left-hand corner of the Fusion goal.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Williams scored Miami's second goal at the 90th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay remains in second place in the Central Division with a
9-8 record and 27 points. Miami is third in the Eastern Division at
6-8-4 and 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Mutiny took a quick lead when Diallo scored at the eighth
minute of the match. Mutiny midfielder Steve Ralston centered a
pass to Diallo, who headed in a 10-yard shot past Fusion goalkeeper
Nick Rimando.
</P>
<P>
   Miami had its best first-half scoring opportunities in the final
minutes as Henry Gutierrez and Welton took open shots that were
stopped by Tampa Bay goalkeeper Scott Garlick.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had players ejected in the first half and were forced
to play 10 a side.
</P>
<P>
   Miami defender Tyrone Marshall was red-carded at the 31st minute
for fouling Diallo from behind. Tampa Bay's Chad McCarty was sent
off nine minutes later after fouling Welton from behind.

<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Preston Wilson homered twice, including a three-run
drive off Rick Aguilera in a five-run eighth inning as the Florida
Marlins rallied past the Chicago Cubs 7-4 Saturday night for their
eighth win in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's homer put the Marlins ahead 6-4, giving him his first
multihomer game of the season, the second of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Derrek Lee followed with his second homer of the game. It was
the first time two Marlins homered twice in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cubs leading 4-2, Dave Berg began the rally with a
one-out double off Tim Worrell and scored on Mark Kotsay's RBI
single off Felix Heredia (3-2).
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Floyd walked, Aguilera relieved and Wilson hit his 16th
homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera blew a save for the fifth time in 20 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Strong (1-1), Florida's 37-year-old rookie, pitched
one-third of an inning for his first career win. Antonio Alfonseca
pitched a perfect ninth for his major league leading 22nd save.
</P>
<P>
   Before 35,140, Florida's largest home crowd this season, Eric
Young went 3-for-4 with two RBIs and Jose Nieves was 3-for-4 with
two doubles and a triple. In addition to the presence of Sammy
Sosa, fans were attracted by a floppy hat promotion,
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Tapani, pitching on three days' rest because scheduled
starter Ismael Valdes was bothered by a blister, struck out nine in
seven innings, allowing two runs and five hits.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes has blister on the middle finger of his pitching hand, a
problem that plagued him earlier this year. Tapani had been
scheduled to start Sunday and will be replaced by Ruben Quevedo,
who was recalled from Triple-A Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's Chuck Smith, a 30-year-old rookie, made his third
major league start and allowed three runs and nine hits in seven
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Young hit an RBI single in the third, but Wilson's first homer
tied it in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago took a 3-1 lead in the seventh on Young's RBI single and
Sosa's sacrifice fly, but Lee homered in the bottom half, his first
at home since Aug. 5, 1998. Nieves' eighth-inning RBI double off
Strong put the Cubs ahead 4-2.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Lee has three multihomer games, all this season. Of Lee's
37 career homers, only six have come at home. ... Florida's Luis
Castillo stole his 32nd base, one shy of Colorado's Tom Goodwin,
the major league leader, but was thrown out attempting to steal
third by Jeff Reed. Castillo has been caught stealing an NL-leading
13 times. ... Floyd struck out his first two at-bats, and each time
a runner was thrown out attempting to steal, for inning-ending
double plays. ... Marlins C Mike Redmond, sidelined since June 17
with a sprained knee ligament, was scheduled to start Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Randy Wolf pitched seven strong innings and the
Philadelphia Phillies scored six times in the seventh inning to
beat the Montreal Expos 8-1 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf (7-4) scattered six hits and allowed just one run -- on
Vladimir Guerrero's RBI single in the sixth -- as the Phillies won
for the seventh time in nine games, including five of six.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Pavano (8-4) allowed two runs in the first on Bobby Abreu's
RBI double and Scott Rolen's sacrifice fly. Pavano then shut out
the Phillies for the next five innings before leaving the game
after the sixth with the Expos trailing 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Forster came in for the Expos to begin the seventh and
allowed a leadoff single to Desi Relaford, who Wolf sacrificed to
second.
</P>
<P>
   Relaford stole third and scored when shortstop Orlando Cabrera
misplayed Kevin Sefcik's grounder. Mickey Morandini's two-run
single made it 4-1. Abreu walked and Rolen hit an RBI single for
his second RBI to make it 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Burrell singled to score Abreu, and Rolen and Burrell scored
when third baseman Michael Barrett cut off the throw home and threw
past second baseman Jose Vidro all the way to the wall in
right-center field.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf allowed just two hits through the first five innings before
allowing three straight hits to begin the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Rondell White doubled and scored on Guerrero's RBI single up the
middle to draw Montreal to within one at 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Vidro's single to right advanced Guerrero to third. Wolf then
struck out Lee Stevens looking and got out of the jam as Abreu
easily doubled Vidro off first when he caught Barrett's liner and
threw to first.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ron Gant was the only Phillies starter who didn't get a hit
as Philadelphia finished with 11 hits in the game. ... Phillies
catchers Mike Lieberthal and Tom Prince have combined to throw out
12 of the last 21 runners who have attempted to steal. Over the
span of 22 games, Lieberthal has thrown out 10 of 18 would-be base
stealers, while Prince, who started Saturday night, has retired two
of three. ... Philadelphia reliever Jeff Brantley has earned a save
in his last five appearances and has a perfect record in nine save
opportunities this season. ... The Expos remain just two wins short
of 1,000 at Olympic Stadium. Montreal is 998-825 at home since
moving to the Big O to begin the 1977 season. ... Stevens needs two
homers for 100 for his career. Stevens, acquired from Texas midway
through spring training, has 16 homers this season after hitting a
career-high 24 homers for the Rangers last season.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Urges Military Vigilance  </HEADLINE>
By KYONG-HWA SEOK
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Addressing thousands of military
veterans on the 50th anniversary of the start of the Korean War,
President Kim Dae-jung on Sunday urged his armed forces to remain
alert despite moves toward reconciliation with communist North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans, some in suits and others in military uniforms, with
medals and garlands around their necks, sat under sunny skies at
the War Memorial Museum as Kim warned that reuniting the Korean
Peninsula will require vigilance as well as generosity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until unification is actually fully achieved and a firm
guarantee of peace is arranged, we cannot afford to relax,'' said
the 75-year-old Kim, whose historic June 13-15 summit with North
Korean leader Kim Jong Il has eased tensions considerably.
</P>
<P>
   ''Firm security should be sustained; peace can be guaranteed
only through a tight defense posture. I emphasize that we should
not allow the slightest gap in our security stance,'' Kim said in a
nationally televised speech.
</P>
<P>
   The words of caution came amid elation in the democratic South
over the summit in which the two Kims agreed to work toward
reunification and end decades of animosity in the wake of their
fratricidal war.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea launched the 1950-53 war by invading the South in an
attempt to reunify the peninsula. The Cold War conflict, which left
up to 5 million people dead, wounded and missing, ended without a
permanent peace treaty and the two Koreas have been locked in a
tense standoff ever since.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first conciliatory gestures from both Koreas was to
tone down or cancel commemorations of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Seoul canceled a military parade planned for Sunday as well as
reenactments of pivotal battles, including the famed amphibious
landing at Inchon in September 1950 that reversed North Korean
advances. The South instead honored veterans and those slain in
combat at the war museum and the National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   At the museum, military honor guards carried the flags of the 21
countries that contributed to the U.S.-led U.N. force that fought
against North Korean and Chinese troops, and women in traditional
gowns draped flowers around the necks of some veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mosley of Britain, 68, described Korea's deep poverty a
half-century ago and sobbed as he recalled comrades who died during
his stint in Korea from May 1951 to March 1952.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still think of them and it's a bit hard,'' said Mosley, who
was among about 1,000 foreign veterans at the event. Another 4,000
South Korean veterans also attended.
</P>
<P>
   Another veteran, 71-year-old Benjamin Santos of the Philippines,
told how his unit lost 10 men when it was ambushed by North Korean
soldiers during a frontline patrol in June 1952.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I'm proud and grateful I have fought to promote peace in
South Korea and I pray that there will be a complete peace and
unification in Korea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, President Kim reiterated points of understanding
that he reached with his North Korean counterpart. He said they
included his belief that U.S. troops deployed in South Korea should
remain on the peninsula even after unification to maintain the
balance of power in Northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ''The North showed substantial understanding on my explanation
on the need for the U.S. troops,'' Kim said. ''I am reporting this
to you as a major accomplishment made during my visit to
Pyongyang.''
</P>
<P>
   However, on at least two occasions since the summit, North Korea
has repeated its longtime demand for the withdrawal of U.S. forces.
In the past, the North has often engaged in fiery rhetoric against
negotiating partners even as it showed a willingness to deal with
them.
</P>
<P>
   In a ceremony at the Seoul cemetery where 50,000 Korean War dead
are buried, veterans prayed, burned incense and laid a wreath at
the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
</P>
<P>
   The veterans included Fidel Ramos, former president of the
Philippines, and Paik Sun Yup, an 82-year-old former general who
was South Korea's top military commander during the war. Togo West,
the U.S. secretary of veterans affairs, was also present.
</P>
<P>
   The three men honored the dead by tolling a giant bronze bell in
the cemetery, which is nestled in a valley between two low hills
overlooking the Han, a river that bisects Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Pyongyang, I stressed that if another war broke out, it
would be different from the one we had,'' President Kim said. ''If
that happened the whole nation would be decimated by the use of
extremely advanced weapons of mass destruction. We should never
dream of unification by force or absorbing the other side.''

<HEADLINE> Indians, Tigers Split Doubleheader  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Bobby Higginson's third two-run homer of the
game ignited Detroit's six-run seventh inning as the Tigers rallied
from seven runs down for an improbable 14-8 win over the Cleveland
Indians and a split of their day-night doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   Higginson also homered in the fourth and fifth innings as the
Tigers came back from a 7-0 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell Magee's three-run homer capped Detroit's seventh as the
Tigers scored 12 unanswered runs to hand Cleveland its most
devastating loss in an already disappointing season.
</P>
<P>
   In the first game, Bartolo Colon mixed his blazing fastball with
a nasty curve to overpower Detroit between rain delays, and Jim
Thome had three RBIs in Cleveland's 8-1 win.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers trailed 7-0 after three innings before Higginson
began the comeback with a two-run shot in the fourth off Paul
Rigdon. Higginson wasn't done, connecting again in the fifth off
Rigdon to bring the Tigers within 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   With Detroit down 7-6 and a runner on second in the seventh,
Higginson hit his 15th homer of the season into the Detroit bullpen
off left-hander Mike Mohler (0-1).
</P>
<P>
   Higginson, bidding to become the first AL player since the
Indians' Rocky Colavito in 1959 to hit four homers in a game,
popped to short center in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   It was Higginson's second career three-homer game. He also did
it on June 30, 1997, against the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Clark's RBI double off Steve Reed put the Tigers up 9-7,
and Magee followed with his fifth homer, a drive onto the home run
porch in left that stunned the Jacobs Field crowd and prevented the
Indians from gaining any more ground on first-place Chicago in the
AL Central.
</P>
<P>
   David Justice hit a three-run homer and Thome added a solo shot
for the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   C.J. Nitkowski (4-7), who entered trailing 7-0, allowed one run
and five hits in four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez, who would go to the New York Yankees if a
tentative trade is finalized, went 2-for-9 in the two games.
</P>
<P>
   Justice hit a three-run homer, his 21st, in the first, and the
Indians appeared to be in control when Enrique Wilson doubled home
two runs during a four-run second that gave Cleveland a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Higginson's first homer, a two-run shot in the fourth, made
it 7-2 and the Tigers added another run in the inning on Wendell
Magee's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Rigdon, who breezed through Detroit's lineup in the first three
innings, gave up consecutive one-out doubles in the fifth before
Higginson connected for his second homer of the game and 14th this
season to bring the Tigers within 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   In the day game, Colon (7-4) had to wait through rain stoppages
of nearly two hours during his 6 1-3 innings that stretched over
4:16. The right-hander allowed one run and four hits, walked three
and struck out 10.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first rain delay was tougher than the second,'' Colon said
through an interpreter. ''I finally realized that there is another
pitch other than the fastball. Hitters can no longer sit on one
pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell Branyan hit a long homer off Steve Sparks (0-1) and
Thome drove in two runs during a four-run fifth inning as the
Indians snapped a five-game home losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Enrique Wilson had three hits and scored three runs for
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Hideo Nomo made his second career relief appearance in the
eighth inning of the night game. The only other time Nomo pitched
out of the bullpen was on Sept. 27, 1998, for the Mets at Atlanta.
... Dave Mlicki was scheduled to start the second game for Detroit
but was scratched with a severe sinus infection. ... Justice has 10
homers in his last 20 games and has already matched his home-run
total of last year. ... Indians RHPs Paul Shuey (hip surgery) and
Sean DePaula (elbow tendinitis) eached pitched one inning for
Double-A Akron on Saturday as they began 30-day rehab stints.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Tony Meola set a Major League Soccer
record with his 12th shutout of the season as the Kansas City
Wizards beat the Los Angeles Galaxy 2-0 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Meola made four saves in the Wizards' eighth straight home
shutout, a span of 730 minutes without an opponent scoring a goal
in Arrowhead Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave the first-place Wizards (11-2-4) a nine-point
lead over second-place Los Angeles (7-4-7) in the Western Division.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Klein opened the scoring in the 44th minute. Midfielder
Chris Henderson bent a cross into the 6-yard box, and while a
diving Gary Glasgow couldn't reach it, Klein slid in and knocked
the ball inside the right post.
</P>
<P>
   In the 55th minute, Glasgow scored his second goal of the
season. Preki slid a pass inside the box to striker Mo Johnston,
whose hard kick was blocked by Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman. But
Hartman couldn't control the rebound and Glasgow tapped the loose
ball into the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has won just once in its last seven games.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Candidate Holds Rally  </HEADLINE>
By TRACI CARL
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Battling last-minute charges of illegal
foreign financing, Mexico's top opposition candidate for president
closed his campaign in the capital Saturday with a mass rally in
the country's central plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Chanting ''Fox! Fox! Fox!,'' nearly 200,000 people poured
through the narrow streets of the city center and filled the
massive Zocalo plaza for Vicente Fox of the conservative National
Action Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''On July 2, democracy is in our hands,'' Fox told the cheering
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   In the final weekend of campaigning before the July 2 election,
Fox was in a statistical dead heat in the polls with Francisco
Labastida of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which
has governed Mexico for 71 years.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Fox appealed to supporters of Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, who is running a distant third in the race, to back him
in the vote. ''If we don't join forces, it increases the
possibility of a PRI triumph,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shouting ''not one minute more of the PRI,'' a crowd of 50 Fox
supporters set fire to a Labastida campaign flag at the city's
independence monument before taking part in one of several marches
to the Zocalo.
</P>
<P>
   The noisy, flag-waving crowd for Fox appeared to equal the
150,000 Labastida drew to the plaza last weekend for his own final
campaign rally in Mexico City. A much larger percentage of the
Labastida supporters, however, had been trucked in by the party.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas plans a rally there Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a T-shirt that read ''Democracy for Mexico Now,'' Lilia
Barajas said she was voting for Fox because the PRI hadn't been
able to improve the lives of Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are tired of promises that aren't fulfilled,'' she said,
watching Fox supporters dance in the streets to pounding pop music.
She complained that many Mexicans were still poor, and ''wanted to
be able to survive in a dignified way.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Fox again appealed to Cardenas' backers to join him,
suggesting that Cardenas was leading his followers to ''collective
suicide'' by refusing to unite the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cuauhtemoc has no chance at all to win,'' Fox said during a
speech Friday in the Gulf coast oil city of Ciudad del Carmen.
''Let us unite the vote of the opposition to sink the candidacy of
Labastida and achieve great agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, meanwhile, called Fox ''delinquent'' for allegedly
accepting campaign contributions from abroad, which is banned in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we are seeing is what sort of patriotism or nationalism
somebody can have when he becomes a delinquent by accepting
resources from abroad,'' Cardenas said Friday in the northern city
of Monterrey.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI on Friday submitted a formal complaint to the Federal
Electoral Institute accusing Fox of receiving foreign
contributions, and offered copies of checks they said proved the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's aides insisted they have not received foreign funds and
said the checks were not evidence of it.
</P>
<P>
   They also accused the PRI of exploiting bank secrecy laws to
hide the names of prominent people whose debts were assumed by the
government in a massive bank bailout.

	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Tyrone Pendergrass drove in three runs to
lead the Richmond Braves to a 6-3 victory over the Rochester Red
Wings in International League baseball Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Pendergrass gave Richmond a one-run lead three times. After
leadoff batter George Lombard tripled in the first and third
innings, Pendergrass drove him in - first with a sacrifice fly,
then with a ground out. His fifth-inning single gave the Braves a
3-2 lead they never lost.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond added three runs in the sixth inning against losing
pitcher Brian Shouse (1-4). Pascual Matos doubled for one run, and
Chris Petersen doubled home two more.
</P>
<P>
   Rochester's Jose Herrera scored two runs and drove in two. He
tripled and scored on a ground out in the first inning, hit his
third home run this season in the third and singled home the final
run in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Winning pitcher Dan Smith (3-4) worked two scoreless innings in
relief as Richmond (23-49) won its second consecutive game. The Red
Wings fell to 34-37.

<HEADLINE> Arizona Activates 1B Durazo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona Diamondbacks activated first baseman
Erubiel Durazo from the 15-day disabled list Saturday and
designated outfielder Bernard Gilkey for assignment.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks went into Saturday night's game with the
Colorado Rockies 7-11 in their last 18 -- a stretch in which they
scored more than four runs just four times.
</P>
<P>
   Durazo, 25, who hit over .400 with two minor league teams before
he was called up last year, has hit .287 in 44 games this season.
He had six homers and 24 RBIs before he went on the DL on May 30.
</P>
<P>
   He had surgery June 1 to repair torn cartilage in his right
wrist.
</P>
<P>
   During a rugged rehabilitation this week, Durazo played in a
doubleheader for Triple-A Tucson and an extended spring game in an
18-hour span. He would have been activated Friday night, but the
Rockies used left-hander Brian Bohanon, and Arizona manager Buck
Showalter wanted him to get his first start against right-hander
Masato Yoshii, who started Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   If Gilkey, hitting .110 in 38 games, clears waivers the team
will owe him nearly $3.5 million of his $5.25 million contract.

<HEADLINE> Possible Nuke Lab Breaches Reported  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- An inventory of all classified data at
Los Alamos National Laboratory, taken in response to criticism over
the disappearance of two top-secret hard drives, has found two more
possible security breaches, a lab official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Two 10-year-old floppy disks containing classified information
were reported missing Wednesday at the nuclear weapons lab.
</P>
<P>
   However, they were found a day later, attached to a paper report
in a nearby, secured area. And apparently no classified information
was compromised, lab spokesman Jim Danneskiold said.
</P>
<P>
   This and the second case, involving an unlocked door, aren't as
serious as the missing computer hard drives, but Danneskiold said
the disappearance of the floppy disks will be investigated by the
Department of Energy, which oversees the lab.
</P>
<P>
   The disks ''are obsolete. Very few, if any, computers are around
that can read them,'' he said. The disks had last been recorded in
an inventory conducted two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Danneskiold said he didn't know how the disks got misplaced and
would not disclose what type of information they contained.
</P>
<P>
   In the second incident, Danneskiold said a computer repair
person left an equipment closet unlocked inside a secure room. The
room door was locked, however.
</P>
<P>
   Danneskiold said the lab is itemizing all classified data in
response to the uproar over the disappearance of the hard drives
last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've instituted a number of additional security measures
beyond what's required,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury has been convened to look into the two-month
disappearance of the two computer hard drives from the lab's
top-secret X division. The drives resurfaced mysteriously behind a
copy machine near the vault where they were first discovered
missing on May 7.
</P>
<P>
   The drives held information that would be needed to locate and
dismantle U.S. or even foreign nuclear devices that might be used
in a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported on its Web site Saturday
night that a General Accounting Office report to be released this
week has identified more than 75 incidents of foreign spies
targeting U.S. nuclear scientists traveling abroad and recommends
that such travel be approved by counterintelligence officials at
the Energy Department's national laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   The report, requested by Reps. Timony Romer, D-Ind., and
Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., says the scientists have been subject to
having their hotel rooms bugged, their personal belongs rifled and
being offered sexual favors.
</P>
<P>
   Edward J. Curran, the Energy Department's counterintelligence
chief, called the GAO study ''fair and objective'' and said his
staff is working to implement its recommendations. He noted that
his office had given GAO investigators complete access to its
classified counterintelligence database made up of hundreds of trip
reports filed by scientists returning from overseas travel.
