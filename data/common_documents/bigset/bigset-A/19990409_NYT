CLOCK TICKING FOR CONCEIVING MILLENNIUM BABY

<P>
   PHOENIX _ Tonight's the night.
</P>
<P>
   Snooze and you'll lose the optimum date for conceiving what
might _ in nine months _ become the first baby born in the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Sawing logs instead of making hay today could defeat Renee and
Walter Harris of Phoenix, declared Y2K Kid contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife works days and I work nights,'' said Walter, a
fast-food restaurant manager, ``so our biggest trick is to have
both of us awake at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Harrises and other couples around the world, who want to
make history as well as a baby, the promise of prizes, gifts and a
lifetime of fame and press clippings is heady stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Unconfirmed rumors promise treasures for the First Family of the
Millennium, including a year's supply of diapers, a college
education and diamond rings.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Canadian businessman who's trying to round up
$2 million in goods and has obtained a U.S. trademark for the term
``Official Millennium Baby.''
</P>
<P>
   China has been beset with rumors of what the first babe might
receive, so much so that the ``Beijing Youth Daily'' reported on
one woman who aborted her fetus so that she could time her
pregnancy closer to the target date.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the Valley, others just want to offer support for the
conjugal cause.
</P>
<P>
   KZON radio in Phoenix is providing a conceptual cubicle for
competing couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the millennium baby conceived on ZON property and
during the morning show,'' said the show's producer, Kevin Butler.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix radio station Power 92 offered free Millennium
Conception Kits valued at $49.99 to any couple entering the
reproduction race.
</P>
<P>
   Three accepted, including the Harrises.
</P>
<P>
   All vow to make good use of the kit's contents, including a
how-to volume titled ``Taking Charge of Your Fertility,'' an
ovulation calculator and pregnancy test kit, along with such mood
enhancers as massage oil and red tapers.
</P>
<P>
   A Web site _  &UR; www.having-a-baby.com/millenium.htm _ (that's
their spelling of millennium) is posting daily preconception tips
that include sound suggestions, such as that women should start
taking folic acid supplements before they become pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Another site _ babycenter.com _ designed for new and expectant
parents, is offering the conception kits for sale and free advice
on everything from picking a baby's name to calculating how long it
might take to become pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Even theologians appear supportive of parents who hope to create
a new life early in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all for procreation,'' said the Rev. Mark Hebert,
associate pastor at St. Thomas the Apostle Catholic Church in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The child has to be wanted for its own sake and not just for
the big prizes,'' he said. ``And the child's safety has to come
first.''
</P>
<P>
   Father Hebert would be appalled if any doctor performed an
elective Cesarean-section or induced labor just to increase the
odds of a timely delivery.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to timing, competing couples might want to consult
Sharon Murri of Paradise Valley, who produced Arizona's first baby
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``She arrived at 12:01 a.m. on January 1,'' Murri said, ``and my
labor nurse was pretty excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Murri, however, wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted the tax deduction and we just missed it by
seconds,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But just to show how unpredictable Mother Nature and babies can
be, Murri remembers that Cassidy Joy arrived eight days after
Murri's Dec. 24 due date. That confirms what reproduction experts
have always known _ only 5 percent of mothers give birth on their
due dates.
</P>
<P>
   And although April 9 is the prime conception date for a Jan. 1
delivery, the window of opportunity is March 26 to April 23.
</P>
<P>
   Or thereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-eight to 42 weeks is considered full-term, so you
really have a month there to play with,'' said Dr. Ole George
Torjusen, a Valley obstetrician/gynecologist.
</P>
<P>
   Even the duration of labor could throw off a well-timed due
date, Torjusen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For first-time mothers, labor could last 12 to 18 hours,'' he
said. ``A second labor usually lasts 12 hours or less.''
</P>
<P>
   But just getting pregnant could be the biggest feat of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an awful lot of hurdles,'' said Barbara Faber, a
reproductive endocrinologist and infertility expert at Samaritan
Institute of Reproductive Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Her best advice to couples wanting the first baby of the
millennium is to be healthy, eat well, exercise, get plenty of
sleep, keep caffeine at a minimum, avoid alcohol and don't smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I tell people to use an ovulation prediction kit that you
can buy at the grocery store for $15,'' she said. ``In advance, it
will predict when the egg will be released.''
</P>
<P>
   With that type of insider information and adequate contact,
something Faber recommends should occur every other day around the
time of ovulation, couples stand a 90 percent chance of conceiving
within one year.
</P>
<P>
   If, she adds, there are no infertility problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-five percent of the time, it's the male's fault for not
conceiving,'' Faber said. ``And the rest of the time, it's the
female's.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly if the woman is older than 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then their chances of getting pregnant each month go down,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if conception does occur, 15 percent of all pregnancies end
in spontaneous miscarriages in the first trimester.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who do manage the miracle of conception, what are
their chances of having a safe delivery in a millennium that
threatens to dawn with computer breakdowns and electrical
malfunctions?
</P>
<P>
   Two of the state's largest hospitals say they are braced for the
worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have emergency generators that can run indefinitely, and
we've had a committee working on Y2K problems so that we'll be
prepared,'' said Jennifer Pool, spokeswoman for Good Samaritan
Regional Medical Center in Phoenix, the state's most prolific
birthing site, with a record 7,732 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we've been preparing for that for a couple of years,''
echoed Laurie Munn of St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in
Phoenix, adding her facility will be Y2K compliant by July.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's the most troubling niggle of all. Just who's
declaring the winner and according to which time zone?
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, labor room nurses keep in touch on New Year's Eve,
determining the number of laboring moms in the running. There's a
recheck after midnight, when times are compared and a winner named.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they always cheat,'' Torjusen said. ``We all do.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a consolation prize for parents whose babies
just can't wait for the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Figure on about $1,350 in tax deductions. &QL;

VAUGHN HEADED FOR DL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Barring a miraculous recovery from Thursday night to
today, first baseman Mo Vaughn is headed for the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who suffered a bone bruise and sprained ligaments in his
left ankle while falling into the Indians dugout on Tuesday's
opening night, won't try to talk the Angels medical staff out of
it. In fact, it's Vaughn's idea as much as anybody's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's going to argue,'' Vaughn said. ``I've stated my
point. It's already been 48 hours and it's not feeling that good.
I'll let 'em know by (today).
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to this point, we're playing with 24 guys, so that limits
the club. I don't think I'll be feeling that good (today). It's
been three days now. The DL is 12 more. If I'm not ready in 12
days, I'll cut the whole damn foot off. It'll be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn is confident he'll be back when he'd be eligible to
return from the DL, which would be April 22 in Toronto. But the
medical staff has indicated an injury the nature of Vaughn's could
put someone out anywhere from two to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, however, has a history of healing quickly. He has been
on the disabled list only one time in his career _ he had torn
cartilage in his left knee in 1997 but missed only three weeks.
Vaughn also seems to know his body well.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I tried to play in a couple days, I'd be in worse shape in
a couple weeks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Terry Collins said the decision of what to do with
Vaughn is strictly out of his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to the medical staff, Mo and (general manager) Billy
(Bavasi), he said. ``However they feel. If he thinks it's going to
be that long....''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels will likely call up first baseman Chris Pritchett
from Triple-A to replace Vaughn on the roster. Pritchett was the
final cut from the roster after a solid spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Bullpen overworked: Tim Belcher and Ken Hill each lasted only
41/3 innings in the Angels' first two games, putting an unwanted
burden on the bullpen at such an early point of the season. But
that is exactly why Collins and his coaching staff decided to begin
the season with 12 pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sitting here wondering if we've got enough even now,''
Collins said. ``We're going to be as cautious as we can early in
the year. Twelve pitchers gives us the opportunity to be
cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   In Arlington: The Angels begin a four-game series in Texas
tonight against the Rangers. Pitching matchups for the series:
Tonight (5:35) _ Chuck Finley vs. John Burkett; Saturday (5:35) _
Omar Olivares vs. Rick Helling; Sunday (5:05) _ Tim Belcher vs.
Aaron Sele; Monday (11:35) _ Ken Hill vs. Mark Clark. &QL;

A VERY CHARMING GUEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ China's prime minister, Zhu Rongji, charmed his
dinner audience on Thursday night with his knowledge of American
history and his candor, drawing applause when he recited part of
the Gettysburg Address and smiles at his honesty in complaining
that his legs fell asleep as he stood in the lengthy receiving
line.
</P>
<P>
   After their daylong official visit together, he and President
Clinton toasted each other at a black-tie event at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In his own toast, the president noted that Zhu had said that
only good friends tell each other what they really think. ``If
you're right about that, you have turned out to be quite a good
friend indeed,'' Clinton said, taking note of Zhu's renowned
outspokenness.
</P>
<P>
   In a chatty way, Zhu spoke not only of the nations'
disagreements but also of the moments during the day when he toured
parts of the White House and saw the original copy of the
Gettysburg Address. He told the audience he had once been able to
recite all of it in English, having learned it in school. And he
switched to English to say, ``of the people, by the people and for
the people,'' drawing applause.
</P>
<P>
   But he also might have caused a tiny bit of consternation as he
set the scene for his recitation of Abraham Lincoln's words. He
mentioned that he had toured the Lincoln bedroom. In the last few
years, it has become a symbol of the Clintons' eager wooing of
influential political donors; many spent the night there.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication that Zhu was aware of the room's recent
political history. Just earlier on Thursday, Zhu spent time
dismissing media questions about allegations that China had tried
to influence the 1996 presidential election here.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's dinner drew members of Congress, the elite of
the business world and Clinton's national security team, which took
a break from the war in Kosovo to try to repair a relationship
badly strained by allegations of China's theft of American military
secrets and illegal campaign contributions to Clinton, and by the
country's human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   It came in the middle of Zhu's three-day visit to Washington,
the first by a Chinese prime minister in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu received the 19-gun salute befitting an official visit,
rather than the 21-gun salute reserved for heads of state. But like
heads of state, Zhu and his wife, Lao An, stayed in Blair House,
the president's guest house, and received protection from the
Secret Service (although they brought their own too). The red
Chinese flag with its yellow stars fluttered next to the Stars and
Stripes on lampposts around the White House.
</P>
<P>
   And their dinner _ of grilled chicken and roasted salmon, served
on Reagan china with Kennedy crystal and vermeil flatware, set on
rose damask tablecloths _ was every bit as formal. The bamboo
centerpieces contained flaming yellow tulips with red stripes,
orchids and poppies. Afterwards, the Clintons and their guests
adjourned to the East Room to hear Yo-Yo Ma, one of the world's
premier cellists, pianist Sara Wolfensohn and pipa soloist Wu Man.
</P>
<P>
   The guest list of more than 220 people was stocked with business
executives who have been anxious for more access to what is
potentially the world's largest market. Some were disappointed with
Thursday's news that negotiations failed to nail down a deal that
would allow China to enter the World Trade Organization, but many
were pleased that China had made certain concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Among those attending were Chris Galvin, chief executive officer
of Motorola Inc., which wants to build a cell-phone network across
China. China has agreed to allow American firms to invest up to 51
percent in cellular telephone and paging systems and will allow
them to operate throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been under fierce attack from Congress for openly
welcoming China at a time when relations between the two countries
border on the hostile. Key members of Congress have said that
because of major disputes between the two countries they were
alarmed at what they saw as Clinton's goal of rewarding China by
trying to bring it into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu had come seeking entry into the trade organization. After it
was clear on Thursday that this would not happen, at least now, Zhu
told reporters he had almost canceled his trip here because he was
afraid that anti-Chinese sentiment was so strong, he ``didn't have
the guts'' to show up.
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed quite relaxed at the White House on Thursday
night.

ADVERTISING: CADILLAC SIGNS LONG-TERM DEAL FOR SIGNS IN TIMES
SQUARE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The automotive brand promoted as the standard of the
world is taking a long-term parking space in the neighborhood
promoted as the crossroads of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac, the luxury division of the General Motors Corp., has
signed its first extended lease for advertising signs in the
cacophonous canyons of Times Square. For the next three years,
Cadillac ads will be visible on 2 Times Square, the northern anchor
of the district at the corners of 47th Street, Broadway and Seventh
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither Cadillac nor Sherwood Outdoor in New York,
which oversees ad sales for 2 Times Square, would discuss the
terms, it is estimated that Cadillac is paying $1 million to $1.5
million annually to lease the space. Cadillac has an option to
renew the lease in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   There are six signs for Cadillac at the site, now pitching the
Evoq roadster concept car and the brand's World Wide Web site
(www.cadillac.com). The so-called flex-face panels of vinyl and
fiberglass are wrapped around the cube-like structure directly
under the familiar neon sign for Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which houses the Olive Garden restaurant and the
Foley's restaurant of the Renaissance Hotel, previously carried ads
for Broadway shows, Apple Computer and Amtrak.
</P>
<P>
   The Cadillac display may be supplemented at some point with a
metal version of the brand's crest, car headlights that would
illuminate and even actual vehicles, mounted on a concrete platform
on the roof of the structure.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac's arrival in what could be called the Cadillac of
outdoor advertising venues is indicative of the boom that has
brought many classic brands back to Times Square. Decades of decay
had led blue-chip marketers to avoid the area until recently.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, which used to advertise Chevrolet above the site
where Cadillac is now perched, joins Coca-Cola and other household
names like Budweiser and Planters in returning to Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environment is a better place to be for marketers now,''
said Kim Kosak, director for advertising and sales promotion at
Cadillac in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to be more of a global player in the marketplace,
and this is a great opportunity to reach a large global audience,''
she added. ``With 1.5 million eyeballs a day passing by, global
eyeballs, it's perfect for us.''
</P>
<P>
   A top executive at the longtime Cadillac agency echoed his
client.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real statement being in Times Square, and we're
delighted about it,'' said John Farrell, president for the North
American operations of D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles
Communications, a unit of MacManus Group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Times Square ``is very appropriate for Cadillac and where
Cadillac is going to go,'' he added, referring to ambitious plans
to revitalize the brand. These include campaigns asserting that
Cadillac vehicles offer a blend of ``art and science'' with
``world-class technology'' and ``new design and styling.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if a decade ago the Times Square advertising business
needed Cadillac more than Cadillac needed Times Square, perhaps
today the reverse is true. Then, because of perceptions that Times
Square was a seedy, perilous place, there was a buyer's market for
signs. And Cadillac was the leader in American luxury-car sales, a
status the brand enjoyed for nearly six decades.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the sign business is flourishing in a prospering Times
Square, and demand for Cadillacs has tapered off. In 1998, Cadillac
held onto its No. 1 ranking in the competitive luxury-car market
only by staging an expensive, last-minute sales blitz.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, Cadillac has fallen behind rivals like Lexus,
Mercedes-Benz and Lincoln; sales through March 31 declined 15.9
percent from the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Evoq is the first visual embodiment of what the new
direction of Cadillac is from a product standpoint,'' Ms. Kosak
said. ``And our communications are being designed to better
represent this new direction.''
</P>
<P>
   After Evoq, the signs will advertise the redesigned Cadillac
DeVille to be introduced for the 2000 model year. The celebration
of New Year's Eve in Times Square for the year 2000 ``will be
important for the DeVille launch,'' Ms. Kosak said.
</P>
<P>
   That embodies the potential benefits of advertising in Times
Square that extend beyond posting the signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The promotional and event-marketing opportunities that Times
Square can offer advertisers can really help get an edge up on
their competition,'' said Brian Turner, president at Sherwood
Outdoor. Those can be multiplied by the free publicity the signs
draw through appearances in movies and television programs as well
as in photographs in magazines and newspapers and even on
postcards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's enormous residual value there,'' said Jeffrey Katz,
chairman of real estate company Sherwood Equities, who formed
Sherwood Outdoor last year to market signs on three buildings he
owns and manages: 2 Times Square, 1 Times Square and 1600 Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the risk of sounding like a real estate guy in the
advertising world, it's location, location, location,'' Katz said,
chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Square signs are emblematic of steps Cadillac is
taking to rejuvenate its brand identity, particularly among younger
drivers. The division also ran a commercial during Super Bowl
XXXIII for Escalade, the new Cadillac sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The spot, created by Berlin Cameron &AMP; Partners in New York, used
the George Thorogood rock tune ``Bad to the Bone'' and an assertive
slogan, ``It's good to be the Cadillac.''
</P>
<P>
   More surprises may be on the way from Cadillac. As they say in
the outdoor advertising business, watch this space.

ANALYSIS: BEHIND MICROSOFT'S SHIFT ON WINDOWS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting and inserts)   (sw) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Microsoft's decision not to blend its consumer
and business Windows operating systems into a single product
reflects profound changes in the consumer personal computer
marketplace that have surprised both the software giant and its
partner, Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Almost overnight the PC market has moved from a business defined
by office products to one that is increasingly delineated by both
consumer prices and features.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's shift became apparent on Wednesday at a Los Angeles
hardware developers' conference, when Steven A. Ballmer,
Microsoft's president, announced that the company was abandoning
plans to tailor its long delayed Windows 2000 operating system to
desktop PC's as well as more powerful corporate machines. Instead,
it plans at least one more release of its aging Windows operating
system for desktop computers. A version, based on Windows 98 that
is scheduled to ship this fall, will fix software flaws and add
some new consumer-oriented features.
</P>
<P>
   Then the company, based in Redmond, Wash., plans ``sometime in
2000'' to release a new consumer version of Windows that will offer
an as-yet-unannounced set of easy-to-use consumer features, such as
``instant on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer said the changes arose from listening to Microsoft's
customers _ PC makers and software developers _ who contended that
the Windows 2000 combined product was not appropriate for consumer
markets increasingly focused on games and entertainment and not
office applications.
</P>
<P>
   The shift, industry analysts said, may indicate that Microsoft
has found itself at a crossroads as significant as the one it faced
in 1995 when it abruptly shifted direction and embraced the growing
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   By redefining the computer marketplace and acknowledging the
failure of its strategy to use a single operating system for
desktop machines, Microsoft is leaving itself vulnerable to
competition _ just as Intel is being successfully attacked at the
low end of the chip market by companies like Advanced Micro Devices
and Cyrix.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, consumer electronics companies like Sony are investing
in software and operating systems and refining consumer products
like its Playstation line so they will increasingly serve as
Internet computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an explosive problem,'' said Mark Anderson, president
of Technology Alliance Partners, a research and consulting firm
based in Friday Harbor, Wash. ``The consumer market will be the
largest market in the world for operating systems,'' and Microsoft
does not have a product.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer's strategy shift included an acknowledgment that the
company's ``Simple PC'' initiative, intended to clean up the
increasingly complex design of the PC, had not gone far enough.
That effort, in connection with Intel has now been renamed ``Easy
PC,'' and Microsoft's president said that it would remain a
multiyear effort.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Ballmer, by announcing Microsoft's intent to add the
new consumer operating system between its Windows 98 and Windows CE
product lines, is in effect admitting that the company's CE
strategy has been a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   In its recent corporate reorganization, the Windows CE consumer
product line was divided between set-top box and hand-held and
portable groups. The shift raised questions about the future of
Windows CE, which has so far had only lukewarm support among
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Anderson said, while Intel's failure to
respond quickly enough to the threat at the low end was a
billion-dollar mistake, Microsoft may not pay such a price if it
responds promptly because there are not yet viable competitors in
the consumer space.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Linux operating system remains at least a year
away from being simple enough to install and having a meaningful
number of consumer applications. And the Be operating system,
developed by Be Inc., of Menlo Park, Calif., has yet to take off.
</P>
<P>
   And although Apple Computer has gained some market share and
been revitalized since the return of its co-founder, Steven P.
Jobs, it still remains at a price disadvantage to PC's in consumer
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the competitive situation at the low end of the PC market
is likely to become more volatile because the Windows 98 operating
system is increasingly the wrong product for consumers who are
oriented toward entertainment and away from Microsoft's Office
productivity suite.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the tip of the iceberg,'' said Jeffrey Tarter,
the editor of Softletter, an industry newsletter based in
Watertown, Mass. ``The real problem is the more you look at the
innards of Windows the more complicated and more flaky it gets. I
don't see any way that they can fix the mess they created without
going back to the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   That appears to be exactly what Microsoft is doing in announcing
a new consumer operating system that may appear in the year 2000 or
2001. Ballmer said the new operating system would include advances
in digital media handling, home networking, Internet technologies
and improvements in the ease of installation and use. That product
outline has evoked a skeptical response from competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a risk of being called sexist, ageist and French,'' said
Jean Louis Gassee, chairman of Be, ``if you put multimedia, a
leather skirt and lipstick on a grandmother and take her to a
nightclub, she's still not going to get lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with its consumer plans in a state of flux, Microsoft also
announced plans for its corporate Windows 2000 operating system,
raising new concerns that by fragmenting its product line the
company may inadvertently sew confusion among customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This raised a red flag for me,'' said Louis J. Mazzucchelli
Jr., a financial analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison, a New York
investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the company now had as many as four or more
versions of its high-end Windows 2000 operating system (formerly
Windows NT) in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember when Apple had more than 17 different product
lines?'' he said. ``I have trouble understanding how Microsoft is
going to keep customers from becoming confused.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Windows Server Appliance, which Ballmer announced
on Wednesday, he said the company was working on Windows 2000,
Windows 2000 Professional, Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000
Advanced Server and Windows 2000 Data Center.
</P>
<P>
   Conceivably, this could leave the software developer at a
disadvantage against Linux and other versions of the Unix operating
system, which have been growing rapidly among both Internet server
and software developer markets.

YOUNG IMPRESSES JOHNSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi had three homers and eight RBI through the first
three games for the Dodgers. The bullpen went nearly 10 innings
without allowing a hit. Yet, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said
it's second baseman Eric Young he's most pleased about.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been my MVP,'' Johnson said. ``He's had nothing but great
at-bats, stealing a base when you need it, exciting to watch, has a
great stroke, knows how to work a pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a mouthful, but Young's been all that.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Thursday's game with the Colorado Rockies, Young
was hitting .455. Equally important, Young had a firm grasp on the
strike zone and was getting deep into counts.
</P>
<P>
   In the three games, Young drew three walks and was hit by a
pitch. That was one of the things he needed to improve upon as a
leadoff hitter. In 117 games last season, he walked 45 times. His
career high for walks in a season is 63, which he accomplished in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what it's all about, making the pitchers work,'' Young
said. ``Don't give away any at-bats. Make it a battle.''
</P>
<P>
   In the opener, Young reached base in his first four plate
appearances. He reached twice in Tuesday's 3-2 win and went 3 for 4
in Wednesday's series finale. And once on base, Young is causing
trouble. His four stolen bases were more than any other team in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven or 12 in pen: The Dodgers' bullpen was outstanding
against the Diamondbacks, allowing three runs in 102/3 innings.
There was a stretch in which the bullpen didn't allow a hit in 92/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he wouldn't rule out using 12 pitchers once
right-hander Antonio Osuna (elbow soreness) comes off the disabled
list. Johnson said that decision remains a week to 10 days ahead.
Currently, the Dodgers have 11 pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in the American League (with Baltimore), sometimes
I wished I had 13,'' Johnson said. ``(Osuna) needs to pitch, just
to be safe, maybe two or three times. It's not like we're in a
panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports were good after Osuna threw a simulated game Thursday.
He is set to begin a rehab stint with Single-A San Bernardino on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to go slow so we don't have any setbacks,'' Johnson
said. ``I'd like to see where he can throw three innings down
there. He needs to build (up to) that.''
</P>
<P>
   Walks, balks and chalks: Injured outfielder Todd Hollandsworth
(pulled hamstring) began throwing and jogging and said,
unquestionably, he'd be ready when he's eligible to come off the
disabled list April 18. Hollandsworth said he wants to begin a
rehab assignment late next week so he can get his timing back...
With Paul Lo Duca scheduled to make the start against the Rockies,
it left utility infielder Tripp Cromer and long reliever Dave
Mlicki as the only two Dodgers yet to appear in a game... Johnson
came up with a humorous take on Mel Rojas' outing Wednesday in
which both Arizona hitters he faced homered. ``That wasn't what I
expected, but he did throw strikes,'' Johnson said.... Offensively,
the Dodgers want to improve on last year's lack of production from
their six through eight hitters. In the three-game series with
Arizona, the home team's six through eight hitters were 9 for 36
(.250) with two runs scored and two RBI. Last season the six
through eight batters hit .228.

CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR PROCLAIMS FIRST 100 DAYS A SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TERRI HARDY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Gov. Gray Davis said Thursday he believes
his first 100 days in office have been more productive than any
other administration in four decades, launching reform and higher
expectations in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   But ask Republican Assemblyman Tom McClintock, and the Granada
Hills lawmaker laments Davis' term so far as ``100 days of lost
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in between is Diana Dixon-Davis, an education activist
from Chatsworth and a mother of three. Dixon-Davis said the
education reforms that were the focus of the governor's first days
in office have not been ``earthshaking,'' but she's still happy for
any progress at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a sense of relief -- my God, someone up there finally
recognizes we have a problem in our schools,'' Dixon-Davis said.
``I feel like we are getting back to thinking about standards,
accountability and putting money in schools.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first week of office, during his State of the State
speech, Davis promised to make education his first, second and
third priority, and he didn't disappoint. Davis pushed through his
four education bills at breakneck speed, and Democrats solidly
backed him, allowing for little debate or Republican input along
the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say, without any false modesty, that my
administration has produced more substantive achievements than any
administration in the last 40 years,'' Davis told reporters
Thursday at a news conference. ``I have established a moderate
course, and we have moved mountains that people thought couldn't be
moved on our most challenging issue: public education.''
</P>
<P>
   All now signed into law, the reforms will implement a peer
review system for teachers, set up a reward and sanction system for
poorly performing campuses, require seniors to pass an exit exam
before graduation and implement intensive reading academies. And,
he successfully pushed for the University of California to approve
a plan that would admit the top 4 percent of the graduating class
of any high school into their campuses, a plan seeking to boost
minority enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   But McClintock's contention is that because of Davis' renowned
caution, the governor's bills became watered down and failed to
seek far-reaching educational reform -- including provisions that
would hold teachers accountable. This, despite Davis being the
first governor in 16 years with a Legislature dominated by his own
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davis' great failing is that he is adverse to anything
controversial -- and real change is controversial,'' McClintock
said. ``I believe that because the governor did little to change
the status quo in our schools, in the next four years we are going
to see campuses with more bureaucracy and lower test scores.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis sees his deliberate method of approaching education reform
as crucial to its passage. But he admitted it wasn't easy. In fact,
he said he grew very depressed at the constant demand by a host of
constituencies for him to ``deal with their problems now.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis believes ``16 years of pent-up demand'' created the lack
of patience.
</P>
<P>
   A slow appointment process in some instances left commissions
unable to operate because they lack the necessary appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he has made strides in other areas besides education.
The governor said he is proud that he has strengthened ties with
Mexico, brought economic relief to farmers hit by this winter's
citrus freeze and negotiated environmental protections for the
old-growth redwoods in the North Coast's Headwaters Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Davis agreed to a temporary salary hike for state workers and
has supported the return to the eight-hour workday, a move critics
say is a political payback to labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   Davis vowed Thursday that education issues would continue to
dominate his agenda. He said he would push for all college students
to perform community service before they graduate. And he wants to
increase the involvement of business in education, particularly
looking at corporations to fund textbooks and computer wiring to
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Any budget surplus, he said, would likely go to the schools.

IT'S WORTH THE WAIT  
 CHAMBLEE'S 3-UNDER 69 GOOD FOR 1ST-ROUND TIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ After 12 long years of watching his peers get
eaten up at The Masters, Brandel Chamblee finally was invited to
play at the Godzilla of golf courses known as Augusta National.
</P>
<P>
   But in his haste to make his way down Magnolia Lane, the
tree-shrouded driveway that leads to the front door of the club, a
funny thing happened to the pro from Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Chamblee, who arrived last Saturday, almost missed the
unpretentious, white-and-green sign that reads: ``Augusta National
_ Members Only.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It snuck up on me,'' he said. ``I came down Washington (Road)
and almost went right past it _ that little, small entrance.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing Chamblee made a sharp right. Otherwise he wouldn't
have gotten the jump on the competition by getting in a ``few extra
practice rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chamblee was guarded when he arrived Thursday morning for
the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had heard all of the horror stories, about how much the
course changed from practice rounds to tournament rounds,'' noted
Chamblee, who earned his way onto these hallowed but humbling
grounds by winning last year's Greater Vancouver Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty much everybody I talked with this week said, `Don't get
used to this,' when you hit a shot and it stopped on the green. So
I didn't know what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   How about a tie for the lead with Davis Love III and Scott
McCarron after an opening 3-under 69?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the course played pretty much how I expected it to
play,'' a beaming Chamblee said. ``Television doesn't do it
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many neophytes get their way with ``the National,'' as the
green-jacketed members refer to their course. But Chamblee had his
day, the highlight being a 4-foot eagle at the 13th hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit my drive right where I aimed, and that left me 216 yards
from the hole,'' Chamblee reported. ``Then I hit my Zoom by PRGR.''
</P>
<P>
   Zoom?
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look like either an iron or a wood. It's ugly the
first time you see it, but when you hit it, it gets much
prettier.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the Zoom is a driving iron and looks like a thick
1-iron. Many pros are picking up the club because it hits the ball
long and straight, perfect for this layout.
</P>
<P>
   Love and McCarron also did a lot of that, each making four
birdies against a lone bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty tough out there, and the course played pretty
difficult, too,'' said Love, whose game seems ready to win the
tournament he seeks most. ``The greens, I was surprised how firm
and fast they were. It wasn't the most consistent I've seen them,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in the afternoon, a thunderstorm interrupted play for 95
minutes. When it resumed, the tournament favorite, David Duval,
made his third straight bogey at the 14th hole.
</P>
<P>
   Duval was one of 12 players who failed to complete their rounds
in the light of day. He is 1 under through 17 holes thanks to a
late birdie and will complete his round today. Also with one hole
to play was Zimbabwe's Nick Price, who was 3-under.
</P>
<P>
   The rain was no great surprise. High humidity and temperatures
in the upper 80s had hung around all day. Most players' shirts were
drenched before they reached the first tee.
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara, the defending champ, opened his title defense with
a splendid 70.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, there were the usual disasters. Duval got wet at the
13th for one of his bogeys, and Phil Mickelson took a plunge at the
15th, leading to a round of 74.
</P>
<P>
   There also was superior shot-making. Lee Janzen holed out from
the fairway for an eagle 3 at No. 2 en route to a 70. Japan's Jumbo
Ozaki made a rare 2 at the 10th, again with a wedge from the short
stuff, finishing at 71.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a good rally, it was the one strung together by
Tiger Woods, who got sandwiched between two pine cones after he
pulled his drive into the tall Georgia pines on the eighth hole.
That led to a slashing shot across the fairway into an azalea bush,
where he took a penalty drop. He finished with a triple-bogey 8 on
his card.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, Woods was 2 over. No problem. Three straight
birdies, beginning at No. 12, the famed middle hole of Amen Corner,
and he was in the red. A bogey at the 17th left him at 72.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blunder was the tee shot,'' Woods explained. ``In the
past, when I'm 2 over I would try to be aggressive. Now I say to
myself, `Be patient.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There is no other way to approach this monster. The weather is
not cooperating, the trees are as terrifying as always, and the
greens appear to be even scarier than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this must be The Masters. &QL;

CLASS OF NELSON SHINES AT AUGUSTA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ One hand gripping a wooden cane, the other
clutching his wife's arm, the greatest iron player in golf history
steadied himself and began the slow loving walk he makes here every
spring.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't yet 8 a.m. Augusta National was yawning, stretching,
the grass damp with dew.
</P>
<P>
   An early riser, Byron Nelson had arrived at the course to music
of songbirds and the whispery sounds of employees with brooms
sweeping purple wisteria blooms from the porch of the
plantation-style clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   He first played here in 19-and-35. He won The Masters in 1937,
and again in '42.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who, three years later did something no golfer will do
again, returns every year. He hopes to keep coming back, God
willing, until he dies.
</P>
<P>
   But as for teeing up a ball. In front of cameras and all those
people. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Going down there is hard for me,'' Nelson said, his pale blue
eyes gazing toward the first tee. ``Hitting a ball is harder than
any championship I won. It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do
in golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Byron Nelson, 87, weighed his obligation to tradition against
his pride.
</P>
<P>
   Nodding thanks to well-wishers, the old man in the white straw
hat steeled himself and shuffled on, his hip aching, Peggy at his
side.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoys seeing Gene and Sam again. The annual reunion is a
celebration. Their smiles and winks and handshakes say ``Well, we
made it another year.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the first round of The Masters the three honorary
starters are introduced, like members of royalty, even though
introductions are unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Those who follow golf and cherish the game's history, know who
they are, and were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now on the tee. . .''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sarazen always has the honors. ``The Squire'' is the
oldest.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson hits next. Born in 1912, ``Lord Byron'' is three months
older than Sam Snead.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Gene was 90,'' Byron said, smiling at the memory, ``he
told me `I'm ``never'' going to do this again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Sarazen keeps coming back, too. He is 97.
</P>
<P>
   They return to Augusta as if answering some beckoning call. They
make the pilgrimage because winning The Masters was a milestone in
their lives. Because they have a standing invitation to attend the
champions dinner and play here forever if they wish. Their memories
are here. They feel welcome.
</P>
<P>
   This year Nelson feels like a special honoree. A bronze statue
in his likeness was unveiled this week in downtown Augusta. Asked
if he ever dreamed of such an honor, the gentlemanly Texan blinked
from behind his bifocals and said, well, no, of course not.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be awful egotistical,'' he said. ``When you're
playing you never think of that.''
</P>
<P>
   All Nelson thought about during his prime was winning and
winning is what he did. He won 52 professional tournaments. The
golf world buzzes about David Duval being on a roll. In 1945 Nelson
won the Phoenix Open and then claimed 18 more tournament titles,
including a record 11 in a row. The Tour's leading money winner
that year collected $63,336 in War Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   While the years haven't diminished Nelson's memory _ he can tick
off details of rounds he played 60 years ago _ he can't play golf
anymore. Nelson underwent hip replacement surgery in 1990. Another
operation came the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't shift,'' he said, frustration in his voice. He
demonstrated his lack of mobility. ``I can't ``pivot''. . .''
Nelson sounded like a golf instructor giving a lesson to himself.
``I tend to come up.'' Then he voiced his fear of public
embarrassment. ``I top a lot of balls.''
</P>
<P>
   But he performed his obligation Thursday. Trading his cane for a
golf club, Byron Nelson swung as best he could. As he silently
lamented the result, the gallery applauded loud and long for the
man who smiled and took his wife's arm and hobbled back toward the
clubhouse and said, ``Peggy, let's have breakfast.'' &QL;

LUCK IS OFTEN KEY INGREDIENT TO DRAFT SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve Ortmayer made up his mind the day he watched Nebraska
running back Lawrence Phillips run for 165 yards and two touchdowns
in the 1996 Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Ortmayer, then vice president of the St. Louis Rams, returned to
his office the next day and told team officials he knew the
identity of their No. 1 pick.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Phillips, chosen sixth overall in '96, is out
of the NFL and the Rams are saddled with making one of the worst
picks of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the fortunes of the NFL drafts in the 1990s. A lot of
time has been spent on evaluating talent. But some of the best
selections are more luck than skill.
</P>
<P>
   Denver, which has won back-to-back Super Bowls, made one of the
decade's best picks when it took Georgia running back Terrell Davis
in the sixth round in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get all the credit, but if we had known he was that good,
we would have taken him higher,'' said former Broncos scout Jeff
Smith, who first saw Davis in a game against Clemson during Davis'
senior season.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos aren't the only team to have great success in later
rounds of the '90s drafts.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay got quarterback Mark Brunell, now of Jacksonville, in
the fifth round and tight end Mark Chmura in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh took starting strong safety Lethon Flowers in the
fifth round and starting linebacker Carlos Emmons in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Bengals, meanwhile, have the AFC's worst record
this decade, and their blown first-round picks of quarterback David
Klingler (1992), Dan Wilkinson ('94) and Ki-Jana Carter ('95) are a
big reason why.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the Washington Redskins' draft record this decade and
you can see one reason why they haven't made the playoffs since
1992.
</P>
<P>
   They used the fourth pick in '92 on Michigan wide receiver
Desmond Howard, who was a bust other than as a return specialist.
Desperate for a quarterback, they took Heath Shuler of Tennessee
third overall in '94, and after being released by New Orleans, he's
out of the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people tend to do is overrate players who come from
strong (college) programs, when their supporting cast makes them
better than they are,'' said Gary Horton, editor of the ``War
Room'' draft publication and a former scout for Cleveland and Tampa
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shuler's a guy who didn't have a great feel for running an
offense. He was part of a very successful system (at Tennessee)
that hid his weaknesses. He never had to win games by himself, and
it showed when he got into the pros.'' &QL; 
Good or lucky? &QL; 
Joel Buchsbaum, ``Pro Football Weekly's'' draft expert, doesn't
think the Broncos pick of Davis was as good as advertised.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you let a guy hang on the board as long as they did, you
don't think he's a great player,'' Buchsbaum said. ``You
misevaluated him. Everyone misevaluated him. You just misevaluated
him less.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he never thought Davis had potential to be a
2,000-yard rusher when he scouted him. ``He caught a swing pass
(against Clemson) and turned it into a nice play,'' Smith said,
adding that Davis was a ``tweener'' in terms of size and speed who
``flashed some good things.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the second day of the '95 draft came around, the
Broncos still were in need of a running back and had Davis
available on their draft board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike (Broncos Coach Mike Shanahan) decided he wanted another
back for (training) camp,'' said Smith, now a scout for the Miami
Dolphins. ``Fergy and Mike talked it over. Mike pulled the
trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Fergy is Bob Ferguson, vice president-player personnel of the
Cardinals, who was the Broncos' personnel boss at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to Mike's credit and (offensive coordinator) Gary
Kubiak's credit that when they saw Terrell's stuff early in his
first camp, they did the things to take advantage of his skills,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Last season's Super Bowl XXXIII was billed as battle of running
backs: Davis vs. Atlanta's Jamal Anderson, a seventh-round pick in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson still was available in the seventh round because he was
slowed by an ankle injury much of his senior year at Utah and was
used some as a fullback by the Utes even though he wasn't a great
blocker.
</P>
<P>
   But the Falcons had him rated the third-best back in the draft
behind Marshall Faulk and William Floyd and considered drafting him
as early as the third round.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons shouldn't be considered drafting geniuses for the
Anderson selection. In 1991, they took Nebraska cornerback Bruce
Pickens third overall. He didn't sign until early October,
collapsed at his first practice and remained with the team only one
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just a bad pick,'' Buchsbaum said. ``A lot of people
had him in the second round.'' &QL; 
All downhill &QL; 
The worst pick of the '90s has to be the New York Jets taking Penn
State running back Blair Thomas second overall.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas never recovered from a lengthy holdout as a rookie. In
1992, he had no touchdowns. The next year, he lost his starting job
to former Cardinals running back Johnny Johnson, and, by 1994, he
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone agreed on Blair Thomas that he should have been
picked second (overall),'' Buchsbaum said. ``I asked Jimmy Johnson
(then coach of Dallas) after the draft how he had the backs rated.
He gets a lot of credit for getting Emmitt Smith in that draft, but
they had Blair ahead of Emmitt. The Jets just got stuck with a
lemon.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips is a different story. The Rams took him in the first
round even though five teams ahead of them passed because of his
considerable baggage.
</P>
<P>
   Off-the-field problems were the reason quarterback Todd
Marinovich (Los Angeles Raiders in 1991) and offensive tackle
Bernard Williams (Philadelphia Eagles in 1994) were busts.
</P>
<P>
   Buchsbaum said those players could easily have been the success
stories Marshall wide receiver Randy Moss was as a rookie with the
Minnesota Vikings last season. Moss lasted until the 21st pick
after getting into trouble at Florida State and Notre Dame. &QL;

HOW CAN WE HELP? 
 COMMUNITY RALLIES AROUND PAYSON YOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
PAYSON, Ariz. - Hunter Walden's duffel bag is filled with thank-you
notes. Between classes at Payson High, before physical therapy,
after baseball practice, late at night, he expresses his gratitude
on blank cards.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He has so many to acknowledge in this town of about 13,000.
Construction companies, police officers, doctors, businesses,
teachers, tribal leaders, classmates, coaches.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't stop. Love and support keep pouring in for the town
superstar, who, a little more than two months ago, wondered where
he would find the money to pay for his knee surgery. Five dollars
here. A hundred bucks there. A thousand. Many from unknown sources.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, in four days, the $10,000 needed was raised.
</P>
<P>
   At a $5-a-plate spaghetti dinner organized this week by the high
school to help pay back those who loaned money, about 500 people
showed up at Payson Elementary School. One person handed Pam
Walden, Hunter's mother, a $300 check. She cried.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter never expected this.
</P>
<P>
   He is the senior class president, the three-sport star, the guy
who quarterbacked Payson to the Class 3A football title that ended
Lakeside Blue Ridge's state-record 64-game winning streak, the kid
who set a season state home run record as a junior with 17, and the
person younger boys in Payson grow up trying to emulate. And he is
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People I didn't even know were sending me stuff,'' he said.
``They'd say, `Hey, here's some money. Get better.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize the impact I had. I'd be walking down the
street, and a little kid I didn't know would yell, `Hey, how's your
knee?' '' &QL; 
Speedy recovery &QL; 
It's much better, thank you, following surgery to clean out loose
cartilage and hours and hours of therapy for an anterior cruciate
ligament that was 50 percent torn in a Jan. 23 basketball game at
Payson's domed gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   His doctor told him that it would take six to eight weeks before
he could join his baseball teammates. He was back 27 days after the
surgery. The day he was released, while waiting for delivery of a
brace that had been ordered, Walden grabbed his mother's knee brace
and played in a spring tournament game.
</P>
<P>
   He started as the designated hitter but is now back at first
base, hitting .500 with two home runs. At times, he is impatient at
the plate, going after pitches out of the strike zone, still
searching for the stroke that led to 13 home runs in his last 15
games a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past few months, Walden has realized he has so much
more to value than home runs and touchdowns and three-point shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we learned from this the most is that everything can be
taken away in a second,'' Pam Walden said. ``Have other avenues in
case something happens.'' &QL; 
Sense of humor intact &QL; 
Walden now can joke with the maintenance man in Payson's gym about
that fateful game against Cave Creek Cactus Shadows. ``You missed a
spot'' on the floor, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there was no wet spot. There was nobody around Walden,
who was on a breakaway layup when he planted his left leg. The
6-foot-1 guard, who was averaging 22 points, heard a pop. And a
crack.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, faced with surgery in order to salvage Walden's
senior season in baseball, the family didn't have the money or
health insurance to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, who owns a dance studio, didn't have Hunter covered
under school insurance. For the football season alone, it was $130.
For a single mother with five children at home, that's a lot of
money. Pam says she regrets her decision. She now has the
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The problem arose when her ex-husband, who had the children
covered under his insurance, switched employers before Hunter's
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Walden, a former Arizona State linebacker who operates
heavy machinery, moved to Phoenix for a higher-paying job to help
support his children, who range in age from 4 to 17 (Hunter is the
oldest).
</P>
<P>
   His new insurance didn't take effect until February. It was too
late to cover Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all the times the window to hit right here,'' Pam Walden
said. ``The odds of that . . .''
</P>
<P>
   It was a window of misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   Payson Principal Phillip Gille and school counselor Dean
Pederson spearheaded a drive to help the Waldens.
</P>
<P>
   Various school clubs and athletic programs pitched in.
Carwashes. Bake sales. Fund-raisers. A construction company donated
more than $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just brought people together that would want to know,''
Gille said. ``They, in all different ways, jumped on the
bandwagon.''
</P>
<P>
   The student council wrestled with the idea of helping only
Walden, the favored star athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want it to be just because he's an athlete,'' said
Anna Van Zile, student council adviser. ``He really was the guy who
helped bring Payson the state football championship. Even though
he's the president of the student government, we represent the
entire student body and it would look, I think, poorly on us.''
</P>
<P>
   After meeting for hours on the matter, the student council
created a hardship fund and donated $1,500 to the Walden family.
</P>
<P>
   As the Waldens repay the donation, the money goes into the
hardship fund. Van Zile said it will be used for others in need.
Two Payson students lost both of their parents this school year.
</P>
<P>
   Pam doesn't want the support to end with her son. With help from
the Tonto Apache Tribe, money was raised by selling Indian fry
bread to help pay off loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that we need to continue,'' Pam said. ``If
there is ever another mother in a situation I'm in, I hope someone
is there to help her.''
</P>
<P>
   But Van Zile sees a potential bee's nest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about pushing this into a community type of thing,''
Van Zile said. ``But one of the nice things is working within the
school, we've got these guidelines to go by. So anything that has
to do with substance abuse, `Sorry, you no longer qualify.' We're
trying to be really careful. After talking to some elementary
school teachers, there's a need in this community.'' &QL; 
People pull together &QL; 
Only in a small town can this happen, Donnie Walden tells himself
as he sits in Tolleson, part of an ever-growing metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   The family, which recently paid off the final medical bills,
feels awkward to have taken so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's right when there are so many others worse
off,'' Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was taught the value of giving.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd always pick a family at Christmas to buy for,'' said
Donnie Walden, who was divorced three years ago but maintains an
amicable relationship with his ex-wife and takes an active role in
his children's lives. ``We didn't know who we'd pick. We'd leave
the gifts on the doorstep and leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're giving something hoping to receive something, that's
not what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Pam said: ``I guess we put our time in to help others. What goes
around, comes around. But, boy, this has really come around big.''
</P>
<P>
   The Waldens settled in Payson when Hunter was 6. He played all
the sports: football, basketball, soccer, baseball. He excelled in
everything, especially football, playing quarterback on Pop Warner
teams since he was in the fourth grade.
</P>
<P>
   He thought about ending his high school career in the Valley at
St. Mary's, where he could get noticed, prove himself against the
best competition and maybe earn a scholarship to ASU like his dad,
who played for Frank Kush in his last year (1979).
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I've played with these guys since preschool. We've
been together since the eighth grade. If I leave, not only do I let
them down, but myself down. If I leave for a bigger school, that's
not the example I want to set,' '' Donnie Walden said.
</P>
<P>
   Last football season, Hunter ran for more than 1,000 yards and
passed for 1,000, leading the Longhorns to a 13-0 record. He capped
the year with a three-touchdown performance in the 3A title game
against Blue Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a hero in Payson,'' Donnie said. ``He's done things
nobody's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnie realized how popular his son was last winter when he and
his 14-year-old son, Taylor, took a stroll through a Payson park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids were throwing the football, little kids, getting ready to
play a game,'' Donnie said. ``One kid said, `I'm Jamir Miller.' He
was on defense. Another kid who was the quarterback said, `I'm
Hunter Walden.' There's a big difference there, but that's the way
these kids look at that. Taylor said he was going to go tell
Hunter. I told him not to. He said, `Why, dad? You think his head
will get so big, you'll have to tie him to the ground?'
</P>
<P>
   ``But it makes me feel good as a father that people look up to
him and he's been an example to these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Hunter scribbles onto cards, trying to put into words the
debt he believes he owes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the hardest part,'' he said. ``Finding the right words
to thank everybody.'' &QL;

DEVLIN ACCEPTS 1-YEAR PACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Center Mike Devlin has agreed to terms with the
Cardinals on a one-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Devlin, who has been with the the team for three seasons, is
expected to sign today. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but
it is believed to be worth $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Also, wide receiver Chad Carpenter accepted the team's one-year
tender offer.
</P>
<P>
   Devlin, a sixth-year pro, started for the Cardinals in 1996 and
'97 and played behind Aaron Graham last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to be wanted, and they wanted me,'' Devlin said.
``It was clear to me I can help this team even if it's a backup
role. I think this is a good place to be.'' &QL; 
Briefly &QL; 
Agent Leigh Steinberg said he doesn't expect negotiations between
his newest client, free-agent linebacker Jamir Miller, and the
Cardinals to intensify until after the April 17 draft because the
team is focused on the draft. The Cardinals have only $2 million
left under their $57.3 million salary cap for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be an interesting cap-o-nomic case,'' Steinberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   Starting quarterback Jake Plummer spent Monday being
photographed at Papago Park for the cover shot of ``Sport''
magazine's July issue. &QL;

REDMOND, HEAP PACE SCRIMMAGE  
 KEALY ACCURATE BUT ISN'T SATISFIED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - It was less a scrimmage than a sneak preview of
the 1999 season.  &UR; J.R. Redmond and &UR; Todd Heap made it clear Thursday
that they will be carrying the offensive load for Arizona State in
the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Redmond rushed for 92 yards and tight end Heap caught
two passes for 23 yards in the Maroon and Gold scrimmage at Sun
Devil Stadium. Both scored touchdowns, with Redmond shedding
several tacklers and running 78 yards for his.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know this season that J.R. has got to have the ball a
lot,'' ASU Coach &UR; 
 &UR; Bruce Snyder said, ``particularly because we're so young at wide
receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond also showed that he can play wideout.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback &UR; Ryan Kealy, who has been limited recently because of
knee tenderness, was sharp, completing 6 of 8 passes for 70 yards.
The junior is rarely satisfied with his performance, and Thursday
was no different.``''
</P>
<P>
   `` '' ``I don't think you can ever be happy,'' he said. ``I, we,
still have a lot of work to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I can see about this team is there's definitely a
different attitude. We're not setting limits on each other this
year. That's the big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Snyder's concerns during spring ball were evident in the
scrimmage. The team had to go through 70 plays with only seven
healthy offensive linemen. Injuries have contributed to a depth
problem that should improve when the remainder of the recruiting
class reports in August.
</P>
<P>
   A shortage of linebackers, too, has set the Sun Devils back this
spring. Thursday, they had five players working three spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain plays we haven't called because there hasn't
been enough linebackers,'' Snyder said. &QL; 
The gift of Flowers &QL; 
No one made more of an impression Thursday than defensive end  &UR; Erik
Flowers, who posted four sacks and was close several other times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great football player,'' Snyder said. ``He's been
possessed playing his position. He's playing as well as J.R. is
playing his spot and Ryan is playing his.`
</P>
<P>
   The defense had a tendency last season to perform well for
several plays and then give up a big one. Although Flowers said he
is grateful that he has been anointed the leader of the unit by
several coaches, he expects leadership behavior from from his
teammates as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense did horrible last year,'' he said. ``We have
something to prove. We have to show people we're a contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't call it my defense. If you step on a field, you
should have pride and not want the offense to score. I look at all
of us as leaders. Maybe we shouldn't haven't been rated as high as
we were last year, but there's no excuse for playing the way we
did.'' &QL; 
Trophy talk &QL; 
With Redmond expected to carry much of the offensive load in '99,
the Heisman campaign should kick in gear again. A season-opening
meeting with another Heisman hopeful, &UR; Ricky Williams of Texas Tech,
will only draw attention to the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder, who has stressed a team philosophy all off-season, said
he's not worried that a lot of attention will fall on Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a solid person,'' he said. ``And as I told our team,
`Let's go and get him the award.' '' &QL;

SCHEDULE DOES SUNS NO FAVORS IN PLAYOFF BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Last week, when the Suns were in the midst of
losing five of six games, Suns Coach Danny Ainge looked over the
NBA standings and said not much had changed for his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still one of five teams fighting for the last couple of
playoff spots in the West,'' Ainge noted.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the Suns are tonight as they begin the 15-game
stretch run against the Utah Jazz at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   But all things are not equal.
</P>
<P>
   If the Suns are going to extend their streak of playoff
appearances to 11 years, they're going to have to do it against
arguably the most difficult schedule of the teams fighting for the
last three of eight Western Conference playoff berths.
</P>
<P>
   And that's only if some of the other contenders stumble against
some bad teams.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Suns are headed to the draft with two lottery
picks in a draft that's considered mediocre by many analysts _
depending on which underclassmen declare themselves eligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no time to be tired,'' guard Jason Kidd said after the
Suns beat Minnesota _ one of those five teams Ainge spoke about _
on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've only got 15 games left. The most important thing is for
us to make sure we're healthy and make sure we get into the
playoffs, and then we all start over again.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no easy task. Here's how it breaks down for the Suns:
</P>
<P>
   The Suns (17-18) play only seven of their final 15 games against
teams that had sub-.500 records through Wednesday night's games.
They get Dallas twice, Seattle twice, Vancouver once, Denver once
and Sacramento, which is on their heels, once.
</P>
<P>
   The other eight games include three against the defending
Western Conference champion Jazz, two against San Antonio and
Minnesota and one against Houston. They play seven of the 15 at
home, where they have struggled.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (15-20) appear to have the easiest path. First,
they've clinched a tiebreaker with Phoenix should the two end up
tied.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings play 12 of their final 15 against sub-.500 clubs,
including three against the Nuggets, two against Vancouver and two
against the Clippers. They get 11 of 15 games at home, where they
are 7-7. However, they also are two games behind the Suns and three
behind Seattle in the loss column.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle (17-17), which moved a half-game ahead of the Suns for
the No. 7 spot by beating Portland, 87-86, on Thursday night, has a
schedule that's comparable to the Suns' in difficulty. The
SuperSonics have 16 remaining, with nine against sub-.500 teams.
Seven are at home, and they get the Clippers, Denver and Dallas
only once each, and Vancouver twice.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State (14-21) has a mixed bag. The Warriors will play 11
of 15 against sub.-500 teams, but they get only six of the 16 on
their home court, where they are 10-9. The Suns have the tiebreaker
on the Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota (20-14), which played the Clippers in Los Angeles on
Thursday night, appears to be in the best shape to clinch. The
Timberwolves had a 2{-game lead on the Suns before Thursday's game.
Their final 15 games include eight against sub-.500 teams and seven
games at home. The schedule includes one game each against the
Clippers, Dallas and Vancouver, and two against the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are other ways to look at what the Suns face.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play our best against the better teams, so maybe it will
work out better for us,'' guard Rex Chapman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns also are the only team among the five with a winning
record on the road. They have beaten Seattle, San Antonio and the
Los Angeles Lakers on the road this season, and they've come close
twice in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   With some luck, the Suns are capable of finishing the season
with a .500 record and extending the playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the part of the year when we need to step up our game
to make that push for a playoff spot, whether it's the eighth spot
or what,'' forward Clifford Robinson said. ``The important thing
now is for us to string some wins together.'' &QL;

   PHOENIX - The Coyotes look at tonight's match-up with Nashville
at America West Arena as a good chance to open space between
themselves and Anaheim and St. Louis in the race for the No. 4 seed
and home ice advantage in the first round of the Stanley Cup
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   It represents much more to defenseman Jyrki Lumme.
</P>
<P>
   It is a release from prison, a situation he equates to being
sidelined because of a shoulder injury that has caused him to miss
the past 16 games and has thwarted him for 30 to 40 other games, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a return, he said, to a lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really looking forward to tonight,'' said Lumme, who with
seven goals and 20 assists ranks eighth on the team in scoring with
27 points. ``I can't wait to get out there again and feel like I
belong again. It's long days when you're injured and not playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating, especially at his time of year, although
there is never a good time. There's not much you can do about it.
I've never been out this long, at least consecutively, before.''
</P>
<P>
   Lumme, who was signed as a free agent in July to bolster the
defense and power play, said he bided time during rehabilitation by
playing more with his infant daughter, Beanoora, and trying to
maintain his cardiovascular conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting my timing and hockey conditioning back are probably
the two biggest challenges I'll have,'' Lumme said. ``Being in
hockey condition is so different. You can do the (exercise) bike,
you can have hard practices, but once you're out there in a game,
it's so different. It will take a couple of games for me to get my
wind back.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes Coach Jim Schoenfeld doesn't plan to nurse Lumme's
return, saying he will step right in on the No. 1 power play unit.
</P>
<P>
   After a slow start, the power play was showing signs of life
under Lumme's direction. Then the lingering shoulder injury finally
took away his shot after playing hurt for what he said was ``30 to
40 games.'' A decision was made to rest him and get him ready for
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the shoulder healthy?'' he said. ``We'll see when I get out
there. Is my shot back? We'll see when I get out there.''
</P>
<P>
   In his absence, the power play has slumped to the league's
second-worst and is operating at a miserable 11.8 percent and went
0 for 6 in a 1-0 loss to San Jose on Tuesday night. But Lumme's
return and the acquisition of center Robert Reichel from the New
York Islanders figure to add punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to get out there as much as I can,'' Lumme said when
told of Schoenfeld's statement. ``Let's just see how it goes right
now. At least we're in a position where we can kind of experiment
with some stuff. It's not like we're fighting to make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean we still want to win, but we can try different things
and get some chemistry back. The power play is usually for whoever
is going best. Sometimes it doesn't make sense to name a No. 1 and
a No. 2 power play unit. We now have two pretty good groups
together. We just need some chemistry and to keep the puck moving
to get chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes center Jeremy Roenick said Lumme's return will provide a
necessary spark to a power play that he says is in ``sheer panic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be a big lift,'' Roenick said. ``Anything we can get is
huge to us. Jyrki is a good puck handler. He just has to make sure
he doesn't handle it too much, that's all. He provides those flip
shots, which are sometimes more dangerous than the big slap shot
from the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he got hurt, it took away a lot of creativity and our
defensive offense. We have a lot of guys capable of doing the job,
but when he has been healthy, he has been a horse for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lumme said nothing is wrong with the power play that can't be
fixed. He called Tuesday's non-production a classic example of the
team's lingering power outage.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything, the guys are getting frustrated,'' he
said. ``When you're on the ice and nothing happens and fans start
booing, you start pressing and try to create something out of
nothing. You don't take your time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against San Jose we had two, actually three, breakaways from
point-blank range. When those chances didn't go, you think, `Holy
smokes,' then really start pressing. You try to get something
quick, instead creating the chances like you had been doing.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - David Cullen, a senior defenseman on Maine's NCAA
championship team, has been signed to a multi-year, free-agent
contract by the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Cullen, 22, was Maine's No. 3 scorer this season with 11 goals
and 33 assists for 44 points. He was also third on the team in
power-play goals with seven, and his assist total was second only
to Steve Kariya, younger brother of Anaheim's Paul Kariya.
</P>
<P>
   Cullen, 6-foot-2, 209 pounds, was scouted by Coyotes General
Manager Bobby Smith at the NCAA Frozen Four in Anaheim last
weekend, where Cullen notched an assist in the Black Bears' 3-2
overtime win over New Hampshire in the final game. A first-team
All-American, Cullen had 28 goals and 89 assists for 117 points in
four seasons at Maine. He finished two goals short of Maine's
single-season record for defensemen this year, and four short for
his career.
</P>
<P>
   Cullen will report to training camp next season for assignment
in the Coyotes' system. &QL;

DIAMONDBACKS STRIVE TO BECOME AS GOOD AS BRAVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the Diamondbacks close their eyes and wish long
enough, maybe someday they can become like the Atlanta Braves, one
of baseball's dominant clubs of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be shortly after the new millennium begins, or will it
take longer for Arizona to become a playoff-caliber team?
</P>
<P>
   Upgrading the pitching staff over the winter was a start, but a
shaky bullpen must be addressed. The club has tripped over its bats
coming out of the gate after averaging seven runs during the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   After the Diamondbacks were swept by the Los Angeles Dodgers in
their three-game season-opening series, they hope they can emulate
the Braves tonight, Saturday night and Sunday at Turner Field
without becoming the victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're consistent,'' said third baseman Matt Williams, who
had two home runs in the LA series, the first of which was the
300th of his career. ``Their pitching, of course, has been good.
They just do everything right. They catch the ball well, they hit
it, they're a well-rounded team. That's the type of team you want
to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not there yet, but we're getting closer, even though we
lost that series. We played them tough for the most part.''
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Omar Daal will be making his first start of the
season after finishing fifth in the National League in ERA in 1998
at 2.88.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a lot of good hitters,'' Daal said. ``If you miss
a pitch, you're going to be in trouble. Hopefully, I can keep the
game close.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves lost first baseman Andres Galarraga for the season as
he battles cancer, but they still have plenty of firepower with
third baseman Chipper Jones, outfielder Brian Jordan, catcher Javy
Lopez and Ryan Klesko, who has moved from the outfield to fill in
for Galarraga at first.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the pitching. Left-hander Odalis Perez pitches
against Daal tonight, with left-hander Tom Glavine, the 1998 Cy
Young Award winner, waiting to pitch Saturday and right-hander Greg
Maddux on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their starting pitching is what makes them successful, without
question,'' second baseman Jay Bell said. ``It's tough to score
runs on them. You have to have your total concentration in every
at-bat. Our starters are capable of being like that. The key is
jumping on those guys early. If you do that, you've got a chance.
They seem to get better as the game goes along.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks hit eight home runs against the Dodgers but did
little else. They'll need to raise their .214 average to have a
chance. The bottom part of the order needs to pick up the pace.
Shortstop Tony Batista is hitless in 12 trips, and catcher Kelly
Stinnett is just 1 for 9.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Buck Showalter said the Braves' staff ``makes you earn
everything you get. They don't walk many, and it's tough to string
three or four hits together against them.''
</P>
<P>
   The most underpublicized part of Atlanta's game is its defense,
according to Showalter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the best in baseball, if not the best,'' he said.
``(Walt) Weiss at shortstop and (Bret) Boone at second _ you're not
going to find many better there. And (Otis) Nixon, (Andruw) Jones
and Jordan in the outfield _ they can really run it down. They
don't really have any weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter hopes people say that about the Diamondbacks one day.
He also hopes he'll still be the manager when they say it. &QL;

EXPOS DEFEAT METS, 5-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The New York Mets are now 0 for 2 in other teams'
home openers. And Orel Hershiser is 0-1 as a member of the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   In his first regular-season start since signing with the Mets
during spring training, Hershiser lasted only four innings in a 5-1
loss to the young Montreal Expos. It was hard to tell what cost the
Mets more: Hershiser's inconsistency on the mound, or the Mets'
uncharacteristic poor defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he pitched as well as he can,'' Manager Bobby
Valentine said of Hershiser, the Mets' fourth starter. ``And I know
we didn't play behind him as well as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser's inauspicious four-inning debut as a Met came against
a festive, if concerned, backdrop. Thursday night was the Expos'
31st home opener. And there are chances that it could be their last
here before the franchise moves to either northern Virginia or
Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   But if Major League baseball was looking for signs that Montreal
wants to keep the team, there were plenty to go around at Olympic
Stadium, which was nearly full. A cluster of fans carried around a
five-placard message reading ``Hey, Bud, Read Our Lips: Claude Must
Go!'' a plea to baseball commissioner Bud Selig that was referring
to Claude Brochu, the unpopular team president and general partner
of the Expos and the person cited by many as trying to run the team
out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the signs here, it brought the biggest cheers. And the
near-capacity crowd of 43,918 _ the team's biggest in nearly three
years _ cheered loud and often, especially once the game began
because Hershiser started shakily and never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old right-hander had not allowed a run in seven
official spring innings with the Mets and five more in a minor
league spring game. But Vladimir Guerrero singled home Orlando
Cabrera from second with two out in the first inning for the game's
first run.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Fullmer followed Guerrero's single with a liner to right
that went for a triple after it skipped past Bobby Bonilla.
Guerrero scored.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser did not help matters much with his base running. After
the Montreal right-hander Miguel Batista walked both Hershiser and
Rickey Henderson to open the third, he nearly picked Hershiser off.
And after Edgardo Alfonzo squared to bunt on Batista's next pitch,
catcher Chris Widger picked Hershiser off.
</P>
<P>
   Two pitches later, Widger fired a perfect strike to nail
Henderson as he attempted to steal.
</P>
<P>
   But Batista allowed a solo homer to Alfonzo two pitches later,
and the Mets had sliced the deficit in half to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the third, Hershiser's defense failed him
again. This time, it was the Mets' two-time Gold Glove winner,
shortstop Rey Ordonez, who threw away a Rondell White grounder for
a two-base error. Guerrero followed by looping a soft liner over
Alfonzo at second for his second run-scoring single of the game.
</P>
<P>
   And then Fullmer launched a ball to deep center. After a long
run, Brian McRae caught up with the ball and leaped for it before
the wall. But the ball glanced off McRae's glove for a double, as
Guerrero advanced to third. Two pitches later, Shane Andrews rifled
a two-run single up the middle. And it was 5-1 Montreal.

ERSTAD ACCEPTS WHAT FATE DEALS
</HEADLINE>

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Mo Vaughn's trip to the disabled list gives the Angels
nine who are out with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the healthy Angels? While some admit that they
can't forget who's not on the field, others _ like Darin Erstad _
refuse to worry about what's out of their control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a firm believer, and my dad always pounded this into my
head, that things happen for a reason one way or another,'' Erstad
said. ``With that approach, you don't have to worry about anything
else other than what you do once you step on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Injuries happen, and with our team they happen a lot. But one
of these years we're going to get rewarded for our hard work. It
will pay off for us some time. I believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   The other Angels on the DL are pitchers Jason Dickson, Pep
Harris, Mike James and Jack McDowell, infielders Justin Baughman
and Gary DiSarcina and outfielders Jim Edmonds and Reggie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad has been on the DL as well in his career, but it has
happened near the end of the season when it seemed his body wore
down. He went into spring training this year with a slightly
different approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it easy the first couple of weeks of spring training,''
he said. ``Just got my feet under me a little bit. I'm eager for
the challenge of a full season. There's something to be said for
playing a full season. You can walk away saying you gave it your
all, and accept the results.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels will call up first baseman Chris Pritchett from
Triple-A to replace Vaughn on the roster. Pritchett was the final
cut from the roster after a solid spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Relievers need relief: Tim Belcher and Ken Hill each lasted only
41/3 innings in the Angels' first two games, putting an unwanted
burden on the bullpen at such an early point in the season. But
that's exactly why Collins and his coaching staff decided to begin
the season with 12 pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sitting here wondering if we've got enough even now,''
Collins said. ``We're going to be as cautious as we can early in
the year. Twelve pitchers gives us the opportunity to be
cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   Upcoming: The Angels begin a four-game series in Texas tonight
against the Texas Rangers. Pitching matchups for the series:
Tonight (5:35 p.m.), Chuck Finley vs. John Burkett; Saturday (5:35
p.m.), Omar Olivares vs. Rick Helling; Sunday (5:05 p.m.), Tim
Belcher vs. Aaron Sele; Monday (11:35 a.m.), Ken Hill vs. Mark
Clark.

<P>
   How is the war in Kosovo going to end? After little more than
two weeks of western air attacks, it may seem premature to be
asking such a question.
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly not prompted by Slobodan Milosevic's guileful
offer of a temporary cease-fire, nor even by the belief that NATO's
bombing campaign may at last be causing some discomfort to his
malign regime.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the West has never sought the outright defeat of Milosevic,
still less the outright victory of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
Rather it has sought an end to the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo's
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   In this, so far at least, it has failed: about 1.1 million of
the province's 1.8 million people have by now been driven from
their homes, and in the past fortnight alone over 360,000 have fled
the country.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate plight of these wretched refugees is,
understandably and rightly, a pressing concern for western
governments, as well as for the aid agencies trying to give them
succour.
</P>
<P>
   Should they be kept in the Balkans, as close to home as
possible? (Yes, if possible.) Or simply taken to a place of safety,
perhaps far away? (Yes, if necessary.)
</P>
<P>
   The refugees seem, however, to have come as a complete surprise
to the West. Indeed, it seems to have been as unprepared in its
humanitarian planning as it was in the military preparation of
Operation Allied Force, whose unfortunate acronym is OAF.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand military officers have been explaining that
sortie after sortie of bombers has come to nothing because of low
cloud cover; that even when the cloud has dispersed so too has the
enemy; and that meanwhile cruise-missile supplies have run low.
</P>
<P>
   On the other, government ministers have been at sixes and sevens
over the refugees. Little practical provision was made for this
huge movement of people. Little political preparation was made to
ensure that a vast influx of ethnic Albanians did not upset the
unstable equilibrium of the neighbors, in particular of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The humanitarian arguments for insisting that the refugees
should go home are powerful. After so much killing, rape and
destruction, it would be an outrage if the Serbs were to add to the
misery of the Kosovars by permanently depriving them of their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   But such outrages have happened before _ in Bosnia, Rwanda, the
Soviet Union, Palestine and all too many other places, and the
ethnic cleansers have got away with their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, after all, it may be better that people live apart,
if the alternative is living together at each other's throats.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if such a separation is to happen in Kosovo, it must not be
at the ethnic Albanians' expense. The geopolitical dangers, as well
as the human costs, are far too great.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia, with a Slav-dominated government and an
ethnic-Albanian minority making up a quarter to a third of the
population, is just one country in the neighborhood waiting to
disintegrate. Were it to do so, Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey would
not feel able to stand idly by.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro, the tiny republic which with Serbia is all that
remains of Yugoslavia, is also teetering. Its pro-western
government has been strained to the limit by NATO's bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Albania itself may soon become a target for Serbian attack now
that it is to play host to NATO's ``deep strike'' forces _ Apache
helicopters, multiple-launch rocket systems and army tactical
missile systems.
</P>
<P>
   Long the most insular country in Europe, it is also the poorest
and one of the most politically turbulent. A permanent population
of exiled Kosovars would alter the country's political balance. It
would also ensure that Albania became a base for guerrilla or
terrorist operations.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this a jerry-built Bosnia, just about held together by
the West, and the scene is set for a potential collapse of
terrifying proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Terrifying, that is, to all but Milosevic. Out of the general
wreckage of the Balkans, he would certainly expect to build a
greater Serbia, cleansed of Muslims and of most other ethnic
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   It is essential that he should be thwarted in this ambition and
disabused of any idea he may have that the West would tolerate it.
</P>
<P>
   But it has to be admitted that so far too many events have been
going his way. That is why NATO's campaign must continue _ and on
NATO's terms.
</P>
<P>
   The West says it will go on until Serbia's troops are out of
Kosovo and the refugees can return home, there to run their own
affairs, protected by a NATO force. That, however, is what was on
offer, and what was rejected, at the talks in Rambouillet before
the war began.
</P>
<P>
   So what will make Milosevic change his mind? Or, if you like,
how is the war going to end?
</P>
<P>
   The hope must be that NATO will still be able to inflict enough
damage from the air to make Milosevic yield. The likelihood,
however, is still that it won't.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the West is ready to use ground troops, and accept
casualties, it may have to settle for a partial victory, which is a
way of saying a partial defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Call it what you will, it will mean concessions, maybe over the
unimportant matter of what the eventual Kosovo force is called
(NATO-led or something else), maybe over the more important matter
of how much of Kosovo is handed over to autonomous rule by the
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   It should be the entire province, with special provision for
access by the Serbs to their holy places. But it may have to be
less.
</P>
<P>
   That will be the price of going to war without the will to do
the job properly. It will be a high price, but an acceptable one _
so long as a wider Balkan breakup is averted.
</P>
<P>
   This time, in any event, the West needs to think its strategy
through. &QL;

CALM DOWN, D-BACKS ARE OK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - The hottest topic in the Valley these days centers
around the Diamondbacks and their failures while starting the
season 0-3.
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable considering where the Diamondbacks are
coming from, which is basically the trash heap when you remember
their only season resulted in 97 losses.
</P>
<P>
   But these are not the Brent Brede and Efrain Valdez
Diamondbacks. They're not even remotely close to resembling last
year's expansion group.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last season, this is not a bottom-feeding club. The
skeptics, however, are out en masse, ready to stick a dagger
through the Diamondbacks and pronounce them worse than last year's
club after just one series.
</P>
<P>
   C'mon, folks. Lighten up. The 1999 Arizona Diamondbacks will be
fine soon enough. Within weeks, those same doubters won't be
rushing to jump back on the bandwagon. They'll be driving it,
telling everyone how they never wavered.
</P>
<P>
   They're probably the same people who routinely crucified the
Cardinals only to turn into the biggest Cardinal honks in the
Valley during the playoff run last season.
</P>
<P>
   It's unquestioned that the 1999 Diamondbacks have holes that
cannot be hidden. Shortstop Tony Batista has not looked good at the
plate and his range in the field is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen has been shaky and the duo behind the plate of Kelly
Stinnett and Damian Miller has not done much to stand out, either
at the plate or with their calling of games. Stinnett has
particularly struggled, catching for 15 of the 17 runs Arizona has
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   There are definite flaws. However, they are nowhere near the
defects the inaugural version had on its roster. This is a club,
like so many other good ones in the National League, with
weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look around the NL and Mordecai ``Three Fingers'' Brown
would have trouble coming up with his own handful of sound clubs.
The Atlanta Braves jump to mind, as do the Houston Astros and Los
Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   But each of those clubs is applying a Band-Aid or two to its
roster. The days of the rock-solid ballclub with no glaring
weaknesses are long gone everywhere outside the south Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians, generally considered the second-best club
in all of baseball, has a pitching staff that has a huge question
mark looming over it. It's the single-biggest reason Indians
General Manager John Hart calls Philadelphia GM Ed Wade several
times a week, wanting to know if Curt Schilling has become
available.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are missing Moises Alou, out for the season, have
health concerns with third baseman Ken Caminiti and are still
searching for a dependable everyday shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were dealt a big blow when first baseman Andres
Galarraga was diagnosed with cancer during spring training. But
even before then, the Braves had worries with their relievers, a
source of anxiety for years.
</P>
<P>
   All around, the very best clubs in the league have obvious
issues to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   Recall last season's three NL division champions _ San Diego,
Houston and Atlanta. What was the common denominator they all
shared and everyone else envied? Solid and dependable starting
pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was the Braves' and their star-studded rotation,
Houston's acquisition of Randy Johnson to go along with Shane
Reynolds and Mike Hampton or San Diego's big two of Kevin Brown and
Andy Ashby, the foundation for winning was based around the same
principle, starting pitching.
</P>
<P>
   It's why the New York Yankees rumbled through the season and the
playoffs virtually untouched. It was the reason Boston, with
comeback seasons from Bret Saberhagen and Tim Wakefield to
compliment All-Star Pedro Martinez, made a surprising return to the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what, it always comes down to pitching in the major
leagues. It's why Brown and Johnson were ``the'' most sought-after
free agents on the market last winter.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' long-term plans are definitely open for
criticism, but loading up on starting pitching will pay its
dividends this season.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the baseball season is still a 162-game marathon, not
a one-week sprint. &QL;

ROUGH BUT NOT ALL TOUGH: NEW AUGUSTA FAILS TO MASTER FIELD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ An off-season facelift at Augusta National Golf
Club produced a fresh collection of front-runners in Thursday's
opening round of the Masters Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But it failed to produce the rash of higher scores that course
officials envisioned when they significantly redesigned four holes
after the 1998 tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when play was suspended because of darkness with 12
golfers remaining on the course, the average score of first-round
competitors in this year's tournament was almost a stroke better,
at 74.5, than first-round scores in 1998 (75.4).
</P>
<P>
   Just don't count on that becoming a weeklong trend, said Davis
Love III, one of three players to finish at 3-under-par 69 and take
a share of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes, they look very good, and I think they make the
course play a little harder. We'll probably see that borne out over
time,'' said Love, who joins Scott McCarron and Brandel Chamblee
atop the leader board.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price, who must return at 8 a.m. Friday to play the final
hole of his opening round, also is at 3-under. That means none of
the top four players on the leader board has ever wrapped himself
in a Masters green jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Two have come close: Love, a runner-up in 1995, and Price, who
set the Augusta course record with a 63 in the 1986 tournament.
Chamblee and McCarron, on the other hand, sit atop an Augusta
leader board for the first time in their PGA Tour careers.
</P>
<P>
   For Chamblee, a Masters rookie who played college golf at the
University of Texas, this qualifies as an unexpected pleasure. A
former cutting horse competitor, Chamblee compared the excitement
of being in the hunt at the Masters to the rush that comes from
getting a foot caught in the saddle while falling off a horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same sort of feeling,'' said Chamblee, 36, who calmed
his racing adrenaline with three birdies and an eagle, offset by
two bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   Price, who missed a chance to take the lead by misfiring on a
10-foot birdie putt at No. 17 in the dwindling twilight, could go
into the record books as the solo first-round leader if he birdies
No. 18 before starting Friday's second round. Other players under
par during partial rounds halted Thursday included David Duval
(1-under, 17 holes) and Stewart Cink (1-under, 15 holes).
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth resident Mark Brooks was at 2-over through 14 holes
when play was suspended after a 90-minute weather delay. Hank
Kuehne, the U.S. Amateur champion from SMU, shot 2-over and played
in the final group to complete its opening round.
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne suggested Masters officials may have added an
unadvertised twist in their attempt to make the course play more
difficult: wet landing areas for longer hitters. Kuehne, who
averaged 292 yards per drive, said he kept finding ``a lot of mud''
on his ball after splitting a fairway before the afternoon rain
delay, while playing partner Mark O'Meara (264-yard average) did
not.
</P>
<P>
   Support for Kuehne's theory may be found in the fact that Tiger
Woods, who averaged more than 322 yards per pop while winning the
1997 Masters, averaged 296 yards off the tee Thursday yet still led
the field in driving distance.
</P>
<P>
   Among Augusta's more tangible changes, which included major
revisions at Nos. 2, 11, 15 and 17, all four holes had a higher
difficulty rating Thursday than during the 1998 tournament. Yet the
course, overall, played easier than during the opening round a year
ago despite several well-tucked pin placements.
</P>
<P>
   McCarron, like Love, attributed that to benign winds and said
scores likely will rise as the week progresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you're in the rough, it's a guessing game,''
McCarron said. ``That's only going to get worse as the greens get
tougher and the fairways get faster and firmer.''
</P>
<P>
   For a day, at least, the touring pros made Augusta's off-season
course changes seem minimal rather than revolutionary. Whether that
continues until Sunday remains to be seen. nn

   Sanctions are a famously blunt instrument, liable to give
anybody but their intended target a bloody nose.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations sanctions imposed on Libya in 1992 are
something of an exception: they had a precise aim, they severely
inconvenienced Libya's top people without doing anything lethal to
ordinary citizens and, in the end, they got their men.
</P>
<P>
   Forget, for the moment, that the men _ Abdel Basset al-Megrahi
and Al-Amin Khalifa Fhimah, the two Libyans charged with planting
the bomb in the Pan Am airliner that blew up over Lockerbie,
Scotland, in December 1988, killing 270 people_are probably small
cogs in a scary wheel and that it took a long time and considerable
compromise to get them to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks at least partly to economic pressure from well-aimed
measures, the laborious process of publicly investigating a vile
terrorist incident is now under way.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions, suspended as arranged after the two men arrived
on April 5 in Camp Zeist, the temporary bit of Scotland in the
Netherlands where they will eventually be tried by three Scottish
judges, were a great nuisance to Libya and, in one way or another,
cost it a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   But, unlike the sanctions on Iraq, they did no direct harm to
ordinary Libyans. They banned all flights to or from Libya (though
some African countries have recently been breaking that embargo);
they forbade the sale of spare parts for oil refineries; and they
froze some of Libya's assets abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In three months' time, after Kofi Annan, the United Nations
secretary-general, has reported on the completeness of Libya's
disavowal of terrorism, the Security Council may lift the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Even if America were to oppose that, as its secretary of state,
Madeleine Albright, has hinted it may, it would find it hard to
persuade its fellow council members to vote to reimpose the
measures.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the families of the 189 Americans who died over
Lockerbie wonders, reasonably enough, about the point of trying the
hit men while the godfather walks free. (By contrast, the British
families, who tend just to want to get on with the trial and a
public inquiry, were instrumental in persuading Robin Cook,
Britain's foreign secretary, to accept the compromise.)
</P>
<P>
   The two suspects, who worked for Libyan Arab Airlines, are
charged with murder and conspiracy to murder, acting on behalf of
Libya's Intelligence Services _ all of which they deny.
</P>
<P>
   But the suspicion is that Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi would
not have agreed to the trial unless he had received assurances that
the process would be unlikely to burrow its way to the very top of
those services.
</P>
<P>
   Annan denies that he has made any such promises, but the two
suspects will not be questioned by American or British security
officials and witnesses will not be called from Libya.
</P>
<P>
   What happens if, and it is a big if, the prosecution is able to
prove the suspects guilty and, more speculatively still, that the
line of guilt stretches up to Qaddafi himself?
</P>
<P>
   Libya's leader seems in recent years to have cut himself off
from his old terrorist proteges. Perhaps he finds that it is no
longer fun or profitable to try to run the world that way.
</P>
<P>
   He now seems pretty harmless, though many of his own people
would not agree. But are either America or Britain prepared to
accept him as a reformed member of the club of eminent
ex-terrorists? He will certainly be treated with the utmost
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, the conditions for suspending U.N. sanctions
have been fulfilled. America's unilateral sanctions against Libya,
banning most trade, will remain in place.
</P>
<P>
   They were first imposed in the 1980s, when Libya was accused of
sponsoring terrorism, then expanded in 1996 when Libya was added
almost as an afterthought to the secondary sanctions that set out
to penalize foreign firms that invest in Iranian or Libyan oil.
</P>
<P>
   Since they do not specify exactly what Libya (or Iran) has to do
to bring them to an end, these blunderbuss measures are the kind of
punishment that has given so many sanctions a bad name. It is time
to lift them too. &QL;

VALLEY LAWYER TAKES UP WNBA LABOR FIGHT  
 EX-CBA ADMINISTRATOR EAGER TO START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - As Pamela Wheeler sat in her 14th-floor downtown
Phoenix office last fall reading in the ``Sports Business Journal''
about WNBA player ratification of its union, her phone began to
ring. And ring. And ring.
</P>
<P>
   The callers all asked the same question: Did you see that story?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm reading the article,'' Wheeler said. ``I think it's
something for me as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Something perfect for a woman who at age 6, according to her
father, announced that she was going to be a sports attorney. After
growing to only 5 feet 4, impeding a basketball career, she
followed through on her childhood plan by earning degrees from
Dartmouth and Boston University Law School while interning in the
legal departments of the San Francisco Giants and Oakland
Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after an 18-month stint with the Continental Basketball
Association headquartered in the Valley and a weekend appearance as
a bridesmaid in her sister's wedding, Wheeler begins work Monday in
her native New York as operations director of the Women's National
Basketball Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   Although Billy Hunter, as NBPA executive director, is the chief
executive of the collective bargaining agency for NBA and WNBA
players, the 32-year-old Wheeler takes the point for the women at a
critical juncture.
</P>
<P>
   If an agreement between the union and league is not reached by
Saturday, WNBA President Val Ackerman said, the June 10 start of
the season could be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long ago when we started the bargaining, we made it clear to
the players we didn't have a lot of time,'' Ackerman said. ``We
have a lot of activities in April that are important to the
operation of the league, and we needed to do it in a certain way
with some lead time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all still true. Time is getting short. My hope is
people understand the urgency attached to making a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   For Wheeler, hired March 30 and on the fast track getting up to
speed on negotiations, the urgency is not Saturday's deadline,
which primarily puts only next week's pre-draft camp in jeopardy.
Her priority is to get the league to budge off its $20,000 minimum
salary offer for a four-month season.
</P>
<P>
   The players, who except for a few with personal services
contracts earned $15,000 to $62,500 last year, twice have lowered
their minimum salary demand to $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler understands money.
</P>
<P>
   She shouts the word instead of ``cheese'' to bring a smile to
her face while being photographed. Like the players who opted for
the WNBA instead of the better-paying but now-defunct American
Basketball League, she gave up money by not taking the corporate
path of her law school classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have already been too many comparisons to the (NBA) men
that are just unwarranted,'' Wheeler said. ``The issues are just
diametrically apart, they're not even in the same ballpark. Because
of that, I don't think we're in a situation where we even want to
consider not starting the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women made a number of sacrifices initially, which is
proof they're willing to work with the league. They're not
interested in bankrupting the league. I use the example of
Microsoft. A number of people took jobs in Microsoft and they
didn't get outright salaries, they got stock options and they made
sacrifices to help build that company. Once that company became an
empire, they were greatly rewarded. Now the women just want an
opportunity to be modestly rewarded for their efforts in helping to
build women's basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   No one pretends the 12-team WNBA, with a per-game average
attendance of 10,869 last season, is an empire or even that pro
women's basketball in the United States is a lock with all players
in one league.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruce Levy, the agent for more than 30 WNBA players,
estimates the league made about $25 million more than projected for
the first two years because of success stories such as the Mercury.
Including playoff games, Phoenix has drawn more than 440,000
spectators (13,760 average) for 32 dates at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Because of being located in the Valley with the CBA, first as
assistant to former Commissioner Steve Patterson and for the past
year as director of business development, Wheeler has seen the
Mercury phenomenon up close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of my (CBA) responsibility was sponsorship and how do you
get people in arenas,'' she said. ``When I went to the Mercury
game, I thought, `Is this not a great marketing opportunity? How do
you get fans so involved?' It's almost like WWF. That was the part
that amazed me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of expecting not to see men there. But I saw a lot
of men with what I assumed to be their daughters, which I thought
was really interesting, too. I was like, `Wow, we're on to
something here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   CBA Commissioner Gary Hunter said the women's union hired
someone special in Wheeler, whose restaurateur father, Bobby,
taught her a jump shot in junior high and joined with her mother,
Virginia, a sergeant first class in the Army, in stressing
education and independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is mature beyond her age,'' Hunter said. ``She's a
strategic thinker and extremely personable. Those qualities are
going to carry her far. I'm very disappointed we're going to lose
her after only 18 months, but that's part of what we do, develop
new talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say she is the Billy Hunter of the WNBA. I say no,
Billy Hunter is the Pam Wheeler of the NBA.'' &QL;

TRANSFERS INTERESTED IN ASU  
 COLORADO PLAYERS LIKE TURNER THORNE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Two of the four sophomore women's basketball
players transferring from the University of Colorado have Arizona
State at the top of their wish list.
</P>
<P>
   Nikki Swagger, a 6-foot-3 forward, has virtually committed to
ASU, saying Thursday she is looking nowhere else. Melody Johnson, a
6-2 center, plans to visit ASU in two weeks and expects to make a
decision after that trip.
</P>
<P>
   Both must sit out a season, then will have two years of
eligibility remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The other Colorado transfers are Nikki Weddle, whose interest in
ASU probably will not be reciprocated because point guard is not a
need position, and forward Chaquita Dilworth, who is returning to
her native Texas to play for Stephen F. Austin, which this week
signed guard Rhonda Rajsich of Phoenix College.
</P>
<P>
   Seven players have left Colorado in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   ASU Coach Charli Turner Thorne cannot comment on the potential
transfers until paperwork certifying their scholarship release is
received.
</P>
<P>
   Both Swagger and Johnson were recruited out of Colorado Springs
high schools by Turner Thorne in her first season at ASU. They were
prep rivals: as juniors Johnson's Palmer High team upset Swagger's
undefeated, defending state champion Doherty.
</P>
<P>
   If ASU lands both posts, they will replace 6-4 Rachel Holt and
6-foot Kristine Sand, who have one year of eligiblity left, and
team with 6-3 Theresa Jantzen and 6-2 Leah Combs for their final
two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my experience, she (Turner Thorne) is a very honest, good
person,'' Johnson said. ``That's very important to me. I'm looking
more for a coach than a program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember her and what she is about. I see a connection with
her, and I think we'd have a good player-coach relationship. ASU is
my first choice. They say the grass is not always greener, but I'm
willing to give it a try.''
</P>
<P>
   Already with 46 career blocks, Johnson averaged 12.8 points and
4.4 rebounds off the bench in the Buffs' final eight games,
including 14 points in 14 minutes in a WNIT loss to Drake. She has
career averages of 7.9 points and 3.5 rebounds and 22 career
starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very, very comfortable in the low post,'' Johnson said.
``I'm not the tallest center, but I play bigger than I am, and I'm
deceivingly quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson played on a BCI summer team with ASU sophomore forward
Kellie McDanal of Conifer, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ASU, Texas A&AMP;M and Colorado were finalists out of high school
for Swagger, who also visited Kansas State and Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was thinking of a place to go, I thought back about my
initial picks and about my trip to Arizona and Coach Turner,''
Swagger said. ``I knew I liked it when I went there, that the
players were like a team. When I spoke with her (Wednesday), I got
the same feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Swagger played a small role with the 15-14 Buffs, averaging 5.7
minutes, 1.4 points and 2.1 rebounds in 21 games. As a freshman on
a 12-16 team, she averaged 5.0 points and 4.6 rebounds and made
nine starts.
</P>
<P>
   Transferring is ``a choice I made based on my happiness here,''
Swagger said. ``It was time to go somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU is coming off a 12-15 season, its most wins in six years,
and tied for sixth in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   The team returns four starters, including Jantzen who made the
Pac-10 All-Freshman team. But it loses starting small forward Leaf
Newman, a sophomore who is transferring. &QL;

<P>
   Economic models can be victims of fashion just as much as the
long-legged sort. The Swedish model, the German model, the Japanese
model, the East Asian model have all been much admired in the past;
now all are showing their age.
</P>
<P>
   Today it is the lean and flexible American economic model that
is deemed triumphant, as the United States enjoys rapid growth, low
unemployment and low inflation _ enough, it seems, to support ever
dizzier highs on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The American model has proved its superiority. But has it?
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom certainly holds that America's economy is
outpacing all its rivals. That is true for the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
   But measured over a decade, to adjust for the economic cycle,
America's GDP per head _ the best measure of prosperity _ has risen
by an annual average of only 1.6 percent, about the same as Japan
and Germany (after stripping out the impact of unification).
</P>
<P>
   On other measures, America's ten-year performance is more
disappointing still.
</P>
<P>
   Perceptions about relative performance are hugely distorted by
cyclical factors. In the late 1980s many Americans, terrified of
being overtaken by Japan, urged that aspects of the Japanese model
be adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Today America is close to the peak of its cycle; Japan, in
contrast, is mired in recession, and Germany is slipping towards
one. When America next meets recession, its model too may quickly
lose its glamour.
</P>
<P>
   One lesson is that getting monetary and fiscal policies right
may be even more important than picking the best economic model. No
model in the world can prevent a financial bubble if monetary
policy is too lax, or a recession if it is too tight.
</P>
<P>
   Recent declines in output in both Japan and Germany are largely
due to inadequate demand caused by overly tight monetary policy,
and not to supply-side constraints imposed by the failings of their
models.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a puzzle, it is actually over why America's more
flexible economy has not delivered even faster growth, for even
longer.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation may be that economies have more in common than
apparent differences in models might suggest.
</P>
<P>
   America, Japan and Germany are all relatively open to foreign
trade, have modern infrastructure and enjoy the rule of law _ some
of the crucial ingredients for growth. And the models' differences
are themselves often exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Interventionists once attributed Japan's success to industrial
policy and to close relations between groups of firms and banks.
Yet Japan's success was greatest among its exporting giants, who
were in the least controlled parts of the economy and the most
exposed to foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation, however, is that the American model is
itself far from perfect.
</P>
<P>
   America may boast highly efficient labor and capital markets,
but these advantages are partly offset by poor primary and
secondary education, run-down public infrastructure, and inadequate
saving that makes the country dependent on foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's better-educated work force partly compensates for its
arthritic labor market. Japan's higher saving and investment has
helped to make up for its relatively low return on capital.
</P>
<P>
   One point remains undeniable: America has a far superior record
in creating jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe high taxes, high minimum wages, restrictions on
working hours and product-market regulations deter firms from
hiring workers. But they may be less of a barrier to overall
growth, because firms respond to higher labor costs by boosting
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk about America's productivity miracle, Germany's
productivity growth has actually been more than twice as fast as
America's over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that America should now junk its model.
Rather, the point is that while elements of the model may well be
important, they are not the whole story.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s and 1970s, America may well already have had a
superior model, on paper, to those in Japan and Germany _ more
flexible, innovative and so on. But other factors swamped that
advantage: poor macroeconomic policy made it more inflation-prone
and hindered investment planning; and Japan and Germany could
anyway grow more easily by importing technology during their long
catch-up phases.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with fast-changing information technology putting a premium
on innovation, America's flexible model may be coming into its own.
But, again, that is not the end of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Success tends to breed complacency and excesses, seen in today's
loose monetary policy and stock market bubble. If that bursts,
America's model may easily turn out to be tomorrow's has-been,
especially if, in the longer term, it does not correct its poor
education and low saving.
</P>
<P>
   After all, if Germany and Japan can grow as fast as America even
when their incentives are blunted by an inflexible model, imagine
what they might do were their economies to be set free. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Chicago has a reputation for making big plans.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 19th century, when sewage dumped into the
Chicago River was fouling Lake Michigan, the city elders decided on
a radical solution: they would reverse the course of the river so
that the city's refuse would flow away from the lake and down the
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 20th century, the city's business leaders have
tackled a more contemporary urban problem: sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   The Commercial Club of Chicago, in association with the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences, has released a report called
``Chicago Metropolis 2020,'' which seeks to deal with the haphazard
flight of people and jobs from the central city.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Chicago accounted for 48 percent of the region's
population and nearly 60 percent of its jobs; two decades later,
the city contained only 38 percent of the population and 37 percent
of the jobs.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bruce Katz, Director of the Center on Urban and
Metropolitan Policy at the Brookings Institution, the region is
growing in ways that are not sustainable.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders insist that poorly planned development is a
threat to both the economic vitality of the region and its quality
of life.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago is hardly alone. Around the country, the escalating pace
of decentralization has raised concern among disparate groups.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists are worried about disappearing green space;
advocates for the poor are worried about concentrated poverty;
firms are worried that potential workers are not where the jobs
are, and everyone is tired of sitting in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smart-growth'' movements have popped up from New Jersey to
Oregon, and sprawl has even crept on to the national agenda. Al
Gore, the vice-president, has been speaking about ``livability''
for months.
</P>
<P>
   But Chicago has taken a particularly comprehensive look at the
problem. ``This is one of the most ambitious reports I've ever
read,'' says Katz.
</P>
<P>
   So why all the sprawl? ``Metropolis 2020'' points first to
America's highly subsidized love affair with the car.
</P>
<P>
   The report estimates that commuters driving to work in
metropolitan areas pay only about 25 percent of the true cost of
their transport; the balance is borne by the public in the form of
pollution, congestion, wear and tear on infrastructure, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois is worse than many states: the state raises $271 per
vehicle in taxes and registration fees, compared with a national
average of $377.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago region has the second-largest number of workers (11
percent) in the country who commute at least 60 minutes to work
each way. It is little wonder that Chicagoans are stuck in traffic;
between 1985 and 1995, the number of vehicle-miles travelled
increased by 40 percent while the number of lane-miles increased
only 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Local communities make a bad situation worse by using planning
laws, such as minimum plot size, to exclude low-income families.
(Many ritzy suburbs will not allow a property to have a second
kitchen for fear that the owner might take in tenants.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many of the same communities compete to attract
high-value commercial developments. The result is scattered,
low-density development that keeps affordable housing out,
increases the cost of infrastructure, separates inner-city
residents from new jobs in the suburbs, and makes public transport
less efficient.
</P>
<P>
   It also means greater racial and economic segregation.
``Metropolis 2020'' points out that four out of five poor whites in
the region live in mixed-income areas compared with only one in
five poor blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1979 and 1989, the average income per head of the three
richest suburbs, as a multiple of that of the three poorest Chicago
neighborhoods, increased from eight to 15.
</P>
<P>
   And because Illinois is dependent, like many states, on local
property taxes to pay for its schools, wealthy districts spend
nearly four times as much per student as the poorest districts.
</P>
<P>
   Any hope of regional cooperation is drowned in a staggering
array of local-government entities. The Chicago area has 1,300
units of local government, including six counties, 113 townships,
270 municipalities, 306 school districts and 558 special districts
that do everything from treating waste water to fighting
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   That amounts to one unit of government for every 6,000 people _
five times the ratio in greater Los Angeles and seven times the
ratio in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The solutions proposed in ``Metropolis 2020'' follow naturally
from the problems it identifies.
</P>
<P>
   Vehicle taxes and fees should be priced to reflect more
accurately the costs of driving; the region should invest heavily
in public transport, especially from suburb to suburb and from city
to suburb; the state should guarantee every school a minimum level
of funding that reflects the cost of delivering a decent education.
</P>
<P>
   The report also proposes giving students more choice in where
they go to school and shifting the tax burden away from property
taxes, perhaps by broadening the state sales tax to include
services.
</P>
<P>
   Several recommendations are more radical. The report calls for a
state-wide building code that would supersede local planning laws.
</P>
<P>
   It also suggests a Regional Coordinating Council (RCC) made up
of representatives of local governments. The RCC would not be a
regional government; rather, it would support regional projects by
using its authority to issue bonds.
</P>
<P>
   What will come of the Chicago report? Probably quite a lot.
</P>
<P>

around the school system,'' notes one participant in the process.

created an infrastructure task force to study the state's needs.
</P>
<P>
   A Commercial Club committee led by the former president of
Inland Steel has already raised $4 million to help promote and
implement the goals of the plan.

and left an enormous positive imprint on modern Chicago.

financed the publication of a primer that summarized the details of
the plan, and over 100,000 copies were distributed to Chicago
schoolchildren so that they would understand the importance of
urban planning. (Study question 36: ``What is the effect on the

<TEXT>
<P>
   Chicago has a reputation for making big plans.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 19th century, when sewage dumped into the
Chicago River was fouling Lake Michigan, the city elders decided on
a radical solution: they would reverse the course of the river so
that the city's refuse would flow away from the lake and down the
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 20th century, the city's business leaders have
tackled a more contemporary urban problem: sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   The Commercial Club of Chicago, in association with the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences, has released a report called
``Chicago Metropolis 2020,'' which seeks to deal with the haphazard
flight of people and jobs from the central city.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Chicago accounted for 48 percent of the region's
population and nearly 60 percent of its jobs; two decades later,
the city contained only 38 percent of the population and 37 percent
of the jobs.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bruce Katz, Director of the Center on Urban and
Metropolitan Policy at the Brookings Institution, the region is
growing in ways that are not sustainable.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders insist that poorly planned development is a
threat to both the economic vitality of the region and its quality
of life.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago is hardly alone. Around the country, the escalating pace
of decentralization has raised concern among disparate groups.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists are worried about disappearing green space;
advocates for the poor are worried about concentrated poverty;
firms are worried that potential workers are not where the jobs
are, and everyone is tired of sitting in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smart-growth'' movements have popped up from New Jersey to
Oregon, and sprawl has even crept on to the national agenda. Al
Gore, the vice-president, has been speaking about ``livability''
for months.
</P>
<P>
   But Chicago has taken a particularly comprehensive look at the
problem. ``This is one of the most ambitious reports I've ever
read,'' says Katz.
</P>
<P>
   So why all the sprawl? ``Metropolis 2020'' points first to
America's highly subsidized love affair with the car.
</P>
<P>
   The report estimates that commuters driving to work in
metropolitan areas pay only about 25 percent of the true cost of
their transport; the balance is borne by the public in the form of
pollution, congestion, wear and tear on infrastructure, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois is worse than many states: the state raises $271 per
vehicle in taxes and registration fees, compared with a national
average of $377.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago region has the second-largest number of workers (11
percent) in the country who commute at least 60 minutes to work
each way. It is little wonder that Chicagoans are stuck in traffic;
between 1985 and 1995, the number of vehicle-miles travelled
increased by 40 percent while the number of lane-miles increased
only 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Local communities make a bad situation worse by using planning
laws, such as minimum plot size, to exclude low-income families.
(Many ritzy suburbs will not allow a property to have a second
kitchen for fear that the owner might take in tenants.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many of the same communities compete to attract
high-value commercial developments. The result is scattered,
low-density development that keeps affordable housing out,
increases the cost of infrastructure, separates inner-city
residents from new jobs in the suburbs, and makes public transport
less efficient.
</P>
<P>
   It also means greater racial and economic segregation.
``Metropolis 2020'' points out that four out of five poor whites in
the region live in mixed-income areas compared with only one in
five poor blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1979 and 1989, the average income per head of the three
richest suburbs, as a multiple of that of the three poorest Chicago
neighborhoods, increased from eight to 15.
</P>
<P>
   And because Illinois is dependent, like many states, on local
property taxes to pay for its schools, wealthy districts spend
nearly four times as much per student as the poorest districts.
</P>
<P>
   Any hope of regional cooperation is drowned in a staggering
array of local-government entities. The Chicago area has 1,300
units of local government, including six counties, 113 townships,
270 municipalities, 306 school districts and 558 special districts
that do everything from treating waste water to fighting
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   That amounts to one unit of government for every 6,000 people _
five times the ratio in greater Los Angeles and seven times the
ratio in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The solutions proposed in ``Metropolis 2020'' follow naturally
from the problems it identifies.
</P>
<P>
   Vehicle taxes and fees should be priced to reflect more
accurately the costs of driving; the region should invest heavily
in public transport, especially from suburb to suburb and from city
to suburb; the state should guarantee every school a minimum level
of funding that reflects the cost of delivering a decent education.
</P>
<P>
   The report also proposes giving students more choice in where
they go to school and shifting the tax burden away from property
taxes, perhaps by broadening the state sales tax to include
services.
</P>
<P>
   Several recommendations are more radical. The report calls for a
state-wide building code that would supersede local planning laws.
</P>
<P>
   It also suggests a Regional Coordinating Council (RCC) made up
of representatives of local governments. The RCC would not be a
regional government; rather, it would support regional projects by
using its authority to issue bonds.
</P>
<P>
   What will come of the Chicago report? Probably quite a lot.
</P>
<P>
   The Commercial Club is made up of Chicago's business elite. All
400 members of the club voted to endorse the spirit of the report,
if not its individual recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the guys who worked with (Mayor) Daley to turn

</P>
<P>

all its recommendations; meanwhile, the governor of Illinois has

   WASHINGTON _ ``It reminds the country,'' says Lamar Alexander,
the former Tennessee governor, ``that the question before the
primary voters is `Who's ready to be president?...Who do we trust
on Korea, China, the Middle East, Kosovo?'''
</P>
<P>
   Well put, since the war in Kosovo is just the sort of unforeseen
issue to test presidential candidates beyond their poll-tested
scripts.
</P>
<P>
   A single wrong word before the TV cameras can sabotage the
best-funded campaign _ but so too could a silence that the voters
recognize as a mite too studied.
</P>
<P>
   In the hard world of politics, the war in Kosovo is also part of
the war to be America's next president.
</P>
<P>
   And unfortunately for Alexander, a perennial runner for the
White House, in a crowded field of Republican hopefuls it is
Senator John McCain of Arizona who is so far picking up the
applause.
</P>
<P>
   As Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute puts it:
``The hands-down winner now is John McCain, in that he's been
forthright, honest and prepared to set out a policy _ he didn't
just start by ripping apart the president's policy.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough. Last month, when his Republican colleagues were
voting 38-16 against NATO air strikes on Serbia, McCain was arguing
that it would be irresponsible to undermine the president's
authority and, by extension, the credibility of both the United
States and NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Now he seems to be on every TV screen, arguing that the bombing
should have been much heavier (civilian casualties notwithstanding)
and that America's ground troops should be readied to do ``whatever
is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   When he says, ``You can't win a war if you're not going to wage
it,'' he cleverly highlights the poll-watching weakness of Bill
Clinton in forswearing the use of ground troops to make peace as
opposed to keeping it.
</P>
<P>
   He also catches the evolving mood of the American public,
increasingly moved by the evidence of ``ethnic cleansing'' in
Kosovo. But most of all McCain can advocate action because he is a
genuine war hero, imprisoned for more than five years by the
Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   In short, for Republican competitors to attack him is to risk
looking both spiteful and unpatriotic.
</P>
<P>
   So what should his rivals do? Ironically, the best answer is
probably to take a view that is the polar opposite.
</P>
<P>
   For all the internationalism of McCain and colleagues such as
Richard Lugar of Indiana, there has always been a strong vein of
isolationism running through the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   It is this vein that is tapped by New Hampshire's Senator Bob
Smith, who last year opposed NATO expansion and who now, in his
presidential bid, witheringly accuses Clinton of being ``in over
his head'' with a Balkan intervention that ``has no exit strategy
and no endgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Unhappily for Smith, however, his is the type of personality
that is televisually invisible. John Kasich, chairman of the House
Budget Committee, makes the same points better.
</P>
<P>
   But the best exponent of Republican isolationism is surely the
televisually expert Pat Buchanan. Long before the air strikes
began, Buchanan was arguing that America ``has no moral mandate
either for opposing the Albanian Kosovars' desire for independence
or waging war on Serbia for struggling to keep its historical
territory intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, ``no vital U.S. interest is at risk,'' and most
Americans (as Clinton has himself admitted) ``could probably not
even locate Kosovo on a map.''
</P>
<P>
   With McCain at one end of the spectrum and Buchanan at the
other, the risk for the rest of the Republican field is that of
appearing to be either intellectually uncertain or a fence-sitting
poll-watcher.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, long the front-runner for the nomination, was
derided by Buchanan for his initial silence on Kosovo _ until he
eventually declared that he could not second-guess the president
but did believe, not surprisingly, that ``we must have a clear
mission, an achievable goal and a credible exit strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, Bush's closest competitor, has been similarly
obvious, but can at least prosper by association with her husband,
Bob Dole, who is a longtime sympathizer with the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   As for the others _ Dan Quayle, for example, or Steve Forbes _
they are left muddling through: in favor of the air strikes, but
not of their preparation; against ground troops, more-or-less on
principle in Forbes's case and, in Quayle's case, because if
Clinton did use troops it would be ``halfhearted.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Alexander, a professed internationalist, argues
for more air strikes and more patience, and the massing of troops
in Macedonia and Albania to protect the refugees. But he then adds
that America should not ``slide into a ground war.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gary Bauer, on leave from the Family Research
Council, disapproves of the administration's Balkan strategy but,
in proposing a foreign policy that supports human rights and the
banning of abortion, is anxious not to be seen as a Buchanan-style
isolationist.
</P>
<P>
   All of which will doubtless look pretty muddled to the voters.
But is muddling-through such a bad thing? The Iowa caucuses are
still ten months away, and it is hard to see the Kosovo crisis
dominating the public mood for all that time.
</P>
<P>
   After all, America's war of aerial attrition against Iraq these
days barely merits a mention even within the Washington Beltway.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, what will matter most for the election campaign is
money. Bush already has plenty from his supporters (and from
friends of his father); so too, not least from his own pockets,
does Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, the war is a heaven-sent opportunity to raise his
profile and thus convince Republicans to give him money, despite
his annoying tendency to take positions contrary to the party line
on campaign finance and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that, whatever happens in Kosovo, it is too early
for any candidate to declare victory _ save perhaps on the
Democratic side, where Al Gore has plenty of money and his only
rival, Bill Bradley, probably not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, if the Kosovo crisis works out well, Gore will take
some of the credit; while, if it works out badly, the blame will be
heaped on either Clinton as commander-in-chief or Madeleine
Albright as secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   For the Republicans, the election issues will be the divisive
ones of old: protectionism and, more especially, abortion. Those
are domestic questions that are hard to keep ducking.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, dodging foreign-policy issues is easy and
electorally painless. For proof, just look back to 1992 when a
candidate was asked about the congressional vote authorizing
President George Bush to use troops against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I would have voted with the majority, if it was a
close vote _ but I agree with the arguments the minority made.''
Sitting on the fence was a certain Bill Clinton. &QL;

principle in Forbes's case and, in Quayle's case, because if
Clinton did use troops it would be ``halfhearted.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Alexander, a professed internationalist, argues
for more air strikes and more patience, and the massing of troops
in Macedonia and Albania to protect the refugees. But he then adds
that America should not ``slide into a ground war.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gary Bauer, on leave from the Family Research
Council, disapproves of the administration's Balkan strategy but,
in proposing a foreign policy that supports human rights and the
banning of abortion, is anxious not to be seen as a Buchanan-style
isolationist.
</P>
<P>
   All of which will doubtless look pretty muddled to the voters.
But is muddling-through such a bad thing? The Iowa caucuses are
still ten months away, and it is hard to see the Kosovo crisis
dominating the public mood for all that time.
</P>
<P>
   After all, America's war of aerial attrition against Iraq these
days barely merits a mention even within the Washington Beltway.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, what will matter most for the election campaign is
money. Bush already has plenty from his supporters (and from
friends of his father); so too, not least from his own pockets,
does Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, the war is a heaven-sent opportunity to raise his
profile and thus convince Republicans to give him money, despite
his annoying tendency to take positions contrary to the party line
on campaign finance and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that, whatever happens in Kosovo, it is too early
for any candidate to declare victory _ save perhaps on the
Democratic side, where Al Gore has plenty of money and his only
rival, Bill Bradley, probably not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, if the Kosovo crisis works out well, Gore will take
some of the credit; while, if it works out badly, the blame will be
heaped on either Clinton as commander-in-chief or Madeleine
Albright as secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   For the Republicans, the election issues will be the divisive
ones of old: protectionism and, more especially, abortion. Those
are domestic questions that are hard to keep ducking.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, dodging foreign-policy issues is easy and
electorally painless. For proof, just look back to 1992 when a
candidate was asked about the congressional vote authorizing
President George Bush to use troops against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I would have voted with the majority, if it was a
close vote _ but I agree with the arguments the minority made.''
Sitting on the fence was a certain Bill Clinton. &QL;

DEVILS SHUT OUT CAPITALS, 1-0 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The New Jersey Devils clinched their
third straight Atlantic Division title on Thursday night with a 1-0
victory over the Washington Capitals, becoming the first team to
take a third straight crown since the Philadelphia Flyers 12 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little celebrating in the Devils' dressing room
because they played far below the standard of an elite team for the
second game in a row. Although this was a victory, the Devils'
performance was poorer than in Tuesday's loss at Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Robbie Ftorek and several players said that clinching the
division title and having a chance to finish first in the Eastern
Conference was of less significance than performing well going into
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the scheme of things, when you take care of the little
things the big things take care of themselves,'' Ftorek said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rolston, who scored the game's only goal, said, ``It's
fine and good if you win the division and the conference, but the
Stanley Cup is the most important thing you want.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils failed to gain any ground in the Eastern Conference
as the Ottawa Senators defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs, 3-1,
tonight to maintain a 3-point lead as the top team. But the Devils
(43-23-11) have a game in hand on the Senators (44-22-12).
</P>
<P>
   For the Devils to have a chance to overtake the Senators for the
conference title, they will need the services of the injured Jason
Arnott, the center for Patrik Elias and Petr Sykora. They have been
the team's most productive line, especially in the last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott missed his second game in a row on Thursday night because
of a bruised right hip. His place in the loss to Carolina was taken
by Brendan Morrison, but on Thursday night Ftorek decided to put
Sykora at center and use Vadim Sharifijanov in Sykora's place at
right wing.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals, who were swept by Detroit in last season's Stanley
Cup finals, were eliminated from the playoffs a day earlier. They
played on Thursday night without eight regulars, most of them out
with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Capitals were short-handed, Rolston's goal was
all the Devils could accomplish offensively. The defense was much
better, however, limiting the Capitals to 15 shots against Martin
Brodeur, who earned his fourth shutout of the season and 36th of
his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense was great,'' said Brodeur, whose record is
36-10-10. ``It's good to see that the one goal held up.''
</P>
<P>
   Rolston's goal was the 20th of the season and marked the first
time that the 26-year-old wing has reached that plateau. But the
goal was also his first in 16 games. It came from close range on
the left after he collected a rebound from a shot by Sheldon Souray
and had plenty of time to beat Olaf Kolzic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't scored in a few games,'' Rolston said. ``That's why
this was a big one tonight. Winning the division is great, but we
want to play our best in the five games we have left.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The only white people visible at Black Entertainment Television
(BET) are maintenance men.
</P>
<P>
   The suits in the conference rooms are black and the executives
chatting in the corridors are black. The art on the walls is
African and the magazines and books laid out for visitors are by
and about blacks. Even the building is black.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Johnson, BET's chief executive, is making a point; but
there is more to this ethnocentrism than politics. American blacks
may be poorer than whites, but Johnson has discovered how to make
good money out of them.
</P>
<P>
   BET, the cable network that is still the most profitable bit of
his fast-expanding company, is a sort of MTV for blacks; its
programming, which consists mostly of music videos made by record
companies, costs next to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   For advertisers aiming at blacks, it is the only place to go.
</P>
<P>
   BET was launched in 1979 after Johnson borrowed a business plan
for a cable channel for the elderly, and substituted the word
``black'' throughout.
</P>
<P>
   He started the company with his sister, a tiny group of
colleagues, and $500,000 from John Malone of TCI, an American cable
giant. Malone has remained a friend, adviser, board member and
minority shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's sister has not: she and two of BET's other original
vice-presidents sued him when he took the company public in 1992,
saying that he had promised them shares. The case was settled out
of court.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson did not have good relations with Wall Street either.
After initial enthusiasm, analysts turned against the company. They
criticized it for investing too fast in too many new ventures;
Johnson retorts that ``there is a discount applied to the real
value of African-American businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Johnson took the company private again. He now has a
lot of debt, a very profitable cable-TV network, and the beginnings
of a media empire along the lines of Disney or Viacom.
</P>
<P>
   BET has three television channels, a magazine group, a
book-publishing company it bought last year, an Internet
joint-venture with Microsoft, called MSBET, a nightclub at Disney
World in Florida which opened last year, a chain of restaurants, a
clothing line and a range of makeup.
</P>
<P>
   This year Johnson is starting a film studio to create more
original content.
</P>
<P>
   When he took the company private, it was valued at just over $1
billion. By 2003, he says, it will be worth $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For his plan to work, however, Johnson needs to retain his
monopoly on black television advertising. Yet digital technology
could make Johnson vulnerable to competition.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest cable networks tend to be the most profitable,
because limited capacity on cable systems has made it hard for
newer networks to be distributed. Digital technology is now making
space for competitors.
</P>
<P>
   True, says Johnson, but BET can move swiftly into any new niche
that appears. Somebody wants to create a 24-hour gospel channel?
Too late: BET, using its powerful brand and its ability to
cross-promote, is already planning one.
</P>
<P>
   Small operators do not have such advantages, and building a big
competitor from scratch would be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   A white company could not tap into black sensibilities as BET
has; and, Johnson maintains, a black competitor would find it hard
to get access to the capital needed to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody would have to put all this wealth into the hands of a
black person. Who's going to do that?''
</P>
<P>
   Barriers to entry for blacks, in other words, are higher than
they are for whites.
</P>
<P>
   BET has other advantages too. As the firm shifts from relying on
music videos to creating more original programming, it will suffer
less from the cost inflation that has hit other film studios and
television networks.
</P>
<P>
   The main networks have seen their margins destroyed by rocketing
star salaries that have inflated the cost of programming. BET can
make films cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is spending $1 million for a movie that is going into
production this year, about a quarter of the cost of an HBO movie _
because there is so much black talent, and so little demand for it
in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   `Who's going to give a black woman a romantic lead?'' asks
Johnson. ``Because blacks are underutilized, many fine actors will
gravitate towards our productions.''
</P>
<P>
   The way audiences are changing, too, looks like good news for
BET. Broadcast television is losing its huge audiences; the mass is
breaking up into fragments; niche channels are winning. Part of
this trend is a growing divide between the viewing habits of blacks
and whites.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s and 1980s, programs such as ``The Jeffersons''
(with a multiracial cast) and ``The Cosby Show'' (with a largely
black cast) were hugely successful with audiences of all colors. By
contrast, none of the big recent successes, such as ``Seinfeld,''
``Friends'' and ``Frasier'' have black characters.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures from Nielsen Media Research, the top three
programs in white households last year came 15th, 91st and 93rd in
black households; the top three programs in black households were
118th, 124th and 7th _ that was Monday Night Football _ in white
households.
</P>
<P>
   ``White people don't want to watch black people realistically,''
says Johnson. ``They're happy with blacks as buffoons or
sidekicks.''
</P>
<P>
   From society's point of view, that is a terrible shame. For
business at BET, it is just fine. &QL;

criticized it for investing too fast in too many new ventures;
Johnson retorts that ``there is a discount applied to the real
value of African-American businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Johnson took the company private again. He now has a
lot of debt, a very profitable cable-TV network, and the beginnings
of a media empire along the lines of Disney or Viacom.
</P>
<P>
   BET has three television channels, a magazine group, a
book-publishing company it bought last year, an Internet
joint-venture with Microsoft, called MSBET, a nightclub at Disney
World in Florida which opened last year, a chain of restaurants, a
clothing line and a range of makeup.
</P>
<P>
   This year Johnson is starting a film studio to create more
original content.
</P>
<P>
   When he took the company private, it was valued at just over $1
billion. By 2003, he says, it will be worth $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For his plan to work, however, Johnson needs to retain his
monopoly on black television advertising. Yet digital technology
could make Johnson vulnerable to competition.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest cable networks tend to be the most profitable,
because limited capacity on cable systems has made it hard for
newer networks to be distributed. Digital technology is now making
space for competitors.
</P>
<P>
   True, says Johnson, but BET can move swiftly into any new niche
that appears. Somebody wants to create a 24-hour gospel channel?
Too late: BET, using its powerful brand and its ability to
cross-promote, is already planning one.
</P>
<P>
   Small operators do not have such advantages, and building a big
competitor from scratch would be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   A white company could not tap into black sensibilities as BET
has; and, Johnson maintains, a black competitor would find it hard
to get access to the capital needed to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody would have to put all this wealth into the hands of a
black person. Who's going to do that?''
</P>
<P>
   Barriers to entry for blacks, in other words, are higher than
they are for whites.
</P>
<P>
   BET has other advantages too. As the firm shifts from relying on
music videos to creating more original programming, it will suffer
less from the cost inflation that has hit other film studios and
television networks.
</P>
<P>
   The main networks have seen their margins destroyed by rocketing
star salaries that have inflated the cost of programming. BET can
make films cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is spending $1 million for a movie that is going into
production this year, about a quarter of the cost of an HBO movie _
because there is so much black talent, and so little demand for it
in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   `Who's going to give a black woman a romantic lead?'' asks
Johnson. ``Because blacks are underutilized, many fine actors will
gravitate towards our productions.''
</P>
<P>
   The way audiences are changing, too, looks like good news for
BET. Broadcast television is losing its huge audiences; the mass is
breaking up into fragments; niche channels are winning. Part of
this trend is a growing divide between the viewing habits of blacks
and whites.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s and 1980s, programs such as ``The Jeffersons''
(with a multiracial cast) and ``The Cosby Show'' (with a largely
black cast) were hugely successful with audiences of all colors. By
contrast, none of the big recent successes, such as ``Seinfeld,''
``Friends'' and ``Frasier'' have black characters.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures from Nielsen Media Research, the top three
programs in white households last year came 15th, 91st and 93rd in
black households; the top three programs in black households were
118th, 124th and 7th _ that was Monday Night Football _ in white
households.
</P>
<P>
   ``White people don't want to watch black people realistically,''
says Johnson. ``They're happy with blacks as buffoons or
sidekicks.''
</P>
<P>
   From society's point of view, that is a terrible shame. For
business at BET, it is just fine. &QL;

KINGS WIN 3-2 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS 
Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Vladimir Tsyplakov emerged Thursday night from the
hiding place he had inhabited for more than three months. He even
remembered to raise his arms after scoring, although it would have
been totally understandable if he'd forgotten to do so.
</P>
<P>
   After going without a goal since Dec. 26, a 29-game drought,
Tsyplakov scored twice as the Kings defeated the San Jose Sharks
3-2 before a crowd of 12,785 at the Forum. Donald Audette also
scored and Stephane Fiset stopped 32 of 34 shots by the Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   But in keeping with the tone of the season, the victory was not
without its price. No.1 center Jozef Stumpel in all likelihood
concluded his disappointing year when he left the game in the
second period with a sprained medial collateral ligament in his
right knee, courtesy of a takedown by Sharks defenseman Bryan
Marchment. Stumpel will be re-examined today.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings also announced that winger Sandy Moger will undergo
surgery Monday to repair a partially torn left rotator cuff, ending
his season.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Kings (29-43-5) are about to reel off five more
victories to complete the regular season, the win over San Jose
meant little. Playoff hopes all but died on the 1-4 trip the Kings
concluded Monday with a loss at Colorado. For the record, the
victory moved the Kings within six points of a playoff berth with
five games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks (30-31-17), who are seventh in the Western
Conference, needed to win the game to draw closer to St. Louis and
the Mighty Ducks in the race for fifth place but showed little of
the urgency one would have expected. San Jose might have been
looking ahead to tonight's game against the Ducks at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Tsyplakov opened the scoring 10:08 into the game when he found a
hole in the Sharks' defense and beat goalie Mike Vernon with a
15-foot backhander. Less than four minutes later, Donald Audette
scored on a breakaway. Tsyplakov, who had 18 goals last year but
has just 10 this season, scored again midway through the second
period off a setup by Rob Blake.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks made a bid to get back in the game in the third
period, Joe Murphy scoring on a power play after Blake took a
penalty for cross-checking Alexander Korolyuk, with whom he'd
battled all night. With 15 seconds to play and Vernon pulled for an
extra skater, Jeff Norton cut San Jose's final deficit to one.
</P>
<P>
   With playoff hopes faint, the Kings used the opportunity to take
a look at 23-year-old winger Jason Podollan, acquired at the
trading deadline on March 23 in the deal that sent Yanic Perreault
to Toronto. Podollan came close to scoring on his first shift with
the Kings, but his point-blank backhander was stopped by San Jose
goalie Mike Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was feeling pressure to produce because Perreault
had scored all four goals for Toronto the night before in a victory
over Ottawa, Podollan said, ``I hope it's not expected.... Five is
kind of out of the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Podollan has had an extremely productive season in the minors,
scoring an AHL-high 42 goals for the Leafs' affiliate in St.
John's, and five more in seven games with the Long Beach Ice Dogs
before being recalled by the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a real good thing,'' Podollan said of leaving the
Leafs' organization to join the Kings. ``It's real exciting for me.
Things weren't working the way I'd like it in Toronto. It's a fresh
opportunity, something I want to make good on. Anytime you get a
chance to come up and skate, it's obviously a little bit of a job
interview.''

   NEW ORLEANS _ A few feet away, street musicians play jazz
standards and tourists browse; but high culture reigns inside the
antique shops on Royal Street, in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   At Harris Antiques, classical music wafts through the air as
patrons navigate a maze of marble and wood.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from New York, Arthur Harris says, New Orleans has the
country's largest high-end antiques market, and the best of it is
packed into a few streets in the French Quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Street has a reputation to uphold. That is why Harris
didn't trust the men who came by his shop more than a year ago,
hawking wrought-iron chairs and cement pots from the back of a car.
</P>
<P>
   The goods looked badly weathered and strangely familiar, he
said. He told the men, ``This looks like cemetery stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   When one said the wares came from his grandmother's, Harris
wasn't convinced. ``She must have had a heck of a yard,'' he said,
and sent the men away.
</P>
<P>
   Police say that other antique dealers have been less careful. In
the past year, they have arrested seven people, including several
retailers, in connection with what they call a sweeping scheme to
rob New Orleans's cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``Cities of the Dead,'' the vast grey cemeteries are
among New Orleans's 31 main attractions; along with Victorian
houses and draping Spanish moss, they lend the city a Gothic air.
</P>
<P>
   Because the water table is too high for digging, the graveyards
were built above ground, rows of vaults and mausoleums modelled
after European tombs, set along wandering paths.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the crypts are still in use, the old bones pushed back
to make room for new generations. Many are adorned with statues and
iron crosses, the crumbling keepsakes of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the cemeteries' worst enemy was time: weather
battered the marble and iron, families moved away and left their
tombs in disrepair. But these days, fashion is just as serious a
foe.
</P>
<P>
   Yuppies decorate their gardens with crosses and angels, the
gloomier the better, and Gothic goods sail through boutiques in Los
Angeles and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Police say the supply has come largely from thieves. So far,
authorities have recovered at least $1 million in stolen loot.
</P>
<P>
   In upstate New York last month, they spotted a five-foot bronze
angel, perhaps the most valuable stolen piece yet, worth up to
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The thefts may have gone on, unnoticed, for years, says Louise
Fergusson, director of Save Our Cemeteries, a preservation group.
But eventually cemetery workers saw the telltale signs of crime:
suspicious vans roaming the grounds, whole aisles of angels
missing.
</P>
<P>
   Police went on the hunt and soon arrested three suburban men _
the same ones Harris remembers _ for lifting urns and prising
marble statues from their bases.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, police booked four wealthy city men, all dealers
and preservationists, who had cemetery items in their homes and
shops. Police believe these men used their knowledge of art to tell
the thieves precisely what to steal.
</P>
<P>
   One such dealer, Peter Patout, the scion of an old sugar family,
was found to have two cemetery statues, including a Madonna worth
$50,000, in the courtyard of his house on Bourbon Street.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since then, he has been trying to clear his name. He even
staged a press conference in a cemetery, a few feet away from his
ancestors' tomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Louisiana and its heritage and I'm a guardian of its
culture,'' he said, insisting that he bought some of the goods at
church sales and did not know that others were stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Other accused dealers offer similar accounts, and note that they
have yet to face formal charges. Patout, who runs his own Royal
Street shop, said the scandal has been overstated. Not every
decaying statue has come from a graveyard, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, police are continuing their probe, as officials try
to squelch the Gothic-chic market.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the city council passed a law requiring antique
dealers and auctioneers to notify police when possible cemetery
artefacts come their way. Fergusson says she will publicize the
scandal in decorating magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the city is trying to return stolen goods to their
rightful owners. Police have set up open houses to display
recovered loot. And Fergusson hopes that people who have purchased
graveyard goods will now see fit to give them up.
</P>
<P>
   At least one person has done so, she says: a local man who
bought two angels, not knowing they came from a cemetery plot. He
gave the statues back to their original owners, who returned them
to the tomb just in time to witness another family burial. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ The Force is about to be with us once more, this
time in the form of a brand new ``Star Wars'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace'' opens in the
United States on May 19, but already it feels as though it has been
with us for months. Hollywood loves a sure winner, and winners
don't come much surer than this one.
</P>
<P>
   The only real questions are whether the film will manage to earn
$100 million on its opening weekend, a feat never before achieved,
and whether its total gross receipts will hit the near-mythical
target of one billion _ that's right, folks, billion _ dollars.

   It is time to end the monkey business over the banana war.

<P>
   The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled on Tuesday that the
United States may impose $191 million worth of duties on goods from
the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
   While true that the behavior of the United States has certainly
been bullying, the Europeans now need to negotiate, not appeal.
</P>
<P>
   With more people fleeing from Kosovo and the number of deaths
increasing daily, the preoccupied western allies do not now need to
be wrangling over who is top banana. &QL;

the supply of desperately needed water to Jordan in a move likely

   Modern Europe _ that civilized territory _ watches wretched,
dirty and hopeless refugees fight for a loaf of bread even as eight
million dollars' worth of cruise missiles explode on nearby
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   NATO is indeed degrading the military resources of President
Slobodan Milosevic, but our failure adequately to support the
refugees degrades and demeans us all.
</P>
<P>
   One of the frightening euphemisms of modern warfare, brought
into vogue in the Gulf War, is ``collateral damage.'' The refugees
from Kosovo are the collateral damage of this NATO action, and we
must do whatever we can to support them. &QL;

   It is time to end the monkey business over the banana war.
</P>
<P>
   The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled on Tuesday that the
United States may impose $191 million worth of duties on goods from
the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
   While true that the behavior of the United States has certainly
been bullying, the Europeans now need to negotiate, not appeal.
</P>
<P>
   With more people fleeing from Kosovo and the number of deaths
increasing daily, the preoccupied western allies do not now need to
be wrangling over who is top banana. &QL;

   JERUSALEM _ The worst drought in 50 years has led Israel to cut
the supply of desperately needed water to Jordan in a move likely
to provoke a crisis in relations between the two countries.

the Israel/Palestine Center for Research and Information in
Jerusalem.

   Modern Europe _ that civilized territory _ watches wretched,

million dollars' worth of cruise missiles explode on nearby

   NATO is indeed degrading the military resources of President
Slobodan Milosevic, but our failure adequately to support the
refugees degrades and demeans us all.
</P>
<P>
   One of the frightening euphemisms of modern warfare, brought
into vogue in the Gulf War, is ``collateral damage.'' The refugees
from Kosovo are the collateral damage of this NATO action, and we

CLIPPERS BEAT MINNESOTA
</HEADLINE>

BY RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Clippers, who've stockpiled enough grief to
freeze a batch for later, began Thursday's work shift at the Sports
Arena by discovering a new predicament:
</P>
<P>
   An opponent scorned.
</P>
<P>
   Going in with a 3-30 record, they had yet to face down the
bitter feelings of revenge carried by a team they had beaten in
their last encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Going against them were the playoff-bound Minnesota
Timberwolves, who were beaten by the Clippers 18 days ago in
Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers suggested the previous result was no fluke by
beating the Timberwolves 99-91 in front of 7,205, ending their
losing streak at six.
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves (20-15), who were clobbered Wednesday by the
Phoenix Suns, had a dandy alibi _ point guard Terrell Brandon was
home with a bruised thigh. But if they had lost, the Clippers had a
better alibi _ the co-stars in those 30 defeats were all here.
</P>
<P>
   One crucial appearance was made by power forward Maurice Taylor,
who missed the two previous beatings thanks to bilateral Achilles
tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor scored 20 points and had eight rebounds (a personal
revelation) in a command performance against Minnesota's big and
jumpy front line.
</P>
<P>
   Contributing to the Clippers' bonanza was the cold marksmanship
of Kevin Garnett. The 7-foot Garnett, a four-year pro whose high
school-to-NBA learning curve was taken on two wheels, missed 16 of
21 field-goal attempts through three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Two Eric Piatkowski free throws gave the Clippers a 68-56 lead
going into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   When the Clippers reach that fork in the road to victory, they
usually pick it up and take turns stabbing it in their eyes. But
when Timberwolves coach Flip Saunders deployed the obligatory
trapping defense _ the same monster Phoenix used in rallying to
beat the Clippers on Tuesday _ the home team refused to yield.
</P>
<P>
   The trick, as prescribed by coach Chris Ford, was attacking the
defense rather than rolling over. Putting the bite in the Clippers
offense was forward Lamond Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Murray scored nine points in the final quarter, and veteran
playmaker Sherman Douglas _ who finished with a season-high 16
points _ was key against Minnesota's defensive pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Making his first return to the Sports Arena since the Clippers
waived him last month was James ``Hollywood'' Robinson, who just
signed his second 10-day contract with Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I wanna know,'' Robinson said before tipoff, ``was how I
can't get any minutes on a losing team, then go to a playoff team
and be in the rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-eight minutes later, Robinson and his new cronies, must
have been at a loss to explain it. &QL;

FORBES CAMPAIGN TO START TV ASSAULT THIS MONTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In another sign of what is becoming a prematurely overheated
campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, publishing
magnate Steve Forbes will launch his first nationwide ad campaign
later this month, a full nine months before the first primary
election.
</P>
<P>
   The media blitz will air most heavily in Arizona, New Hampshire
and Iowa, states with key early contests, according to a Forbes
campaign official.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes used television to stunning effect in 1996, running ads
that ultimately won him victories in two presidential primaries,
Arizona and Delaware, even though he had never run for elective
office. The self-financed Forbes campaign spent $4 million in
Arizona and $37 million nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like we're going to be bombarded with ads from now
through November (2000),'' said Larry Makinson, director of the
Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington, D.C.-based
organization that tracks campaign finance issues, when he learned
of the campaign. ``I'm beginning to feel what they are feeling in
Belgrade right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to former Vice President Dan Quayle downplayed Forbes'
ability to dump huge sums of his own money on an ad campaign,
saying Forbes is doing what everyone expected him to do: spend his
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will make one bit of difference,'' said Fred
Davis, Quayle's media advisor. ``When your greatest strength is
your deep pockets, you play to your greatest strength, and that's
the only one he has.''
</P>
<P>
   The appearance of ads paid for by a presidential campaign before
the end of April surprises even longtime campaign observers.
</P>
<P>
   The quick start will put increasing pressure on other candidates
to come out with their own ads, according to Makinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the kid in the class that wrecked the curve for
everyone else,'' he said. ``If one candidate is on the air, it's
going to be more and more difficult for other candidates to stay
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Makinson argued that a sustained television presence so early in
the campaign could shell-shock candidates like Quayle, former
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and former Family Research Council
President Gary Bauer, all of whom are ``out there making their
pitches as to why they are credible when someone else is already on
TV in May.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It undercuts their argument that they've got a chance,''
Makinson said. ``There are a lot of reasons that people give to
campaigns, but pragmatism is one of them. This year more than any
other, donors are going to separate the candidates with potential
from the lost causes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Quayle campaign's Davis predicted the Forbes ads will be the
only ones that viewers see for a while, not because other
candidates aren't interested in making their own, but because they
can't afford it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you look at the fund-raising reports?`` Davis asked,
referring to the first round of financial reports filed by
candidates with the Federal Election Commission on March 31. ``We
were the second-highest, and we were a third of (Texas Gov. George
W.) Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``There's no one right now who can step up to the
plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Makinson said the greatest impact of a Forbes media blitz could
fall on Bush, who reportedly is considering whether to opt out of
the federal campaign finance system entirely in order to be able to
match Forbes dollar for dollar in the primary. Candidates who
accept federal matching funds must abide by severe contribution
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Steve Forbes stands much chance of winning the
presidency,'' Makinson said, ``but it does give George W. Bush a
rationale for opting out, and I think it's something his staff
wants to do.``
</P>
<P>
   All candidates should think twice about filling the airwaves
with ads so soon, according to Makinson, noting they risk
alienating an already wary public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is a guaranteed good reception or bad
reception,`` he said. ``If these ads aren't good, they could
backfire. People just don't want to be reminded this soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes national co-chairwoman Dodie Londen said she was aware
that the candidate might launch the ad campaign, but she had no
details. Londen, a former chairwoman of the Arizona Republican
Party, defended the decision, saying Forbes must worry about
raising his name identification in states like Iowa and New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes may also have cause for concern in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he won the state's GOP primary in 1996, the
candidate showed poorly in a recent Arizona Chamber of Commerce
poll, placing fifth, with 7 percent of the vote. He was outpolled
by Quayle, Arizona Sen. John McCain, Bush and former Red Cross
President Elizabeth Dole. &QL;

ADVANTAGE, AUGUSTA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ They were bunched like raindrops, and soon many
of the leaders will be falling too. Thursday at The Masters, nobody
raced in front, Augusta National asserting itself more than anyone
in the field.
</P>
<P>
   After a mostly searing afternoon followed by a thunderstorm that
stopped play for 90 minutes, four players emerged as the
first-round leaders at 3-under-par 69. Two you have heard of, Nick
Price and Davis Love III. The others are Scott McCarron and Brandel
Chamblee, one-time winners on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   There is a group of seven at 2-under, featuring defending
Masters champion Mark O'Meara, former Masters champion Jose Maria
Olazabal and former major tournament champions Jeff Sluman, Lee
Janzen and Justin Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   Nine more players are in red numbers at 1-under, led by Masters
favorite David Duval and sentimental favorite Greg Norman. Thirteen
more _ among them Tiger Woods _ are at even par.
</P>
<P>
   Darkness prevented 12 players from finishing, including Price,
who was stranded on the 18th tee.
</P>
<P>
   Augusta presented a rough challenge. The second cut was
everywhere. It was short in comparison to U.S. Open rough, but just
tricky enough to cause hesitation in club selection and swing
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Additional trees and yardage resulted in additional problems for
golfers who otherwise would have handled Thursday's mostly benign
conditions until the storm rolled in.
</P>
<P>
   Pin placements on the already undulating greens created a game
of miniature golf. After taking three strokes on several greens,
Fred Couples finished with a 74.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pins were all on nobs and crows and front edges,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   What is supposed to be a tournament resembles a scrum thus far.
The battle resumes Friday with big names and no names taking
another shot, hoping to thread the pine needles and find an opening
in Augusta's defense.
</P>
<P>
   No one found much daylight, particularly those in the final four
groups and Tiger Woods, a camouflaged star but lurking nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   He recorded one of golf's most dreaded scores, a snowman,
triple-bogey 8 at the eighth hole when he mingled too closely with
nature. After pulling his drive to the left, Woods attempted to hit
a recovery shot but caught a branch, his ball ending up in an
azalea bush.
</P>
<P>
   Woods was forced to take an unplayable lie. His next shot soared
over the green and Woods failed to get up and down in more ways
than one.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past when I'm 2-over, I would try and be aggressive
right away,'' Woods said. ``Now I say to myself to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   It paid off, as Woods reeled off three birdies in a row at 12,
13 and 14 to work his way back into contention.
</P>
<P>
   After getting to 3-under, Duval dropped back after bogeying 12,
13 and 14. The world's top-ranked player tried cutting the dogleg
at the par-5 13th and hit a branch, his ball bounding into Rae's
Creek, lowlighting his stretch of atypical golf.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders hung in there, avoiding casualties, using
persistence and steady play. Accomplished professionals who have
won other major championships and 29 tournaments between them, Love
and Price do not own a green jacket. They were both at 1-over at
one point but turned solid on the back side, neither recording a
bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Love nearly won The Masters in '95, shooting 13-under but losing
to Ben Crenshaw by one shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a good score, a very good score,'' Love said. ``I
called Ben. I told him how happy I was for him...I'd like to just
shoot that score a couple more times.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the ricochets that derailed Woods and Duval, Love got a
break at the fourth when his approach hit someone in the gallery
and bounced within 5 feet of the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Chamblee is in an unusual position _ just being here. The
36-year-old from Phoenix earned a spot in the tournament by winning
the Greater Vancouver Open last year.
</P>
<P>
   An eagle-3 at the 13th highlighted his round. It came
unconventionally, Chamblee hitting a ``Zoom'' club from 216 yards
within four feet of the hole. The ``Zoom'' is a cross between a
wood and an iron, playing like a 4- or 5-wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ugly the first time you see it, but when you hit it, it
gets much prettier,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before coming to Augusta, Chamblee used to watch The Masters at
home. He learned about Augusta's nuances from his TV set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like everybody else, I do my taxes and have a Masters party
and invite everybody over to watch it on Sunday,'' said Chamblee,
who as a kid taught himself the golf swing by mimicking the ones he
saw on TV.
</P>
<P>
   If he is not the featured performer on the big screen this
weekend, Chamblee won't care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when I've played poorly, I've enjoyed it,'' he said.
``It's like that bumper sticker _ a bad day of golf is better than
a good day at work.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarron is another likeable fellow. He is best known for the
rockets that are launched from his driver, and the long-shafted
putter he uses on the greens.
</P>
<P>
   For four years after graduating from UCLA, McCarron gave up golf
and worked with his father in the family clothing business. Now he
hopes to add a green jacket to his wardrobe on a course that is
tailor-made for him. Before the tournament began, Couples predicted
that McCarron would do well at Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that because I took money from him (Wednesday),''
McCarron said. `But, yeah, the course does set up real well for me.
For some reason, I get here and start relaxing and feel
comfortable. I drive the ball farther and feel more powerful. It's
kind of a mystical place for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Augusta National was more like a mystery to everyone
else.

GALAXY LOSES IN SHOOTOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA -- Talk about your miserable nights. Everything seemed
lousy Thursday -- the fans, weather and the soccer. And of course,
another dreaded shootout didn't help any.
</P>
<P>
   After winning its first two shootouts to start the season, 2-0,
the Galaxy saw its record drop to 2-2 after defender Greg Vanney's
final shootout attempt hit the near post, allowing Columbus to
escape with a 2-1 victory (3-2 in the shootout) in front of a
franchise low 4,825 at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Shootouts.
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news, bad news story of the Galaxy's 1999
season.
</P>
<P>
   Good news first: The Galaxy hasn't lost a game in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news: The Galaxy hasn't won a game in regulation,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Cobi Jones' one-touch finisher in the 55th minute or
Stern John's equalizer for Columbus in the 65th minute, the worst
part of Thursday's match came in the 90th minute when referee Alex
Prus put a stop to this thing to send the Galaxy to its fourth
consecutive shootout in as many games.
</P>
<P>
   Stern John, Brian McBride and Robert Warzycha notched shootout
goals for the Crew (2-1). After Welton and Jones missed their first
two attempts, Clint Mathis and Mauricio Cienfuegos pulled the
Galaxy to within a goal, but Vanney was unable to force an extra
round.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano continued to preach patience after
the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced this team will show what it is capable of
doing, Zambrano said. ``By the time we reach the middle of the
season we will be where we want to be. Right now this is a young
team that is still finding its way. It's just a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Jones, are growing impatient.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to start winning games in order to keep ourselves in
the hunt and play to the level our fans expect us to play, said
Jones. ``I know we're a young team but this team expects better
resutlts -- I expect better results. There's no serect, we need to
start playing 90 minutes of intense soccer the way we know how to
play.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy enjoyed a 1-0 second half lead thanks to Jones, but
certainly Cienfuegos and Ezra Hendrickson, who made his first start
since injuring his groin a day before the season started, deserved
some credit.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrickson, arguably the best attacking defender in the league,
received a pass from Cienfuegos behind Columbus' defense down the
right side. Hendrickson dribbled a couple of steps toward the goal,
then slid a pass in front of a rushing Jones who was able to
one-touch his shot past Crew goalkeeper Mark Dougherty from a few
yards out.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman made his best save
of the season, he let a John shot slip through his hands to the
near post.
</P>
<P>
   John appeared as though he would get the equalizer in the 64th
minute, but Hartman made a spectacular flick save with his right
hand following a header from John five-yards in front of the Galaxy
net.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, John found himself open again from 20-yards
out. He tried to sneak a quick shot to the near post past Hartman.
The Galaxy keeper appeared to be in position, but the ball slipped
pass his right arm and trickled into the net to tie the game, 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, maybe it had something to do with the rainy
conditions, but the same problems the Galaxy has encountered its
first three games appeared to surface again.
</P>
<P>
   -- Midfield newcomer Daniel Hernandez continued to struggle in
place of Guatemalan Martin Machon, who was sold in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cienfuegos wandered about most of the time, showing a look of
frustration as his teammates spread the ball everywhere except in
his direction.
</P>
<P>
   -- And Welton, last year's scoring surprise -- has been useless.
</P>
<P>
   No one said this would be the new and improved Galaxy after last
year's record breaking regular season -- but no one expected the
team to look this unorganized either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not clicking all the way yet, said Jones. ``Sometimes we
play 90 percent and other times we play at 80 percent. We're not
yet at the level we should be.

M'S AND SONICS FANS STRIVE TO SURVIVE SPRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The inevitable cyclical nature of sports presents us
with a harsh reality: What goes up, must come down.
</P>
<P>
   And boy are we mostly down around here.
</P>
<P>
   Lower than low tide at Myrtle Edwards. Lower than the Space
Needle elevator stuck on ground level.
</P>
<P>
   At water coolers and lunch counters across Seattle, sports fans
are shivering through a very chilling spring. Where's the Sonics'
bounce? Where's the Mariners' pop? Why does mediocrity reign?
</P>
<P>
   The questions, the collective agony and growing anger over the
demise of the Sonics and Mariners has just about reached full metal
jacket.
</P>
<P>
   That is why people are still talking about what a yawner the
Mariners opener was on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Sonics, fans are finally realizing they are not the
SuperSonics of the past six winning seasons. Beating the Trail
Blazers 87-86 at KeyArena Thursday night was a morale booster, but
this is not a Sonics team that has sustained any energy or momentum
this season.
</P>
<P>
   What gives? What did we do to deserve this?
</P>
<P>
   Didn't KeyArena get a massive overhaul in 1994-95, making it one
of the hottest buildings for home-court advantage?
</P>
<P>
   Don't the Mariners have that new and now world's most expensive
baseball stadium looming on the horizon?
</P>
<P>
   Don't we have Ken Griffey Jr. taking over games at the Kingdome
with his uncanny knack for belting homers and going 4-for-4 just
when the moment calls for it?
</P>
<P>
   Don't we have Gary Payton taking over games at KeyArena with his
complete unwillingness to conceed defeat?
</P>
<P>
   These are not the issues, however. It is a mistake to think the
monstrous amounts of cash it has taken to spruce up and build new
sports palaces guarantee high times and giddy playoff runs.
</P>
<P>
   And even the brightest stars can't make up for the glaring
mistakes of a franchise that has failed to promote an aggressive
plan of attack for keeping the Mariners competitive, even in
horrific market conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Can anyone say, ``No. 1 starter?''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, expectations for success are unrealistic in
today's world of professional sports. Money has thrown the entire
equation for enjoyment and satisfaction out of whack.
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy to offer up a survival guide for followers of
.500 teams, but there are things Mariner and Sonic fans must keep
in mind.
</P>
<P>
   For Sonic fans, the only hope is that team president Wally
Walker did not like the boos he heard during the retirement of Nate
McMillan's number two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassment is a terrific motivator, although it is unclear
whether Walker and his hand-picked successor to George Karl, Paul
Westphal, have a clear vision of where they want the Sonics to go,
this season or beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Fault Karl's trapping, helter-skelter system all you want. It
still got the Sonics to Game 6 of the NBA Finals in '96. Now the
trick is for the Sonics to carve out a new identity _ something a
little more difficult in this expansion-diluted, Post-Jordan NBA.
</P>
<P>
   It is still hard to imagine how a team with Payton and Shawn
Kemp at its core was not an automatic contender, but we all know
how Walker's rush to sign Jim McIlvaine and the inability to
appease Kemp busted apart the Sonics, who could have had a
Jazz-like reign.
</P>
<P>
   Now the burden is on Walker stop the slide this summer during
free-agency. And with Vin Baker demonstrating less than All-Star
qualities, Walker's job of surrounding Payton has become that much
more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Mariners, returning to contender status could take a
long time, or it might never happen _ unless a billionaire buys the
team.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the Seahawks are not in this category of ``Local
Teams Who Severly Disappoint Us'' is because Paul Allen has the
money to do whatever the NFL will allow him to do. Money is no
object. Winning is.
</P>
<P>
   Since baseball can't get itself a system to control owners'
spending, the Mariners, with a $49 million payroll, have no chance
of being like the Yankees ($84 million) without the help of a sugar
daddy owner.
</P>
<P>
   That is why it is not unreasonable for Mariner fans to pray that
after the new ballpark opens, Mariner owners move to restructure
themselves. In fact, it might be wise to pray that a single owner
emerges from this band of red-ink fearing Nintendo and Microsoft
folks.
</P>
<P>
   The best chance for unbridled spending is if the M's are in the
hands of a solo owner, say like Microsoftie and Mariner part-owner
Chris Larsen. He is the kind of baseball junkie who may want a team
to call his own.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, try and enjoy Carlos Guillen and Freddy Garcia
and Griffey, who is still here. Try to hang tough with Payton and
Baker, who are as frustrated as you are. Their nasty spat in
practice proves their nerves are worn, too.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere under all this rancor, all this baggage of megabucks
and expectations, it is good to remember these guys are human and
these are only games and this is supposed to be fun.
</P>

KINGS BEAT SHARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Vladimir Tsyplakov emerged Thursday night
from the hiding place he had inhabited for more than three months.
He even remembered to raise his arms after scoring, although it
would have been totally understandable if he'd forgotten to do so.
</P>
<P>
   After going without a goal since Dec. 26, a 29-game drought,
Tsyplakov scored twice as the Kings defeated the San Jose Sharks
3-2 before a crowd of 12,785 at the Forum. Donald Audette also
scored and Stephane Fiset stopped 32 of 34 shots by the Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   Tsyplakov's performance, however, did not take the sting off a
season in which he has scored just 10 goals, eight below the career
high he set a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my worst season so far in the NHL, actually my career,''
Tsyplakov said. ``It's hard to say (why). I work hard. The puck
doesn't go in. Maybe I've got to shoot more, go to the net.''
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the tone of the season, the success of Tsyplakov
and the team did not come without a price. No.1 center Jozef
Stumpel in all likelihood concluded his disappointing year when he
left the game in the second period with a sprained medial
collateral ligament in his right knee, courtesy of a takedown by
Sharks defenseman Bryan Marchment. Stumpel will be re-examined
today.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings also announced that winger Sandy Moger will undergo
surgery Monday to repair a partially torn left rotator cuff, ending
his season.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Kings (29-43-5) are about to reel off five more
victories to complete the regular season, the win over San Jose
meant little. Playoff hopes all but died on the 1-4 trip the Kings
concluded Monday with a loss at Colorado. For the record, the
victory moved the Kings within six points of a playoff berth with
five games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've still got a chance,'' Tsyplakov insisted. ``You never
know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks (30-31-17), who are seventh in the Western
Conference, needed to win the game to draw closer to St. Louis and
the Mighty Ducks in the race for fifth place, but they showed
little of the urgency one would have expected. San Jose might have
been looking ahead to tonight's game against the Ducks at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Tsyplakov opened the scoring 10:08 into the game when he found a
hole in the Sharks' defense and beat goalie Mike Vernon with a
15-foot backhander. Less than four minutes later, Donald Audette
scored on a breakaway. Tsyplakov scored again midway through the
second period off a setup by Rob Blake.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks made a bid to get back in the game in the third
period, Joe Murphy scoring on a power play after Blake took a
penalty for cross-checking Alexander Korolyuk, with whom he'd
battled all night. With 15 seconds to play and Vernon pulled for an
extra skater, Jeff Norton cut San Jose's final deficit to one.
</P>
<P>
   With playoff hopes faint, the Kings used the opportunity to take
a look at 23-year-old winger Jason Podollan, acquired at the
trading deadline on March 23 in the deal that sent Yanic Perreault
to Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Podollan came close to scoring on his first shift with the
Kings, but his point-blank backhander was stopped by San Jose
goalie Mike Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was feeling pressure to produce because Perreault
had scored all four goals for Toronto the night before in a victory
over Ottawa, Podollan said, ``I hope it's not expected.... Five is
kind of out of the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Podollan has had an extremely productive season in the minors,
scoring an AHL-high 42 goals for the Leafs' affiliate in St.
John's, and five more in seven games with the Long Beach Ice Dogs
before being recalled by the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a real good thing,'' Podollan said of leaving the
Leafs' organization to join the Kings. ``It's real exciting for me.
Things weren't working the way I'd like it in Toronto. It's a fresh
opportunity, something I want to make good on. Anytime you get a
chance to come up and skate, it's obviously a little bit of a job
interview.''

CLIPPERS WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the Clippers send a message, they usually
forget to use a stamp.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday's missive was delivered in person to the Minnesota
Timberwolves with 7,205 Sports Arena witnesses. And the message was
this:
</P>
<P>
   Nah-nah, nah-nah-nah. Us 99, you 91.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are an NBA team,'' T'wolves star Kevin Garnett said of
the Clippers, in case anyone needed clarification, ``and they have
talent just like we do. They are a hell of a team.''
</P>
<P>
   This translation of hell would be 4 victories in 34 games. But
in game 34, the Clippers were finally facing down the bitter
feelings of revenge carried by a team they had beaten in their last
encounter. The playoff-bound Timberwolves were conquered by the
Clips 18 days ago in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clippers, the best (and only) 4-30 team in the NBA,
suggested the previous result was no fluke by smiting the T'wolves.
This ended the Clippers' chump-change losing streak at six.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good win,'' said Clipper coach Chris Ford, whose
flair for understatement is defined by still needing one more
victory to make a fist.
</P>
<P>
   The roll call of Clipper heroes should begin with crusty point
guard Sherman Douglas, whose sage shenanigans prevented another
fourth-quarter free fall. Under siege by the Minnesota defense,
Douglas' ballhandling kept his team out of harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I done seen everything,'' Douglas (16 points, four assists)
said of his ability to deal with Minnesota's pressure defense. ``I
was just hoping this wasn't going to be the Phoenix game all over
again.''
</P>
<P>
   So let's rewind to Tuesday's date with the Suns, when a
half-court trap left the Clippers puckered up on the doorstep of
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves (20-15), who were clobbered Wednesday by the
Phoenix Suns, had a dandy alibi for losing to the Clippers - point
guard Terrell Brandon and his bruised thigh were under therapy in
Minnesota. But if they had lost, the Clippers had a better alibi -
the co-stars in those 30 defeats were all here.
</P>
<P>
   One crucial appearance was made by Clipper power forward Maurice
Taylor, who missed the two previous beatings thanks to bilateral
Achilles tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor scored 20 points and located 8 rebounds (a personal
revelation) in a command performance against Minnesota's big and
jumpy frontline.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all?'' Taylor said upon hearing the news of his
rebounding exploits. ``I thought it was more than that. Well, he
(Ford) has to take what the hell he can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he will.
</P>
<P>
   Contributing to Ford's bonanza was the unreasonably cold
marksmanship of Garnett, the lone T'wolf in the franchise fold
following highly scrutinized defections by Stephon Marbury and Tom
Gugliotta. The 7-foot Garnett, a four-year pro whose high
school-to-NBA learning curve was taken on two wheels, missed 18 of
25 field-goal attempts through three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have pride and they mess up other teams' records and
season,'' said Garnett, who did some of that himself. ``I don't
think they're gonna lay down to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Kevin got the message.

SONICS GET BAKER BACK, BEAT BLAZERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Sonics continue to resemble the stock market _ up
one day, crashing the next.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, after their 87-86 victory against the Portland Trail
Blazers Thursday night, the Sonics are hoping for at least two
constants during the final 16 games of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing they are in a fight to make the playoffs, the Sonics
are counting on solid play from Vin Baker as well a renewed
defensive stance.
</P>
<P>
   Baker played for the first time since he went on the injured
list March 23 with a partially torn ligament in his right thumb.
For the second time in three games, the Sonics (17-17) reverted to
the ball-hawking defensive style that had been synonymous with
their past dominance.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics held the Trail Blazers (27-7) to four field goals in
a decisive third quarter. A 30-13 run by the Sonics in that period
erased a 12-point deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our team is out there, we can beat anybody,'' Sonics
coach Paul Westphal said. ``(Portland) has the best record in the
league so this win does a lot for our confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker's presence did wonders, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics needed an emotional lift after Tuesday's overtime
loss at home to the Sacramento Kings. More importantly, the Sonics
needed Baker's inside presence to draw double teams and create open
outside shots.
</P>
<P>
   Baker came off the bench with 9:51 left in the first quarter
after rookie Vladimir Stepania picked up two quick fouls. He scored
on his first touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was pumped up for this game,'' said Baker, who wore
a protective brace and did not appear bothered by the thumb. ``I've
been playing pretty well in practice, better than I thought I've
played in a long time. So I wanted to come out and take my time. I
was going to come out aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   He did. Baker finished with 15 points and seven rebounds in 38
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played extremely well,'' Hersey Hawkins said of Baker. ``He
was a lot quicker and more aggressive. With him drawing double
teams, it opens up the perimeter for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics had plenty of motivation for this game.
</P>
<P>
   They lost to Portland April 2 after committing 11 fourth-quarter
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Sonics led 87-83 with 50 seconds left when Greg
Anthony hit a 3-pointer 36.4 ticks remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Disaster nearly struck when the Sonics, who had 10 turnovers in
the game, committed a costly miscue with 16.1 seconds to play.
Rasheed Wallace slapped the ball away from Detlef Schrempf and Jim
Jackson gathered the steal. The Sonics, though, forced Portland to
turn the ball over with 1.5 seconds left and preserved the win.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics played with fire defensively the entire second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to pick up full court and gamble. They beat us a
few times. But at least the energy was up,'' Westphal said. ``It's
just a good precedence to set _ that we're going to outwork the
other team. It's something I think will help us play 48 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers, who had won 10 of their last 11 games, flew
around the glass like kids going after cotton candy in the first
half. They outrebounded the Sonics 25-12 in the first half,
outscored the Sonics 10-3 for second-chance points and led by as
many as 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had two rebounds,'' center Olden Polynice said. ``I just
thought, `Hey, I can get two rebounds in my sleep.' We all took it
upon ourselves to be more aggressive. So we turned it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton, who led the team with 20 points, ignited the team's
biggest run after Portland dominated the first half. He opened the
third with a 3-pointer and the Sonics used an 18-4 run to go ahead
59-57.
</P>
<P>
   Portland also went cold after shooting 52.5 percent in the first
half. The Trail Blazers missed 20 of their 24 shot attempts in the
third. The Sonics limited the Trail Blazers to one shot in the
third quarter and most of them came from the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were accustomed to playing that style for so long,''
Schrempf said. ``We got away from that and we were being passive.
We were always the aggressor. I like it when we're the aggressor.''

UNSER HAS BROKEN ANKLE, ACHING HEART
</HEADLINE>

By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Smacking a wall while traveling 200 miles per hour or at least
the danger of that happening is part of Al Unser Jr.'s chosen
profession.
</P>
<P>
   And like any other race car driver, Unser knows and accepts
that. But, there is no collision in the world not even one at 200
miles per hour that could prepare Unser for the pain of watching
one of his children suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Unser was at work testing his CART FedEx Championship Marlboro
Team Penske entry at the Miami-Dade Homestead Motorsports Complex
when he received word that his 12-year-old daughter, Cody, was
stricken with tranverse myletis, an inflammation of the spinal cord
caused by an attack of the body's immune system. Cody, a
sixth-grader and an accomplished athlete, was playing basketball in
the Unser's hometown of Albuquerque on Feb.5 when she complained of
pain and numbness in her legs. As her condition worsened, she
became paralyzed from the chest down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit me right in the gut,'' said Unser, a six-time Toyota
Grand Prix of Long Beach champion, who has become known as the King
of Long Beach for his success here. ``Not having control over what
was happening to my little girl is very frustrating. I was looking
at the doctors (and) at first they were scratching their heads
saying `We don't know.' That's really scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Cody's progress toward recovery has been slow, and it will
continue to be. She spent three weeks at the Barrow Neurological
Institute in Phoenix before returning home and is now undergoing
rehabilitation at Albuquerque's Carrie Tingley Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cody is doing great,'' Unser said on Wednesday after attending
a weekly meeting that includes Cody's doctors, therapists and
school teacher. ``Everybody (in the meeting) gave her straight A's.
She is still paralyzed from the chest down, but she is getting
better. The process is pretty slow.''
</P>
<P>
   Unser returned to Homestead on March 21 for the CART FedEx
Championship opening race the Marlboro Grand Prix of Miami. It was,
he hoped, the first step toward Marlboro Team Penske's climb back
to the Champ car pinnacle. However, literally seconds into the
opener, a frustrated Unser was slinging the steering wheel out of
the car after being run into the wall by rookie Naoki Hattori.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically I was in the wrong place at the wrong time,'' said
Unser, who will turn 37 on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   What resulted was a right ankle broken in two places and a
sprained knee for Unser and a broken leg for Hattori. The reaction
by the other CART competitors showed the kind of respect the classy
Little Al has earned in his 18 years in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see someone like Al get hurt like that is tough for
everyone,'' said fellow driver Christian Fittipaldi. ``He's a guy
that all of the drivers respect and look up to.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Andretti, who came into the series a year after Little
Al, also expressed sympathy for his long-time friend and rival
after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it rains, it pours,'' said Andretti after finishing
second in Miami. ``I feel bad about Cody, and now this happens.
It's been a tough winter for him. But they're tough people. They'll
get through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unser, who had surgery two days after the incident, has seen
pretty much everything the series has to offer since joining the
circuit. He's been injured while racing, including suffering a
broken ankle in 1985. But he had never missed a race because of an
injury. In fact, after the first broken ankle, he was back in the
car in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being in Japan for the Firestone Firehawk 500, which
begins today at 9 p.m. PST, Unser was at home. And, although he'll
be in Long Beach on April 16-18 for the 25th running of the Toyota
Grand Prix of Long Beach, Unser won't be where he wants to be on
the track.
</P>
<P>
   Unser and wife, Shelly, are the parents of Cody, Alfred Richard,
16, Shannon Lee, 11, and and Joseph Scott, 2. Which brings us to
the bright side of his time off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting to spend time with my family,'' said Unser. ``If
there's anything good coming from this, it's the fact I get to
spend time with all four of my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Little Al and Cody have attended rehab sessions together. Al's
rehab consists of range of motion exercises and plenty of ice for
the ankle. Cody's work includes building her upper body and keeping
her legs stretched. She's also learning how to operate a wheel
chair and things we take for granted such as putting on her shoes.
Little Al alternates between using a wheelchair and crutches, and
Cody is in a wheelchair full-time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's teaching me wheelies,'' Cody told the Associated Press.
``I'm teaching him how to get around the house better.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Little Al will be a few weeks away from walking, he
plans on being back in the car by the end of April and racing in
the Bosch Spark Plug Grand Prix in Nazareth, Pa., on May 2. He said
he literally may have to be carried to and from his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have the same goal,'' said Unser, `` which is to put
the No. 1 (signifying the series champion) on the Marlboro car.''
</P>
<P>
   It was with that theme that Unser and Team Penske attacked
off-season testing. The team is in its 30th season overall and 21st
in CART. It has compiled 86 Champ car victories, 10 Indy 500 wins,
118 pole positions and seven Champ car titles. But the last victory
was by Paul Tracy at Gateway in 1997. Little Al hasn't won since
taking the checkered flag at Vancouver in 1995 and the team's last
championship was Unser's title in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's gotten very frustrating,'' Unser said of the 54-race
winless streak. ``But my dad said a long time ago, `If it was easy,
everybody would be doing it'.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Unser had podium finishes of second at Japan and
third at Michigan, but only delivered five other top 10 finishes
and his 11th-place finish in the points standings marked the second
successive year out of the top 10. Penske's other driver, Andre
Ribeiro, was 22nd in the standings. The biggest change of the
off-season was the team's decision to field one only entry Unser
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an easy decision for Team Penske,'' Penske said at a
February press conference in Homestead. ``Certainly we had a
long-term contract with Al and we were not happy with our
performance in 1998. Probably our unreliability was the biggest
issue. We had some great testing during the preseason, following
the end of the 1998 season and also going into 1999. Certainly as
we see the reliability of the car, we have run competitive times
with other teams during the preseason.''
</P>
<P>
   He closed that part of his statement by saying ``The racing
season will tell a little story.''
</P>
<P>
   However the story was put on hold when Unser was injured. Tarso
Marques, a 23-year-old Brazilian, took over Unser's seat for
today's race in Japan. Gonzalo Rodriquez and Jason Leffler have
also tested with Penske, though the team hasn't announced who drive
in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   What Unser is concerned with is trying to return to the front of
the pack, beginning in Nazareth. And how does he plan to do that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Stand on the gas,'' said Unser, whose father, Al, and uncle,
Bobby are racing legends.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Unser won't be standing on the gas at Long Beach,
where he won four consecutive times 1988-91 and then back-to-back
1994-95.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long Beach has been very, very good to me,'' Unser said.
``We've won more at that track than any other. To be missing the
25th anniversary is very disappointing. But that's the cards I've
been dealt.''
</P>
<P>
   Unser was relegated to a spectator role last year at Long Beach
for a different reason. After qualifying 10th, his race day ended
in Turn 3 of the first lap when he slammed into the tire barriers
while avoiding Scott Pruett, and was struck from behind by Helio
Castro-Neves. This year, Unser said, was going to be different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking forward to winning at Long Beach,'' Unser said.
``We have a great car and I really thought I could have won the
race.''
</P>
<P>
   History says he may have been right.

<P>
   TAMPA _ The best that can be said for Thursday night's game was
that it was entirely predictable.
</P>
<P>
   One night after the Bruins clinched a playoff spot against the
Florida Panthers, they suffered a giant letdown against the Tampa
Bay Lightning, losing, 3-0, to a team on its way to finishing dead
last in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns, who has a roster full of banged-up players,
elected to rest defenseman Hal Gill (hip flexor) and Rob DiMaio
(finger/forearm) so that they, at the very least, wouldn't get
worse.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the most let down of all was goalie Rob Tallas, who
was making his first start since Feb. 21. Prior to this game,
Tallas, who had never lost to the Lightning in his career (5-0-1),
said he was well aware his teammates could have some difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   They were coming off a high after winning their fourth straight
and assuring themselves of a postseason slot. They were playing
their second game in two nights and their third game in four days.
A loss at this juncture was by no means going to be considered a
disaster, but even Burns said at the morning skate he was concerned
about how much help his players were going to be to his backup
goalie.
</P>
<P>
   The answer? Not very much.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning, who beat Boston for the first time since Dec. 17,
1997, when they earned a 2-0 decision, got on the board early in
the first period when rookie center Vincent Lecavalier, who shows
every sign that he will live up to his billing as the No. 1 pick
overall in last June's draft.
</P>
<P>
   Right wing Stephane Richer, who had two assists and has made a
career of being a Bruin killer, dished a pass from the far right
circle to Lecavalier, along the inside edge. Lecavalier fired a
wrister that beat Tallas to the stick side at 3:28. It was the 13th
goal of the year for the 18-year-old rookie.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins lost left wing Ken Baumgartner at 10:02 when he lined
up Tampa center Michael Nylander and drilled him head-first into
the glass. Nylander left the game bleeding from the head and having
suffered a concussion. Baumgartner left the game with a five-minute
major for boarding and a game misconduct. He also faces possible
supplementary discipline.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins killed off the penalty. Tampa's best chance came with
30 seconds left on it when Alexandre Daigle ripped a one-timer from
the slot that Tallas gloved.
</P>
<P>
   At the 16:22 mark, Lecavalier set up Daigle for another scoring
chance, with Daigle firing a backhand shot from the right circle.
Tallas came out to cut it off, dropped sideways and enveloped the
puck in his body, securing it with his glove.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning replaced goalie Kevin Hodson with Corey Schwab to
start the second period because Hodson aggravated a groin strain,
but Schwab was just as stingy as Hodson had been. Boston had six
power plays in the first 40 minutes, including a brief two-man
advantage early in the second, but couldn't cash in any of them.
The Bruins just looked tired and out of sync.
</P>
<P>
   Tallas kept plugging away, hoping for some offensive help but
didn't get any. At 16:57 of the second, he made a great save on
right wing Mike Sillinger, who tried to redirect a Rob Zamuner feed
from the edge of the crease.
</P>
<P>
   With just over two minutes left in the period, Tallas made a
terrific stop with his stick on a bid by Lecavalier.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning boosted their lead to a pair of goals with under a
minute remaining. Center Darcy Tucker centered a pass to left wing
Colin Forbes in front of the net. Forbes, who was being pressured
by defenseman Don Sweeney, managed to pop a high shot in over
Tallas with 58.3 seconds left for the 2-0 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gratton capped the scoring with an empty-net goal with
48.6 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rough night for Boston, a result the Lightning
predicted long before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think we're going to win,'' said Richer, after the
morning skate.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for hard-luck Tallas, Richer was right on the
money.

<P>
   TORONTO _ Things did not go quite according to Hoyle Thursday
night. Rick Pitino was riding the referees over the medical
qualities of a pimple while Kenny Anderson, his new best friend,
was getting booed every time he touched the ball.
</P>
<P>
   A Buffalo Bills lineman was calling for Dontae Jones, either
unaware or unconcerned that Jones hasn't been in the league this
year. Throw that in with a botched karaoke contest and a technical
on mild-mannered Paul Pierce and, well, things aren't always what
they seem.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask the flavor-of-the-month Raptors. They have the big-time
rookie, the wily vets, the spiffy new arena, the playoff
possibility _ and absolutely none of it mattered against the
supposedly dysfunctional Celtics. Boston wore out the Raptors in
the second half with its trap and long-range shooting and pulled
away for an easy 101-89 victory, a margin that would have continued
to grow had not the clock intervened.
</P>
<P>
   It was a big win. The Celtics had not won two straight since
Feb. 24-27, when they put together a three-gamer. They had been
manhandled by Toronto in their first two meetings and now Toronto
was making a move and talking about the postseason. But this was
decidedly different.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino high-fived Pierce on the way out and put his arm around
Anderson, who reacted to the booing with a 23-point, 7-assist
submission. The Celtics stayed competitive on the glass, bombed
away with impunity and success from international waters (8 for
13), forced 22 turnovers (good for 25 points) and got blissfully
balanced scoring _ Anderson's 23 led five starters in double
figures. That more than offset rocketman rookie Vince Carter, who
had 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always felt we were the better team, but I don't think we
were even in those other two games,'' said Pierce, (15 points, 7
rebounds), who was given his first pro `T' for hanging on the rim
after a sweet alley-oop. ``They banged us before. We wanted to be
more physical. I think we were.''
</P>
<P>
   Some credit has to go to Kiev strongman Vitaly Potapenko, who
would not be pushed around inside and finished with 11 points, 7
rebounds, and a blocked shot. His only problem was an alleged cut
in the first quarter; the referees said they saw blood and ordered
him to the bench for treatment. Pitino went bonkers, screaming that
it was a pimple and that there was no blood.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pitino, Potapenko had more bumps and bangs than he
deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to be cut a break,'' Pitino said. ``He's getting
bumped in there pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Raptors coach Butch Carter, ``Their new center handled
(Kevin) Willis very well and that had something to do with it. We
did not match their energy. I hope it's not a trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Also up to the task was Antoine Walker, who had 18 points, 10
rebounds, 6 assists, 4 steals, and 5 turnovers. Butch Carter
saluted Walker, saying, ``He played an unselfish game.'' Walker had
the hot hand from outside, knocking down four treys while Anderson
matched his season total of three. And what did Anderson think of
the boos directed his way because he refused to report here last
year after being traded for Damon Stoudamire?
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes me feel really important,'' he cracked. ``I didn't
even think they knew who Kenny Anderson was.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics took control in the third, when a 3-point barrage
turned a Toronto lead into a 68-62 Boston advantage. Boston led,
71-67, after three and was clinging to an 83-77 lead in the fourth
with 5:49 left. Out of a timeout, Anderson took a pass from Walker
and hit a 15-footer. Vince Carter (12 for 22) matched that, but
then Ron Mercer (18 points) made a rare trey to ignite a 9-2 run
that sent the patrons scrambling to the exits.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Bills lineman Robert Hicks, who had a front-row
seat and went to Mississippi State with Dontae Jones, was calling
out ``SEC, SEC'' at every opportunity. Pitino may sometimes wonder
why he left Kentucky, and is still wondering why he doesn't get the
calls he got at Kentucky, but on this night, he saw a lot of good
things.
</P>
<P>
   His team beat a good team, on the road, having played the night
before, and doing it the way all his teams do it: with harassment,
hustle, and some plain old good luck. That comes to teams that work
and, Thursday night, the Celtics were the unquestioned worker bees.

DAFOE A POET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poetry is the man's birthright. You have to remember that when
you're talking about Bruins goaltender Byron Dafoe. He's not just a
goaltender. He's a poetic goaltender. This may not be exactly what
Dafoe's mother had in mind 28 years ago in Sussex, England, but I
don't hear any Bruins fans complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know Lord Byron, the poet?'' Dafoe said Thursday. ``My
mother was a real big fan of his, so she named me after him. I
understand he was a pretty wild guy in his time.''
</P>
<P>
   He was. He liked to pen his clever verse. He liked his freedom
(he was a 19th-century pretty boy). He liked his drugs. And, the
gossip mongers of the 1800s whispered, he loved being intimate with
women _ including his half-sister. So that Byron was nearly run out
of town. Not this one. Almost everyone who talks with him likes
him. He is so popular that on Monday night, more than 17,000 people
at the FleetCenter didn't need to talk with him to let him know how
they felt. They simply chanted his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's not like I have the easiest name to chant,'' he said.
``It doesn't roll like `Reg-gie, Reg-gie.' It's just `By-ron.' ''
</P>
<P>
   You say you've never read a poem in your life? You have if
you're a Bruins fan and have ever mentioned the name of Dafoe. The
following is a major difference between Dafoe's poetry and the
prose of his namesake.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Byron poetic line: ``The best of life is over and its
bitters double.''
</P>
<P>
   Byron Dafoe poetic line: 10 shutouts, 9-2-3 in his last 14
games, Bruins in the Stanley Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so I exercised some poetic license toward the end of that
line. But have you seen the Eastern Conference lately? What's Lord
Byron talking about? The best of life has begun for the Bruins.
They have the schedule on their side, fate on their side, and the
poetic goaltender in their net.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Thursday night's games, the East was a mess. Seems
like each day, the Bruins leap over a fallen team mumbling about
what it could have been.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the beginning of the season when everyone thought the
Flyers would be great? Now they are more of a prayer group than a
hockey team. Eric Lindros recently gave the entire city a scare
when one of his lungs collapsed and six pints of blood filled his
chest cavity. He was released from one hospital Thursday, but
admitted to another and is probably out for the season. So forget
about the Flyers in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins? They've been moonwalking through the standings,
sliding farther and farther back to the land of seventh and eighth
seeds. And can we talk about the Carolina Hurricanes? They play in
front of about 10 people every night, probably making them wish for
the comparably good days when they were in Hartford. They are the
leaders of a dilapidated eyesore known as the Southeast Division.
They also, by default, hold the third spot in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   I know Pat Burns says that you should never try to pick your
opponents, but I'm sure the coach won't lie awake trembling if the
Bruins finish in sixth place and have to open the playoffs with a
series against the Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get into saying who we'd want to play, because
that gets you in trouble,'' Dafoe said before the Bruins played the
Lightning in Tampa Bay. ``But the other night, four or five of us
were sitting around talking about who we could play in the
playoffs. A lot can happen. We match up pretty good with a lot of
teams in our conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe is a nice man. He won't talk trash about anyone in the
East. But, yo, give me one Eastern team that is supposed to scare
the Bruins. Well, some team other than the Devils and Maple Leafs.
And even then, I like my chances against anybody as long as the man
who has ``Lord Byron'' scripted on his black-and-gold mask is
rejecting pucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say he's had a great run, but it's a little more than
that,'' Don Sweeney said of the bard. ``Even when he gives up a
goal, it's not really a bad one.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney is right. As dominant as Dafoe has been at times, what
he's doing is not necessarily new. In 1995, when Dafoe was with LA,
teammate Rick Tocchet was asked to name his top Hart Trophy
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to vote,'' Tocchet said at the time, ``it would be
between Mario Lemieux, Jaromir Jagr, and Dafoe.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems silly when you look at it now, but the Kings were in a
quandary in '95 because Dafoe was playing well while Kelly Hrudey
was recovering from an injury. Eventually, the Bruins would make
one of their best trades of the '90s, dealing Jozef Stumpel, Sandy
Moger, and a fourth-round draft pick to the Kings in exchange for a
man who is now their leading goal scorer (Dmitri Khristich) and a
man who makes their fans unafraid to speak of the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Dafoe will be a restricted free agent. That means
he will probably walk away with a contract in the $3.5
million-per-season range. That's enough loot to purchase a few
800-page Lord Byron anthologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've read up on him a little bit,'' Dafoe said, ``but I can't
recite you any lines. I wouldn't consider myself a poet.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe him. He's a poet. All you have to do is read those
lyrical stat lines that appear next to his name.

RED SOX BEAT ROYALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Sweeping the Kansas City Royals, who play in
the heartland of America but will be nowhere to be found come
October, ranks as something less than the Norman Conquest.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox know that. But there's still something to be said
for being the only unbeaten team in the American League three games
into the season, especially when their best player, Nomar
Garciaparra, is hobbled indefinitely with a strained left
hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox understand that, too, which is why there was a sense
of satisfaction in the visitors' clubhouse here after
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night's 4-1 win over the Royals, leavened by the reality
of what lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early,'' said Pedro Martinez, who pitched the opener
then watched as Bret Saberhagen (three hits allowed in six shutout
innings Wednesday) and Tim Wakefield (three hits and a run in 6 1/3
innings Thursday &UR;  &LR; night) shut down the Royals the next two games,
while the Boston bullpen went unscored upon in all three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the start of the season,'' Martinez said. ``We
have to stay focused, play the game the way we have been with
pitching, defense, and hits at key times, and try to sneak out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget about everything else. Get wins, wins and forget about
everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Royals will be quite relieved to forget former teammate Jose
Offerman, whose one-man reign of terror culminated with two more
doubles Thursday night, as he scored the first Sox run on John
Valentin's sacrifice fly in the first and accounted for the second
on a force out with the bases loaded in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   In three games, Offerman outscored his ex-team, 5 to 4. He had
eight hits in the series and five of the 11 Sox extra-base hits in
the three-game set.
</P>
<P>
   The polling booths, of course, will remain open all summer. But
based on the early returns, Dan Duquette was right about Offerman.
The rest of the world, ready to cast Offerman as Duke's Folly, can
jump off the Tobin Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offy had a great series,'' said Royals manager Tony Muser,
probably the first sentence he uttered this week that Offerman
would not dispute after taking exception to Muser musings about his
lack of hustle. ``We didn't pitch him well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to score over 100 runs. He'd probably have a real
good year if Mo Vaughn was still there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox nursed a 2-1 lead until there were two outs in the
ninth, when back-to-back thunder by Garciaparra's replacement,
Donnie Sadler (triple into the left-center field gap), and rookie
Trot Nixon (home run off a beer sign flanked by the waterfalls
beyond the right-field fence) made it easy for Tom Gordon. The Sox
closer gave up an infield hit and walk then struck out the side for
his second save of 1999 and 45th in a row dating back to last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw him this spring, and you saw what Donnie did last
year,'' manager Jimy Williams said of Sadler, whose fifth-inning
single off former Sox pitcher Jeff Suppan followed a base hit by
Jason Varitek in setting up the second Boston run. ``He really
didn't surprise me that he would go out there and play as well as
he did, and hit the ball as well as he did. To me, he has a lot
better idea at the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon gave the Sox an idea of his power potential with his first
big-league home run, a drive off Royals reliever Don Wengert that
carried 412 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullpen did a great job, and Trot's hit was huge,'' said
Wakefield, who like Saberhagen the night before pitched with the
flu but revealed few of its effects, allowing the Royals just one
run on a walk, bunt single, and Rey Sanchez's grounder through the
left side in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's takeout slide of shortstop Sanchez on Offerman's
bases-loaded RBI grounder in the fifth, meanwhile, reinforced the
idea that he will be useful in other ways as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just happy to put good wood on the ball,'' Nixon said.
``I can't afford to panic if I'm not getting hits. I have to play
good defense, hit the ball, and play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Royals scored just two runs on 11 hits in the last 26
innings against Red Sox pitching, and one of those runs was
unearned. In all, they were outscored, 15-4, and outhit, 36-14.
They had just three extra-base hits in the series, one in the last
25 innings, and fanned 27 times.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Lowe, who relieved Wakefield with two on and one out in
the seventh, retired pinch hitter Larry Sutton on an easy fly and
rookie Carlos Febles on a tapper to second, then breezed through
the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the ideal man in that situation,'' Wakefield said.
</P>
<P>
   And the Royals played the perfect patsy, for openers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we've only got 159 to go,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   On to Tampa.

KUEHNE TAKING MASTERS IN STRIDE AFTER ROUGH START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Regrettably, there are no mulligans at the
Masters.
</P>
<P>
   As golfer Hank Kuehne of Dallas waited Thursday for his heart to
stop thumping and his tee shot to stop rolling, he pondered that
gentlemanly omission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't too worried when I was on the practice green,'' the
SMU senior said. ``My putting wasn't bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``But somehow, along the way from the practice green to the
first tee, I started feeling like, `Hey _ I'm getting ready to tee
off in my first Masters.' ''
</P>
<P>
   His first Masters. The first time Kuehne ever picked up a golf
club _ at the tender age of 6 1/2 _ he dreamed of playing in the
Masters.
</P>
<P>
   As reigning U.S amateur champion, Kuehne became one of the
invitees to this year's tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Let it be noted that the ride up Magnolia Lane to the stately,
66-year-old clubhouse of Augusta National can be daunting. There is
Amen Corner. Rae's Creek. The dogwood in bloom.
</P>
<P>
   But the 23-year-old Kuehne was handling that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fine until we were walking up to the first tee and the
guy asked, `You ready?' '' Kuehne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it starts to hit you.''
</P>
<P>
   From the moment Kuehne's first shot of his first Masters left
the tee, he knew something was very wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get lucky! Get lucky!'' his sister Kelli prayed aloud.
</P>
<P>
   The soaring missile cleared not only the towering pine trees
lining the left side of the No. 1 fairway, but it whistled over the
adjoining ninth fairway before it came to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I got it airborne,'' Kuehne said with a wince.
</P>
<P>
   His two playing partners, Lee Westwood and Mark O'Meara,
immediately rushed to Kuehne's side and began consoling him with
stories about their own previous calamities at the Masters' No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't have hurt. From beyond the green on his second shot,
Kuehne scrambled to a less-than-textbook par.
</P>
<P>
   As turning points go, he called it huge.
</P>
<P>
   There might have been better opening rounds at a Masters by a
young amateur, eager to make the leap into golf's big time. But
none may have come so far and started so dreadfully as Kuehne's.
With a 35 on the back nine, Kuehne finished at 2-over 74 and found
a crowded corner of the leader board.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, he was battling alcohol addiction and being
treated at the Hazelden Rehab Clinic in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question,'' said his father, Ernie, in the fading
Augusta twilight. ``What Hank Kuehne has done, not just in golf,
but to his life is something very special.''
</P>
<P>
   These days Hank wears a golden key on a chain around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to a new beginning,'' Hank Kuehne explained. ``It's
from rehab. Kind of a reminder.''
</P>
<P>
   From his ghastly beginning on the No. 1 tee, Kuehne settled down
to an afternoon of soaring drives _ only four golfers were longer
off the tee.
</P>
<P>
   On the undulating, par-5 second hole, Kuehne sent his tee shot
345 yards _ with a 3-wood. His tee ball on No. 13 screamed through
the fairway and missed the dogleg, striking instead the belly of a
tall tree. The ball caromed back across the fairway at least 50
yards and found refuge in Augusta National's infamous ``second
cut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nailed it,'' Kuehne said. He ended up saving par.
</P>
<P>
   His birdies came on Nos. 5, 15 and 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the second shot of the first hole,'' Kuehne said, ``I
felt fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot today. The experience was great. I really
wasn't overly concerned whether I shot a 74 or an 84.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the rain and thunder halted play, the best amateur
golfer in the country refused to be intimidated by where he was.
Two of his birdies came once play resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Round 2, will be different, Kuehne wished aloud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to hit it, try and go find it, and then hit it
again, like Arnold Palmer said.'' nn

VAUGHN ON DL; ANGELS LOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Mo Vaughn joined Gary DiSarcina, Jim Edmonds and six
other Angels in a not-so-exclusive club Thursday -- they're all
members of the Angels' disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who sustained a bone bruise and sprained ligaments in
his left ankle while falling into the Indians dugout on Tuesday's
opening night, didn't try to talk the Angels medical staff out of
it. In fact, it was Vaughn's idea as much as anybody's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's going to argue, Vaughn said Thursday before the
Angels were routed by the Cleveland Indians, 9-1, before 25,084 at
Edison Field. ``I've stated my point. It's already been 48 hours
and it's not feeling that good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to this point, we're playing with 24 guys so that limits
the club. I don't think I'll be feeling that good (today). It's
been three days now. The DL is 12 more. If I'm not ready in 12
days, I'll cut the whole damn foot off. It'll be ready.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn is confident he'll be back when he'll be eligible to
return from the DL on April 22 in Toronto. But the medical staff
has indicated an injury the nature of Vaughn's could put someone
out anywhere from two to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, however, has a history of healing quickly. He had been
on the disabled list only one time previously in his career -- he
had torn cartilage in his left knee in 1997 but missed only three
weeks. He also seems to know his body well.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I tried to play in a couple days, I'd be in worse shape in
a couple weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Terry Collins said the decision of what to do with
Vaughn was strictly out if his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to the medical staff, Mo and (general manager) Billy
(Bavasi), he said. ``However they feel. If (Mo) thinks it's going
to be that long ...
</P>
<P>
   Angels medical director Dr. Lewis Yocum said the fact that the
injury is a high ankle sprain makes the injury more serious than a
lower ankle sprain and presents the possibility of Vaughn being out
beyond the 15 days.
</P>
<P>
   Yocum added he doesn't believe Vaughn will show bravado and try
to come back before he's ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, he's movitated (to follow doctors' advice), Yocum
said. ``There has been a little improvement each day, but there's
no reason to push it. It's not a matter of playing with pain -- he
cannot move around on it.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's trip to the disabled list wasn't the only bad news for
the Angels Thursday. Starting pitcher Steve Sparks (0-1) looked
nothing like the pitcher he was in spring training, getting knocked
around by the Indians for six runs and seven hits in four innings
before the rain came.
</P>
<P>
   The game was halted with Darin Erstad at the plate in the bottom
of the fourth inning and the Indians leading, 6-0. After a one hour
and 43-minute delay, the game resumed but it didn't get any better
the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Indians starter Bartolo Colon (1-0), who had allowed only one
hit in three innings before the delay, picked up where he left off,
striking out Erstad and then Tim Salmon when the game resumed. He
went six innings, allowing one run and two hits, the run coming on
Troy Glaus' first home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   For the second night in a row, the Angels offense was weak.
They've had only four hits in each of their last two games. Going
back to the third inning of Wednesday's game, Angels hitters have
five hits in their last 51 at-bats.

DODGERS LOSE TO ROCKIES
</HEADLINE>
 QUOTES-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rain, the wind and the seemingly imminent threat of snow
gave Dodger Stadium that Coors Field, early April kind of feel. The
1 hour, 25-minute rain delay before the first pitch didn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   But the five hits the Dodgers managed clarified this is not Mile
High air, and also made it clear the Colorado Rockies can pitch, at
least on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Rockies left-hander Brian Bohanon baffled his old 'mates for
seven innings and Todd Helton hit a three-run homer as Colorado
handed the Dodgers a 4-2 loss Thursday in the opener of a four-game
series.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Dodgers fail in their bid to start 4-0 for the
first time since 1981, but they lost left fielder Gary Sheffield
after he flied out to end the fifth inning. He left with what was
termed as muscle stiffness in his right hip.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of aching and swelling going on in there,'' Sheffield
said. ``I got loose as usual, but the spasms just started again.
When I got on the on-deck circle (in the fifth) I felt it again.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the gambles the Dodgers made on the final day of roster
cuts was carrying four outfielders and three catchers. It left
Jacob Brumfield, who replaced Sheffield in left, Devon White and
Raul Mondesi as the three remaining outfielders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine he'll probably need a day or two off,'' Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon (1-0) was effectively wild, allowing three hits, walking
five and striking out four. The only run he allowed was when he
walked Eric Karros with the bases loaded in the third inning. But
that was sandwiched by Raul Mondesi striking out and Mark
Grudzielanek lining out to first.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the only Dodger to get past second base was Dave
Hansen, who had a pinch-hit homer off reliever Dave Veres with two
outs in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the right guys up at the right time and we couldn't get
diddly,'' Johnson said. ``Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies experienced the same thing against Dodgers
left-hander Carlos Perez for the first six innings. Until then,
Rockies had one hit, a second-inning single by Vinny Castilla, and
Perez answered that by retiring the next 13 batters.
</P>
<P>
   That changed in the seventh, and quickly. Dante Bichette doubled
into the left-field corner with two out to score Neifi Perez and
tie the game 1-1. Perez then intentionally walked Castilla to face
the lefty hitting Todd Helton, last year's runner-up in the
National League Rookie of the Year race.
</P>
<P>
   On a cold night in which the baseball wasn't carrying well,
Helton hit a shot to right-center field for a three-run homer.
Helton's first homer of the season and third hit in 16 at-bats gave
the Rockies a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good pitch, a slider away,'' said Helton, who hit 25
homers last season. ``I didn't think it was gone, not when I hit
it. I haven't hit one in so long I forgot what it felt like.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then it looked like Perez was heading for the Dodgers'
first complete game of the season. Perez was so good that no
Rockies player got past first base until the seventh inning. He had
thrown less than 60 pitches through six innings.
</P>
<P>
   That was rendered meaningless by the slider to Helton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the only bad pitch he made,'' Dodgers catcher Paul
LoDuca said. ``It was just one bad pitch, and until then he was
sailing. If (Helton) pops it up, Carlos is out of the inning.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was delayed 1 hour, 25 minutes by a rain shower that
hit just as the first pitch was ready to be thrown. Perez was
warming up on the mound when the rain came.
</P>
<P>
   That the Dodgers were able to play is significant, mostly to the
organization. It prides itself on an 11-year streak without having
a game rained out, though that was tested last season when the
Dodgers and Phillies waited out a pair of rain delays totaling 2
hours, 31 minutes last May 12.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have avoided the poor weather all week in the Los
Angeles area, and have pushed their streak to 853 games without
being washed out at home. The last time the Dodgers were rained out
at Dodger Stadium was April 21, 1988, the third of three straight
washouts against the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   In the 38-year history of Chavez Ravine, the Dodgers have been
rained out 15 times. &UR; !dlim!!end! &QL;

VIETNAM-STYLE MESS UNLIKELY IN NATO GROUND WAR, EXPERTS SAY  
   
  
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK VIVIANO  
 c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
PARIS _ In Europe, no less than America, the debate over Kosovo is
increasingly focused on a single issue: the dangers of a ground
war.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Balkan re-enactment of Vietnam lies ahead, warn some, with
American and Allied troops bogged down in a protracted conflict for
years. Others predict a bloody guerrilla campaign, fought by the
grandchildren of Serbian Partisans under Marshal Josip Broz Tito,
whose hit-and-run tactics defeated an immense German Army in World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the reality is that ground intervention is not only all but
inevitable _ it's already under way, with rising public support on
both sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether NATO faces a new Vietnam or Partisan war
on the ground in Kosovo _ or a paper tiger on the model of Iraq's
Republican Guard, which was crushed in five days during the Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, Kosovo is neither Vietnam, nor the Yugoslavia in
which Marshall Tito defeated the Germans. Its geography and
demographics are not suited to a lengthy guerrilla war against
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The irregular units that were the backbone of the Viet Cong and
Tito's Partisans operated in dense jungle or mountainous terrain,
where the far more technologically sophisticated U.S. military and
Wehrmacht were at a profound disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Partisan campaign, which diverted vital Nazi resources away
from the Soviet front and Atlantic coast in the months before
D-Day, has become a legendary episode, recounted often by Yugoslavs
as an implicit warning against foreign intervention. It was the
basis of Tito's later power as president of Yugoslavia, which he
ruled until his death in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the war in 1943-44, 110,000 Partisans held off
19 Nazi divisions, in addition to 160,000 Bulgarian, Serb and Croat
collaborators _ over 360,000 men in all, according to General
Fitzroy Maclean, the chief British liaison officer in Yugoslavia
then.
</P>
<P>
   But as Maclean notes, the Partisans' activities were
concentrated almost entirely in the precipitous highlands of
Montenegro and Bosnia, with very few incursions into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the province is a gently rolling plain, with few
sanctuaries outside of the mountainous borders with Albania and
western Macedonia, which are effectively under the control of
unfriendly neighbors or NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more importantly, the Serbs lack a friendly countryside
in Kosovo to support their morale and supply lines, factors that
gave a crucial political and psychological edge to the Viet Cong
and the Partisans.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo was more than 90 percent Albanian when ethnic cleansing
began in earnest last year. Since then, an estimated 900,000 of the
1.8 million Albanian Kosovars have fled. But so too, according to
Belgrade, have 50,000 of Kosovo's 100,000 Serbs, leaving the
province overwhelmingly hostile to the Yugoslav army.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, defense analysts say, the Yugoslav National Army is
itself a deeply conventional military force, built around
mechanized divisions that dominated early stages of the war in
Croatia and Bosnia with classic ground tactics against outnumbered
and outgunned opponents. That makes it highly vulnerable to the
technological superiority of the Western alliance.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, say American and European officers, a revolution has
occurred in NATO's battlefield command-and-control infrastructure
over the past decade, while Yugoslavia's military equipment has
largely remained frozen in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known aspect of this gap is in the air, where NATO has
been virtually unchallenged since the earliest days of the assault.
But on the ground, too, Western officers told The Chronicle,
Yugoslav Army tanks and armored cars will encounter radically new
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can track every single vehicle on a battlefield by
satellite, and we have personnel detection devices that accomplish
the same task,'' said Lieutenant Colonel John Angell, chief
operations officer at a NATO training program in Germany geared to
military intervention in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, from a command post, we'd only know if one of our own
tanks had been hit. Today, we know from which direction, with what
weapon, and how. We know exactly what's happening in a battle, as
opposed to what people think is happening. It's a quantum leap.''
</P>
<P>
   Against this background, escalation has steadily mounted toward
de facto ground intervention. The escalation took overt form
Wednesday, with daylight assaults on a Serbian armored column in
Kosovo by U.S. A-10 Warthogs and British Harriers, aircraft that
are usually attached to ground campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The commitment will deepen considerably by the end of the week,
with the arrival of Apache AH-64D Longbow assault helicopters,
which hover so close to the ground that Iraqi infantrymen were
known to surrender to them during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The Warthogs and Apaches are designed to work together in
Advanced Joint Air Attacks operations, backing up an infantry
advance. During the Gulf War, according to NATO sources, such
sorties accounted for 1,200 of the 1,700 Iraqi tanks destroyed in
the Allied invasion, and 1,000 of 1,200 artillery pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The top-rated of Yugoslavia's 1,300 tanks, about 300 of which
are believed to be in Kosovo, is the M-84, built to the same design
as the Soviet T/72 that fared so poorly for Iraq against Operation
Desert Storm.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon confirmed Thursday that Hunter unmanned
reconnaissance planes are in action over Kosovo. The Hunter's
normal purpose is to provide video images of a battlefield prior to
a land operation.
</P>
<P>
   More discreetly, NATO now has commando teams in place behind the
lines, report sources close to the French Ministry of Defence.
``They are there to direct air strikes, and to prepare for the
deployment of troops,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly but relentlessly, NATO ground strength in the region has
also been rising _ it stands at just below 70,000 troops and
support personnel _ and changing in character, from peacekeeping
forces to offensive engagement.
</P>
<P>
   The number of U.S. troops presently involved in the operation
has grown to 22,500, including Marine detachments that have been
shipped to the Adriatic Sea for possible action. About 2,600 Army
personnel will accompany the Apache helicopter units to Albania by
week's end, and nearly 10,000 U.S. soldiers are less than 200 miles
away in Bosnia, along with 20,000 troops from other NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon says that Abrams tanks and Bradley Fighting
Vehicles will be transported to the Albanian-Kosovo border region
by mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch forces in Macedonia have been reinforced in the past two
days by artillery units, according to the Netherlands Ministry of
Defence. Altogether, there are now 12,000 NATO troops just across
Kosovo's southern border in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 6,200 French troops in Bosnia and Macedonia, say
government sources, are elements of the Commandement des Operations
Speciales (COS), an elite commando force used in raids behind enemy
lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav Army has 75,000 troops _ 40,000 of whom are
currently in Kosovo _ backed up nationally by 75,000 Interior
Ministry police and 150,000 reservists with varying degrees of
battle-readiness.
</P>
<P>
   On the diplomatic front, NATO's shift to a more aggressive
military stance has been paralleled by what many observers regard
as a new and more open-ended version of its aims in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Across Europe, newspapers and parliamentary exchanges this week
have repeatedly cited an apparent change in Washington's definition
of the ``permissive environment'' necessary for U.S. troops to
advance into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   During the failed Kosovo negotiations at Rambouillet, France,
the phrase was understood to mean an explicit invitation from
Belgrade to serve on a peacekeeping mission in the province. But
Sunday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright declared that ``there
are other ways of creating this environment,'' which many Europeans
interpret as an armed expulsion of the Serbian military followed by
an invitation from the Kosovars themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday in Brussels, NATO Secretary General Javier Solano
emphasized that the organization's objectives include ``the
deployment of an international security force (within Kosovo),''
and ``the retreat of Serb armed forces, police and paramilitary
forces.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the center-left politicians who govern most
European Union nations have rallied around a proposal to enforce a
security zone covering all of Kosovo, in which NATO would provide
military protection on the ground for the return of refugees to the
province. The idea was first broached on Monday by Socialist deputy
Paul Quilles, president of France's national Defence Commission.
</P>
<P>
   As in Germany, the leaders of France's historically anti-war
Green Party have strongly argued in favor of ground intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Political anxiety, rather than military weakness, has kept most
NATO leaders short of unambiguously endorsing escalation _ the fear
that their own citizens would rebel against a decision to send
troops into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But there is mounting evidence, in North America and Europe
alike, that the grisly images of Kosovo's ethnic cleansing and
terrified refugees are steeling Western voters' resolve.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a Newsweek survey found that 54 percent of Americans
now support ground intervention. Less than one-third of respondents
to a New York Times/CBS poll published Thursday said they thought
bombing alone would end ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. If air strikes
do not work, according to an NBC/ Wall Street Journal survey also
published Thursday, 73 percent of Americans are in favor of ground
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   In an opinion poll in the Sunday Times of London, Britons
supported ground action against Yugoslav troops by 66 percent to 27
percent. Germans, who have been Europe's leading pacifists since
the end of World War Two, backed a Bundeswehr's role in the NATO
operation by 62 percent to 31 percent in a March 26 poll.
</P>
<P>
   Over seven consecutive opinion polls in France, an average of 55
percent of the public has steadfastly backed NATO operations.
</P>
<P>
   As almost all observers add, however, public support might
quickly dwindle if serious Western casualties were sustained.
</P>
<P>
   An unpredictable factor in this picture is the emotional power
of Serbian nationalism, and its historic obsession with Kosovo,
site of the 14th century defeat at Turkish hands that utterly
destroyed the medieval Kingdom of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Six hundred years later, would Serbs take the suicidal risks
necessary to stop a NATO invasion?
</P>
<P>
   In a poll conducted by Nin, a Belgrade weekly, 65 percent of
respondents said they would ``defend Kosovo at any price.'' Nearly
15 percent said the only solution to the crisis was to ``chase the
Albanians out of Kosovo'' or to ``liquidate'' them.
</P>
<P>
   Zeljko Raznjatovic, the Serb militia commander known as
``Arkan'' _ whose men were responsible for dozens of civilian
massacres in Croatia and Bosnia _ promises that the price of an
invasion will be high. ``We have a big heart to defend our
country,'' he said in a telephone interview with MSNBC, ``and
that's why I'm telling you, when you come here with ground troops,
we will make a hell out of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent history in Bosnia says otherwise. Serb nationalist
resistence there, both from regular army units and from
paramilitary groups like Arkan's ``Tigers,'' crumbled immediately
when 60,000 NATO-led combat troops were deployed to end the war.
Since then, the peacekeeping force has been cut by half without
hostilities resuming.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that this would not necessitate the deployment
of land forces in numbers as considerable as as those that are
cited here and there,'' said former French Defence Minister
Francois Leotard, alluding to the proposal to enforce a security
zone in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the number of NATO troops required to seize and
hold Kosovo have ranged from 100,000 to 300,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall that in Bosnia, in a vaster territory, 30,000 men are
at the moment enough to enforce the Dayton accords and the
co-existence of different communities so long at open war with each
other,'' Leotard wrote in Le Monde on Tuesday.

   PRISTINA _ If there are lies, damned lies and statistics, the
Kosovo war has now moved into damned lies.
</P>
<P>
   Just a week ago, we had the Serbs claiming that the Albanians _
far from being ``ethnically cleansed' _ were setting fire to their
own homes. Now we have NATO claiming that the Serbs of Pristina _
far from being bombed by NATO _ were blowing up their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of this empty, silent city, you might be forgiven
for thinking that the world had gone mad.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs are spending much of their time insisting that the
tens of thousands of Albanians who have palpably disappeared from
the capital of Kosovo are merely hiding from NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
   In which case, why is every house empty, every Albanian street
deserted, every Albanian shop smashed and plundered and daubed with
Serb graffiti?
</P>
<P>
   Why did the fearful group of non-Serb refugees we saw at the
disused railway tracks shamble in exhaustion and fear through the
city, a mass of filthy clothes and old sacks and haggard faces, a
live reenactment of ``Schindler's List?''
</P>
<P>
   Why did lights still burn in broken homes and front doors bang
in the wind and why were the contents of the Albanian chemist's
shop strewn over the pavement on the edge of town?
</P>
<P>
   Then we have NATO's brutal air raid on Tuesday night and
Wednesday morning. It killed at least ten civilians, destroyed the
post office, the largest bank in town and a whole row of civilian
homes.
</P>
<P>
   One bomb crater had totally erased a single-story house. At
least two craters were thirty feet deep and the bomb that hit the
post office had brought part of the building crashing to the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   When I talked to Serbs who live in the center of Pristina _
alone and in many cases almost too angry to speak to a citizen of a
NATO country. They all gave detailed descriptions of the night of
air raids.
</P>
<P>
   When Valentina Jovanic came to the door of her house in
Pristina, she was still in a state of shock, drawing heavily on a
cigarette, her fingers shaking, as frightened of her own voice as
she was angry to find an Englishman outside her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bombed first at 11 o'clock. Then they came back at 1
o'clock. Then again at 3 o'clock this morning. They bombed and
bombed and bombed. Why?''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, Air Commodore David Wilby told a NATO
briefing that in Pristina ``NATO has certainly not caused the
widespread and random damage, which we believe has been caused by
Serb forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Now while it is true that _ at the start of its air bombardment
_ NATO attacked exclusively military targets, the American-European
alliance is now hitting civilians.
</P>
<P>
   And I believe that Valentina Jovanovic was telling me the truth
in Pristina. I do not believe Air Commodore Wilby was telling us
the truth in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Only aerial bombing could have pulverized the center of the city
in so shocking a way. Only missiles or air-fired ordnance could
have gouged such craters into the ruins.
</P>
<P>
   No Serb _ however devious _ could have created this disgraceful
scene in just a few hours, priming the entire Serb population of
the area to tell every journalist an identical story.
</P>
<P>
   Either NATO made a terrible mistake in Pristina or, egged on
perhaps by its Kosovo Liberation Army guerrilla allies, it
committed a terrible deed.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the Serbs _ who brought journalists to Kosovo to see
the ruins but allowed them to walk unaccompanied through this part
of the town _ were so willing to have this shameful scene filmed.
</P>
<P>
   If ever the Serbs needed to find a reason for the Albanian
exodus _ other than the real reason which was no doubt murder and
intimidation and dispossession _ NATO has now provided them with
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loyal Albanians stayed _ only the disloyal left,'' a
middle-aged man explained on the Corso near the Grand Hotel in
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   A likely story. Who, in heaven's name, are the loyal Albanians?
</P>
<P>
   The old man I found with a battered typewriter and a bag of
dirty clothes hobbling past the post office, mumbling his desire to
go to Skopje?
</P>
<P>
   The ghostly occupants of all those burned homes east of
Pristina?
</P>
<P>
   The phantom Albanians who, according to Serb city officials,
will have to wait a few days to collect their pensions now that
NATO had destroyed a local welfare office?
</P>
<P>
   What Albanian would ever choose to return here now? &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>

   &UR; (325-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 775) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the way to Pristina, amid the fields of vines and cherry
trees and the blossom-smothered farmyards, the Serb tanks were hard
to see. It took me all of five seconds to spot a T-72 in a farm
scarcely twenty feet from me, so well had the hay and branches been
piled around the tracks and hull. Only the end of the gun barrel
glinting in the late afternoon sun gave the game away.
</P>
<P>
   In one small village, the Yugoslav army had parked its trucks
beside cottages, on lawns, alongside barns, within the first trees
of a great forest. Every house has its tank, I thought.
</P>
<P>
   And I doubted very much if the NATO pilots were going to winkle
this lot out. In one great valley, it was only when I was
travelling beside a river that I saw the antiaircraft guns dug in
beside the banks, barrels on a flat trajectory, camouflage netting
pulled over ammunition bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   This was not an army that was ready to die. Yet by the time we
reached Pristina, there was little to hide.
</P>
<P>
   We overtook two T-72 tanks thrashing down the highway in clouds
of brown dust past burned-out homes and shops, their crews _ each
with his head encased in that Russian-style rubber helmet so
familiar from every Soviet war film _ giving us the three-fingered
Serb victory sign.
</P>
<P>
   Truck and jeeps and armored vehicles hummed along the highway.
The troops waved and shouted and, at one hillside bar where a
platoon sat in the late afternoon drinking, a soldier pulled the
opener on a beer can and sprayed the contents in a circle against
the sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   We have won, the message meant. We have conquered. Kosovo is
ours.
</P>
<P>
   But is it? Every night, the local Serbs told us, the KLA came
back. Every night there was shooting. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over all of this scene of frightening desolation _ the very
emptiness a terrible witness to the suffering of the Albanians _
hung thick clouds of black smoke.
</P>
<P>
   NATO had totally destroyed the oil plant outside Pristina. When
I passed it, the 40-foot flames were so bright they hurt my eyes. A
direct hit. Like the NATO bombs that hit the very center of
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb version of a direct hit _ and the exodus of Pristina's
Albanian population is just that _ is awesome and wicked. And NATO
has _ so far _ killed only a fraction of the civilians whom the
Serbs have mowed down.
</P>
<P>
   But it is now increasing its cull; the bombing of civilian homes
at Aleksinac has now cost seven lives, Pristina's toll may reach 12
if two of the seriously wounded die.
</P>
<P>
   As the very same Air Commodore Wilby intoned a few days ago,
``this is not a game of cricket.'' All too true _ because there are
fewer rules every day. &QL;

with his head encased in that Russian-style rubber helmet so
familiar from every Soviet war film _ giving us the three-fingered
Serb victory sign.
</P>
<P>
   Truck and jeeps and armored vehicles hummed along the highway.
The troops waved and shouted and, at one hillside bar where a
platoon sat in the late afternoon drinking, a soldier pulled the
opener on a beer can and sprayed the contents in a circle against
the sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   We have won, the message meant. We have conquered. Kosovo is
ours.
</P>
<P>
   But is it? Every night, the local Serbs told us, the KLA came
back. Every night there was shooting. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over all of this scene of frightening desolation _ the very
emptiness a terrible witness to the suffering of the Albanians _
hung thick clouds of black smoke.
</P>
<P>
   NATO had totally destroyed the oil plant outside Pristina. When
I passed it, the 40-foot flames were so bright they hurt my eyes. A
direct hit. Like the NATO bombs that hit the very center of
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb version of a direct hit _ and the exodus of Pristina's
Albanian population is just that _ is awesome and wicked. And NATO
has _ so far _ killed only a fraction of the civilians whom the
Serbs have mowed down.
</P>
<P>
   But it is now increasing its cull; the bombing of civilian homes
at Aleksinac has now cost seven lives, Pristina's toll may reach 12
if two of the seriously wounded die.
</P>
<P>
   As the very same Air Commodore Wilby intoned a few days ago,
``this is not a game of cricket.'' All too true _ because there are
fewer rules every day. &QL;

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Ariel Sharon, the Israeli foreign minister, has a
unique view of the threat in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   It is not of a triumphant Serbia expelling Kosovars. It is that
the present crisis will end with an independent Kosovo becoming
part of a greater Albania and ``a focus for extremist Islamic
terror that will spread in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite how the stumbling columns of Kosovan refugees will become
a threat to anybody he does not explain. But Sharon's belief,
expressed with increasing vigor over the last two weeks to the
amazement of the U.S. and the embarrassment of his own government,
is that ``a big bloc of Islamic states'' may be established in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The office of Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, says the
foreign minister was ``expressing his private views only.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel is to take in 100 Kosovan refugees, has sent a 100-bed
field hospital to Macedonia and the army radio was last night
holding an open-air rally in Tel Aviv to collect money for the
victims of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be enough to calm American irritation and will
further cool relations between Israel and Washington, already
frigid because of Israel's non-implementation of the U.S.-brokered
accords with the Palestinians signed last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon may have a chance to find this out for himself when he
meets Madeleine Albright, the U.S. secretary of state, later today
(Friday).
</P>
<P>
   There are obvious reasons for Israel's lukewarm support for the
NATO action. There is historic sympathy for the Serbs because of
their role in the Second World War, a sense that Israel is well out
of taking sides in age-old Balkan conflicts and a fear that one day
foreign intervention against sovereign states might be directed
against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon's policies, though often maverick, are often
strategically astute. In this case his motive is probably a wish to
cultivate Russia, whose foreign minister is to visit next week for
the third time in a month.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Israeli radio he said: ``It's important to
look forward and see that Russia is coming back to the Middle
East.''
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, Israel wants Russia to stop helping Iran to
build missiles and to keep open communications between the large
Jewish community remaining in Russia and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   If Yevgeny Primakov, the Russian prime minister, offered to
scale down the transfer of missile technology to Iran it would be a
major boost to Netanyahu just before the Israeli election on May
17.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has already expressed ``satisfaction'' at Sharon's
reservations over NATO action. It wants a relaxation of pressure
from Jewish lobbying groups on the U.S. Congress to force the
administration to impose sanctions on Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu confirms that he has already sent a message to the
U.S. asking it to suspend for six months plans to increase
sanctions on Russia. It is a delicate balancing act for, as the
daily newspaper Ha'aretz points out: ``If Russia gets the
impression that Israel has lost its influence with the U.S., Russia
could turn its back on Israel.'' &QL;

   DHAKA _ The Indian subcontinent offers some important lessons
for Yugoslavia. It is a pity that India, with almost characteristic
hypocrisy, has been so quick to criticize the NATO action as
interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
   The Delhi statement sounded odd here recently when Bangladesh
was celebrating the anniversary of its independence. The final
success of Bangladesh's war of liberation from Pakistan, achieved
in December 1971, was due to India's massive and direct military
intervention in support of the secessionist movement.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of Bangladesh _ now the world's eighth most
populous nation _ was by far the largest incidence since 1945 of
one state participating with military force in the dismemberment of
another. It created a precedent that is worth examining.
</P>
<P>
   India's motives in 1971 were certainly not entirely idealistic.
It had every interest in the dismemberment of its main enemy,
Pakistan, and the creation on India's eastern border of a state
that was weak and in India's debt.
</P>
<P>
   But mixed motives did not detract from the legitimacy of Indian
intervention in support of a liberation movement that had
overwhelming popular support.
</P>
<P>
   The liberation struggle was fought against a Pakistani military
not noted for adherence to human rights _ though better behaved
than the forces of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, there were numerous warnings _ including from Prime
Minister Chou En-lai of China _ that the establishment of
Bangladesh would set an appalling precedent for the unity of India
itself as well as for the territorial integrity of many newly
independent states in Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But in international opinion, the justice of the Bangladeshi
cause was a stronger force and contributed to Pakistan's eventual
admission of defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Bangladesh was the first, and is still by far the most
important, post-1945 case of recognizing that not all the borders
and sovereign states created at the end of empires were immutable.
</P>
<P>
   Further adjustments to the states created by European empires in
Asia and Africa, as well as by the successors to the Ottoman and
Hapsburg empires in Europe, were likely.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia was a well-intentioned construct intended to bring an
identity to a part of the post-Ottoman/Hapsburg world just as a
two-winged Pakistan was an attempt to resolve some of the
contradictions arising from the end of British India. Neither
worked.
</P>
<P>
   The necessary readjustments may be painful but they do become
the least bad options. Indonesia has learned that lesson in East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The other lesson of Bangladesh that may be relevant in Kosovo is
the staying power of well-defined communities. Bangladesh has
established itself as a viable state with a strong identity and no
likelihood of breaking up or being invaded.
</P>
<P>
   Poor it remains, and not well-governed. But from wretched
beginnings it has made much more progress than Pakistan in areas
from agriculture to education, women's rights and family planning.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this must be attributable to having the most homogeneous
population in South Asia _ indeed in all of Asia outside Japan and
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the relative success of Bangladesh has had no
visible negative impact on India, which faces no secessionist
problems other than the endless sore of Kashmir, an issue which
long predates 1971.
</P>
<P>
   India shows how heterogeneous societies can work given political
commitment to religious and linguistic pluralism _ long lacking in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   As Mr. Milosevic has no interest in Indian-style pluralism, the
principles that India applied in Bangladesh in 1971 should be
applied by NATO in Kosovo. &QL;

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Young man, think before you turn
your thoughts
 &HT;    Lesson of love on a train to Milan
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (ital)''In the spring, a young man's fancy lightly turns to
thoughts of love.'' _ Tennyson. (endital)
</P>
<P>
   Better, boys, that you should concentrate on baseball.
</P>
<P>
   But if you persist, there are some things you need to know about
women.
</P>
<P>
   Though I'm pretty well past the point of participation _ there's
not much spring in my step regardless of the season _ I received a
refresher course last fall, gratis of a beautiful young woman who
makes her home where once lived the world's most famous princess.
</P>
<P>
   This was in Monte Carlo, whose people still revere the late
Princess Grace as someone like unto a saint.
</P>
<P>
   This, too, was where Kathleen, the young woman I met boarding a
train to Milan, was living her own fairy tale.
</P>
<P>
   She was tall and willowy, with blondish brown hair, blue eyes
and lovely features. Her accent was Swedish. Close your eyes and
you would think hers was the voice of Greta Garbo.
</P>
<P>
   She had become a model at age 16 and toured much of the world _
Europe, America and Asia _ with the fashion runway as her stage. It
was at a show in Monte Carlo that her husband-to-be, whose family
has substantial real estate investments in Monaco, saw her for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   When I met her she was just 25, a woman who knew the world and
what it had to offer, and had chosen well. She had chosen a
Frenchman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something special about Frenchmen,'' she explained in
her lovely accent. ``They are very, very gentlemen, and very
romantic.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Englishmen, I asked?
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Russians?
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Germans?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hah!''
</P>
<P>
   That had pretty well narrowed it down.
</P>
<P>
   How about American men?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Americans do not know how to treat a lady,'' she said.
Then she shrugged, in way of a apology, ``I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Me, too, I told her.
</P>
<P>
   So, what does the Frenchman have over most everyone else?
</P>
<P>
   ``You smoke a cigarette, and you get the light,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For a fact, she'd been smoking one cigarette after another on
the train. Silly me for not flicking my Bic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always open the door for you. You always go in before
them. They pull back the chair for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next day you receive flowers, and they always call. Small
things, perhaps, but very important for a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Small gifts as well?
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, but it doesn't have to be expensive. It is the
...'' She paused, looking for the word.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought,'' I suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes! It is the thought that counts.''
</P>
<P>
   And she told this story:
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of mine, she was very sad one day because her
boyfriend was out of town. When he phoned her long distance she
told her how lonely she was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immediately after they hanged up, he called a shop in her city
and had them send her their biggest stuffed animal and with the
note, 'To keep you company until I return.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Kathleen said, ``it was the thought that counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is to say, fellows, all a woman expects of you, now and
forever, is that you treat her like a princess.
</P>
<P>
   (ital)'' ... that is all ye know on earth, and all ye need to
know.'' _ Keats. (endital)
</P>
<P>
   Class dismissed. Baseball anybody?
</P>
<P>
   Anybody?
</P>

 &HT;    Palm Beach: An island of white dogs, cell phones
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ There are two requirements for living in Palm
Beach, besides the obvious one of having more money than God: a
little white dog and a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   I'm here on company business, staying in a hotel where one of
the Kennedy heirs died of a drug overdose in the 1980s. I've seen
Donald Trump's estate from afar. It's of course ridiculously big.
Driving a vehicle that costs less than a four-year education at the
University of Texas is apparently against the law here. A Mercedes
is the equivalent here of a Ford Taurus in the real world. The
Mobil station around the corner had four Rolls Royces in the
parking lot and no self-service gasoline. Every time I walked
around, I imagined the police were slowing down to scrutinize me,
someone who obviously doesn't belong here.
</P>
<P>
   I'm way out of my league here.
</P>
<P>
   Normal people live in West Palm Beach, across the bay, a typical
sprawling Florida city. West Palm is a melting pot of Yankees,
Cubans, Jamaicans and blacks _ my kind of place. Palm Beach, the
island, is tiny, about 10,000 residents, and by my guess 9,980 of
them are white.
</P>
<P>
   The police station even looks like a luxury hotel. There's not a
7-11 in sight.
</P>
<P>
   And the little white dogs are everywhere, mostly on leashes,
pulling old people along, yapping incessantly. I sat out by the
pool the first day there and watched as a little white dog on a
expandable leash tried to take a chunk out of a housekeeper who
ventured too close. The owner came out and glared at the maid as if
it was her fault. I glared at the owner.
</P>
<P>
   Later, I took a stroll down Worth Avenue, which is billed as
Florida's version of Beverly Hills' Rodeo Drive. I didn't bother to
go inside the stores _ Gucci, Ralph Lauren, Ferragmo, et al. _
since simply window shopping told me I had no business even
browsing. It was fairly early and many of the shops weren't open
yet. In about half of the shops still closed, a little white dog
stood at the door, yapping incessantly at the sight-seers and the
other little white dogs out for a morning stroll.
</P>
<P>
   The accent here is New York, by and large. I ate a patty melt at
a place called Hamburger Heaven, which is presumably where Palm
Beachites go when they're slumming (there are no franchises on the
island that I saw). I sat at the counter and listened to old people
with leathery tan skin talk with accents that made them sound like
Bronx cabdrivers. I thought to myself that this has got to be a
great place to be a dermatologist or a skin cancer specialist. I
paid $11 for a patty melt, fries and an iced tea, which is about
four bucks too much.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the cell phones. Yeech. While out at the pool, I
watched a 60-ish man wearing a way-too-tight Speedo and sporting a
forest of white chest hair, yap nonstop on a cell phone, making
deals right and left while sipping Perrier. To his credit, he did
not have a little white dog with him. Still, he annoyed me.
</P>
<P>
   I sat out there for about three hours, reading
``Cloudsplitter,'' a historical novel about radical abolitionist
John Brown. Three uninterrupted hours spent wearing shorts and
reading by a pool in March qualifies as heaven in my book. The man
never quit yapping on the cell phone. He would wander about,
sometimes dangerously close to me, ogling the women sunning
themselves. Admittedly, I was ogling the women too, being of the
male species, but I had neither a cell phone nor a white dog, so I
was harmless.
</P>
<P>
   I probably could have made a bundle just following his wheels
and deals, but all my money at present is invested in children
attending the University of Texas. I fantasized about pimp slapping
him, tossing his phone into the pool and screaming, ``You're on
vacation, bubba! Get off the danged phone! You have made enough
money for one day!''
</P>
<P>
   But I didn't. The police here are just itching to bust some
yokel who roughs up one of the nouveau riche, and I wasn't about to
give them the satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   The beach is beautiful at night, illuminated by floodlights
stationed on the high-rise condos, so that they catch the tips of
the waves and create artificial moonlight. I'm not making this up.
I'm reasonably sure there is an Artificial Light Wave Committee in
Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the boats. I love the idea of boats, their
sleekness and beauty, but in truth I get sick as a dog on boats.
There are many boats here, most guarded fiercely by little white
dogs and captained by people who made their money in mysterious
ways. I would love to know how they made their money, but likely it
would depress me. Luckily, that night I was able to head across the
bridge to West Palm and find some basic Cuban food _ skirt steak
covered with onions, accompanied by black beans and rice, washed
down with some sangria wine, and with a side of plaintains.
</P>
<P>
   You have to know your limits.

 &HT;    We need to get better at naming computer viruses
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ I wonder who is in charge of naming the new
computer viruses? They must work for the Bureau of Names, you know,
that place where they put titles on military campaigns, decide what
to call hurricanes every year and make up the official names for
bills so that no one will know what the bill is really about.
</P>
<P>
   I say this because two new virus doozies have just been
announced in the last couple of weeks. First came Melissa, then
came Papa.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa? Papa?
</P>
<P>
   If I didn't know better, the person who came up with Melissa was
an aging hippie who had had too much acid in his early years and
couldn't get the Allman Brothers song by the same name out of his
head. Except I do know better. People who deal in computers aren't
aging anythings, they are all kids. The truth, as we later found
out, is that Melissa was apparently named for a topless dancer,
which would have been all right if topless dancers still went by
names like ``Modesty'' or ``Fanny.''
</P>
<P>
   Papa seems a little more understandable, but it still isn't
descriptive. You can't read the name of the virus and have any idea
what it will do to your computer.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if viruses worked like life, I know what the Papa
virus would do: Exactly what the Mama virus told it to do. Find the
computer code equivalent of a recliner and you have the Papa virus
whipped.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you wonder what the Mama virus would do. That's simple.
Any darn thing it wants to.
</P>
<P>
   We would do a lot better if we used names that were
characteristic of what the virus really did. Here are my ideas for
some viruses we might see in the future (or that are already here,
perhaps?) and what to name them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bush virus: Causes you to be unable to tell whether your
computer will run or not. You must wait until the end of May to be
absolutely sure.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gore virus: Computer keeps going into sleep mode. Appears to
have originated in a Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
   _ GOP virus: Computer starts out running better than you can
believe, followed by a sudden, severe crash. Happens over and over.
Does not appear as if this can be fixed; just get a new computer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moral Majority virus: Affects computer's sound system. After
typing every word, computer repeats the sound, ``tsk, tsk, tsk.''
Costs considerable amount of money to repair as technician keeps
sending you bills saying he needs the money to keep the computer,
``on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Bill Gates virus: Every computer in the world is already
infected and there is nothing you, the federal government, or
anyone else can do about it. So there.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tyson virus: Uses more than expected number of bytes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pat Buchanan/Jesse Jackson viruses: Both have the same
characteristics. Computer runs once every four years, but nothing
ever really happens except that a lot of noise is generated.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jerry Springer virus: Makes your computer get very, very dumb.
</P>
<P>
   _ NATO virus: Message appears on screen that demands you allow
neighbor to use your computer whenever he wants or computer will
explode.
</P>
<P>
   _ Milosevic/Saddam virus: Extremely dangerous virus which can
move from machine to machine without any direct connection.
Computer will need to be destroyed as there is no fix.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It is Opening Day in Cincinnati, a perfect spring
afternoon, replete with the mingled smells of hot dogs and popcorn,
the aesthetically satisfying contrast between the sea of red and
white shirts and the lurid green of the AstroTurf.
</P>
<P>
   My husband brings Doritos for the kids, instead of the promised
cheese nachos. It is an indignity not to be borne. ``Not those kind
of chips!'' one wails. ``I hate that kind!'' We bite our lips,
forcing ourselves not to say, ``In our day, we would have been
thrilled with sharing a bag of peanuts.'' We wonder why there are
tears instead of smiles.
</P>
<P>
   It happens all the time: When we're supposed to be having fun,
Americans find something to gripe about. In the midst of our
plenty, we focus on what's missing.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, we watched the CNN footage of the Albanian
refugees massed at the Macedonia border, wearing brightly-colored,
beautifully woven jackets and hats, a remnant of the more
prosperous life from which they have recently been torn.
Everywhere, men and women hold onto their children as if they'll
never let go.
</P>
<P>
   It was not to be borne. We turned off the TV and tried to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the images persist, this terrible week: An Albanian man
clutching his golden-haired child at the Petrovic airport. A woman
nursing her baby as she marches into Macedonia. Men fleeing along
railroad tracks to avoid land mines, carrying an elderly woman in
the makeshift rickshaw of a tattered red-checkered blanket.
</P>
<P>
   Now the news that some 25,000 refugees have been turned back,
herded into buses so quickly that some became separated from their
families. The piles of rubble in the modern provincial capital,
Pristina, begin to remind us of Sarajevo. The U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata said there are reports of
abandoned, burned-out cars along major roads in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Before this tragedy, many of the refugees _ in Pristina
particularly _ had attained a decent standard of living. Cars,
computers, the hope of a better life for their children. Not so
different from us.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine being forced out of our homes, no time to pack a
suitcase. Everything we have burned behind us, our families split
up.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine not knowing where your children will sleep tonight, or
whether your government will try to use them as ``human shields.''
Imagine not knowing if you'll be able to protect them from
genocidal soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   We can't imagine it, try as we might. No war has been fought on
our soil since 1865.
</P>
<P>
   So we can afford to lose perspective about what's important. We
can afford to forget how lucky we are.
</P>
<P>
   In Cincinnati on Monday, 55,112 people swarmed out of Cinergy
Field following the Reds' opening day loss. A party atmosphere
prevailed, accompanied by a sultry sax rendition of the ``Addams
Family'' theme song, yet people groused that riverfront
construction forced them to park a dozen blocks from the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, tens of thousands of people _ a virtual human tide _
have embarked on a massive exodus on foot. Relief agencies have
provided shoes to those whose soles have collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   We can push the images out of our minds, but they gnaw at us. We
can no sooner turn away from their suffering than we can comprehend
it _ or than we, never knowing such hardship, can feel the full
measure of gratitude for all that we have.

 &HT;    Australia's a long hop unless you're born to shop
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ This report comes to you from somewhere in
the South Pacific. We are here because my wife, a direct descendant
of Christopher Columbus, and Beverly Mobley, her confederate in
wanderlust, discovered a University of Georgia-sponsored excursion
that's so cheap they practically pay you to go. At least that's
their story, and they're sticking to it.
</P>
<P>
   A trip from Fayetteville to Australia equals approximately 3,152
shopping trips to Lenox Square, a mall in Atlanta. Since wives
travel mainly for the shopping opportunities, I am proposing a tour
that will accomplish the same purpose for a much smaller cost and
far less physical wear and tear.
</P>
<P>
   We will board at Hartsfield Airport after the supper hour, so
that instead of being in a comfortable bed during normal sleeping
hours we will be scrunched three abreast in seats designed for a
kindergarten classroom. After a delay to repair an equipment
malfunction, we will circle between two small Georgia towns until
everybody has swollen feet and a portion of mystery meat and a
small glass of wine has been served.
</P>
<P>
   When everyone begins to doze, we will wake them up and land in
Chattanooga, Tenn., where a bus will be waiting to take wives on a
shopping trip to Lenox Square with a stop at a factory outlet in
Calhoun.
</P>
<P>
   An optional trip to Birmingham, Tenn., will be followed by a
return to Hartsfield, where, to add foreign flavor, everyone will
take cabs to a hotel in Chamblee, a diverse unincorporated area in
DeKalb County. After a bus trip below the gnat line, we will go to
Jacksonville for a return flight to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Australia isn't that simple. From Atlanta to Sydney is 18 1/2
hours flying time. Elderly travelers have been known to develop
fatal blood clots en route. I called Dr. Randy Martin, the renowned
television cardiologist, to inquire if there was anything I could
do to cut my chances of dying somewhere over the Pacific. ``Take an
aspirin and stand on your head at least once every hour,'' he
advised. I asked him if he gave that advice to all his patients.
``Only a favored few,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   My other concern was Bobby Mobley, entrusted into my care by his
long-suffering wife, Beverly. Bobby's normal range is limited to
lunching at Waffle Houses not far away. I was apprehensive about
his behavior when I discovered our tour group included several
couples from Atlanta's elite Northside.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the group was balanced with an equal number of
Southsiders, including the Clacks, Jeannette and Jerry from Lake
Spivey, and Barbara and Jim from Henry County. ``Those boys are
just like us,'' Bobby observed. ``They over-married.''
</P>
<P>
   Once we got circulation back in our lower extremities and our
eyes pried open, Sydney turned out three times as nice as San
Francisco, with great restaurants and a nearly completed Olympic
village that's threatening to make Atlanta look like Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Claude McBride, our tour commander who doubles as
chaplain for the UGA football team, got off the plane in Sydney
wearing his coaching staff shirt. ``My God!'' exclaimed a
bystander. ``You aren't recruiting over here, are you?'' He wasn't,
although considering the trouble we had on short yardage last year
a springy-legged kangaroo at fullback wouldn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of our visit to Melbourne, ahead of a world-famous
botanical garden and historic buildings, was an opal store giving
away earrings, necklaces, rings, etc., at a price no red-blooded
American female could refuse. We saw penguins coming home from the
sea, bringing fish to mates and offspring. Penguins, along with a
handful of surviving Eisenhower-era Republicans, are thought to be
the only monogamous creatures left on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   We landed in Alice Springs, in the middle of the Outback and
100-degree heat, which became nearer 120 at Ayers Rock, which is
inclined to change colors three or four times a day. Alice Springs
is often mistaken for the sun side of the moon, or Yuma, Ariz. Just
the kind of place to ride camels to supper, which we did.
</P>
<P>
   Aborigines, otherwise known as Native Australians, are the
leading tourist attraction in the Outback. Our politically correct
local guide explained their sensible lifestyle. They don't take
baths because of what water does to skin oils and have a lot of
rules worth considering, one being that when a man takes a bride he
can never again speak to, or be in the same room with, her mother.
</P>
<P>
   By the time we headed for the Great Barrier Reef and a cooler
clime, Bobby had turned into a hero by pulling a fat lady from Long
Island to safety when their hot air balloon crashed into a tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think we'll ever get back to Georgia,'' he asked when it
was so hot our plane had to jettison fuel and baggage to get off
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably,'' I assured him. ``Some of the soldiers and sailors
who served down here in World War II survived.''

 &HT;    Public must demand legislature toughen educational standards
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Politicians talk a good game when it comes to
improving public education _ identified as the political hot-button
issue this year.
</P>
<P>
   All that bold talk about the critical need to improve public
education turns to Jell-O when politicians get around to enacting
meaningful reforms.
</P>
<P>
   About as bold as most lawmakers get is to give away public
school funds to private, parochial or charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   A better solution would be to fix, not transfer, the problems
that have been allowed to develop in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Few politicians or public officials, however, are willing to put
their big talk into action when the time comes to approve the
salaries that would attract and keep quality school teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and public officials tuck tail and run when the
subject of weak teacher education programs is mentioned.
Intellectually feeble schools of education _ teacher mills _ have
remained largely unchanged for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers go all wobbly when education reformers mention the
need to test teachers to see if the people in charge of educating
the nation's children possess the basic skills needed to teach
assigned classroom courses.
</P>
<P>
   School teachers are models. Teachers who misspell words on the
blackboard, cannot solve simple math problems or use improper
grammar should be found out and fired.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers should ratchet up teacher pay in step with tougher
teacher standards and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of higher standards, it's been obvious for years that
America's public school students need to be held to higher
standards.
</P>
<P>
   America's young people have been graduating from high school
with excellent grades only to find that they score so poorly on
college-entrance examinations that the Scholastic Assessment Test
was dumbed down. Colleges across the nation have been forced to
fund an explosion of remedial programs for entering freshmen who
failed to learn enough to take first-year college courses.
</P>
<P>
   By giving students inflated grades, little homework and
undeserved promotions, America's young people graduated with high
self-esteem but tested at the bottom of all industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's quite another matter to get public officials to
actually increase academic standards and require objective,
standardized measurements to determine if learning has taken place.
</P>
<P>
   It is easier to talk about school prayer, vouchers, charter
schools, school uniforms, local control and other subjects rather
than require high standards and top-to-bottom accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians would rather talk about the importance of improving
public education than actually requiring it because they know if
they demand the best they will have to pay for the best.
</P>
<P>
   It's much easier to talk a good game while keeping public
education funding low enough to promise tax cuts. Besides, by
shifting some of the current funding to private and church schools,
perhaps someone else will solve the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Not all politicians and public officials run from the
accumulated problems that plague many of the nation's public
schools. With luck, public support will swing behind those
courageous politicians who are willing to put actions and funds
behind their words.
</P>
<P>
   Texas and North Carolina have begun to make steps toward raising
student standards and putting in place the beginnings of an
accountability system. Much more needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians who talk a good game when it comes to improving
public education know that there's no such thing as a free lunch.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for lawmakers and public education officials to
recognize that education is like everything else in life _ you get
quality when you demand quality. And you get what you pay for.

 &HT;    Get the box right
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On the Internet, a woodworker postulates that ``most
everything that a woodworker builds is based on a box,'' which is
another way to describe casework, but then he adds:
</P>
<P>
   ``How hard can it be to build a box?''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a man who's never built one.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one reply to his statement went like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can build 'a box', but to build a box that's square,
with perfectly fitting joinery, be it mitered corners, box jointed
or dovetailed sides, can be one of the greatest challenges facing
all. Me, I keep try'n.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it has long been my contention that there is no better
practice for the woodworker in general and the casework builder in
particular than small boxes.
</P>
<P>
   You will learn joinery. Virtually every joint known to the
professional can be employed in building a box and its lid.
Dovetails are a staple, and you'll have to cut them by hand, or
with a band saw, because router-cut joints would be far too large
for the dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   Read all the articles about easy and quick box joints, and then
try a delicate box joint of 15 slots or more. See how many jigs you
have to make before you get one right. Box joints are easy when you
don't have more than six or seven slots. But a dimensional error so
slight as not to be noticed there will be multiplied in a longer
joint until it simply won't go together.
</P>
<P>
   You want mitered corners? Fine, but that's a cut, not a joint.
The simplest way to joint mitered corners is with splines; makes an
outstanding joint in a box or a dresser. Want it a little tougher?
Try mitered secret dovetails. Only you will ever know they there
once they're in place, so you'll want to make a picture before you
glue it up.
</P>
<P>
   You can also make splines, or even dovetailed splines, that run
sideways through a mitered joint. Make them in a contrasting wood;
it's very showy, even gaudy.
</P>
<P>
   You'll more often that not use frame-and-panel construction in
the lid, but you can make the whole box that way. The panels offer
a great way to try veneering; they're not so big that you need any
special equipment for glueing the veneer in place.
</P>
<P>
   When I first got started, I made some nice boxes but I could
never get the lids to fit right. Like to drove me crazy until a
more skillful craftsman explained to me the importance of being
square. If you want to make a presentable box with a lid that fits,
you will learn that squareness is a basic principle of woodworking.
The box has got to be square or the lid will never be right.
</P>
<P>
   You'll learn a lot about proportions. You can make the most
skilfully-joined box out of the most beautiful wood you can find,
and if you got the dimensions wrong it will never be anything but
an ugly duckling. Fortunately, you can easily draw the dimensions
out full-size on newsprint or an artist's pad before you start;
it's hard to do that with a blanket chest.
</P>
<P>
   You won't have to spend a bundle of money building boxes,
because they don't require a lot of wood. You'll need a band saw,
for sure, because you'll need to resaw your stock. Nothing looks
clunkier than a small box built of four-quarter stock.
</P>
<P>
   Building a box is, in fact, no small thing.

   MILLENNIUM-LUTHERAN _ On Oct. 31, 1517, Martin Luther tacked a
paper to the Palace Church door in Wittenberg, sparking a movement
that changed Christianity. But the church Luther founded finds
itself in deep trouble in Europe, where the Lutheran World
Federation reported a ``general reduction in numbers.'' And the
problem is even greater in Germany, the homeland of Protestanism,
where more than a million people have left the church rolls in
the1990s. (Gwhite, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 67. WITH PHOTOS.

   MILLENNIUM-PROTESTANTS _ Most German Protestants spend little
time in the pews, but the history of northern Germany, the
birthplace of the Protestant Reformation, can be traced through
three churches: The Palace Church in Wittenberg where Luther nailed
the theses that started the Reformation; the Berliner Dom, or great
emperial cathedral, that survived the tremendous forces that shaped
20th century East Berlin; and, St. Michael's in Hamburg, a city
famous for its churches and its red-light district, where the
rebuilding of St. Michael's after World War II has become a major
point of pride for the city. (Gwhite, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 30. WITH PHOTOS.

<P>
   MILLENNIUM-LUTHER _ Although Catholic monk Martin Luther never
intended to form his own church, millions of Christians around the
world are now in a family of denominations that bear his name.
Millions more are in other groups _ Reformed, Methodist,
Presbyterian _ that are part of the Protestant Reformation Luther
sparked. A brief bio of Luther. Photo. (Gwhite, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 12.5.
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-BOX _ Although the government of Germany collects
funds for the Protestant and Catholic churches along with income
tax, many people have chosen to disaffiliate themselves from the
faith. And many of those who still pay money to the church seldom
attend. We take a quick look at the numbers. Gwhite. 7.4''

   COSMOS _ The Hubble Space Telescope and other new instruments
for examining the space we live in have generated a flood of new
discoveries during the 1990s, the fastest accumulation of insights
about the Universe in history, scientists say. Yet, fundamental
questions still exist about science and religion. Was there a Big
Bang? Did something happen before it? Was there a ``before it?''
Did something ``cause'' it to happen? Are human beings the only
``intelligent creatures'' to live in the space that it seems to
have created and to wonder about these things? The American
Association for the Advancement of Science will bring together
scientists and religious scholars from universities in the United
States and Europe next week (April 14-16) to talk these questions

IT'S NOT YOUR GRANDFOLKS' WOODSTOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Your grandparents' Woodstock was a long time ago, back in 1969,
when flower power still ruled. But the 30th anniversary of
Woodstock this summer will be a cutting-edge affair that not only
spans rock and hip-hop, but will have a ``cyber cafe'' and an
``extreme sports park'' with bungee jumping and skateboarding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll also have a film festival and arts and theater groups.
It will be a complete cultural experience,'' says coproducer
Michael Lang, who worked on Woodstock '69 and the '94 sequel.
</P>
<P>
   The official lineup announced for the July 23-25 event at the
former Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome, N.Y., (about 50 minutes
west of Albany) includes two Boston acts in Aerosmith and Guster,
along with the Dave Matthews Band, Metallica, Alanis Morissette,
DMX, Korn, Ice Cube, Limp Bizkit, Rage Against the Machine, Creed,
Counting Crows, Sheryl Crow, Bush, the Chemical Brothers, Everlast,
George Clinton, Jewel, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Sugar Ray, Collective
Soul, Fat Boy Slim, Foo Fighters, Live, Los Lobos, moe, Brian
Setzer Orchestra, Rusted Root, Willie Nelson, the Offspring, and
Tragically Hip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll add a half-dozen more big acts in the next few weeks,''
said coproducer John Scher of New York-based Metropolitan
Entertainment. ``We'll add more hip-hop artists, electronic acts,
and some classic rock.''
</P>
<P>
   John Fogerty is one of the acts he hopes to land. But there will
be no ``three-timers,'' Scher said, meaning acts that would have
played all three Woodstocks (thus, Santana and Joe Cocker were not
invited).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for kids 18 to 27,'' said Lang. ``We wanted to be
contemporary in 1994, but we tied it more to the past then. We
won't do that to the same extent this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The largely new-generation Woodstock '99 will feature two
500-foot-wide stages located three-quarters of a mile apart, and a
third ``rave stage'' starting at 2 a.m. and running all night,
probably in an old airplane hangar. The overall grounds are 3,600
acres, including a grassy, 240-acre campground, plus a hospital,
sewage plant, and water system, and parking for up to 70,000 cars.
``Most of the infrastructure is already there,'' said Lang, though
he added that a colorful, 12-foot-high, wooden ``art fence'' will
be built around the 5-mile perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   The event will try to recoup the $8 million these same producers
lost at Woodstock '94, which was marred by gate crashers (an
estimated 150,000 of the 350,000 fans did not pay) and by a
cynicism that Scher feels is gone now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no trouble getting acts to come to this,'' said Scher,
noting that the core acts of Woodstock '94 (Aerosmith, Crow,
Metallica, and the Chili Peppers) were the first to sign up. ``That
set the tone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   MTV is expected to be involved, and look for a pay-per-view too,
said Lang, who is thrilled with the reception the event is getting
from Rome officials _ notably from Mayor Joe Griffo, an Aerosmith
fan nicknamed ``the MTV Mayor.'' The town will also allow tickets
to be sold on the days of the shows, which was prohibited in 1994's
Saugerties, N.Y., site and sparked gate crashing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will corporate sponsorship be intrusive, said Scher. Tommy
Hilfiger, who is sponsoring the Rolling Stones tour, wanted to have
his name affixed to the event but was rejected. ``There will be
some corporate sponsorship, but no banners,'' said Lang.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets are $150 for the three-day event (including camping).
Individual tickets go on sale April 25 at 9 a.m. through
Ticketmaster (212-397-7474). ``Woodstock Express'' packages, which
include tickets and bus service from 17 cities, go on sale April 18
through the same number.

MOTHERS TELL OF THEIR `MOMMY SINS' IN MAGAZINE SURVEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 For release Monday, April 12)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Redbook Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Redbook magazine put out a call for unforgettable mommy
boo-boos, 133 readers responded. Read on _ you'll feel so much
better!
</P>
<P>
   The stress of major holidays and other special occasions seems
to trigger the biggest mommy blunders. Next time you're making
excuses for the tooth fairy, take comfort: You've got lots of
company.
</P>
<P>
   _ Santa slipups: 22 percent of our readers were caught eating
the old guy's cookies, stuffing the stockings, or just stumbling
over an incoherent explanation for his existence.
</P>
<P>
   _ Easter Bunny, MIA: 3 percent mangled Easter morning by
forgetting to hide the eggs and candy for the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   _ Birthday blowups: 2 percent overlooked a child's birthday,
missed a gift, or suffered some other snafu when under pressure on
the big day.
</P>
<P>
   _ Flighty tooth fairy: 16 percent neglected their duties as
tooth fairy. They said the tooth fairy was sick, busy, or that
``Hey, look! I found the money while making the bed!''
</P>
<P>
   Margo Lujan, of Pflugerville, Texas, tried this creative save:
``My son was very upset when someone told him I was the tooth
fairy. I wanted him to believe, so I pretended to get upset at this
comment and said, `That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard.
Think about it, why would I pay for your teeth? If I wanted your
teeth, I would simply say, ``Give me your teeth.'' `Why would I
wait until you're asleep, sneak into your room, and replace them
with money?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought for a minute and said, `You're right, Mom, you'd
never give up sleep to pay for my teeth.'''
</P>
<P>
   _ Trash trauma: Just between moms, many a precious object has
been secretly laid to rest in the trash.
</P>
<P>
   One daughter discovered her deceased goldfish in the garbage
(``Mom, what's my fish doing in there!?''); needless to say, it was
quickly removed and given a proper burial.
</P>
<P>
   Most of you who tried to ditch a prized work of kiddie art got
caught. Says Charisse Parisi, of Central Islip, N.Y., ``I was a
little too indiscreet when throwing away one of my five-year-old's
paintings made `just for me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only so much room for my little artist's
masterpieces, so I had to get rid of a few. He opened the garbage
can and, to his horror, found his painting covered in sauce on top
of the rest of the trash.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I realized what I had done, I did my best to act just as
horrified. (`How in the world did that get there?') He fell for it
that time, and the spaghetti sauce painting hung on the
refrigerator for several months.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Zombie mommies: Kids have been stranded at school, left
rideless at friend's houses, and forgotten at restaurants, movie
theaters, skating parties, gas stations, and graduation ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an especially good one from Diane Lizotte of Pascoag,
R.I.: ``When my son was about 11, he played Little League baseball.
Sometimes the games were scheduled for the evening. One night I
found myself bleary-eyed and tired as I sat on the bleachers
watching him play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to rest my head for a few minutes in the car. I fell
asleep and missed his great, game-saving catch. Not only that, but
I only woke up when I heard a tapping and saw my son and his coach
peeking in the car window at me. All the other parents were long
gone. Needless to say, I never really wiggled out of that one, but
I volunteered to work in the snack bar the following year, which
put me in the coach's good graces-and kept me awake.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Little love lies: Oh, what a tangled web we weave. The fibs we
tell seem harmless at first, but then seem to spin out of control.
Good luck trying to set the record straight later.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Mettler, of Perry, Ohio, writes: ``I told my son that I
dropped him when he was little and that's how he got the crack in
his butt. When his twin sisters were born he wanted to know when we
could drop them, because everyone has a butt crack! I had to come
clean and admit I was only teasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Martha Bokshon, from Anderson, S.C., was fed up with McDonald's
and wanted her two- and six-year-old to eat something different.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching the restaurant in her car, she turned a corner in
the other direction and explained, ``We can't eat at McDonald's
tonight, it's burned down.'' Her kids began to cry, and three days
later, when Bokshon couldn't take the guilt any longer, she thought
of a way to ease her conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Taking them back to McDonald's, she said, ``They built it back
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Her kids were understandably pleased, but, with a true
comprehension of time, her two-year-old asked, ``What took them so
long?''

FINALLY, A PRACTICAL USE FOR SATELLITE PHOTOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Later this week _ in fact, on Thursday, when you'll probably
wish you had started filling out your tax forms earlier _ NASA
plans to launch a satellite that will take 250 pictures of Earth
each day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If it makes you feel better, you can tell yourself that probably
a little of the money you send to Washington will be used to pay
for some of this. If that doesn't improve your mood, well, you
strike me as pretty whiny and hard to please _ so contrary, in
fact, that I can't think of much I could tell you about taxes that
you'd like. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether you feel better about this or not, you may want to hold
real still and smile 250 times a day so as not to mess up this
work. A better idea would be to forget that. After all, the Landsat
7 satellite pictures will cover roughly 115 miles by 105 miles.
That means that whoever buys these images (at $475 a pop) won't be
able to pick you out very clearly, probably. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I suppose, though, that depends on how big you are and what kind
of ridiculous hat you might have on. (What are you, a show-off or
something?) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time this kind of satellite has been sent
into orbit to collect images of Earth. NASA, in fact, has been
studying the Earth since 1958 and there have been Landsat-type
satellites in use since the 1970s. Which means that you yourself _
unless you're a hermit who never comes out of your condo _ probably
have been included in hundreds of images captured by the
complicated cameras on board these satellites. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Landsat 5, launched in 1984, is still up there taking
pictures, snap, snap. The next satellite in line, however, Landsat
6, failed to achieve orbit after its 1993 launch and had to be
destroyed. That's how it is with satellites and horses _ quit
working and you're dead meat. (Unless, of course, you get put out
to stud, no doubt Bill Clinton's dream.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The folks responsible for this Landsat 7 project say it will
help us understand our environment _ especially once its work is
coordinated with the Terra Earth Observing System satellite to be
launched in July. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All kinds of scientists _ meteorologists, oceanographers,
biologists and worse _ will be studying these high-tech images of
Earth and trying to help improve weather forecasts, manage forests
better and so forth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And no doubt this is all a wonderful idea that has made _ and
will continue to make _ life better for all of us. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard for me to understand why these satellites can't be
programmed to take more useful _ and much closer-up _ pictures that
would help us more directly with the stress of our lives. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For instance, let's say it's the Christmas shopping season.
Well, in a few weeks weeks we won't have to imagine that's the case
because Christmas shopping now begins about Mother's Day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, say it's the weekend before Christmas Day and you've
made the boneheaded decision to go to a suburban shopping mall to
buy gifts _ the sort of presents that people who live their lives
more creatively than you do already have made by hand. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What do you fear most in this scene _ besides, I mean, the
crowds and charge-card bills? Why, the parking, of course. Wouldn't
it be wonderful if there were a small TV screen on the dashboard of
your car that could receive constantly updated satellite photos of
the parking lot? It would save you from driving around and around
and around, looking for an empty space. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and while they're at it, can't these satellites take
pictures that would warn us that the boss is on the way back from
lunch? Hey, our taxes are paying for this snazzy satellite stuff.
Why can't we get what we want? &QL;
</P>

FROM SLIME TO SUBLIME IN THE NEWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Random comments on people in the news:
</P>
<P>
   MONICA LEWINSKY: What? Monica is back in the news?
</P>
<P>
   Well, ``back'' isn't the right word. The right word is
``still.'' When you stop and think about it, the president's former
girlfriend never really vanished from the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   After ruling the tabloid universe for a year or so as the Starr
witness in Bill Clinton's sex-and-lies scandal, Lewinsky breezily
segued into the role of tell-all author and international pop idol.
She mingled with movie stars at last month's Academy Awards, and
she has drawn big crowds at book signings overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Monica bulletin, emanating from her book tour in
Norway and reported by USA Today: The love is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feelings are changing a lot,'' Lewinsky said, ``but I think
that one thing I do know for sure is that I'm not in love with him
any more.''
</P>
<P>
   That's good to know. Do you suppose he's still in love with her?
</P>
<P>
   MICHAEL ISIKOFF: Michael who?
</P>
<P>
   Some readers might not recognize the name, but just about
everyone is familiar with his work. Isikoff is the Newsweek
reporter who conspired with Lewinsky's ex-friend Linda Tripp and
Tripp's pal Lucianne Goldberg to help turn the Bill-and-Monica
sexcapades into the most read-about case of adultery since ``The
Scarlet Letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Isikoff wrote a book detailing his pursuit of the White House
sex story and has been telling interviewers that he was a willing
participant in the Tripp-Goldberg plot to make a federal case out
of Clinton's sexual proclivities. Give him points for candor, if
not for good judgment and journalistic integrity.
</P>
<P>
   JENNY JONES: As long as we're down here splashing around in the
muck, we might as well mention the
stand-up-comic-turned-TV-talk-show-host who's being sued because a
guest on her show allegedly went out and killed another guest
because the show took a turn that the first guest didn't
appreciate. Seems that the program's theme was ``secret crushes''
and that the crushee was horrified to discover that he was the
object of a gay man's affection.
</P>
<P>
   The dead guest's survivors are suing ``The Jenny Jones Show''
for $50 million, claiming that the shooter was nuts and the program
made him nuttier. Wow. If putting wackos on the air can get a talk
show sued, Jerry Springer could end up spending more time in court
than he spends breaking up fistfights.
</P>
<P>
   MARK MCGWIRE: From the slime to the sublime. Having rescued
baseball from the trash heap of sport by blasting a mind-boggling
70 home runs last season, Big Mac has picked up where he left off.
McGwire launched the 1999 homer chase with an opposite-field smash
in the first game of the season, high-fived his batboy son, Matt,
as he did after so many trots around the bases in '98, and provided
a polite and humble interview on one of the TV news magazines.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget: He donates a chunk of his multimillion-dollar
salary to the battle against child abuse. Who says an athlete can't
be a role model?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN MCCAIN: I don't agree with him on all the issues _ he's
partial to the idea of deploying ground troops in Kosovo _ but the
Arizona senator/ex-prisoner of war is a man who says what he means
and means what he says.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is running for president, which means he'd be smart to
keep his opinions on Yugoslavia to himself. Most White House
hopefuls are waiting to see who wins the war before staking out a
position.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain isn't the sort of leader who waits for the parade to
go by and then sprints up the street to get in front of it. Right
or wrong, he takes a stand. Who says a politician can't be a role
model?
</P>
<P>
   BILL CLINTON: Talk about a pol who rushes to the front of the
parade to create the illusion that he's leading it. Clinton didn't
invent the strategy _ he just turned it into an art form.
</P>
<P>
   Give him credit, though: Clinton boldly went where others dared
not go in Yugoslavia, and recent polls indicate that the American
people are following.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: What will he do if the people turn against him?
</P>

 By LEON LAZAROFF 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ Sitting behind a small rectangular desk that holds a
computer terminal and a small pile of papers, Jorge Piedrahita
spends much of his day in a rented Park Avenue office looking for a
job with a Wall Street banking firm. It has been about four months
since the Argentine trader was let go as director of Latin American
proprietary trading at West Merchant Bank, a job he held for just
one month after he decided to leave an equally notable position at
Citicorp Securities.
 &HT;    Piedrahita is not alone. In the past 12 months, hundreds of once
high-flying Latin American traders, analysts and deal makers have
been cut from their well-paid, high-stress posts at many of Wall
Streets largest firms. For the moment, they constitute the
Unemployed Masters of the Universe _ to borrow the phrase from Tom
Wolfe's ``Bonfire of the Vanities.''
 &HT;    In the highly competitive world of finance, jobs are usually
awarded or taken away for the most fundamental of reasons: the
bottom line. Either you make money for the firm or you go. The
mighty young wizards of Latin finance are no longer bringing in the
bulge bracket deals, so they must go.
 &HT;    As a market, Latin America has all but dried up for now.
Brazil's devaluation marks the end of an era in which firms built
entire Latin American divisions to handle massive deals. The people
who engineered the region's rise and fall made money, and had a lot
of fun, and took _ for a time _ center stage in the world of
finance.
 &HT;    Riding the boom and bust on Wall Street produced some very rich
young people, and in some cases, some very desperate ones. Chris
Taylor, a former telecom analyst at Bankers Trust, reports that a
couple of former colleagues earned as much as he did during their
tenures but simply forgot to put away any savings. Unlike Taylor,
who now plans to take a year off while carefully looking for his
next job, some former masters are more desperate than others.
 &HT;    But no one here says they are looking for sympathy. Wall Street
wages, justly or unjustly, reflect the high stakes and high
pressures of the industry. Booms and busts, whether in Latin
America or on the Internet, are simply part of the game. ``Hey, no
one should have pity on anyone who makes $200,000 or $500,000 [a
year,'' Taylor, fresh back from a trip to India, says. ``I don't
want to sound cocky, but during the good times some people get
hired who probably shouldn't be on Wall Street. And now, some
people lost out because of political battles, or they just didn't
cut it.'' Taylor, by his own account, was pushed out the shrinking
BT door following a heated internal fracas.
 &HT;    West Merchant's sudden decision to all but scrap its Latin
American operation forced Piedrahita and a group of his colleagues
onto the street. The firm blamed the cuts on Russia's sudden
default, but Piedrahita is quick to add that Russia wasn't the only
guilty party. Over the entire past 14 months, the once-mighty
emerging markets of South Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe
have all but closed shop. ``I was downsized,'' he says frankly.
 &HT;    Downsizing at Wall Street's Latin American departments is
happening fast and furiously. At one firm, pink slips were handed
out by tapping people on their shoulders and asking them to clear
out their desks. So much for goodbye parties.
 &HT;    Insisting that he remains unfazed by his sudden job change,
Walter Molano, former director of Latin America macroeconomic
research at Warburg Dillon Reed, says he holds no bitterness over
being let go. ``When I came here, one Wall Street analyst gave me
some good advice. He said, There are very short windows of
opportunity here, don't think they'll go on forever,'' says Molano,
37, who now holds a similar position at BCP Securities, a
Greenwich, Connecticut-based brokerage specializing in Latin
America.
 &HT;    No one likes it when a glorious boom turns into a heartless
bust.
 &HT;    But that's what has happened. After a strong recovery from the
1995 Mexican peso crisis, Latin America was once again struck
broadside when financial failure in Russia sent Latin currency
rates tumbling and stock prices plunging; any talk of large
corporate or infrastructure bond deals was silenced. According to
Deborah Rivera of the Wall Street headhunting firm Allison, Gaines
&AMP; Rivera, many one-time Latin American gurus have moved on to
so-called buy-side firms such as fund management companies, and
even commercial banks. Others are still looking.
 &HT;    ``I clearly have more people looking for work than people who
want to hire them,'' says Rivera. ``It used to be that there were
huge bidding wars where people were getting giant guarantees and
cushy ex-pat packages to move to Latin America. Not anymore.''
 &HT;    To have been young, ambitious and riding the wave in Latin
American securities was exhilarating. It also was lucrative.
Looking back, Piedrahita says everyone has stories about watching
as a region known primarily as a financial backwater unaccustomed
to soliciting foreign markets turned into a major, if not the most
attractive, destination for global capital.
 &HT;    In 1991, the free-market gospel was being zealously embraced by
the region's economic leaders, both in government and corporate
boardrooms. In Argentina, then-Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo
unveiled his Convertibility Law, and Mexico's Carlos Salinas was
moving swiftly forward with large-scale privatizations. ``There was
a lot of talk about a new Latin America,'' Piedrahita says.
 &HT;    As far back as 1988, Latin American companies had begun to
return to the capital markets with private bond offerings, which
were followed by initial public offerings (IPOs) a few years later.
But Piedrahita recalls that many Latin American traders were far
more skeptical about Latin America's sudden popularity than those
based on Wall Street. In the early 1990s, Piedrahita was working
for Citicorp in Buenos Aires. He knew only too well that Argentina
was still a financial mess; other countries remained deep in debt.
``We knew there were still some big problems, so it was hard to
imagine what was coming,'' he says. ``We weren't sure just where it
would go.''
 &HT;    But by 1991, gradual economic improvements and newfound
international interest in the region _ sparked in part by a surge
in global liquidity _ transformed Latin American corporate bonds
and in some cases even sovereign debt paper into some of the most
sought-after assets in the world. ``Then it really did get
amazing,'' Piedrahita adds. In May 1991, Telefonos de Mexico
(Telmex) under the market guidance of Goldman Sachs, conducted its
landmark global stock offering. Telmex rapidly became the most
traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange, jump-starting Latin
America's equity boom.
 &HT;    For the next three years, everyone wanted a piece of Latin
America. Recruited out of Duke University in 1993 before completing
a doctorate in political economy, Molano went to work for First
Boston on its emerging-markets desk. In those days, Latin American
specialists got everything they wanted. ``There were a lot of
resources floating around. Firms were spending big money on Latin
America,'' Molano says. ``Christmas parties for Latin America were
major blowouts.''
 &HT;    Only the most conservative companies held them at the office.
Most brokerages staged the event at New York City's finest hotels
and restaurants, or _ why not? _ at a swank resort in the Bahamas.
Nothing was too good for the fine young men and women who were
bringing in billions in new business.
 &HT;    As 1993 and 1994 rolled on, general optimism began to border on
the excessive. Some brokers and analysts became so bullish they
began talking about certain Latin American countries becoming
investment grade and Latin America as a new asset class. ``Very few
voices were cautious,'' Piedrahita says. ``Business was booming.
People were toohappy to question things.''
 &HT;    Russell Ashcroft, who was at J.P. Morgan at the time, remembers
that heady talk. No longer were Latin American corporations or
their governments just performing routine commercial banking. They
were doing some of the most creative financing anywhere in the
world. Derivatives became commonplace. A bond market with annual
trading volumes of a trillion dollars had suddenly appeared out of
the rubble of the 1980s bank debt, as countries repackaged the old
loans into so-called Brady bonds backed by securities purchased
from the U.S. government. Investors were eager to buy this
high-yield paper.
 &HT;    ``There was this huge burst of a feeling that these countries
are trying to restructure their debts, they are our neighbors, and
most of these bonds have a U.S. Treasury component to them,''
Ashcroft says. ``For most of these countries, all of this was new
and they were uncertain how to do it.'' So, without much
hesitation, Wall Street firms, which had never thought seriously
about Brazil and Argentina, let alone Venezuela or Colombia, began
to send plane loads of their people southward.
 &HT;    The impact was immediate. ``Every graduate from an MBA program
wanted to get into emerging markets,'' Molano says. ``Departments
were growing willy nilly. People moved to other jobs after nine
months, doubling their salaries. It seemed as if there were no
restrictions on costs or expenses.''
 &HT;    Enrique Bustamante, who moved last fall from a waning ING
Barings to Merrill Lynch, recalls that riding the boom was
especially exciting for Latin Americans. Bustamante, a Mexican,
lived in his nation's capital during the 1980s, and watched with
proud eyes as his country became recognized as a leading emerging
market. It was nothing short of a local investment bankers dream.
``Coming from Latin America, there was this sense of doing
something good to develop the region,'' he says.
 &HT;    Ultimately, though, it was Bustamante's own Mexico and the
severe devaluation of the peso that would foreshadow the end of the
region's Wall Street boom. Mexico's overvalued currency came
crashing down in December 1994, and although Brazil's auspicious
Real Plan had just been introduced, the region spent the next year
in the doldrums. Thousands lost their jobs, and prices for basic
products soared out of reach for even those middle-class Mexicans
who had been the loudest supporters of free trade and foreign
investment.
 &HT;    But even as domestic and international money exited from Mexico,
investment banks did not execute the drastic restructuring measures
they would perform some four years later. Piedrahita's Citibank,
which has been in Latin America longer than any current competitor,
stayed on the ground, making only a handful of personnel changes.
``It was nice to see that the company was not changing its
strategy,'' Piedrahita says.
 &HT;    For those bankers who did lose their jobs after the Tequila
crisis, comparable positions could be found handling high-yield
debt elsewhere, particularly in the emerging markets of Southeast
Asia and Russia. ``Because demands for Russia were so strong,''
recalls the headhunter Rivera, ``if you could say you had been
doing emerging markets, you could end up somewhere else.'' And
there were still jobs to be found within Latin America. The
sleeping giant, Brazil, came to life with some of the world's
largest privatizations. Corporate and sovereign issues flew off the
shelf. It seemed that the region would continue to march toward
economic growth and stability.
 &HT;    Reality had other plans. Following the Asian collapse led by
Thailand in mid-1997 and Moscow's meltdown in August 1998, South
America's largest economy began to teeter. In the months leading up
to Brazil's devaluation last January, Latin America's boom-boom
decade came to a grinding close. Major international brokerage
houses began changing the way they cover the region.
 &HT;    Ruben Fernandez, an Argentine who joined Santander's
fixed-income department when the Spanish bank purchased Banco Rio
de la Plata in September 1997, was forced to leave just over a year
later. The experience left him wondering about the dedication of
foreign investors to his home continent. ``Some investment houses
have been in Latin America in a very erratic way,'' he says,
charging that most banks seek immediate profits without making any
real commitment to a region.
 &HT;    Of course, a bank's business is to make money, not commitments.
But for the smart young idealists who came to think they were
taking part in profound change, that bottom-line mentality deals a
double blow: their jobs have evaporated along with the region's
short-term financial outlook.
 &HT;    Comfortably ensconced now in the world of academia, Frank
Partnoy, a former Latin America derivatives trader, left Wall
Street altogether in 1995 after he accused his own brokerage house,
Morgan Stanley, of a concerted effort to deceptively force risky
products on unsuspecting clients. Watching the most recent
bloodletting on Wall Street, Partnoy, a law professor at the
University of San Diego, says he feels more sentimental than
vindictive about seeing so many people like himself tossed from
their jobs.
 &HT;    ``In a tortured kind of way I find it all sad,'' says Partnoy,
author of the widely acclaimed ``F.I.A.S.C.O. - Blood in the Water
on Wall Street.'' ``You define yourself as a macho Master of the
Universe and then you lose your job. So youre out looking for
something new and discover that the opportunities available will
pay you only a fraction of what you once made. That's going to hurt
no matter what you say.''
 &HT;    For the Latin American generation of Wall Street go-getters, the
current crisis has been sobering, admits Piedrahita. He thinks that
the next time around, some people may choose to go into a much less
volatile business. And he wonders what his long hours of frenetic
deal-making have gained him: ``Mostly, we all grew some gray
hair.''

 Por LEON LAZAROFF 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    NUEVA YORK _ Sentado ante un pequeno escritorio rectangular con
una computadora y unos cuantos papeles, Jorge Piedrahita pasa gran
parte del dia en una oficina alquilada en Park Avenue buscando un
empleo con una firma bancaria de Wall Street. Hace unos cuatro
meses que el corredor argentino perdio su puesto de director de
operaciones latinoamericanas de corretaje con recursos propios en
West Merchant Bank, puesto que solo ocupo un mes tras dejar un
cargo tambien elevado en Citicorp Securities.
 &HT;    Piedrahita no esta solo. En los ultimos doce meses, cientos de
corredores, analistas y asesores de alto calibre especializados en
America Latina han perdido empleos bien pagados en grandes firmas
de Wall Street. De momento son, para usar la frase de Tom Wolfe en
``La Hoguera de las Vanidades,'' los amos del universo
desempleados.
 &HT;    En el mundo de las finanzas, donde la competencia renida es la
orden del dia, los empleos dependen de la razon mas elemental: las
ganancias. O se genera dinero para la empresa o hay que marcharse.
Los jovenes magos de las finanzas latinoamericanas ya no aportan
los grandes negocios de antes, asi que se deben marchar.
 &HT;    Como mercado, America Latina practicamente se ha agotado por
ahora. La devaluacion del real en Brasil marca el fin de una era en
la que las firmas creaban divisiones latinoamericanas para manejar
grandes acuerdos. Los que intervinieron directamente en los
altibajos economicos de la region se llenaron los bolsillos y
ocuparon por un tiempo las candilejas del mundo de las finanzas.
 &HT;    Wall Street ha creado jovenes muy ricos y, en algunos casos, muy
desesperados. Chris Taylor, ex analista de telecomunicaciones de
Bankers Trust, informa que dos ex colegas ganaron tanto como el
mientras trabajaron juntos, pero que no ahorraron nada. A
diferencia de Taylor, quien planea tomarse un ano libre mientras
busca cuidadosamente su proximo empleo, algunos ex amos estan mas
desesperados que otros.
 &HT;    Pero nadie pide compasion. Los salarios de Wall Street, justa o
injustamente, reflejan los grandes riesgos y presiones del sector.
Las altas y las bajas no son mas que parte del juego. ``Nadie debe
sentir lastima por alguien que gana US$200.000 o US$500.000 [al
ano,'' dice Taylor tras llegar de un viaje a la India. ``No quiero
parecer arrogante, pero en los buenos tiempos se contrato a
personas que quiza nunca debieron haber entrado en Wall Street.
Algunos perdieron sus puestos debido a conflictos internos o
simplemente porque no dieron la talla.'' Taylor relata que perdio
su trabajo en Bankers Trust en una renida batalla de politica
interna.
 &HT;    La subita decision de West Merchant de desmontar practicamente
sus operaciones latinoamericanas dejo en la calle a Piedrahita y a
varios colegas. La firma dice que las reducciones se debieron a la
repentina crisis de Rusia, pero Piedrahita opina que Rusia no debe
cargar con toda la culpa. En los ultimos 14 meses los mercados
emergentes del Sudeste Asiatico, America Latina y Europa Oriental,
antes tan poderosos, se han venido abajo. ``Sencillamente no habia
nada para mi``, dice con franqueza.
 &HT;    Los despidos en los departamentos latinoamericanos de Wall
Street avanzan a todo vapor. En una firma los que perdieron el
empleo recibieron una palmada en el hombro y la orden de vaciar sus
escritorios. Desde luego, no hubo fiestas de despedida.
 &HT;    Walter Molano, ex director de investigaciones macroeconomicas
sobre Latinoamerica en Warburg Dillon Reed, afirma que no guarda
rencor por que lo hayan despedido. ``Cuando llegue, un analista de
Wall Street me dio un buen consejo: Aqui hay muy pocos periodos de
oportunidad; no creas que van a durar para siempre, me dijo,''
recuerda Molano, que ahora ocupa un puesto similar en BCP
Securities, una correduria de Greenwich, Connecticut, especializada
en America Latina.
 &HT;    A nadie le gusta ver caer la bolsa estrepitosamente.
 &HT;    Pero eso es precisamente lo que sucedio. Despues de una fuerte
recuperacion tras la crisis del peso mexicano en 1995, America
Latina recibio otro golpe fuerte cuando la crisis financiera de
Rusia estremecio los tipos de cambio en la region, los precios de
las acciones cayeron en picado y se interrumpieron todas las
conversaciones sobre grandes emisiones de deuda empresarial o para
obras de infraestructura. Segun Deborah Rivera, de Allison, Gaines
&AMP; Rivera, una firma cazatalentos de Wall Street, muchos expertos en
America Latina se han ido a trabajar a firmas de administracion de
fondos e incluso a bancos comerciales. Otros todavia estan
buscando.
 &HT;    ``Tengo mas personas buscando trabajo que empresas buscando
personal,'' senala Rivera. ``Antes habia verdaderas guerras para
captar talentos, a los que se ofrecian excelentes garantias, altos
salarios y otras ventajas para trasladarse a Latinoamerica. Pero
esa epoca ya paso``.
 &HT;    Era emocionante ser joven y ambicioso y aprovechar el auge de
los valores latinoamericanos. Tambien era lucrativo. Piedrahita
dice que todo el mundo tiene anecdotas sobre la transformacion de
una region de poca actividad financiera, alejada de los mercados
extranjeros, en un importante destino (quiza el mas atractivo) del
capital internacional.
 &HT;    En 1991, los lideres economicos de la region se arrodillaron
ante el evangelio del libre mercado, tanto en los gobiernos como en
las juntas empresariales. En Argentina, el entonces ministro de
Economia Domingo Cavallo elaboro su Ley de Convertibilidad, y el
mexicano Carlos Salinas dio luz verde a las privatizaciones en gran
escala. ``Se hablaba mucho de una nueva America Latina,'' comenta
Piedrahita.
 &HT;    En 1988, las empresas latinoamericanas ya habian comenzado a
regresar a los mercados de capital con emisiones de deuda privada,
seguidas por salidas a bolsa unos anos despues. Pero Piedrahita
recuerda que muchos corredores latinoamericanos se mostraban mucho
mas escepticos sobre la subita popularidad de America Latina que
los de Wall Street. A principios de los anos 90, Piedrahita
trabajaba para Citicorp en Buenos Aires. Sabia muy bien que
Argentina era todavia un desastre financiero; otros paises tenian
una deuda enorme. ``Sabiamos que habia grandes problemas, asi que
era dificil imaginar lo que vendria. No sabiamos con certeza hacia
donde se dirigian las cosas,'' dice.
 &HT;    Pero en 1991 la gradual mejoria economica y un renovado interes
internacional en la region, debido en parte a un aumento de la
liquidez mundial, colocaron la deuda empresarial latinoamericana, y
en algunos casos hasta las deudas soberanas, entre los activos mas
buscados del mundo. ``Fue verdaderamente asombroso,'' anade
Piedrahita. En mayo de 1991, Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), bajo la
orientacion de Goldman Sachs, realizo su historica salida a bolsa.
Las acciones de Telmex se convirtieron rapidamente en las mas
negociadas de la Bolsa de Nueva York y dieron inicio al auge de los
titulos latinoamericanos.
 &HT;    Durante los tres anos siguientes, todos querian una parte del
pastel. Captado en la Universidad de Duke antes de terminar un
doctorado en Economia Politica, Molano paso a trabajar en el
departamento de mercados emergentes de First Boston. En aquel
tiempo, los especialistas en America Latina tenian lo que querian.
``Habia muchos recursos. Las firmas gastaban sumas enormes en
America Latina,'' dice Molano. ``Las fiestas de Navidad de los
departamentos latinoamericanos eran espectaculares.''
 &HT;    Solo las companias mas conservadoras celebraban las fiestas en
la oficina. La mayoria de las casas de corretaje celebraban en los
mejores hoteles y restaurantes de Nueva York o (por que no?) en
algun lujoso centro turistico de las Bahamas. Nada era demasiado
bueno para los brillantes jovenes que aportaban miles de millones
en negocios nuevos.
 &HT;    En 1993 y 1994, el optimismo general se hizo excesivo. ``Muy
pocas voces aconsejaron prudencia,'' recuerda Piedrahita. ``Los
negocios florecian. La gente estaba demasiado feliz como para
cuestionarse las cosas.''
 &HT;    Russell Ashcroft, que en aquel momento estaba en JP Morgan,
recuerda esa retorica optimista. Las empresas y los gobiernos de
America Latina ya no realizaban las actividades bancarias
rutinarias: concretaban las actividades financieras mas creativas
del mundo. Los derivados estaban a la orden del dia. Un mercado de
bonos con volumenes anuales de comercio de un billon de dolares
surgio subitamente de las cenizas de la deuda bancaria de los anos
80, cuando los paises reestructuraron las antiguas deudas en los
bonos Brady, respaldados por titulos comprados al gobierno de
Estados Unidos. Los inversionistas estaban ansiosos por comprar esa
deuda de alto rendimiento.
 &HT;    ``Se extendia como un reguero de polvora la opinion de que estos
paises trataban de reestructurar sus deudas, que eran nuestros
vecinos y que la mayor parte de esa deuda tenia un componente del
Tesoro estadounidense,'' dice Ashcroft. ``En la mayor parte de esas
naciones, todo esto era nuevo y no sabian con certeza como
hacerlo.'' De modo que sin mucha vacilacion, las firmas de Wall
Street, que nunca habian pensado seriamente en Brasil y Argentina,
y mucho menos en Venezuela y Colombia, enviaron a su gente rumbo
sur.
 &HT;    El impacto fue inmediato. ``Todo graduado de una maestria en
Administracion de Empresas queria entrar en los mercados
emergentes,'' dice Molano. ``Los departamentos crecian
vertiginosamente. La gente se cambiaba de empleo cada nueve meses y
duplicaba su salario. Daba la impresion de que no habia
restricciones a los costos ni a los gastos.''
 &HT;    Enrique Bustamante, que el otono pasado se traslado del
debilitado ING Barings a Merrill Lynch, recuerda que el auge fue
muy emocionante, sobre todo para los latinoamericanos. Bustamante,
que es mexicano, vivio en la capital de su pais durante los anos 80
y vio con orgullo como se convertia en un importante mercado
emergente. Era el sueno de un banquero de inversiones. ``Como venia
de America Latina, tenia la sensacion de que estaba dando un aporte
al desarrollo de la region,'' senala.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, a la larga fue el Mexico de Bustamante y la
devaluacion del peso los que marcaron el principio del fin del auge
de Wall Street en la region. El sobrevaluado peso mexicano se
desplomo en diciembre de 1994, y aunque recien se habia
implementado el Plan Real en Brasil, la region paso el ano
siguiente bajo una crisis economica. Miles perdieron sus empleos y
los precios de los productos basicos quedaron fuera del alcance
hasta de los mexicanos de clase media, que habian sido los
partidarios mas fervientes del libre comercio y de la inversion
extranjera.
 &HT;    Pero aunque los capitales nacionales e internacionales escapaban
de Mexico, los bancos de inversion no aplicaron las drasticas
medidas de reestructuracion que aplicarian cuatro anos despues.
Citibank, que llego a America Latina mucho antes que cualquier
rival, se mantuvo en sus bastiones y solo hizo unos cambios de
personal. ``Fue grato ver que la compania no cambio su
estrategia,'' senala Piedrahita, de Citibank.
 &HT;    Los banqueros que perdieron sus empleos por el efecto tequila
hallaron puestos similares trabajando con deuda de alto rendimiento
en otros lugares, sobre todo en los mercados emergentes del Sudeste
Asiatico y Rusia. ``Como la demanda en Rusia era muy alta,''
recuerda Rivera, el cazatalentos, ``si uno demostraba que habia
trabajado en mercados emergentes, podia encontrar trabajo en
cualquier lugar.'' Y todavia habia empleos en America Latina.
Brasil, el gigante dormido, desperto con algunas de las mayores
privatizaciones del mundo. Abundaban las emisiones de deuda
empresarial y soberana. Parecia que la region seguiria su marcha
hacia la estabilidad y el crecimiento economico.
 &HT;    Pero la realidad tenia otros planes. Tras el colapso en Asia,
que se inicio en Tailandia a mediados de 1997, y el derrumbe
financiero ruso en agosto de 1998, la mayor economia de Sudamerica
se tambaleo. En los meses anteriores a la devaluacion del real en
enero, la decada del auge latinoamericano llego a un abrupto final.
Las grandes casas internacionales de corretaje cambiaron su forma
de cubrir la region.
 &HT;    El argentino Ruben Fernandez, que entro en el departamento de
renta fija de Santander cuando el banco espanol compro el Banco Rio
de la Plata en septiembre de 1997, tuvo que irse un ano despues. La
experiencia le dejo dudas sobre la relacion de los inversionistas
extranjeros con America Latina. ``Algunas casas inversoras han
tenido una presencia muy erratica en Latinoamerica,'' apunta. Acusa
a la mayor parte de los bancos de buscar ganancias inmediatas sin
hacer un compromiso autentico con la region.
 &HT;    Desde luego, el negocio de los bancos es ganar dinero, no hacer
compromisos. Pero para los jovenes idealistas que trabajaban
pensando que participaban en un cambio profundo, la mentalidad de
concentrarse en los dolares y centavos es un dobleolpe para los que
perdieron sus empleos a la vez que se desplomaba el panorama
financiero a corto plazo de la region.
 &HT;    Hoy comodamente instalado en el mundo universitario como
profesor de Derecho en la Universidad de San Diego, Frank Partnoy,
ex corredor de derivados latinoamericanos, se fue de Wall Street en
1995 tras acusar a su propia casa de corretaje, Morgan Stanley, de
imponer productos riesgosos a clientes desprevenidos. Observando la
sangria mas reciente en Wall Street, Partnoy dice que siente mas
pena que rencor al ver tantos despidos.
 &HT;    ``Todo eso me parece muy triste,'' comenta Partnoy, autor del
aclamado F.I.A.S.C.O., sangre en el agua de Wall Street. ``Uno se
define como un Amo del Universo, pierde el puesto y cuando busca
trabajo, descubre que en los empleos vacantes solo puede ganar una
fraccion de lo que ganaba. Y eso afecta a cualquiera.''
 &HT;    Para la generacion de latinoamericanos emprendedores de Wall
Street, la crisis actual ha tenido un efecto moderador, reconoce
Piedrahita. Piensa que la proxima vez, algunos escogeran un negocio
mucho menos volatil. Y reflexiona sobre el legado de sus largas
horas de negocios freneticos: ``En general, a todos nos salieron
canas.''

BMW FANS, DON'T READ THIS REPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm going to do two things in this review to try to keep from
looking stupid to BMW fans. I'm not going to call the cars
``Beamers,'' and I promise to try to keep the term ``V-6''
completely out of the article (BMW doesn't have one).
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, I must add this disclaimer: I'm not a big fan
of BMWs, and I don't come close to knowing as much about them as
you aficionados. You who love these machines with a passion will
have read all about the redesigned 3-series sedans in the car-buff
books, so you'll just be reading this out of curiosity. Please look
the other way and chuckle quietly if I make a gaffe.
</P>
<P>
   This review isn't intended for you. It's for folks who don't
know much about BMWs and who might want to learn a little about the
1999 328i sedan so they could add it to their shopping list when
they go car-hunting this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, BMW has redesigned only the sedans in the 3-series.
The coupe and convertible models carry over basically unchanged
from last year. The last major 3-series redesign, in 1992, brought
the E36 cars. The new sedans are designated E46 models.
</P>
<P>
   There are two new 3-series sedans for 1999, and both have inline
six-cylinder engines. The base 323i (list price $26,400) has a
2.5-liter engine, and the uplevel 328i (list price $33,400) has a
2.8-liter powerplant.
</P>
<P>
   Although these sedans represent a new generation of the
3-series, BMW has taken a gentler approach to changes than it did
when the E36 series was introduced seven years ago. The body is
new, but it still looks much like its predecessor. BMW describes
the changes as an ``evolution'' rather than a ``revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The 3-series literature says the design ``is not trendy,''
because if it were, ``it could not stay fresh'' during the average
eight years that a BMW design is expected to stay on the market. Of
course, the other consideration is that radically changing the
design of a luxury car immediately outdates the previous
generation, making a whole bunch of loyal owners spitting mad.
</P>
<P>
   That's the reason most luxury-car makers seldom make radical
changes from generation to generation. BMW owners should recognize
the differences in the new 3-series sedans, but those differences
will be transparent to the rest of the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Refinements'' to the E46 body include a grille similar to
those of the 7- and 5-series models. It is set into the hood, and
``sweeps right down to the front bumper,'' to use BMW's
description. And I love this part: ``At the same time, the grille
now thrusts farther forward to symbolize the way this car moves
ahead ... '' Puh-leeeze!
</P>
<P>
   Changes have been made in the headlights, the roof line is
longer, and wheel arches are larger to incorporate bigger wheels
(16-inch in the 328i and 17-inch in the 328i Sport models).
</P>
<P>
   The engines have had ``enhancements'' but aren't radically
different from last year's. The four-cylinder engine is no longer
available in a 3-series sedan, and that's great news. The
four-cylinder is just too anemic for a BMW. (That was a change made
last year, which leaves the 318ti coupe as the only four-cylinder
BMW on the market).
</P>
<P>
   Changes in the engines include a new, lighter aluminum cylinder
block, a new variable valve timing system, a thermoplastic intake
manifold, newly configured fuel injectors, and electronically
controlled engine cooling.
</P>
<P>
   Our test car, the 328i Sport model, came with a five-speed
manual transmission. That gearbox is basically unchanged from the
previous year, but there is a new self-adjusting clutch for 1999. A
brand-new five-speed automatic transmission is available, but if
you're going to buy a BMW to have some fun driving it, why bother
with an automatic?
</P>
<P>
   With the manual transmission, the 328i goes from zero to 60 mph
in 6.6 seconds. With the automatic, that climbs to 7.2 seconds. Top
speed is electronically limited to 128 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Road handling is typical BMW: These cars like curves, and they
show it.
</P>
<P>
   The new body is more rigid than before, and I believe ride
comfort has improved slightly. But that's not necessarily a good
thing. BMWs in this class never have had a true luxury feel,
because they are designed to be drivers' cars, not passengers'
cars. These are among the few cars left that retain a feel for the
road through the steering wheel and suspension system, rather than
keeping the driver fully insulated in a cushy package. If BMW ever
changes that, the company will be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a roomy car; the EPA designates it a compact based on
its 90-cubic-foot interior volume. The front bucket seats are
comfortable enough, but it's difficult to get into and out of this
car, and the rear seat is not really suited to full-size adults.
The trunk holds just 10.7 cubic feet of stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The brakes have been extensively upgraded, BMW says, because
company engineers weren't satisfied with those of the
previous-generation cars. The discs are now ventilated front and
rear, and a new system called ``electronic brake proportioning''
has been introduced to even out the braking pressure on all four
wheels. That helps overcome the tendency of a vehicle to put the
majority of braking pressure on its front wheels when the brakes
are applied. In most cars, because the weight of the vehicle shifts
to the front while stopping, the front brakes do about 70 percent
of the work.
</P>
<P>
   Standard features on the 328i include four-wheel antilock
brakes, all-season traction control, speed-sensitive power
steering, dual front and side air bags for the front occupants,
automatic climate control, keyless entry, antitheft AM/FM/cassette
stereo with 10 speakers (prewired for compact disc changer),
six-way power front seats, power windows and door locks, cruise
control, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Our car came with the gray leather interior package ($1,450),
titanium silver metallic paint ($475), and the sport package
($1,350), which included 17-inch star-spoke alloy wheels, as well
as the sport suspension, steering wheel and seats.
</P>
<P>
   Total price of the test vehicle was $37,245 (including $570
transportation charge).
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are highly respectable: 20 miles per
gallon in the city and 29 mpg on the highway. The tank holds 16.6
gallons, and premium fuel is recommended.

GOOD STORY (AND MUSIC) IN `THE HARMONISTS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Harmonists,'' a tight European drama about the rise and
fall of one of the century's greatest vocal groups, is story-driven
filmmaking of the sort that doesn't much get made any longer.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing flashy about it _ the plot is basic
rags-to-riches, with a few fascinating historical subtleties _ but
Joseph Vilsmaier's heartfelt direction, Klaus Richter's thoughtful
screenplay and the cast's nuanced acting make for a brisk,
well-told tale.
</P>
<P>
   If you're in a speculative mood, ``The Harmonists'' (in German,
with subtitles) might remind you of ``The Commitments.'' The
difference being, of course, that ``The Commitments'' concerns a
contemporary Irish soul band that never existed (except in package
tours), while ``The Harmonists'' has to do with a syncopated
close-harmony male singing group that wowed Berlin in the late
1920s and soon thereafter seduced the world.
</P>
<P>
   They call themselves the Comedian Harmonists, and there are six
of them. Erwin Bootz (Kai Wiesinger) is the flighty pianist. Ari
Leschnikoff (Max Tidof) is the womanizing tenor. Erich Collin
(Heinrich Schafmeister) is the monocled baritone. Robert Biberti
(Ben Becker) is the corn-blond bass. Roman Cycowski (Heino Ferch)
is the other tenor, a profoundly religious Jew. And Harry
Frommermann (Ulrich Noethen) is the ensemble's fierce musical
engine, its founder, arranger, comic baritone, romantic idealist
and driving creative force. He is also, as it happens, Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Their true story _ which has already spawned two stage musicals,
one of them written by Barry Manilow _ has a good deal of soap in
it, examining the group's snarled love lives as well as their
bounding careers. But there are deeper levels, too, layers of
humanity and political tension sprung from the film's setting
between the two world wars. In an ensemble comprised of Jews and
staunch Aryans, conflict is inevitable _ with the government, and
with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises an interesting point: As accustomed as we've
become, these days, to Nazi-peopled period films, it's rare to find
one that addresses the struggle of musicians.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s the Third Reich placed severe restrictions on the
types of music played and the types of performers allowed to play
it. Jewish composers were banned. Jewish musicians were banned. And
as ``The Harmonists'' makes wistfully clear, a lot of careers
cracked up. (Many who failed to escape Nazi Germany in time landed
in the Theresienstadt concentration camp, where they continued to
make music before being shuttled off to the Auschwitz gas chambers,
but that's another story.)
</P>
<P>
   In one of the film's most affecting scenes, Harry and Robert
meet with a minister of the Reich Music Association to discuss
``the non-Aryans in the group.'' He commands them to quit singing
works by Jewish composers and threatens to ban the ensemble if they
fail to comply. Then, stiffly adjusting in his seat, he pulls out
one of the band's hit records and pushes it slowly across the desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I do have a small request,'' he says, and asks them for
autographs. His nephew, it seems, is a fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Harmonists'' is built on such moments, elegant emotional
interplay that finds revelation in small things. Nothing is awkward
about it: Unlike a lot of fact-based dramas, Vilsmaier treats
history with an unfailingly dexterous touch. It zooms along,
hopping from Berlin night club to velvet celebrity to hints of the
century's darkest rumblings.
</P>
<P>
   The film's only real annoyance is its unidimensional female
characters, who consist of hookers, wives, assorted paramours and
mothers carting plates of sauerbraten.
</P>
<P>
   Noethen is mesmerizing as Harry _ his cool glare hides real fire
_ and Becker fills his role with great, blowhard puffs of ego.
Their performances, and Ferch's quiet turn as the spiritual Roman,
are standouts in a film of even-keeled artistry.
</P>
<P>
   In case you're wondering, those airtight, honeyed tones you hear
on the soundtrack are, in fact, those of the Comedian Harmonists.
Rather than hire a modern vocal group to render the group's old
tunes, the filmmakers dubbed in the originals. It was a smart move;
the recordings are clean, the cast lip-syncs convincingly, and the
results are enchanting throw-backs to an earlier era. So, in its
way, is the film.

WOODSTOCK TURNS 30, OFFERING MUSIC FOR NEW ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREG HAYMES  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ ``Never trust anyone over 30'' was the battle cry
of the 1960s' Woodstock Nation, but this summer the ultimate rock
festival will itself turn 30 with a musical celebration for a new
generation.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the pop-'n'-rock music scene has splintered
into dozens of different factions ranging from funk-rock to
skate-punk to gangsta-rap, yet the Woodstock '99 festival slated
for July 23-25 at the former Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome
promises to be a literal gathering of the tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Such stylistically diverse musicians as Alanis Morissette, Korn,
Jewel, DMX, Metallica, Sugar Ray, the Dave Matthews Band and Willie
Nelson are among the 31 contemporary music acts announced Thursday
as performers at the three-day festival, marking the 30th
anniversary of the legendary 1969 Woodstock rock fest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three more days of mud, noise and logistical nightmares?
Wouldn't miss it for the world,'' said Metallica drummer Lars
Ulrich.
</P>
<P>
   Musically speaking, all roads will lead to Rome on Woodstock
weekend as this year's fest is expected to attract 250,000 fans to
the 3,600-acre Griffiss Park.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets will be $150 for the three-day festival and will go on
sale at 9 a.m. April 25 at Ticketmaster outlets or by charging by
phone or through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Other performers announced Thursday include Aerosmith, Bush, the
Chemical Brothers, George Clinton, Collective Soul, Counting Crows,
Creed, Sheryl Crow, Everlast, Fatboy Slim, Foo Fighters, Guster,
Ice Cube, Limp Bizkit, Live, Los Lobos, Rage Against the Machine,
Red Hot Chili Peppers, Rusted Root, the Brian Setzer Orchestra, the
Offspring and the Tragically Hip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woodstock isn't just a concert _ it's a rite of passage,''
festival co-producer Michael Lang said by telephone Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lang also was one of the producers of Woodstock '94 in and the
original 1969 Woodstock Festival in Bethel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woodstock has become the Olympics of live music, so that every
five years we can step out of ourselves and celebrate diversity,
great music and each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The musical lineup features no musicians who performed at the
'69 Woodstock fest and only five _ Aerosmith, Sheryl Crow, Live,
Metallica and Red Hot Chili Peppers _ who played at the 25th
anniversary fest in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a festival that is designed for 17- to 28-year-olds,
not people in their 40s and 50s,'' said festival co-producer John
Scher. ``This is a huge commitment to come and camp and spend the
weekend with several hundred of your most intimate friends _ to
interact from a sociological and political basis as much as
watching a lot of great musical acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Producers indicated that probably about another half dozen
performers _ including ``a little more representation in the
hip-hop area,'' according to Scher _ will be added to the festival
lineup at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're looking for first and foremost is to capture the
spirit of the music of today _ to get the best and the biggest
bands performing today,'' Lang said. ``And then from that point,
we're trying to be a bit eclectic about who we book and also to
introduce bands that we feel are going to be important in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The bands will be performing on two main stages, located about a
mile apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't made a commitment yet, but we're considering adding
one more performance area that may be indoors or in the campgrounds
that would feature really brand new emerging artists,'' Scher said.
</P>
<P>
   While there currently are no plans to make a movie of the event
as was done at the '69 fest, Lang indicated that a pay-per-view
television broadcast of the event was a probability.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Woodstock 25th anniversary event in '94 lost money,
Scher _ who also co-produced that event _ was eager to try it
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just an extraordinary, incredible experience,'' Scher
said. ``History did indeed repeat itself. I don't know why. You put
a few hundred thousand kids in a field in upstate New York and
certain things happen. The pure magic of that, quite honestly, was
too irresistible not to try it one more time.''

NEW `NYPD BLUE' COP PASSES MUSTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Random thoughts bounced around my aching head on the first
depressing Friday since ``The Sopranos'' ended its epic first
season:
</P>
<P>
   _ In a pretty lame TV season with some bright flashes, the
greatest surprise remains Rick Schroder.
</P>
<P>
   As each new episode of ``NYPD Blue'' passes, the brilliance of
selecting the ``Silver Spoons'' alum to replace Jimmy Smits back in
December comes into greater focus. No one is snickering anymore, as
we did last summer when it was announced he was joining the show.
</P>
<P>
   The initial plan, according to co-creator David Milch, was for
Danny Sorenson to be somewhat of a rube. Sorenson has turned out to
be street-wise beyond his 28 years. On Tuesday, he even began
developing into a confidant of Andy Sipowicz (Denniz Franz).
</P>
<P>
   _ With all the new cartoons out there, the hottest one may be
... ``Scooby-Doo.'' Still shown on TBS and the Cartoon Network in
reruns (blow off those latter-day Scrappy-Doo episodes), Shaggy,
Scooby, Velma, Freddy, Daphne and, of course, The Mystery Machine,
are popping up on T-shirts, hats, Volkswagen ads, other shows
(including ``Family Guy,'' in a hilarious bit this Sunday).
</P>
<P>
   Question: Why does the rail-thin Shaggy always have the
munchies?
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Titanic'' finally docks on television with its premiere at 8
p.m. Saturday on HBO. I saw the flick once, on a cross-country
flight last year. Halfway through, a thought hit me: Wait a minute,
this is a transportation disaster film ...
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Mod Squad'' stunk, according to reviews, and ``My
Favorite Martian'' was worse. ``Wild, Wild West'' and ``South
Park'' are coming out this summer. Now Hollywood is talking about a
movie version of ``Charlie's Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   What's next? Here are some wholly unsolicited and probably
useless suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``WKRP in Cincinnati.'' Steve Buscemi as Dr. Johnny Fever,
Chris Rock as Venus Flytrap, Crispin Glover as Les Nessman, Dabney
Coleman as Herb Tarlek.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``The Waltons.'' Sam Watterston as John Walton, Meryl Streep
as Olivia Walton, Chris O'Donnell as John Boy, Wilford Brimley as
Grandpa Zeb Walton.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``My So-Called Life.'' Claire Danes can still play the part.
</P>
<P>
   While we're at it, here are three television-to-theater movies
we hope are never made:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Hazel.'' This has Roseanne written all over it.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``The Love Boat.'' Your captain: Kevin Costner.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Veronica's Closet.'' Actually, it would be worth sitting
through the two hours if they promised never to make another
episode again.
</P>
<P>
   _ Edie Falco looked familiar when she first popped up on ``The
Sopranos.'' Of course: she is also simultaneously in another great
HBO series, ``Oz.'' Then this week I rediscovered from a friend
another reason why I knew her: She was in my graduating class at
Northport High School on Long Island, N.Y. In our senior year she
had the lead in the school production of ``My Fair Lady.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Just like any new mayor, Jason Nastke did the basics: Got
sworn in, settled into his office _ and appeared on ``Letterman.''
The 19-year-old mayor of Valatie, N.Y., was a guest on the ``Late
Show with David Letterman'' April 1. And he was good, even getting
Dave to crack up a few times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only one who didn't take me serious(ly) was the current
mayor,'' Nastke said. ``Now he is the ex-mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Letterman's on-air conclusion: ``Wow. you are pretty slick. You
are pretty good.''

SCREEN SAVERS, THREE STOOGES ARE A JOKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: My screen saver stays on about 10 minutes and
then goes off. I think I must have made a mistake installing it.
</P>
<P>
   _ New to Computers
</P>
<P>
   DEAR NEW: Now why do people always assume they're the ones who
made a mistake when something goes kerflooey with their computers?
Trust me, most of the problems originate in faulty software design
or loony notions about how you should be forced to use your
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Screen savers are a good example. Back in the olden days, a
screen saver was necessary unless you wanted to see ``WordStar''
burned permanently into your monitor's phosphors. The way modern
monitors are designed, nobody really needs one. They're more of a
novelty, allowing you to think you're cooler than the other geeks
in the office because you have winged toasters flying all over your
screen.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not going to make fun of anybody for using screen savers,
though, because if you actually think they make you a supercool
hepcat, you obviously have much bigger problems to deal with. No,
what upsets me is how all the different screen-saving techniques
your computer employs work together about as well as the Three
Stooges on a plumbing job.
</P>
<P>
   That's your problem, New. Moe's pounding Curly over the head
with a big monkey wrench, and Larry's off on his own, digging up
the lawn, looking for the shutoff valve.
</P>
<P>
   All three are trying to blank your screen. Moe is the built-in
operating system, a program on a chip that runs the show when you
start up your computer. Moe usually has his power-saving mode
turned on, and he likes to turn your monitor and hard drive off
when he thinks you're not looking. Curly is your screen saver,
obliviously building a rat's nest of water pipes on your monitor
until Moe whacks him a good one and shuts it down. And poor, dopey
Larry is Windows, blithely off in some other world with a power
scheme all his own.
</P>
<P>
   You need to show these numbskulls who the boss is. First, tell
Moe to keep his hands off the power controls. You'll have to check
your owner's manual to get into the system setup program, but
that's where you can turn off power management. Next, yank out a
big hunk of Larry's hair so he'll pay attention. In the control
panel, click on the power management icon. Depending on your
Windows version, you may have a checkbox that lets Larry control
the power. Uncheck it. Or there may be separate settings for
turning off the monitor and the hard drive. I set them to
``never.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Curly. He's basically harmless. Let him build his
pipes.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: This is just a ``heads-up'' on a word you have
used in your column: nimrod. It is actually a great honor to be
called a nimrod. The dictionary defines ``nimrod'' as a ``great
hunter or sportsman.'' I hate having you use this appellation as
one of derision, when, in fact, it is quite the opposite!
</P>
<P>
   _ Word Czar
</P>
<P>
   DEAR CZAR: Oh, I understand now! You obviously didn't realize
that words mean what I want them to. Nimrod is simply too goofy a
word to use any other way. As for the dictionary: What a pile of
gorp! Now I suppose next you'll be telling me ``gorp'' is just
trail mix.

information about what the NATO forces are doing. Yeah, we get news
about what was hit, but little else about our side _ much less than

   BEN (Kansas City, Mo.) _ At the end of World War II, South
Kansas Citian Ben Alvarado was part of the 80th Infantry Division
unit that conquered the tiny German town of Weimar. What the
conqueror's didn't do was destroy the place, and the people there
have been grateful for that ever since. This weekend, Alvarado will
be back in Weimar as part of a celebration organized by the people
Weimar to thank the Americans who spared their town. For Alvarado,
it's pretty confusing to embrace former enemies like this. The war,
by the way, changed his life profoundly. He was severely wounded
and had some psychological adjustment to do upon returning home.
And his younger brother Mike, who lied about his age to enlist,

DREW BARRYMORE MAKES A GREAT NERD IN `KISSED' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first, ``Never Been Kissed'' doesn't seem to have anything
going for it: a geeky copy editor at the Chicago Sun-Times who goes
back to school to fulfill her dreams of being a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry. It even has the limpest title of the recent crop. But the
film, directed with knowing affection by Raja Grosnell, has the wit
and fearless self-awareness its months-old predecessors were afraid
of. It also has Drew Barrymore in a wacky, madcap performance
Goldie Hawn should use if she starts teaching little foxes roaming
the Hollywood Hills how to be uproarious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kissed'' is the first movie to which Barrymore brings more
than what the script asks her. Always a sunflower of
infectiousness, she usually sparkles to the point where it looks
like she's having more fun than she should be. Where Hawn was often
capable of putting her bubbles away, Barrymore's on-screen
solemnity had the obvious complexity of the lead in a school play.
</P>
<P>
   As Josie, the copy editor who desperately wants to be a writer,
Barrymore throws herself headlong into one 25-year-old's
self-esteemless plight for corridor-wide popularity. And Barrymore
suffers the girl's mountain of humiliation like the rubber-faced
phenom of pratfalls the role calls for.
</P>
<P>
   The film could succeed on its star's glee alone, but Grosnell,
working from a snappy script by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein, has
a terrific time juggling contempo camp and cheese. When not
plodding through tired scenes of more Hollywood newsrooms (this
one's presided over by Garry Marshall), ``Kissed'' gets an
earthbound whiff of ``Peggy Sue Got Married,'' moving between
Josie's sickly high school flashbacks circa '89 and her attempts to
find a salable story about ``young people'' before she and her
editor (John C. Reilly) get the hook.
</P>
<P>
   (Apparently, Hollywood would have us believe there's as much
pressure to get on this teen spirit bandwagon at newspapers as
there is at movie studios.)
</P>
<P>
   Faster than you can say Riley Weston, Josie is 17 again, trying
everything she can to be cool, but she falls in with the school
nerds, led by the unlikely but convincing Aldys (Leelee Sobieski).
Leave it to her equally daffy, formerly popular bro (David
Arquette) to reverse her rep by joining Josie undercover and still
out-cooling her. Where ``Never Been Kissed'' succeeds is in its
unabashed refusal to stoop to choosing sides in the high-school
hipness war. The kids are clique-y but with a comic humanity that
elevates jocks, geeks and airheads above archetype status.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, however. This is a chick flick so powerful it
can turn a high school baseball game into a love connection.
</P>
<P>
   But it's one with the open-mindedness to give its heroine the
option of the hot student (Jeremy Jordan, looking like he wandered
in from the ``Velvet Goldmine'' set) or the sensitive teacher
(Michael Vartan) with the hots for her.
</P>
<P>
   It's a testament to Barrymore's screwball legitimacy that she's
neither upstaged by quirkmeisters Molly Shannon (as Josie's
hilariously sexed-up co-worker) and Arquette nor out-geeked by the
luminously awkward Sobieski. But it's lousy that Arquette never
breaks into his ``800-CALL-ATT'' dance and gives us a free call.
We'd ring Barrymore and tell her we love her best as a full-tilt
dork.

OPPOSITES ATTRACT, AND IGNITE, IN `ANGELS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By G. ALLEN JOHNSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Certainly it's a cineaste's cliche to say that French films are
driven by character and American films are driven by plot. In ``The
Dreamlife of Angels,'' the two characters rivetingly played by
young actresses Elodie Bouchez and Natacha Regnier are just plain
driven.
</P>
<P>
   They're behind the wheel, all right, pressing the pedal to the
mettle and leaving the rest of us in their rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   The performances by Bouchez and Regnier are so complete and full
of dimension that last year's Cannes Film Festival jury, headed by
Martin Scorsese and with Sigourney Weaver and Winona Ryder, awarded
both performers the best actress award. The film itself won
France's prize for best film, the Cesar.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the French city of Lille, Isa (Bouchez), a wanderer,
blows into town selling tacky, homemade postcards. When offered a
chance at a real job at a sewing factory, she accepts.
</P>
<P>
   Her sewing is suspect, but her strong attraction to a co-worker,
Marie (Regnier), is not. Soon they are roommates, spending all
their time together working, chasing boys and exploring their
newfound freedom as 20-year-old adults. They live in a cool
apartment that became available after the previous tenant, a young
woman, lapsed into a coma after an accident.
</P>
<P>
   But little clues soon suggest Marie may have something terribly
wrong with her. She has unexplained angry outbursts, such as when
they argue about boys. She doesn't seem concerned about the girl in
a coma. And she has emotionless sex with her boyfriend, who has
real feelings for her.
</P>
<P>
   Isa begins as seemingly the most troubled spirit of the two, but
her true colors soon show. Whereas Marie tries to shove her
feelings deep inside, as if they don't exist, Isa welcomes a chance
to express herself and to learn from others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dreamlife of Angels'' is the feature debut of Erick Zonca,
who perhaps knows a thing or two about rootlessness. He spent his
20s living in different places, working odd jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Zonca made this film at age 42, and that says something, too.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when the thirst for ``cutting edge'' has movie
industries on both sides of the Atlantic shoving 20-somethings
behind the camera in search of the next wunderkind, the sense of
maturity Zonca displays stands out.
</P>
<P>
   A ``wunderkind'' could not have made this.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the freshness of youth pervades ``The Dreamlife of Angels,''
in the personas of its two impetuous leads. Bouchez, best known as
the female star of Andre Techine's ``Wild Reeds,'' has impressive
range and makes unpredictable choices. Regnier, originally from
Belgium, is making her reputation with this role, and her ability
to visually suggest many moods without words gives her an alluring,
mysterious quality.
</P>
<P>
   At once an intriguing mix of naivete and world-weariness,
Bouchez and Regnier make us care about two young women who find out
about the harsh realities of life a bit too quickly, before they
had the chance to enjoy their innocence.

<P>
   The rumbles of yet another nationalist earthquake are shaking
the former Yugoslavia. Rising from the fetid hovels of Pristina and
the concrete-block family farms of rural Kosovo is the newest
political and military force to beset the Balkans _ the Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA), known to Albanians as the Ushtria Clirimtare
e Kosoves.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of this militant armed group, now numbering
several thousand fighters, has dimmed hopes that even a compromise
agreement with Belgrade could be successfully implemented.
Emboldened by NATO's March bombing of the Serbian military, the KLA
will wage a protracted guerrilla war in the Serbian province that
could ignite a wider war in neighboring Macedonia and Albania,
potentially even dragging in Greece and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA is uncompromising in its quest for an independent Kosovo
now and a Greater Albania later. And it has, to the consternation
of Washington's would-be peacemakers, supplanted the ineffectual
leadership of the moderate voice of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
majority, Ibrahim Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA is important out of all proportion to its size _ not
merely because it will probably eventually get Kosovo to secede
from Serbia, but because it now represents the aspirations of most
Kosovar Albanians. To understand the current conflict in Kosovo and
America's stakes in its resolution, one must understand the KLA,
how it came into being, who leads it, what drives it and why it now
speaks for a majority of Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   Even a truly vicious, Bosnia-like wave of atrocities by the
Serbs in reprisal for NATO's attacks will only pour fuel on the
separatist fire. The grim reality is that we had better get to know
the KLA _ because it is not going to go away.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo's Albanians have grown increasingly embittered. By
attempting to include the KLA in the peace process that began in
February at the French chateau of Rambouillet, the Western alliance
is working feverishly _ even as it bombs the Serbs _ to blunt the
momentum toward a war of independence.
</P>
<P>
   The allies want NATO troops to separate the province's warring
factions, although Belgrade is wary. The underlying idea behind
creating a theoretically temporary, NATO- enforced military
protectorate in Kosovo is to buy time for a three-year transition
period in which ethnic Albanians will be allowed to elect a
parliament and other governing bodies _ meeting enough of their
aspirations, it is hoped, to keep Kosovo from seceding.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the Western alliance's response to the
Kosovo crisis, however ragged, shows that some lessons have been
learned from the bumbling in Bosnia. The Europeans no longer talk
about handling matters alone but demand the presence of the United
States. Threats have been backed up by force.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a consensus that if some kind of a solution is not
found soon, the fighting inside Kosovo _ an area the size of
Connecticut _ will accelerate and make future intervention
difficult, if not impossible. Even the Pentagon officials who
fought like wildcats to keep U.S. forces out of Bosnia accept that
some 4,000 U.S. troops will have to be deployed in Kosovo to make
any peacekeeping force credible.
</P>
<P>
   But, as in Bosnia, the West is wedded to a solution that might
have worked earlier in the conflict but is now untenable. Serbian
ethnic cleansing has taken on a somewhat different character in
Kosovo than in Bosnia. In Kosovo, Serbian ethnic cleansing is to a
large degree tactical, designed to deny the rebels succor from
civilians and therefore aimed primarily at the inhabitants of KLA
strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   But the Serb campaign has been more than brutal enough to make
autonomy for Kosovo a nonstarter. The ethnic Albanians in Kosovo,
who make up 90 percent of its 2 million inhabitants, cannot remain
in Serbia after the horrific recent bloodshed, the displacement of
a quarter of a million people, and the razing of scores of
villages.
</P>
<P>
   They do not trust Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic or the
Serbs _ and given Belgrade's bloody campaigns against ethnic
minorities over the past decade and its habit of breaking
agreements, who can blame them?
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians have been radicalized, and their new voice is the
KLA. Rugova, the old pacifist, is more a symbol of outmoded
moderation than a leader.
</P>
<P>
   By ignoring the plight of the Kosovar Albanians for nearly a
decade, the West lost much of its credibility before NATO began
bombing. Many Albanians feel let down by the world and their own
meek leaders. What is most striking, then, about the KLA
insurrection is not that it occurred but that it took so long to
occur.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA fighters are the province's new power brokers. Whatever
political leadership emerges in Kosovo will come from the rebel
ranks, and it will be militant, nationalist, uncompromising and
deeply suspicious of all outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence agencies, preoccupied with tracking militant
Islamist groups and Iranian agents in Bosnia, were caught off guard
by the Kosovo rebel force's emergence, strength and popularity.
Indeed, some diplomats argued as late as last year about whether
the shadowy group really existed _ even as small armed bands roamed
Drenica in central Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The first KLA armed attack took place in May 1993, killing two
Serb police officers and wounding five more. But the rebel group _
its membership largely drawn from a few clans in Kosovo and
radicals in the Albanian diaspora _ was founded eight years ago.
Most of its leadership has spent years in prison for separatist
activity, many having been jailed earlier by Tito's communist
government.
</P>
<P>
   Like all revolutionaries who have spent years underground or in
jail, the KLA leaders are wary of the outside world and given to
secrecy, paranoia and appalling mendacity when they feel it serves
their interests, which is most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA splits down a bizarre ideological divide, with hints of
fascism on one side and whiffs of communism on the other. The
former faction is led by the sons and grandsons of rightist
Albanian fighters _ either the heirs of those who fought in the
World War II fascist militias and the Skanderbeg volunteer SS
division raised by the Nazis, or the descendants of the rightist
Albanian rebels who rose up against the Serbs 80 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although never much of a fighting force, the Skanderbeg division
took part in the shameful roundup and deportation of the province's
few hundred Jews during the Holocaust. The division's remnants
fought Tito's Partisans at the end of the war, leaving thousands of
ethnic Albanians dead.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by KLA commanders to dress their police in black
fatigues and order their fighters to salute with a clenched fist to
the forehead led many to worry about these fascist antecedents.
Following such criticism, the salute has been changed to the
traditional open-palm salute common in the U.S. Army.
</P>
<P>
   The second KLA faction, comprising most of the KLA leaders in
exile, are old Stalinists who were once bankrolled by the
xenophobic Enver Hoxha, the dictator of Albania who died in 1985.
This group led a militant separatist movement that was really about
integration with Hoxha's Albania. Most of these leaders were
students at Pristina University after 1974, when Belgrade granted
the province autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Freed from Yugoslav oversight, the university imported thousands
of textbooks from Albania, all carefully edited by Hoxha's
Stalinist regime, along with at least a dozen militant Albanian
professors. Along with its degree programs, Pristina University
began to quietly school young Kosovar leaders in the art of
revolution. Not only did a huge percentage of the KLA leadership
come out of the university, but so, ominously, did the ethnic
Albanian leadership in neighboring Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The two KLA factions have little sympathy with or understanding
of democratic institutions. Split bitterly between radical left and
radical right, they are now arguing over whether to carry the
fighting to the pockets of ethnic Albanians who live in western
Macedonia and neighboring Montenegro. The only thing they agree on
is the need to liberate Kosovo from Serbian rule. All else,
menacingly, will be decided later. It is not said how.
</P>
<P>
   Given these deep divisions, it is no accident that the KLA has
failed to create a political organization or even a vague platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think we have an ideology,'' Jakup Krasniqi, the
KLA's mercurial spokesman, told the Albanian-language daily Koha
Ditore on July 12, 1998. ``And in fact we do not have time for such
things even if we were interested in them, because we have our main
job to do, which is the task of liberation.''

<P>
   I first stumbled into the Kosovo Liberation Army in February
1997, shortly after a police car was ambushed by armed
``terrorists,'' as the Serbs called them.
</P>
<P>
   Three uniformed ethnic Albanians equipped with automatic weapons
were killed in the firefight. I took a taxi that had seen better
days to attend the wake for one of them.
</P>
<P>
   As I approached the village of Orlane, a few lean men in track
suits were standing about 20 feet apart on either side of the dirt
road. Several of the mourners proved hostile, lashing out at my
translator as a ``spy'' for Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate ethnic
Albanian leader.
</P>
<P>
   That day in Orlane, with its crude outhouses, simple wooden
structures and roaming flocks of goats and noisy chickens, offered
a glimpse into an armed rebellion that was still a year away.
</P>
<P>
   The slain man, Zahir Pajaziti, 34, had studied English at
Pristina University before dropping out. He had never held a steady
job and had been on the run for several months, appearing
unannounced at night, armed and in uniform, to visit his family and
then disappearing before dawn.
</P>
<P>
   He and his two companions had been stopped by police, who
apparently were looking for them, and were killed inside their car.
Mourners told of other small bands setting up roadblocks to collect
``war taxes'' and holding political meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But it was hard to penetrate the group from the inside. Only in
Switzerland, where there was less danger in speaking with a foreign
reporter, did it prove possible to establish links with the
organization. This proved easier than I expected, in large part
because the KLA had then built close ties or melded with much of
Rugova's League of Democratic Kosovo (LDK).
</P>
<P>
   Once the rebellion erupted a year ago, local LDK leaders
immediately picked up weapons and became commanders of village
units. By the time of the uprising, Rugova had lost control of his
own party.
</P>
<P>
   Through the LDK, I arranged a meeting with a rebel commander in
Geneva _ the first such meeting with the press. My interlocutor was
nearly killed some months later when two men with ski masks arrived
at his unmarked office in Geneva and pulled out pistols with
silencers. The assistant who answered the bell, although shot in
the stomach, managed to slam shut the security door, no doubt
saving the official's life. The would-be assassins were never
apprehended. The office has since been closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all feel a deep, deep sense of betrayal,'' the KLA man told
me, echoing a sentiment that seemed to speak for most ethnic
Albanians. ``We mounted a peaceful, civilized protest to fight the
totalitarian rule of Milosevic. We did not go down the road of
nationalist hatred, always respecting Serbian churches and
monasteries. The result is that we were ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton peace negotiations, which dealt with Bosnia but not
Kosovo, ``taught us a painful truth, (that) those that want freedom
must fight for it. This is our sad duty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovar Albanians, with understandable rage, did not grasp
why the Bosnian Serbs, responsible for some of the worst acts of
genocide since World War II, were handed nearly half of Bosnia at
Dayton. The recognition of Radovan Karadzic's gangster statelet,
Republika Srpska, was the final insult. It shattered all hopes for
peaceful change in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Young Albanians have bitterly repudiated not only Serb rule but
also Rugova's older, urbane and educated leadership. Pristina's
elites, they say, have betrayed the Albanian cause.
</P>
<P>
   On April 6, 1998, in the town of Jablanica, 30 miles north of
Dakovica, I bumped into a group of surly KLA fighters, dressed in a
motley collection of uniforms and equipped with an odd assortment
of hunting rifles, pistols, automatic weapons and hunting knives.
Killings by Belgrade, and the the humiliation of 10 years of abuse,
had left them seething with resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our territory,'' said a gaunt, nervous rebel with a
scraggly black beard and a chrome-plated pistol protruding from his
belt. ``We are through with these Albanian intellectuals in
Pristina, with journalists, diplomats, and everyone else. No one
saved our women and children from slaughter. Now it is up to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the uprising in Kosovo last spring, the KLA had only a
couple hundred members. The most prominent inside Kosovo was Adem
Jashari, a gruff, taciturn peasant who, with his brother Hamza, had
been on the run from Serb authorities for months. They were among
the handful of militants who founded the KLA in 1991 before it
mushroomed into a popular army, much like the Islamist resistance
in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, they came closest to running the
organization, and many of their lieutenants and relatives _ at
least the ones that have survived _ now run the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   I had tried fruitlessly over three days in late 1997 to speak to
the Jasharis, spending one afternoon pleading with Shaban, their
70-year-old father, to pass on a message. He refused. His sons were
increasingly wanted men. Just a few weeks before, on Nov. 28, 1997,
uniformed KLA fighters had, for the first time, appeared before a
large crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Before some 20,000 mourners at the funeral of a schoolteacher
slain by the Serbs, two KLA leaders delivered a rousing call for
liberation that was greeted with a roar of approval and thunderous
chants of ``KLA! KLA! KLA!''
</P>
<P>
   A few days after Ramadan ended I was called to Geneva and told
that on Feb. 17, I should be waiting outside the old religious
school in Pristina at 8 a.m. I would be allowed to bring a
photographer.
</P>
<P>
   At the assigned hour, Wade Goddard, our photographer, and I
stood in the cold as two young men, both in jeans and wearing
combat boots, walked swiftly toward us. ``Be here at three o'clock
tomorrow, and make sure you are not followed,'' said one in broken
English. In less than a minute, they had vanished.
</P>
<P>
   We spent the next morning darting in and out of taxis and
walking through back alleys to make sure we were not being tailed.
A KLA official in Switzerland, in an insight into what has become a
respectable intelligence network, had thoughtfully provided me with
the name of the undercover cop who hung out in my small hotel in
Pristina to report on my activities.
</P>
<P>
   As we traveled the next day to Prekaz, the small town in central
Kosovo that was the Jasharis' headquarters, the group's well-oiled
underground network was evident. Men along the road signaled with
their hands that the way was clear of Serb checkpoints. When we
entered Prekaz, the driver honked the horn three times, and a group
of about a dozen men emerged from a shed to watch us.
</P>
<P>
   We turned up into a field covered with a thin layer of snow and
were stopped by a half-dozen heavily armed men in camouflage
uniforms. All wore on their shoulders the red-and-black KLA patch
with the double-headed Albanian eagle.
</P>
<P>
   We were escorted through the fields and along dirt roads. As our
patrol walked over the thin layer of snow, I noticed that no one
seemed to find the presence of the rebels unusual; even the
children hardly gave us a glance. We reached a small stone
farmhouse surrounded by a wooden fence.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, on cushions set on the floor along the wall, were Adem
and Hamza Jashari. The room, filled with acrid cigarette smoke, was
lit by a single kerosene lamp. Two burly bodyguards, clutching
automatic weapons, stood by the door. The two dirt roads leading
into the village had also been closed after we passed by bands of
armed fighters.
</P>
<P>
   This would be the first and last interview the Jasharis would
give to a reporter. In three weeks, I would be standing over their
bodies in a warehouse. Adem's neck had been slit, probably after he
had died of multiple bullet wounds. Shaban, his elderly father with
whom I had spent an afternoon, lay not far away.
</P>
<P>
   There were 51 corpses, 20 of them members of the Jashari clan,
many of them shot in the head at close range. About two dozen of
the victims were women and children, and some of the bodies were
blackened by the flames that had engulfed their homes.
</P>
<P>
   But that day, the encounter with the Jasharis offered a
revealing look at the contrasts within the KLA. Adem, with his
drooping bandito mustache and hostility, had none of Alban's
polished charm. The fighters around him were suspicious peasants,
prone to lash out at everyone, including Rugova, who was not part
of their inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   They insisted that they would never flee from the village if it
came under attack. Most, in fact, died in their homes, as have
scores of other Kosovar Albanians who have yet to master the basic
tenets of guerrilla warfare.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   As late as April 1998, Belgrade, blind to the looming rebellion
of young Albanians against Serb brutality, blithely continued to
rule Kosovo like a colonial backwater. On several occasions, as a
foreign correspondent for The New York Times, I saw two or three
beefy Serb police officers walloping young ethnic Albanians with
their clubs in the center of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   I once watched a cop shove a young boy of about 10, who held a
small wooden tray of individual cigarettes for sale, onto the
sidewalk. The cop laughed as the frightened child scrambled to
rescue the cigarettes from the mud puddles. Many of the Serb police
were sent to Kosovo as a demotion or a punishment for misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   One of their favorite pastimes was to set up roadblocks and
collect money from a long line of cars for invented traffic
violations. Drivers that did not have money or did not pay had
their documents seized.
</P>
<P>
   All this, however, paled in comparison with the brutal treatment
in Serb jails. People were beaten, tortured (usually while chained
to radiators) and held incommunicado for days and weeks. Some
simply vanished. Bejram Shehi, 39, a laborer in Switzerland, came
home last year to visit his family and was arrested by Serb police.
They accused him of carrying in money for the KLA. He had a black
hood pulled over his head, was handcuffed and was then pushed
through the back door of the police car onto the car floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They joked that they were taking me to see the Kosovo
Liberation Army,'' he said. ``We drove for about an hour. I was
taken out and brought to a basement, where I was stripped and
handcuffed to a radiator. I stayed like this for five days. They
beat me until I fainted, all the time asking about the Kosovo
Liberation Army, who belonged to it, how it raised money abroad,
and where it got its weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   On the fifth day he was forced to sign a confession. ``I
promised to collaborate with them, and they gave me the name of a
police contact,'' he said, unfolding a small slip of white paper
from his wallet with a Serbian name and phone number written in
pencil.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs, meanwhile, lived as if Kosovo were the raj, with all
civil and state jobs and a private police force to ensure their
privileged status in the birthplace of modern Serb nationalism.
Milosevic, presiding over a decaying economy, clung to the millions
of dollars a year in hard cash brought in by Kosovo's massive
Trepca mine complex, valued at $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The mine alone made him loath to give up the province to the
ethnic Albanians; the ultranationalist bigotry he had ridden to
power reinforced his obstinacy. Kosovo came to have the elements of
a political time bomb, ticking louder and louder while the world
looked the other way.
</P>
<P>
   I had my first encounter _ indeed the first interview by any
reporter _ with a rebel commander in April 1997. I'd been standing
with one of the top officials of Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate
Albanian leader. We were in front of the McDonald's in downtown
Geneva on a rainy afternoon. He told me that at 6 p.m., in the
Buffet des Premieres Classes at the Geneva train station, I would
find a man seated in a front booth with a copy of the Journal de
Geneve. The paper, I was told, would be completely unfolded. I was
to come alone. The conversation would take place in French.
</P>
<P>
   Although a few ethnic Albanian reporters had spoken to the
Jasharis, the clan that made up much of the KLA at the start of the
rebellion, none dared write about them or the KLA. This deeply
angered the Jasharis and aided my efforts to reach them.
</P>
<P>
   I walked into the station and saw a lean man in his late
thirties dressed in black jeans, a gray jacket and a purple
T-shirt. He looked up and motioned for me to follow him out the
door. We weaved quickly through the crowds outside the station
until we came to another cafe, where he took a seat along the back
wall facing the door.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel, who gave his nom de guerre as Alban, would within a
year lead a group of a few hundred fighters over the border from
northern Albania into Kosovo. The last I heard, he was commanding a
large unit in the province.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke quietly and without rancor. He said that, like most of
the leadership, he had spent years in prison for separatist
activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no Tito,'' he said. The KLA leadership, he told me,
was divided between about 30 people, with no paramount leader.
These men were drawn primarily from the 5,000 or so ethnic
Albanians who had fought for the Muslim-Croat Federation in Bosnia
against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   In another era the Jashari clan, which oversaw a large
black-market smuggling network, would have faded away into local
folklore. The Balkans are filled with small-time renegades who
combine criminal activity with thin, separatist ideologies.
Instead, by leveling Prekaz with 20 mm antiaircraft cannons and
killing more than 50 people, including many old people, women, and
children, the Serbs made the Jasharis into martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 23, 1998, U.S. Special Envoy to the Balkans Robert
Gelbard gave what many have interpreted as a green light to
Belgrade to go after the rebel bands by announcing in Pristina that
the KLA ``is without any question a terrorist group.'' He went on
to add that the United States ``condemns very strongly terrorist
activities in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Within two weeks Serb forces had turned Prekaz into a smoldering
ruin, killed close to a hundred people, and ignited the uprising.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the Jashari compound was flattened with mortar
and cannon shells, I wandered among the piles of brick and cement.
In the ruins of one room lay a blackened book with a map that
showed a Greater Albania that included Kosovo, parts of Serbia,
much of Macedonia and parts of present-day Greece and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   The map was drawn up on July 1, 1878, when the bajraktars, or
clan chieftains, from the Turkish realms of the southwest Balkans
founded the League for the Defense of the Albanian Nation. The book
was a potent reminder of what the war was about _ especially since,
with most ethnic Albanians concentrated in homogeneous areas
bordering Albania, the drive to extend Albania's borders remains
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   That drive is not only a wider threat to European stability but
also to Albanian moderation. Kosovar Albanians in exile _ and even
some who have gone back to fight _ express deep frustration at the
provincialism of the leadership within Kosovo, but to little avail.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the KLA, especially those who have not lived abroad,
are convinced that they have embarked on the century-long dream of
a Greater Albania. Many KLA commanders tout themselves as ``a
liberation army for all Albanians'' _ precisely what frightens the
NATO alliance most.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians were spurred by the collapse of Tito's Yugoslavia.
Croatia and Serbia, whose political ideology is often overtly
racist, unleashed a war in the early 1990s largely against unarmed
civilians to try to form ethnically ``pure'' enclaves and states.
Militias stormed through minority communities in drunken frenzies,
looting, burning, raping and murdering. They set up detention
centers, carried out mass executions and ignored tepid
international protests.
</P>
<P>
   But after Milosevic revoked Kosovo's autonomy in 1989, Rugova
insisted on a very different road to independence, a Gandhi-like
plan to withdraw from all state institutions and create a parallel
government. His was to be a peaceful revolution and an example of
civility and tolerance that would earn the backing of the Western
democracies.
</P>
<P>
   The former literature professor, with his glasses constantly
sliding down his nose and a scarf loosely draped around his neck,
has the distracted look of an aging Left Bank poet. Remote and out
of touch, he rarely leaves his small office in Pristina, even to
attend a funeral a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Under Rugova's leadership, the ethnic Albanians had set up their
own schools, clinics and a shadow administration that levied taxes,
drawing on the resources of a diaspora of more than 600,000 ethnic
Albanians in Europe and some 300,000 in Canada and the United
States. The civil resistance lasted nearly a decade. Streams of
delegations from Kosovo traveled to Scandinavian countries to take
expenses-paid seminars in nonviolence.
</P>
<P>
   But the protest, unsustainable in the long term and a victim of
international indifference, collapsed. Its death notice came after
the 1995 Dayton agreement was swiftly followed by the European
Union's recognition of Yugoslavia _ even though Yugoslavia had
failed to meet an EU demand to first resolve the Kosovo issue.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Both the Serbs and the ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo are now
confident that force of arms can solve the impasse between them.
Despite NATO's air strikes, neither side has much incentive to lay
down its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs have huge stockpiles of heavy weapons they have yet to
unleash, while the KLA has a large reserve of volunteers and a
porous border with Albania to smuggle in supplies and newly trained
recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Settling in for a long fight, the KLA probably has 30,000
automatic weapons, made available at bargain prices after Albanian
military arsenals were looted in the chaos after the spring 1997
economic meltdown. The rebels have made a concerted effort to
acquire German antitank weapons, heavy machine guns, sniper rifles
and rocket-propelled grenades.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, by launching the current rebellion, taking on
the Serbs and drawing international attention to the conflict, the
rebel group has done more in a year to further the cause of
independence for Kosovo than Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate leader,
was able to do over the preceding decade.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Washington insists on adhering to the principle that
all states in the former Yugoslavia be multiethnic, there is little
hope of a resolution. And as long as Belgrade is permitted to
station troops in Kosovo, which is part of the current agreement,
neither NATO soldiers nor Kosovar Albanians will be safe. Building
any kind of lasting peace or democratic institutions will be
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomatic efforts designed to keep the Serbs and the
ethnic Albanians in the same country mirror the fruitless peace
efforts carried out during the first three years of the Bosnian
war. The refusal to accept the creation of ethnically ``pure''
enclaves _ a decision that is strategically and morally
understandable _ leaves diplomats paying homage to multiethnic
institutions, however hollow, and lofty democratic ideals that
nearly all Balkan leaders detest.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo can remain a Serbian province and the two groups can live
together, this reasoning goes, if only the ethnic Albanians are
given a little more freedom. Given that between 1966 and 1989 an
estimated 130,000 Serbs left the province because of frequent
harassment and discrimination by the Kosovar Albanian majority,
this is at best naive.
</P>
<P>
   The peace agreement for which NATO went to war proposes to
deploy some 30,000 NATO troops and allow ethnic Albanian police to
take over security functions in Albanian-majority areas. The plan
would gradually cede local police control to the KLA, which would
probably comprise most of the force.
</P>
<P>
   But Serbia would keep troops in the province and handle security
along the borders _ especially the border with Albania, where the
KLA has set up logistics bases and smuggling routes for weapons and
fighters. The plan also calls for a phased disarming of the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   Such a deal would be extremely hard to implement under a rebel
command that has spent the last three years preparing for war. The
KLA is wildly unlikaely to hand over its guns, especially given
Milosevic's pattern of ignoring formal agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The latent nationalism among most Serbs, coupled with the
disturbing belief that they were the real victims in Yugoslavia's
wars, is aroused by each Western attack. Belgrade knows that NATO
has no desire to become the air wing of the KLA. Anything much
short of all-out war on Yugoslavia only consolidates Milosevic's
grip on power and allows him to unleash his forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The West's blundering peace initiative has reminded the KLA not
to rely too much on NATO. The alliance was palpably reluctant to
move against the Serbs, although they have flagrantly violated the
agreement made last October to cease hostilities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the October pact, NATO bombed to get Belgrade to sign
on to the Rambouillet deal _ a shift not lost on the Kosovar
Albanians. Milosevic, for his part, has driven NATO crazy since the
Kosovo crisis began.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Hill, the current U.S. Kosovo mediator, has carried out
fruitless shuttle diplomacy since last spring; on his latest trip
to Belgrade, Milosevic did not even meet with him. Put bluntly, the
Serb leaders stiffed the United States. The KLA is correctly
distrustful of Western intentions and resolve.
</P>
<P>
   That distrust led to the decision by the KLA not to sign the
Rambouillet agreement in the first round of talks last February _
which, in turn, let the alliance off the moral hook. Kosovar
intransigence gave the West the excuse it was looking for not to
implement the October agreement and deepened the already wide rifts
within the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   If the West's peace push eventually dies, as now appears likely,
the KLA leaders will swiftly become utterly disenchanted with the
West and turn to Islamic radicals ready to back another battle by
Muslims against Orthodox Christians. The Serbs, whose information
is admittedly often unreliable, say that Islamic charities in the
Persian Gulf are giving millions to the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say they have detected ties to Islamist
organizations and suspect that some money has been forwarded to the
KLA. I saw bearded mujahideen, who did not look Albanian, wandering
around the staging areas in northern Albania, a hint that there may
be some truth to these assertions.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs also contend that the KLA has about 1,000 foreign
mercenaries from Albania, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Afghanistan, Bosnia
and Croatia, as well as British and German instructors. Most of the
mercenaries are probably Albanian nationals, especially former
Albanian army officers, police officers and members of the state
security services.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA is clearly preparing for a long slog. It has tried to
recruit ethnic Albanian veterans in Croatia, who formed two
battalions in Croatia's war against the Serbs. In early February,
Yugoslav officials said that they had seized $500,000 worth of
weapons, ammunition and uniforms for the KLA that were smuggled in
from Croatia in a truck.
</P>
<P>
   There are rebel training camps now in Albania _ apparently in
Ljabinot, near Tirana _ as well as ones I saw in Tropoja (near the
Yugoslav border), Kuks, and Bajram Curi.
</P>
<P>
   Were the conflagration to result in the deployment of
peacekeeping NATO ground forces _ a proposition that should not be
taken lightly _ it would have risks that were not faced in Bosnia.
Kosovo, unlike Cyprus and Bosnia, has no fixed lines dividing the
antagonists. The province's battle lines resemble the constantly
shifting sands of Central America's 1980s guerrilla wars: a stretch
of road that is safe in the morning can be deadly in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Because this is an insurrection rather than a war between
armies, rebels can be farmers one day and combatants the next. They
will be impossible to define.
</P>
<P>
   To muddy the waters further, the KLA is poorly led, with no
central command and little discipline. Many villages have formed ad
hoc militias that, while they identify themselves as KLA, act
independently.
</P>
<P>
   I found that KLA commanders often spent as much time trying to
find out what these militias were doing _ closing down unauthorized
roadblocks and curbing excesses by local warlords _ as they did
fighting the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem facing any peacekeeping force will be
defining who belongs to the KLA and who does not. The Serb soldiers
and special police, in uniform and headquartered in barracks, will
prove far easier to monitor, if not always control. But the overall
picture is one of chaos.
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, by contrast, the front lines had changed little by
late 1992, and the war often resembled World War I clashes on the
western front, albeit on a much smaller scale. Hundreds of people
were wounded or killed in the trench warfare, but the trenches
themselves moved little.
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, at least by the fall of 1995, conditions were much
riper for peacemaking. The Bosnian Serbs, battered by two weeks of
heavy NATO bombing, were a spent and broken force. On the other
hand, even after this spring's NATO air strikes and ruthless
Serbian attacks, Kosovo's combatants may still have vigor to spare.
Kosovo has not yet been granted the dubious blessing of exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs appear to believe that the problem requires not
negotiation but more force. Morale among the Serbs is low, and
there are steady reports of desertions. The heavily mechanized Serb
patrols stick to the blacktop roads while the KLA controls a
network of back dirt roads that often skirt police checkpoints. And
Belgrade's decision to scorch villages is only flooding the rebels
with recruits.
</P>
<P>
   At this late stage in the game, a NATO deployment _ if Milosevic
can somehow be bombed into accepting it _ will over the short term
save lives, just as it did in Bosnia. But it will not bring back
the autonomy that Tito, the last of the Habsburgs, oversaw with
such skill.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, the stationing of international troops may prevent
all-out fighting and provide the breathing space to negotiate a
workable solution. But given the deep rifts between the sides, the
latter is hardly likely.
</P>
<P>
   The international community would then face the stark choice
between remaining in Kosovo for a long time or pulling out after
the proposed three-year period, with the likelihood that those on
both sides of the divide would again pick up their guns.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it will come to this: Led by the KLA, Kosovo will
separate from Serbia, whether by negotiations or by violence.

<P>
   The rumbles of yet another nationalist earthquake are shaking
the former Yugoslavia. Rising from the fetid hovels of Pristina and
the concrete-block family farms of rural Kosovo is the newest
political and military force to beset the Balkans _ the Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA), known to Albanians as the Ushtria Clirimtare
e Kosoves.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of this militant armed group, now numbering
several thousand fighters, has dimmed hopes that even a compromise
agreement with Belgrade could be successfully implemented.
Emboldened by NATO's March bombing of the Serbian military, the KLA
will wage a protracted guerrilla war in the Serbian province that
could ignite a wider war in neighboring Macedonia and Albania,
potentially even dragging in Greece and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA is uncompromising in its quest for an independent Kosovo
now and a Greater Albania later. And it has, to the consternation
of Washington's would-be peacemakers, supplanted the ineffectual
leadership of the moderate voice of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
majority, Ibrahim Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA is important out of all proportion to its size _ not
merely because it will probably eventually get Kosovo to secede
from Serbia, but because it now represents the aspirations of most
Kosovar Albanians. To understand the current conflict in Kosovo and
America's stakes in its resolution, one must understand the KLA,
how it came into being, who leads it, what drives it and why it now
speaks for a majority of Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   Even a truly vicious, Bosnia-like wave of atrocities by the
Serbs in reprisal for NATO's attacks will only pour fuel on the
separatist fire. The grim reality is that we had better get to know
the KLA _ because it is not going to go away.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo's Albanians have grown increasingly embittered. By
attempting to include the KLA in the peace process that began in
February at the French chateau of Rambouillet, the Western alliance
is working feverishly _ even as it bombs the Serbs _ to blunt the
momentum toward a war of independence.
</P>
<P>
   The allies want NATO troops to separate the province's warring
factions, although Belgrade is wary. The underlying idea behind
creating a theoretically temporary, NATO- enforced military
protectorate in Kosovo is to buy time for a three-year transition
period in which ethnic Albanians will be allowed to elect a
parliament and other governing bodies _ meeting enough of their
aspirations, it is hoped, to keep Kosovo from seceding.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the Western alliance's response to the
Kosovo crisis, however ragged, shows that some lessons have been
learned from the bumbling in Bosnia. The Europeans no longer talk
about handling matters alone but demand the presence of the United
States. Threats have been backed up by force.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a consensus that if some kind of a solution is not
found soon, the fighting inside Kosovo _ an area the size of
Connecticut _ will accelerate and make future intervention
difficult, if not impossible. Even the Pentagon officials who
fought like wildcats to keep U.S. forces out of Bosnia accept that
some 4,000 U.S. troops will have to be deployed in Kosovo to make
any peacekeeping force credible.
</P>
<P>
   But, as in Bosnia, the West is wedded to a solution that might
have worked earlier in the conflict but is now untenable. Serbian
ethnic cleansing has taken on a somewhat different character in
Kosovo than in Bosnia. In Kosovo, Serbian ethnic cleansing is to a
large degree tactical, designed to deny the rebels succor from
civilians and therefore aimed primarily at the inhabitants of KLA
strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   But the Serb campaign has been more than brutal enough to make
autonomy for Kosovo a nonstarter. The ethnic Albanians in Kosovo,
who make up 90 percent of its 2 million inhabitants, cannot remain
in Serbia after the horrific recent bloodshed, the displacement of
a quarter of a million people, and the razing of scores of
villages.
</P>
<P>
   They do not trust Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic or the
Serbs _ and given Belgrade's bloody campaigns against ethnic
minorities over the past decade and its habit of breaking
agreements, who can blame them?
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians have been radicalized, and their new voice is the
KLA. Rugova, the old pacifist, is more a symbol of outmoded
moderation than a leader.
</P>
<P>
   By ignoring the plight of the Kosovar Albanians for nearly a
decade, the West lost much of its credibility before NATO began
bombing. Many Albanians feel let down by the world and their own
meek leaders. What is most striking, then, about the KLA
insurrection is not that it occurred but that it took so long to
occur.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA fighters are the province's new power brokers. Whatever
political leadership emerges in Kosovo will come from the rebel
ranks, and it will be militant, nationalist, uncompromising and
deeply suspicious of all outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence agencies, preoccupied with tracking militant
Islamist groups and Iranian agents in Bosnia, were caught off guard
by the Kosovo rebel force's emergence, strength and popularity.
Indeed, some diplomats argued as late as last year about whether
the shadowy group really existed _ even as small armed bands roamed
Drenica in central Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The first KLA armed attack took place in May 1993, killing two
Serb police officers and wounding five more. But the rebel group _
its membership largely drawn from a few clans in Kosovo and
radicals in the Albanian diaspora _ was founded eight years ago.
Most of its leadership has spent years in prison for separatist
activity, many having been jailed earlier by Tito's communist
government.
</P>
<P>
   Like all revolutionaries who have spent years underground or in
jail, the KLA leaders are wary of the outside world and given to
secrecy, paranoia and appalling mendacity when they feel it serves
their interests, which is most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA splits down a bizarre ideological divide, with hints of
fascism on one side and whiffs of communism on the other. The
former faction is led by the sons and grandsons of rightist
Albanian fighters _ either the heirs of those who fought in the
World War II fascist militias and the Skanderbeg volunteer SS
division raised by the Nazis, or the descendants of the rightist
Albanian rebels who rose up against the Serbs 80 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although never much of a fighting force, the Skanderbeg division
took part in the shameful roundup and deportation of the province's
few hundred Jews during the Holocaust. The division's remnants
fought Tito's Partisans at the end of the war, leaving thousands of
ethnic Albanians dead.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by KLA commanders to dress their police in black
fatigues and order their fighters to salute with a clenched fist to
the forehead led many to worry about these fascist antecedents.
Following such criticism, the salute has been changed to the
traditional open-palm salute common in the U.S. Army.
</P>
<P>
   The second KLA faction, comprising most of the KLA leaders in
exile, are old Stalinists who were once bankrolled by the
xenophobic Enver Hoxha, the dictator of Albania who died in 1985.
This group led a militant separatist movement that was really about
integration with Hoxha's Albania. Most of these leaders were
students at Pristina University after 1974, when Belgrade granted
the province autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Freed from Yugoslav oversight, the university imported thousands
of textbooks from Albania, all carefully edited by Hoxha's
Stalinist regime, along with at least a dozen militant Albanian
professors. Along with its degree programs, Pristina University
began to quietly school young Kosovar leaders in the art of
revolution. Not only did a huge percentage of the KLA leadership
come out of the university, but so, ominously, did the ethnic
Albanian leadership in neighboring Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The two KLA factions have little sympathy with or understanding
of democratic institutions. Split bitterly between radical left and
radical right, they are now arguing over whether to carry the
fighting to the pockets of ethnic Albanians who live in western
Macedonia and neighboring Montenegro. The only thing they agree on
is the need to liberate Kosovo from Serbian rule. All else,
menacingly, will be decided later. It is not said how.
</P>
<P>
   Given these deep divisions, it is no accident that the KLA has
failed to create a political organization or even a vague platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think we have an ideology,'' Jakup Krasniqi, the
KLA's mercurial spokesman, told the Albanian-language daily Koha
Ditore on July 12, 1998. ``And in fact we do not have time for such
things even if we were interested in them, because we have our main
job to do, which is the task of liberation.''

TALE OF MALAISE TAKES AN IRONIC TURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Benoit Jacquot has yet to meet a lonely, out-of-focus woman he
didn't like. When we're introduced to 29-year-old Mathilde
(Sandrine Kiberlain) during the opening title sequence of ``Seventh
Heaven,'' she's a literal blur that steps into our plain sight,
only to jam a toy truck in her coat pocket.
</P>
<P>
   The shock of being caught shoplifting knocks her cold, and her
husband Nico (the magnificent Vincent Lindon doing a lot for
drawn-mouthed, droopy-eyed men) can't determine how much he's to
blame for her listlessness and strange behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Mathilde winds up confiding her dissatisfaction to a man
(Francois Berleand) whom she's been running into at parties and
spotting on the subway. He turns out to be a hypnotist who tells
her feng shui will restore stability to her psyche and improve her
sex life.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor figures this out by completing a diagram of
Mathilde's apartment, then advising her to move her bedroom from
one end of the flat to another. There will come her ``seventh
heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, with Mathilde going AWOL at work and disturbing her
son with her unexplained domestic malaise, it feels like Jacquot's
headed in the woman-on-the-verge-of-psychosomatic breakdown a la
``Safe.'' But, mercifully, ``Seventh Heaven'' takes on the
inconvenient irony of an O. Henry story _ not to mention its
conciseness.
</P>
<P>
   Once Mathilde speedily regains her equilibrium, the film rests
squarely on Nico's shoulders as he wanders into an insecure
out-of-focusness of his own. Jacquot (who wrote the film with
Jerome Beaujour) has a thing for men whose psyches, egos and sex
drives are incompatible.
</P>
<P>
   Cad is the nicest thing you could say about the omnivorous
animal (played by Vincent Martinez) that brings a smile to Isabelle
Huppert's face and a tear to her eye in Jacquot's ``The School of
Flesh.''
</P>
<P>
   Jealous of and flummoxed by Mathilde's breakthrough, Nico sheds
the veneer of the neglectful, adulterous husband and displays
genuine concern _ if not for his wife, then over the fact that he
can't believe he's finally satisfying her in bed. He staves off an
understated attack from his mother-in-law (deliciously insinuating
Francine Berge) and begins seeing a hypnotist in search of
psychological parity with Mathilde.
</P>
<P>
   Lindon, so good as Huppert's transvestite pal in ``The School of
Flesh,'' brings a critical gravity that counters the swift
evanescence Jacquot builds around him. The nervous irritation that
creeps onto his face when Nico fails to please his son with a
bedtime story is the same haggard, self-inflicted anger that'll
keep a guy like David Straithairn from being a star.
</P>
<P>
   It's beautiful _ especially when contrasted to the solar-powered
emptiness fueling Kiberlain. She often looks as if she knows the
camera's on her and it's adding 10 pounds to the level of her
self-consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   The film isn't to be confused with the Bible-belting television
show of the same name. Breezy as it is, Jacquot's film prefers to
do its conservative moralizing on the inside and keep God out of
its questions of erotic faith.

`GO' NEVER STOPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Go'' is the sagest, most invigorated spawn o' ``Pulp Fiction''
in a junkyard littered with knock-offs.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly five years now, we've been forced to endure the
amateur-night ``Pulp Fiction'' tributes that amount to the scuzz
cinema equivalent of a ``Star Trek'' convention with Quentin
Tarantino its winking William Shatner god. There was scuzz before
Tarantino, but he managed to become the hypodermic for throngs of
C-movie crime junkies who dream of sublimating potty mouths and
literary verve into bewitching cinema.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go'' screenwriter John August gets buzzed on the ``Pulp
Fiction'' energy but is more enthused about the down-and-out losers
in Tarantino's ``Jackie Brown,'' spinning a single sequence from
that film into an entire movie of its own. Essentially,
exclusively, ``Go'' is a triptych whirling on a Lazy Susan of
revolving character perspectives of the mayhem that goes down when
Ronna, a supermarket wonder chick (Sarah Polley), sells some
Ecstasy to two pretty boys, Adam and Zack (Scott Wolf and Jay Mohr)
in order to pay the rent. Simon (Desmond Askew), their regular
dealer, just gave Ronna his extra shifts because he is Vegas-bound,
but these guys need to score. So Ronna wipes the sleep and dollar
signs from her eyes and does the stupidest, most desperate thing
she's ever done. She deals.
</P>
<P>
   Polley's Ronna has a fistful of self-control that belies the
fact that her nerves are fried from pulling a double. It's her
sidekicks-turned-accomplices Claire and Mannie (Katie Holmes and
Nathan Bexton) who get nervous. ``Swingers'' director Doug Liman
mines the situation's quick suspense. This on-the-job-training in
trafficking is going to go wrong. Just how bad does it get? Let's
put it this way: Once Ronna realizes she's short some cash and
leaves Claire with the menacing dealer (Timothy Olyphant) as
collateral, ``Go'' takes a hit of it own stuff and never stops
tripping.
</P>
<P>
   Under Liman's blistering, one-track-minded direction, ``Go'' is
so aerodynamic in its construction that there's no room for excess
baggage or delirious tangents. It has its sights set on delirium
but is too bleary-eyed to see them clearly. What you're left with
is an inflamed joy ride whose title says everything about the
frazzled hedonists living in the grooves of this pulsing 12-inch
single of a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Tay Diggs' conscientious thrill-seeking in the
``Simon'' chapter, none of these characters stops for a first
thought, let alone a second. Transfixed by electronic soundsmith
BT's throbbing score, ``Go'' moves on sex, drugs and techno, and
would have no idea how to control itself enough to encounter the
tantric orgasms Diggs talks about. It just wants instant
gratification.
</P>
<P>
   That speedy determination to get from ``Ronna'' to ``Simon'' to
``Adam and Zack'' in 100 minutes flat makes for wildly economic
filmmaking and exhausting moviegoing. But ``Go'' is neither the
transcendent, transporting experience of ``Pulp Fiction,'' nor does
it have it have the human depth that made ``Jackie Brown'' feel as
long as its characters were old. What it does have is an
exhilarating sense of now.
</P>
<P>
   The title functions as both a harried exclamation and the most
terse case ever against inertia. ``Go'' whizzes though a fear of
being bored in a culture too hyperactive to examine itself.
</P>
<P>
   Living isn't simply being on a roller coaster, it's being stoned
on one of those super-streamlined laser trains. ``Go'' revels in
the near-buzz-killing safety of knowing that like every amusement
park thrill ride, it'll return you to the platform a little shaken
but intact.

`FORTUNE' DIRECTOR HAS A BALL WITH SMALL-TOWN ECCENTRICITIES

<TEXT>
<P>
   The broken glass and goosefeathers that lay fallen at the
doorway of Jewel Mae Orcutt's bedroom don't announce that
``Cookie's Fortune'' is open for business.
</P>
<P>
   But when a gunshot uncorks a geyser of pillow stuffing and a
crystal salad bowl crashes to the floor, it's clear that Robert
Altman's neatly arranged, deceptively sunny comedy will serve you
now.
</P>
<P>
   Before Jewel Mae ``Cookie'' Orcutt's broken-heart and loneliness
inspire her to blow her brains into a pillow, ``Cookie's Fortune''
meanders around Holly Springs, Miss., with the fuzzy benevolence of
a Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation. Toyomichi Kurita's
photography of the local juke-joint initially borders on lurid as
Josie (Ruby Wilson) smolders through the opening minutes with a
fire that tapers off the second she stops singing her smoky blues
number. It's one of the more riveting sequences Altman's composed _
the tone of which eludes him for nearly 25 minutes after.
</P>
<P>
   By way of Anne Rapp's traffic jam of a script, Altman introduces
us to everybody in Holly Springs. Cookie Orcutt (Patricia Neal) is
the regal town loon and its unofficial matriarch. Willis (Charles
S. Dutton) is the liquored-up handyman who lives on her crumbling
antebellum estate. The story disconnects the two from Camille
(Glenn Close) who's directing her sister Cora (Julianne Moore) in a
springtime production of ``Salome,'' one that promises to be as
pleasingly bizarre as the disco-era, severed-head-and-cocaine
version in James Ivory's ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries.''
(Though Camille's incarnation is based on the Oscar Wilde
adaptation and has greater bearing on the proceedings.)
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, it's vague how the catfisher (Lyle Lovett) with a
creepy eye on a striking, tomboy drifter named Emma (Liv Tyler) and
her estranged sheriff boyfriend (Chris O'Donnell) will situate
themselves among the dozen or so other characters. But you trust
Altman to get you there in spite of the fact that the rabbits in
Cookie's backyard hop faster than the movie. What you don't trust,
or don't believe, is the pleasant demeanor illuminating ``Cookie's
Fortune.'' The niceness is enervating and suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Cookie's suicide brings the film's missing vitality. No
disrespect to Neal, who provides an elegant nonchalance, but when
what's surrounding her moseys more than she does, something's gotta
give. Fortunately, it's her will to live without her dead husband.
</P>
<P>
   Things don't speed on from here, they rollick and just seem more
focused and purposeful, as if Altman were never really interested
in the set-up of things, as if he, too, found the early warmth
artificial.

   The Southern-Gothic-lite tapestry Rapp builds allows Altman to
do some of his most nuanced storytelling with his best, non-gimmick
ensemble since '83's ``Streamers.'' Especially fine are Moore in a
perpetual state of kewpie-doll torpor and Niecy Nash as the randy
Sheriff's assistant with a jones for Courtney B. Vance's
investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Camille discovers her alienated aunt's body along with the
suicide note. In a supreme fit of disgust, rage and consternation
over the chagrin a suicide in the family would wreak, Camille
stuffs the note in her mouth and proceeds to use her extensive
local theater training to stage Cookie's murder.
</P>
<P>
   Camille is nothing short of the most melodramatic lady alive.
Her antic scramble is Close's finest hour of histrionics. The
masticated note churns in Camille's stomach, fueling Close to feign
the coyness of a woman who just dropped a house on her sister _ or
her aunt's best friend, as the case may be.
</P>
<P>
   If Holly Springs were some bizarro Oz, those would be good
Willis' toes furling beneath that house. Dutton has a great,
refined way refusing to indulge in pathos, letting Tyler, Ned
Beatty as the town lieutenant and Donald Moffat as Willis' counsel
do his emoting for him. The days and nights Willis spends jailed
for Cookie's suicide bring Altman to further explore his very quiet
relationship with race and with the South. He's never been one to
make pulpit pronouncements about various ``isms,'' but the
harmonious jocularity he finds in Willis' predicament stirs an
unbitter poignancy that feels foreign to the tenor of his
filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Whose South is this? The deep South of ``Cookie's Fortune'' is
as much an old South (the disregard for modern technologies, the
maintenance of aristocratic airs) as it is a new one. Even if
there's a romanticization of race relations, Altman finds Holly
Springs an idiosyncratic utopia where that ideal union can exist.
You're never less than aware of what a sensitive issue it is for
most of the town that Willis is sitting in a cell for something he
clearly didn't do.
</P>
<P>
   Altman's cynical urges disappear in the miles of unspooled
yellow ``crime scene'' tape spun all over Cookie's house, which
Camille has shamelessly orchestrated herself (and Cora) back into.
Camille becomes the screwball embodiment of a South so old and
institutional she seems like a figment, making her Blanche DuBois
send-off more than a sendup.
</P>
<P>
   It's a cheeky exorcism of a place far less sensationalistic than
the crime scene status Altman thinks it left years ago.

 &UR; By Garry Wills &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (1,600 words) As the world's only superpower, America is told
that it must act like ``a great nation,'' which still means
defending freedom around the world. That is a difficult enough task
for any nation. It is even more difficult for America, not only
because of its established Cold War pattern, but also because of
its longstanding tradition of holding aloof from global
partnerships.

   (1,300 words) American officials seem peculiarly blind to the
fact that often the more the United States attacks a foreign
leader, the more his popularity soars among countrymen who applaud
him for standing tall against the greatest power on earth. The
demonizing of leaders has so far failed to shorten their tenure in
power, from Fidel Castro (who has survived eight American
presidents) to Slobodan Milosevic to Saddam Hussein.

<P>
   (1,400 words) To report international news, the cost of a
journalistic caravan, including hotels, per diem expenses, car
rentals and local support staff, begins at about $3,000 a day.
Airfare and excess-baggage charges can easily reach $12,000. Then
there are ``extras'' such as satellite fees. New digital
technology, including smaller and lighter cameras and editing
equipment, will eventually reduce costs, but there is no indication
that the networks will use the savings to increase international

   (1,500 words) There will always be ``trapped'' minorities, no
matter how carefully boundaries are drawn, except in the smallest
or most isolated environments. But when should secession be
supported by the international community? When massive human-rights
violations, approaching the scale of genocide, are being
perpetrated. Or when reasonable demands for minority rights have
been arbitrarily rejected by a central government.

   (2,000 words) The bloodshed in Kosovo is a symptom of the
approach, in the Dayton Accords of 1995, which strengthened
Slobodan Milosevic. In fact, Dayton plunged Serbia deeper into
ethnic chauvinism, whereby the ``sacred Serb soil'' of Kosovo
matters vastly more to Belgrade than do the Albanians who resided
there. As such, the Kosovo crisis comes as scant surprise.

   (1,400 words) In the United States and other rich countries, a

REMOVE ALL RUST BEFORE PAINTING 
</HEADLINE>

   Q. The underside of an old cast iron sink is rusting, and looks
pretty bad. How can I paint it? There are rust spots around the
rusty drain cover in the sink. I plan to replace the drain cover;
can I put it right over the rust?
</P>
<P>
   MARY BETH COUGHLIN, Milton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It is necessary to remove all rust from the underside of the
sink before painting it, and a good idea to remove the rust in the
sink before putting on the new cover.
</P>
<P>
   For the underside, sand heavily to remove all traces of rust. If
you cannot remove all traces, paint the remaining rust with a rust
reformer, which is a phosphoric acid compound that turns the rust
black and makes it paintable. Then paint with an oil-based primer
such as Kilz, and finish with an oil-based enamel.
</P>
<P>
   Do the same with the rust around the drain cover. With it
completely removed, paint the area around the cover with an
appliance touch-up paint. Now you can put on the new cover.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I remove caulking compound smeared on a concrete walk
outdoors?
</P>
<P>
   GIGI McDONALD, Boston
</P>
<P>
   A. Scrape up as much as you can with a putty knife. Soak the
remainder with paint thinner, enough so you can continue scraping
or scrubbing with very coarse steel wool. If the compound contains
silicone, try rubbing alcohol. If these tricks fail, apply chemical
paint remover; use a citrus-based remover so you can hose it off
when it softens the compound.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I put a wood stove in a fireplace. It works well, and the
draft is OK. But when the stove is not working, I get a bad smell
like creosote or burned, wet wood. I installed a chimney cap on top
of the chimney; that, and the closed damper in the stovepipe helped
a little, but the odor continues. How can I prevent that odor?
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN KOLBERT, Salem, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. That bad smell is because there is a downdraft when the stove
is not working, despite the chimney draft being OK when the stove
is working. It is a common problem, and sometimes blocking the
chimney at the top or at the stovepipe where it enters the chimney
will work, but the blockage has to be airtight, which makes it a
pain to do. The chimney cap helped some and so did the damper, but
as you found out, not quite enough.
</P>
<P>
   But there is hope, and this is what Ed Grant of Beverly, Mass.
did to stop the odor coming down through his stove. He found an
old-fashioned kerosone lamp (not the one with a tall glass chimney
but a railroad type lamp), and set it in the stove (when it is not
working, of course). He then lit a newspaper torch and stuck it up
the stovepipe to get the air moving up, not down. Then he lit the
lamp, which produces enough heat to keep the air moving up.
Ingenious, what? You can do the same. It goes without saying (but
we'll say it anyway): Take the lamp out when you run the stove.
</P>
<P>
   You could probably run the lamp with the damper closed, because
such dampers are not airtight and can handle a small flame from a
kerosene lamp. After all, we lived with more than one kerosone lamp
in the good old days without venting them, and we were not
affected. I think. Those lamps are still sold; you could find one
in an antique store; maybe even in some hardware stores.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Newspapers I was using to train my dog got wet and stuck to
the vinyl floor, creating a sizable black mark. How can I remove
it?
</P>
<P>
   NANCY RAILA, Quincy, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Try a pre-wash spray such as Spray and Wash. Leave it on as
long as necessry, then scrub and rinse. A strong solution of baking
soda and water may do it, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My basement windows are flush with the ground. I was told to
put in window wells. I understand why they are needed, but how can
I install them?
</P>
<P>
   ANTONIO OLIART, Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I think places like Home Depot and building supply stores
carry them; they are painted galvanized steel, and rounded to form
a half circle. Dig a hole to match the size of the steel well; make
it as deep as the steel wall. Insert this wall and bolt or screw it
to the foundation. To fasten to concrete, drill a hole for the
screw or bolt and insert a fiber or plastic sleeve that will hold
the screw or bolt.
</P>
<P>
   To get the right size well, measure the window's width; if the
well is a little wide, going beyond the window, that is OK; if it
is short, it is not OK. Fill the well with crushed stone to within
six inches of the sill.
</P>
<P>
   You should be able to find the right size, and you can also buy
a cover for it, which will prevent rain water from filling the
well.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find a ready-made steel well, you can make your
own. Dig a hole the width of the window or a little wider. Make it
12 inches deep and let it extend about 18 inches out from the
window. Line the hole with pressure-treated 2 x 12s. Keep the 2 x
12s flush with the ground or a tad higher. Fill the well with six
inches of crushed stone.
</P>
<P>

VANGUARD EXTENDED MARKET MAY FIT BETTER INTO INVESTOR'S MIX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 11, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am single, in my mid-thirties and earn $25,000 a year
working for an employer who does not offer a pension, 401(k) plan
or a profit-sharing plan. Just recently I have started to invest
for my future needs. I have $4,000 in a Roth IRA invested in
Vanguard Growth and Income fund, and I also have $6,000 in a
taxable account invested in Vanguard Life-Strategy Growth, which
holds roughly 20 percent bonds and 80 percent stocks. I also have
some $18,000 in a NOW account that pays 1 percent interest. I plan
to move $12,000 of that to a Vanguard money market fund that pays
about 5 percent interest until I figure out what to do next. Maybe
I'll move some of that money to Vanguard Mid-Cap Index fund or
Vanguard Aggressive Growth fund to add some diversity to my taxable
fund holdings. What do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   L.L., Bedford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I think diversifying beyond the large-cap arena is a good
idea, but it's a tough job to choose between the two funds you're
looking at. Currently, both are classified by Morningstar Mutual
Funds as mid-cap funds, with Vanguard Aggressive Growth (curiously)
at the value end of the spectrum and the Mid-Cap Index fund is
classified as a mid-cap blend, holding both growth and value
issues. And let's also throw a third fund into the discussion _
Vanguard Extended Market Index. This is another mid-cap blend
issue, differing from the Mid-Cap Index issue in that Extended
Market Index tracks the results of the Wilshire 4500 index
(embracing both small and mid-cap issues) whereas the Mid-Cap Index
tracks the Standard &AMP; Poor's Mid-Cap 400 Index.
</P>
<P>
   All three funds are managed by George U. Sauter. The most
notable difference among the three is that the Aggressive Growth
fund is not limited to the mid-cap universe, but rather places its
investments wherever its computer-directed strategy dictates that
the best market opportunities lurk.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Extended Market Index topped this group, with a
26.74 percent total return, closely followed by Aggressive Growth
with a 26.12 percent gain, and less closely by the Mid-Cap Index
fund, which was begun only about a year ago, producing an 8.78
percent return for eight months and ten days of operations. Through
the first quarter of 1999, Extended Market Index was again leading
the list, losing 3.50 percent, trailed by Mid-Cap Index with a 6.1
percent loss and Aggressive Growth with a 10.8 percent loss. All of
the funds looked good compared to their peers in 1998, with the
average mid-cap blend fund tracked by Morningstar producing a 9.33
percent total return and the average mid-cap value fund returning
1.36 percent. In the first quarter, though, only the Extended
Market Index fund came close to its peer group median return, which
was a loss of 3.1 percent; the median loss for the mid-cap value
segment was 2.3 percent for the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   If we just go by the numbers, it seems to me that the Extended
Market Index is the clear winner here. Moreover, there are
drawbacks involving both of the other funds: Vanguard Aggressive
Growth is not by charter required to keep its portfolio in any
particular market segment, so at some point in the future you might
find that such a holding duplicates your current large-cap blend
position with Vanguard Growth and Income. And Vanguard Mid-Cap
Growth fund simply has a record that's too short to bear very much
analysis. So I would go with the fund you didn't suggest _ the
Vanguard Extended Market Index.
</P>
<P>
   One further note: You propose to leave $6,000 in that NOW
account, earning that token 1 percent interest. That seems to me to
be a lot of money loafing, especially for somebody earning $25,000
a year. I suggest either that you reduce this balance to the
minimum amount allowed to maintain the NOW account or, if you write
relatively few checks, abandon the NOW account entirely and put
this money, which I assume you are viewing as emergency savings, in
a money market account with check-writing privileges.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are both 53 years-old and self-employed.
Through many years of hard work we have developed a $333,000
portfolio. We have paid for our children's college education and
just have a mortgage to pay off. I would like your opinion of our
current allocations and whether the investments we currently have
will get us to $1 million by age 62, assuming we make $5,000 annual
contributions. We have $260,000 in 15 large-cap blue-chip stocks,
$21,000 in bonds, and $52,000 in the New Perspective, Janus, Janus
20, and Vanguard Index 500 funds.
</P>
<P>
   B.C., Hopkinton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. To get to $1 million from where you are and with the
contributions you contemplate would require average annual returns
of 11.98 percent over the course of the next nine years. That may
not seem like so much after viewing the results of market
investments over the next several years, but my view is that it's
pretty unlikely. In fact, I wouldn't even be very comfortable with
an expectation of 10 percent average returns, which would take you
to $856,337. To my view, a much safer expectation would be average
portfolio returns of 8 percent, which would take you only to
$730,486.
</P>
<P>
   One reason I prefer the lower expectations is that I think
you've reached the point where you should be a little more
conservative, putting some of your contributions into bond and
other fixed-income holdings. The current fixed-income position is
only 6.3 percent of the portfolio. Moreover, I think you should
diversify away from large-cap stocks, which now represent the
entire stock portfolio. Along with balanced funds, I would suggest
you establish positions in mid-cap and small-cap stock funds.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you don't mention where you are investing your
contributions to these accounts. Since you note that you built this
portfolio over many years, I suspect there would be ugly tax
consequences if you sold any of the individual stocks. But I would
commit no further money to those accounts, and if you are enrolled
in dividend reinvestment programs, I suggest you elect to take your
dividends in cash, using that money to help build greater portfolio
diversification.

SOME ARGUE US FORCES STRETCHED TOO THIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, Germany _ Without the use of ground troops,
the US-led mission in Kosovo has been criticized as too weak, too
narrow, too ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as an increasing number of far-flung US military
resources have been diverted to the Balkans, another question has
cropped up: Is this miniwar leaving other US interests naked to
attack?
</P>
<P>
   Within the last two weeks, Pentagon officials have admitted US
forces are running down their supply of air-launched cruise
missiles, one of the heaviest and safest hitters in the lineup of
weapons fired from afar.
</P>
<P>
   Airpower has been shifted from Turkey and northern Iraq to
Yugoslavia. Aircraft carriers have been rearranged to free up one
for the Adriatic, leaving the north Pacific without.
</P>
<P>
   The shuffling has led some US military observers to argue, in
the words of the Congressional Research Service, ``that deployments
such as the ones in Bosnia or potentially in Kosovo harm US
military readiness and divert scarce military resources from
defense of vital US interests elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether such concerns are valid _ or are hysterical
exaggerations of the truth _ remains as much a matter of debate as
the strategy in Kosovo itself, according to a range of officials
and outside analysts.
</P>
<P>
   To some, the complaints are political hyperbole aimed at
persuading Congress to increase the military budget. To others, the
concerns are real, and a sign the Pentagon is ill-equipped to
handle the multiple brush fires of the world after the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``If another challenge were to come simultaneously, what would
the implications be for our capabilities?'' said Robert
Pfaltzgraff, professor of international studies at the Fletcher
School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, we're going to have to cut into some of
our capabilities. That worries me. It fits into a larger pattern in
the military, especially as we draw down forces as we have over the
last eight or nine years, since the end of the Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, officials have over the last year begun paying close
attention to whether the military is ready for war and whether its
soldiers are adequately trained, lobbying Congress for an increased
Pentagon budget as well as a pay raise for the troops. In turn, the
military has blossomed again as a political issue, with both
Democrats and Republicans competing for the Pentagon budget
increases.
</P>
<P>
   Those worrying about defense deployments, argues military
analyst John Pike, may be trying to take advantage of the bidding
war between the parties. Pike said the missile shortage is
misleading _ while the air missiles are dwindling, sea-launched
missiles are in abundance and can be used just as effectively, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pike also said that ``to the extent that knowledgeable people
are worried about this, they're just trying to get us revved up for
a $15-billion defense budget increase in the next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Heller, an Air Force specialist at the Center for Defense
Information, agreed. ``The idea that we're being stretched thin by
this operation, in terms of our overall force structure, is not
accurate,'' he said. ``I don't know if it's ignorance or
intentionally misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Pentagon policy, spelled out to Congress earlier
this year, the military is supposed to be prepared for two major
regional wars at the same time _ not including the ongoing and
relatively low-level forces committed to Iraq, Bosnia, and now
Kosovo. The Pentagon has told Congress the military meets that
standard and would be able, for example, to wage war against North
Korea as it battled Saddam Hussein in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, the Navy moved the aircraft carrier in the
Pacific, the Kitty Hawk, to the Persian Gulf, where it will
substitute for the Theodore Roosevelt, which was diverted to the
Adriatic.
</P>
<P>
   Combat fighters have been put on alert near North Korea as a
result, and some 100,000 US troops are deployed in Asia, Pentagon
spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   He denied that moving the Kitty Hawk made a difference. Of Asia,
he said, ``it's not true that it's being left naked.''
</P>
<P>
   Although 10 F-15s and several EA-6B radar-jamming planes have
been moved to Italy from their usual posts guarding northern Iraq,
military analysts also denied Iraq would go unattended. The
southern no-fly zone, scene of a US attack Thursday, has picked up
the slack, analysts said. But in Germany, officials and airmen said
there is no question that adding Yugoslavia to the roster has
placed a strain on everyone, forcing them to compensate through
longer hours and less sleep.
</P>
<P>
   That, they said, could be the biggest military risk of all.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Buchanan, 25, a senior airman, worked a 24-hour shift on
the Ramstein airstrip Thursday _ his 12th such shift in recent
weeks. Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Christie, a military police
officer, acknowledged the hours were taking their toll, saying,
``the hours have been very, very busy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were busy during the African embassy bombings,'' he said,
recalling the August explosions, ``but that hardly compares to
this. And this seems to have the potential to go on a lot longer.''

   FREEPORT, Maine _ ``Wow, they're not dumpy anymore'' is one
consumer's reaction to the women's clothing featured in a new
catalog published by L.L. Bean Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Since its founding in 1912, the legendary purveyor of the famous
Bean boot has held this belief: L.L. Bean doesn't go after fashion;
fashion comes to L.L. Bean.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion came to L.L. Bean in the 1980s, when college students
embraced the preppie trend and flocked to Freeport for the
traditional styles Bean had been selling for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, though, fashion has looked elsewhere, and Bean's sales
have been flat for the last three years as consumer taste has moved
away from the functional, no-nonsense clothing for which Bean is
famous.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to regain momentum, Bean has launched several
out-of-character initiatives _ including a flirtation with fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Besides wooing women who want stylish career wear with its new
Freeport Studio catalog, Bean plans to open a half-dozen stores
along the East Coast, with some modeled on its famed Freeport
flagship store. Expect to see stores in or near New York and
Washington, D.C., but not in Boston, which was deemed too close to
Freeport.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bean kicked off its first major TV ad campaign this
week. Created by the Wenham ad agency Mullen, the ads unveiled the
theme ``Start here, go anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon A. Gorman, Bean's president since 1967 and grandson of
founder L.L. Bean, seeks to put the changes into perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are ``not seeing us as up-to-date and relevant to
their lifestyle,'' he says. ``We want to let people know we're not
just the same old company they liked in the '70s and '80s. We're
also contemporary.''
</P>
<P>
   Bean is by no means abandoning its past. Purists will still be
able to buy Bean boots and chamois shirts. The goal is to preserve
Bean's heritage while persuading folks to think of Bean in new ways
_ a combination that can be tricky.
</P>
<P>
   For a company that had long seemed to be on automatic pilot, the
sudden burst of activity surprises longtime observers of the $53
billion consumer catalog industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very un-Bean-like,'' says catalog consultant Maxwell
Sroge. ``Are they trying to do too many things at once?''
</P>
<P>
   And what happens to the company after Gorman? For all but a few
months of its 87-year history, the company has been led by two men,
founder Bean and grandson Gorman. Gorman, 64, has not said anything
publicly about a possible successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he getting the company ready to go public or to sell it?''
Sroge says of Gorman and the recent changes.
</P>
<P>
   Gorman strongly denies any such plans and says the new ventures
are strictly designed to regain the double-digit growth Gorman has
enjoyed for most of his 32-year tenure. The goal is to reach $1.4
billion in sales by 2002, up from $1.03 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bean after Gorman, a company spokesman notes that founder
Bean remained president until his death at age 94. For his part,
Gorman says he has ``no immediate plans to retire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The business is expected to pass to the fourth generation of
the family,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Some fault Gorman for being slow to react to shifts in the
fast-changing catalog business. But it's hard to argue with his
track record. When he took over, sales were about $5 million. Bean
has exceeded $1 billion in sales for four straight years.
</P>
<P>
   Bean isn't alone in facing challenges. In the last few years,
many catalog companies selling outdoor clothing have lost some zip.
Eddie Bauer has had its ups and downs. Lands' End Inc. recently
ousted its chief executive and implemented layoffs after annual
profits dropped by half.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the explanations for such outdoor-catalog malaise is
intensifying competition, as many brick-and-mortar retailers such
as Macy's are starting or expanding catalog operations. The catalog
turf that Bean, Eddie Bauer, and Lands' End once had mostly to
themselves is now being encroached upon by many other retailers.
</P>
<P>
   At W.A. Dean &AMP; Associates, a catalog consulting firm, president
Bill Dean wonders whether consumers have reached a saturation point
with outdoor merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you can only sell so many backbpacks and Polartec
pullovers,'' Dean says.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the wild card of e-commerce, though Gorman thinks
that stores, catalogs, and the Internet will coexist and that
retailers using all three channels will fare best.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Direct Marketing Association, catalog companies
mail out about 14 billion catalogs a year, which works out to more
than 100 per US household.
</P>
<P>
   But sophisticated databases can now identify the consumers who
make the most catalog purchases, and such buyers can be inundated
with far more catalogs than the average household.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're getting catalogs from people you've never heard of,''
Dean says.
</P>
<P>
   Amid this mailbox glut, catalogs from companies such as Bean and
Lands' End can get overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Bean is dealing with another challenge. In the early 1990s, its
goods were wildly popular in Japan. The currency exchange rate made
Bean-wear a bargain, and the Japanese were fascinated by the Bean
mystique of quality, durability, and service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if the Japanese loved us for who we are or
because our goods were stylish and cheap,'' Gorman recalls. ``It
was a little of both, probably.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the recession in Japan has been painful for Bean.
In 1994, Japan accounted for 20 percent of Bean's total sales; last
year, that figure fell to 5 percent, Gorman says.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with such troubles abroad and more competition at
home, Bean decided to respond with some drastic measures, including
what for it was a frontal assault on fashion.
</P>
<P>
   In January, it mailed out a catalog called Freeport Studio to
women who buy Bean's weekend attire; the idea is to give these
women an opportunity to buy clothes from Bean that are fashionable
enough to wear to the office and elsewhere during the week.
</P>
<P>
   There are no plans to sell Freeport Studio clothing in Bean's
flagship store _ that might blur Bean's brand identity and leave
longtime customers of backpacks and fly-fishing gear confused.
Freeport Studio clothing is available only through the catalog, in
which the L.L. Bean name appears in small letters.
</P>
<P>
   Many rivals already offer ``casual career'' clothing, notes
Glenda Shasho Jones, head of Shasho Jones Direct, a firm that
advises catalog retailers on branding and marketing issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.L. Bean stands for casual weekends and the outdoors,'' she
says. ``But they have to establish credibility with fashion. Bean
merchandise was never seen as fashionable. It was seen sensible and
comfortable. We'll see if the consumer can accept this from them.''
</P>
<P>
   One goal of the new ad campaign is to change some perceptions
about Bean and help customers accept some newfangled things from an
old-fashioned retailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seen as a cold-weather New England company,'' says Bean
senior vice president Bill Shea. ``Now we're trying to get people
to think of us as an all-year-round company.''
</P>
<P>
   At Bean's Freeport store, sales run strong from summer vacation
to ski season, or roughly from July to January. But store sales
account for only about 10 percent of total revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 90 percent come from catalogs or the Internet, with the
Internet making up 5 percent of last year's total.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to store sales, catalog sales bunch up in a much
shorter time frame, peaking at the holidays. An aim of Bean's new
initiatives is to build sales in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Freeport Studio gives Bean an entree into spring fashions.
Opening the new stores is another bid to attract customers all
year.
</P>
<P>
   And running a big ad campaign in the spring is one way to try to
get consumers to think of Bean as a year-round retailer that sells
more than just snowshoes, parkas, and fall hunting gear.
</P>
<P>
   Past ads tended to focus on products. New ads seek to convey a
more subtle message: that Bean's outdoors is not about mountaintops
and dangerous whitewater rapids, but about the outdoors that begins
just outside a family's back door.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ads are saying that Bean and the outdoors are more
relevant to your life than you think,'' says Bean advertising
manager Dave Holmblad. ``We want people to think that something is
going on at Bean.''
</P>
<P>
   As vice president Shea acknowledges, this is ``the most risk
this company has ever faced.''
</P>
<P>
   But in taking risks, Bean may have a secret weapon _ its name
and its mystique.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.L. Bean has got one of the great brand names in the catalog
industry, and Bean has not really capitalized on that,'' says
consultant Sroge.
</P>
<P>
   That's the plan now. With new initiatives under way, Gorman
says, ``We think we're going the right way.''

A SHY EDITOR REWRITES HIGH SCHOOL

NEVER BEEN KISSED 
Directed by: Raja Gosnell 
Screenplay by: Abby Cohn &AMP; Marc Silverstein 
Starring: Drew Barrymore, David Arquette, Molly Shannon, John C.
Reilly, Garry Marshall, Michael Vartan, Leelee Sobieski, Jessica
Alba, Marley Shelton, Jordan Ladd, Jeremy Jordan 
Running time: 102 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (sex-related material and some drug content) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Drew Barrymore is on a winning streak that's only going to get
longer with ``Never Been Kissed.'' Even more than ``The Wedding
Singer'' and ``Ever After,'' it's a romantic comedy that spotlights
her ability to make the romance count for a lot more than the
comedy. She does it by filling the screen with the sweetest smile
and most simpatico presence of any young actress currently before
the cameras. One look at that soft, radiant smile and you want her
character to get whatever she wants. Her pale full face is a
perfect vessel for yearning. And this film gives her a lot to yearn
for as a shy copy editor trying out as an undercover reporter by
enrolling in high school to get the kind of story you never read on
the education pages.
</P>
<P>
   It also gives her the chance at the age of 25 to go back and do
high school over again, this time, she hopes, without the agonies
and humiliations she suffered the first time around as a sweet geek
laboring under the triple curse of pudginess, braces, and zits. The
film's message is to not go by appearances and to refuse to let
yourself be shot down by those who do. It will of course fall on
deaf ears. This time around, though, Barrymore's Josie Geller is a
bit better equipped to make her way through the slings and arrows
of outrageous classmates. But although she's more poised, she's
still vulnerable, partly because she's never been really kissed. To
complicate things, she's drawn to her English teacher (Michael
Vartan) and he's drawn to her, although, given her assumed student
identity, it can't go farther than an exchange of longing glances.
</P>
<P>
   These days it's almost impossible to avoid leaning on
Shakespeare, and this film does so by borrowing from the theme of
``As You Like It.'' When Josie dazzles the others in class with her
observation that the play's heroine, Rosalind, disguised as a boy,
is best able to see through the disguises of others, she's speaking
from experience. She's also the one who nods meaningfully when the
teacher observes that disguise changes all the rules and can be
liberating. As in the play, the romantic confusions multiply. Josie
plays her professional ambition against her yearning to finally
find the right guy, as she duly notes the ways in which the flashy
social set wars against the brainy and much nicer nerds, led by
Leelee Sobieski.
</P>
<P>
   Brightening the picture considerably is David Arquette, as
Josie's tag-along brother. He was a wild success back in high
school because he knows how to play the social card, although he
actually has been going nowhere since he graduated. Bonding through
his gregariousness and adding a measure of warmth that his shy
sister keeps inside, he's also supportive and loving. He's the most
appealing brother figure to turn up in a romantic comedy since the
late John Candy in ``Splash.'' ``Never Been Kissed'' is a triumph
of warmth over predictability, with Molly Shannon's sidekick and
John C. Reilly's boss adding to the pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   The real element of fantasy is to be found in its depiction of
the professional environment of the youngest copy editor on the
Chicago Sun-Times. Josie not only has her own office into which
colleagues respectfully trudge, bearing copy by hand, but also has
her own personal assistant, which is more than any copy editor I've
ever known has had. But Barrymore can even smile her way around
that anomaly. She's the big reason ``Never Been Kissed'' is a
charmer.

AS THE JOKES MULTIPLY, GORE TRIES TO BUTT OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After serving more than six years as vice
president, Al Gore is facing one of the toughest challenges of his
career: being the butt of a joke.
</P>
<P>
   First, Gore said he and his wife served as the models for the
tear-jerker novel, ``Love Story.'' (Not entirely so.) A month ago,
Gore took credit for ``creating'' the Internet. (He helped expand
it.) Then, the vice president boasted that as a child he learned to
slop hogs on the family farm. (But he didn't mention that he had
spent much of his childhood living in a fancy Washington hotel.)
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have wasted no time mocking the man they assume will
be the Democratic presidential nominee. In recent days, the
Republican Leadership Council, which boosts moderate GOP
candidates, paid for an advertising campaign that lists the Gore
gaffes and mocks the vice president for ``reinventing reality.''
The ad ends by zinging Gore in a computerized voice familiar to
anyone who has used America Online: ``Goodbye!''
</P>
<P>
   But for Gore, this is no laughing matter. Gore aides are well
aware their candidate is largely undefined in the public mind and
remember how former vice president Dan Quayle's spelling mistake
and other miscues became a metaphor for Quayle's supposed lack of
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It matters whether you are the butt of Letterman and Leno
jokes for two years,'' said political analyst Stuart Rothenberg,
referring to late-night television hosts David Letterman and Jay
Leno. He said Gore could be seriously hurt ``if this seeps into the
electorate's consciousness, that he exaggerates and you can't
believe everything he says.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a vivid history of politicians remembered for words and
actions that seemed trivial at the time. Gerald Ford, a superb
athlete, is remembered for his few stumbles. Jimmy Carter, an avid
outdoorsman, is recalled for his encounter with a ``killer
rabbit.'' And Quayle, who is now seeking the Republican nomination,
is widely viewed as a long shot partly because of his many
misstatements and his infamous misspelling of potato as
``potatoe.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether Gore's lone Democratic primary
opponent, former senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, will be helped
by Gore's gaffes. But one beneficiary has been Quayle, who recently
tweaked Gore over the matter, referring to a feature of many
computer word processing programs. If Gore created the Internet,
Quayle said, ``then I invented the spell check.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said the attacks are unfair. Lehane
said Gore did ``play a leading role'' in creating today's version
of the Internet and did live on a Tennessee farm for many summers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is pretty clear is that the Republicans don't have
anything positive to talk about, so what they are doing is
attacking the vice president,'' Lehane said. ``We are going to
continue to talk about Al Gore's compelling life story.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Republicans are copying the strategy used by the
Democrats in 1996 by trying to ``define'' Gore before he does.
During the last presidential campaign, the Democratic National
Committee spent millions of dollars on ads that attacked Bob Dole
long before he became the Republican nominee. The ads played a
major role in pushing down Dole's approval rating, and the
Clinton-Gore campaign easily won reelection.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican ads use humor to deliver a potentially
devastating message: Gore shades the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee,
has spent the past week mocking Gore. On Monday, for example,
Nicholson issued a statement criticizing Gore for attending a
Beverly Hills fund-raiser while bombs were falling on Belgrade and
refugees were fleeing Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd expect more sensitivity from the guy who inspired `Love
Story,' '' Nicholson said sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson, in an interview, said, ``There is nothing complicated
about what we have been doing. We just think that Gore is so into
himself and his self-importance. And for some reason he has gotten
into an epidemic of overblowing his own importance with these
exaggerated claims. He is doing it to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, Gore often is self-deprecating and witty, joking
that he is so stiff people can't tell the difference between him
and his Secret Service agents. But Gore also has been awkward and
defensive in public, as when he defended his campaign fund-raising
practices by saying there was ``no controlling legal authority''
regarding his actions.
</P>
<P>
   In each Gore gaffe, there is some truth and perhaps some
exaggeration. For example, Gore went to Harvard with ``Love Story''
author Erich Segal, who has said he modeled the lead male
character, Oliver, partly on Gore but also on Gore's roommate,
actor Tommy Lee Jones. Oliver's love, Jenny, apparently was modeled
on someone other than on Tipper Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Gore seemed to be irked when Bradley, a former NBA
star, touted his wide-ranging ``life experiences'' and implicitly
questioned Gore's. The vice president responded by telling an Iowa
audience about life on the farm with his father. ``He taught me how
to clean out hog waste with a shovel and a hose,'' Gore said. ``He
taught me how to clear land with a double-bladed ax. He taught me
how to plow a steep hillside with a team of mules. He taught me how
to take up hay all day long in the hot sun and then after a dinner
break go over and help the neighbors take up hay before the rain
came and spoiled it on the ground. I wonder if Senator Bradley has
had any of those life experiences?''
</P>
<P>
   While Gore did spend summers on his family's farm, he spent much
of his childhood in Washington, where his father was a senator and
the family lived in a six-room apartment on the eighth floor of
Washington's fancy Fairfax Hotel. He attended the elite St. Albans
school in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As for his computer prowess, Gore told CNN on March 9: ``During
my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in
creating the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   That comment prompted Republicans to note the Internet actually
was established by the Pentagon around 1969. But Gore aides, and
numerous Internet authorities, do give the vice president credit
for pushing legislation that helped create today's version of the
Internet, which is far different from what the Pentagon started.
Gore aides hope the publicity about Gore's comments will, in the
long run, educate the public that the vice president played a
significant role in the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore suffered another Internet-related embarrassment on
Tuesday. After having championed legislation that prevents
commercial web sites from seeking a child's e-mail address and
other information without parental consent, Gore unveiled his
campaign web site that included a ``Kid's Corner'' that sought such
personal information from children. After realizing the
contradiction, the Gore campaign rewrote the web page to ask only
for a child's first name.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his Internet statement during a visit to California
this week, Gore said, ``I'm proud of the work that I did do in the
Congress to help facilitate the development of the Internet as we
know it.'' But when pressed on his claim of creating it, Gore tried
to make a joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day I made that statement,'' Gore said, ``I was tired
because I had been up all night inventing the Camcorder.''

   BRAZDA, Macedonia _ The cries rose up Thursday over the misery
of this refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   Two daughters sobbing uncontrollably, mourning the death of
their mother. An infant, just born under a green canvas tent,
wailing her way into the world.
</P>
<P>
   In just one day in the Brazda refugee camp, the rhythm of life
and death unfolds amid the numbing enormity of human suffering. The
scenes, as archetypical asa mother clasping a new baby or as stark
as a son digging a shallow grave for his mother, make vivid the
desperation and the tragedy of the tens of thousands of refugees
who've fled to this side of the Kosovo border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life goes on... There is the sadness of death and the joy of
birth and a story that will break your heart in every tent,'' said
Major Christian Holler, the head of the International Red Cross
operation in the Brazda camp.
</P>
<P>
   In the quiet hour just past midnight, 55-year-old Hamida Zenili,
a mother of eight, died after falling ill in the squalor of the
refugee camps. She is one of roughly 40 people who have died in the
camps in the two weeks since the refugees began flowing across the
frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the long shadows of late afternoon, Baharia Baricha was
gripping her husband's hand as she delivered her first child, a
girl, into the world. The baby was the 15th born in the two-week
period.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours that unfolded Thursday between the death of Hamida
and the birth of the baby girl, dramatic family reunions were
taking place from one tent to the next.
</P>
<P>
   In the early morning, a 10-year-old girl who had been shot by
Serbian troops in her left arm was reunited with her mother. An
elderly man, who suffered from a stroke and was unable to speak to
aid workers looking for his family, cried when his son found him in
a hospital tent. A man in the hospital bed next to him pointed to
the bloody bandage over his eye, saying a Macedonian soldier had
slammed him with the butt of a rifle when he asked if he could
leave the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Around thema line of thousands snaked through wooden stockade
fencing that led to aide workers handing out packaged meals and
loaves of bread. Another long line formed in front of folding
tables where United Nations workers painstakingly tried to document
the refugees' names for liststo be transferred around the world,
from Albania to Turkey and Germany and Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Children kicked a soccer ball in the dust with two NATO
soldiers. Families clutched the barbed wire fencing at the entrance
to the camp and waved to family and friends on the other side who
were kept back by armed Montenegran police who are refusing to
allow the refugees to leave the camp. Helicopters hovered overhead
transporting in more supplies and more tents.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was 4:14 p.m. when Baharia Baricha, 24, gave birth to a girl
in a makeshift operating room in the tent hospital set up by a
Israeli team of 102 medics flown in as part of a massive aid effort
at the border camps.
</P>
<P>
   Baharia's husband, Sabit, held her hand as she pushed and winced
in pain as the child came into the world.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had fled their village just outside Pristina 10 days
earlier. They feared that all the tension, the violence, and the
walking in the long column of refugees fleeing Kosovo into
Macedonia would induce early labor. But the baby arrived on the due
date, a beautiful girl weighing just under seven pounds. Her
healthy new lungs triumphantly told the refugee camp she had
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to see her born into so much confusion,'' said a
proud Sabit as he held the baby in his arms. ``But she also brings
so much happiness into our lives. She helps us remember that
despite all these bad things, we have to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple still hadn't decided on a name. The Israeli surgeon
suggested Sarah, the Israeli matriarch. The Albanian Muslim
translator suggested the name ``Rania'' after Jordan's Queen Rania,
who made a ceremonial walk through the camp followed by an
entourage of paparazzi.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had time to even think about it,'' said Sabit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In another medical tent, Adelena Berisha, 10, explained how she
was shot in the arm. As doctors working on a plaster cast to hold
her small left arm in place, Adelena said she had gotten lost in
the massive refugee camp in the ``no man's land'' between Kosovo
and Macedonia. She wandered down a set of train tracks and strayed
back to the border almost into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lost. I couldn't find my way. And when I saw the
soldiers I thought they would help me,'' she said. ``But then I
heard the bangs and I was knocked down and my arm was bleeding. I
was crying.''
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers the little girl had run into were apparently
Yugoslav Army troops on the Kosovo side of the border. After she
was hit, Macedonian police picked her up and brought her to a
hospital on the Macedonian side. She remained there for several
days and the hospital staff could not find her parents. But her
mother had finally found her Thursday, and the Israeli doctors were
operating on what they say is nerve damage from the bullet wound.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli medical team has offered to fly the girl back to Tel
Aviv for delicate surgery correct the nerve damage.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Sadia, comforted her daughter Thursday in the cool
shade of a green canvas tent in the emergency room of the makeshift
hospital. She was thankful to the doctors, relieved to have found
her daughter, and furious about what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did this to a child?'' she asked. ``What is wrong with
this world?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hamida Zenili, 55, was the mother of eight children. She didn't
want to leave her Pristina home. The family had a comfortable life
thanks to the family patriarch who works as a waiter in St. Moritz,
Switzerland, and sent money home. Hamida, a protective mother,
demanded that her children take their education seriously. Six of
the eight children were college educated. They had a solid
middle-class life that she did not want to give up.
</P>
<P>
   But her son, Bekim, a law student, insisted that the family
flee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fled the paramilitaries. They said they would come to kill
us,'' he said. ``But we come here and still death finds us.''
</P>
<P>
   The family waited in the column of misery that stretched for
miles as they fled Pristina, and like tens of thousands of others
ended up in the mud and squalor of the ``no man's land.'' The
filth, disease, and daily indignity of the camp took its toll.
Hamida refused to sleep, and waited in long lines for food for her
family. Exhausted and consumed with anxiety, she fell ill. Then
heavy rains came. Her condition worsened. At first the symptoms
were flu, then dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, the family along with 40,000 others were
forcibly uprooted and bused to this camp.
</P>
<P>
   The move was the breaking point. Ay 9 p.m. Wednesday she was
taken to an emergency medical tent where she suffered shortness of
breath, according to doctors. Just past midnight, her blood
pressure dropped and she died.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross officials worked tirelessly to help the family arrange
a proper Muslim burial. Hamida's body was ritually bathed, as is
the tradition, and wrapped in a white sheet. The family was
permitted to leave the camp for two hours to bury her in a hillside
cemetery just 500 yards from the stench of the Blace camp where she
had grown ill.
</P>
<P>
   Her sons dug her grave and marked her initials and the date of
her death on a simple piece of wood stuck in the dirt. But the
family vows that they will return to Kosovo, and that they will
exhume her remains and give her a proper burial in a graveyard in
Kosovo, where ancestors for four generations lay.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, her daughters and sons cried and comforted each other,
sitting on the ground outside a tent. Sabrije, 22, looked to the
heavens and sobbed. She was unconsolable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will return to Kosovo. And we will take her with us,'' said
Bekim, speaking over the wailing cries. ``We will not leave her
behind. Kosovo is our home.''

MILITARY DESERVES HONEST ANSWERS FROM CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUGLAS MACKINNON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. _ What if you gave a war and despised the very
military you asked to carry out your mission?
</P>
<P>
   That is now the problem facing President Clinton and his
administration. Past comments and actions come back to haunt them
as they ineffectively try to wage war over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   During my final three years in the Bush administration, I served
at the Pentagon in a joint command comprised of members of the Air
Force, Army, Navy and Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   I have kept in regular contact with friends in the Pentagon and
military. While it may come as no surprise that many members of the
military look at Clinton with a jaundiced eye, some may be shocked
at how deep the anger and mistrust run.
</P>
<P>
   Military personnel in every branch openly wonder how a president
who once mocked their very existence can now ask them to put their
lives at risk. And why? An Army colonel asked me, ``Why does a
president who dodged the draft and once stated that he loathed the
military now ask us to fight and possibly die thousands of miles
away? Why does a president who avoided service in Vietnam now use
the same rationale for Kosovo as President Johnson did for
Southeast Asia?
</P>
<P>
   ``After years of Whitewater and Monica, is this president now
desperately trying to create a legacy by spilling the blood of
those in uniform?''
</P>
<P>
   My honest answer is, ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Many political appointees in the Clinton administration
(including a number at the Pentagon and in positions of power over
the military) have openly stated their ``disgust'' for the
military, its code of conduct and way of life.
</P>
<P>
   It is fair for men and women in uniform to ask if those who
would send them to die have the proper respect and understanding
for the job they perform.
</P>
<P>
   It is right for those who serve to point at past Clinton
mistakes and ask if he has learned his lesson.
</P>
<P>
   The colonel I spoke with mentioned Mogadishu, Somalia, and the
18 elite American soldiers who were not only killed, but also
stripped, disfigured and dragged through the streets as macabre
trophies.
</P>
<P>
   In his mind, he said, this happened because ``Clinton and the
secretary of Defense didn't send in the armor requested by the
commanders on the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   How many people today remember that secretary of Defense Les
Aspin had to resign because of that tragedy? More importantly, how
many people in the Clinton administration remember that?
</P>
<P>
   The military has a right to wonder if it is being used like
pawns for political, or worse yet, personal gain. This president
and his administration have a track record when it comes to the
military _ and it's not very good.
</P>
<P>
   Are those in uniform wrong to question the motives of the
president when he bombs a pharmaceutical factory in Sudan at the
same time Monica Lewinsky is scheduled to testify?
</P>
<P>
   Are those in uniform wrong to question the motives of the
president when he bombs Iraq during his impeachment trial?
</P>
<P>
   Many in the military now want to know why Clinton is using them
in the war over Kosovo. Is it to prevent the genocide that his
military commanders and intelligence experts warned him couldn't be
stopped with an air campaign _ or, is it instead to try to
manufacture a page in history for the legacy of Bill Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   Our men and women in uniform deserve an honest answer.
</P>

SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS TO SAM HINGSTON'S SUICIDE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILTON, Conn. _ Pride fairly shrieks from the cardboard sign.
``HOME OF SAM HINGSTON, CONNECTICUT STATE WRESTLING CHAMPION!''
announces the handmade landmark tacked to a telephone pole at the
bottom of the winding driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Lest there be any doubt, the living room of the red split-level
at the top of the hill is a virtual museum embellishing the
message. Samuel Hingston's grandmother, Dorothy, is the loving
curator. She guides a visitor along the table and back wall
bedecked with the mileposts that trace her maternal grandson's
journey of distinction, a journey that ended tragically and
suddenly some two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   There are photos of Sam with his mother, Marjorie, and his
father, Richard, his older sister, Jane, and his twin sister,
Sarah, smiling and hugging, always smiling and hugging.
</P>
<P>
   Sam in his baseball and football uniforms at Woodstown High in
New Jersey. Sam's medal as a New Jersey district wrestling
champion. Sam's Wilton High Warriors baseball jersey in a glass
frame, signifying that his No. 17 has been retired. Sam's wrestling
singlet, also encased in glass, signed by every member of the
Wilton squad, with a team picture beside it. And, at the far end,
the draw for the 160-pound division from the Connecticut wrestling
championships in mid-February at Glastonbury High, revealing that
Sam won four matches and the Class M title.
</P>
<P>
   It is a virtual continuum of honor and glory at two schools, in
two states. But there is a jarring gap in the middle, and it
reflects the tragic dichotomy that ended with a young man, hailed
as a hero by most and denounced as a pariah by others, choosing to
commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy pauses at the large framed photo that is the centerpiece
of the exhibit. It is a class picture of Sam, with his
short-cropped black hair and handsome, angular face set off by a
luminous smile. Tucked at the bottom lefthand corner, she spots a
much smaller picture, a religious card depicting Jesus embracing a
new arrival to the kingdom of heaven. She picks it up haltingly.
Her voice cracks. ``I'd like to give him a good kick in the
bottom,'' she says. ``Such a stupid, senseless act . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   She gazes around at the floral arrangements filling virtually
every available space in the room, at the basket beneath the table
overflowing with hundreds of cards. ``Everything's all over the
place,'' she says. ``We're trying to get some semblance . . . If we
could only understand . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   That is the curse of it for the Hingstons. They cannot
understand why this museum is in fact a memorial. They never will
comprehend why 17-year-old Samuel Hingston _ three-sport athlete,
honor student, ROTC scholarship recipient to Boston College, wildly
popular peer and mentor in Wilton _ took his own life. They do not
acknowledge or accept that his past in New Jersey _ where he is
known not only as a scholar-athlete but also as an accused
13-year-old rapist who was ultimately acquitted _ may have hounded
him to his grave.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This much is known. Sometime in the middle of the night between
March 23 and 24, Sam Hingston arose from his corner bedroom and
walked into the garage of his grandparents' house near the base of
a secluded cul-de-sac in this affluent New York commuter community,
where the median house price is more than $400,000. He took an
empty plastic sports drink bottle, filled it with the contents of a
can marked ``white gas,'' left the can in the basement, returned to
the house, entered the bathroom, and locked the door behind him. He
took a swig of gas from the bottle. He doused himself with the
rest.
</P>
<P>
   Then he lit a match and set himself ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing a thud, his mother raced from her bedroom, saw her son's
room empty, noticed the bathroom door locked _ it was never locked
before _ kicked the door, and frantically yelled, ``Sam, let me in!
Let me in!'' A 911 call was placed to police saying that Sam had
locked himself in the bathroom and wouldn't come out.
</P>
<P>
   Marjorie kicked the door open. Another 911 call was made, this
time with screams in the background, saying there was a fire.
</P>
<P>
   Police and firefighters arrived on the scene almost
simultaneously at 3:05 a.m. There they discovered that the fire had
not been structural, as had been suspected, but had extinguished
itself because of the lack of oxygen caused by the closed door.
</P>
<P>
   They also discovered Sam Hingston, charred from head to toe, his
facial features obliterated. ``We could not immediately tell
whether the victim was African American or Caucasian,'' says Fire
Chief William von Zehle, who rode in the second of the two Wilton
engines that answered the call.
</P>
<P>
   Sam, somehow, was still alive, and he responded to the emergency
medical technicians' instructions to place an oxygen mask over his
face before they performed a tracheotomy. ``I think once he did
what he did, he quickly thought, `This is not the way I want to do
this,' '' says von Zehle. ``That's not the way to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam did not die, not right then. With third-degree burns over 85
percent of his body, he was rushed by ambulance to Norwalk Hospital
at 3:37, then immediately airlifted to the burn unit at Westchester
Medical Center in nearby Valhalla, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, his father was racing up from Woodstown, from where
he has commuted on weekends and vacations since the rest of the
family suddenly relocated last April. Richard Hingston, an art
teacher and assistant tennis coach at Williamstown (N.J.) High, had
been asleep in his den with the television on and hadn't heard the
phone ring when the initial call came from Wilton. Finally,
Richard's father, a New Jersey physician, got through and informed
him that Sam had burned himself.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Richard arrived at the hospital, Sam was on life
support. Sarah met her father in the parking lot, and when he
inquired as to his son's condition, she told him he wasn't going to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 4:30 in the afternoon, Samuel Hingston was declared
dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poor boy,'' sighs Richard. ``The poor beautiful boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Sam left no note, this may never be known: What prompted
such a grotesque act of seeming self-eradication?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll never have the answer,'' says Richard.
</P>
<P>
   But as with any mystery, there are clues. They just aren't
evident in Wilton.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To the people of his adopted home, the news was
incomprehensible; the announcement of Sam's death set off waves of
grieving, and crisis counseling was provided for all 930 students,
plus staff and faculty.
</P>
<P>
   ``From most likely (to commit suicide) to least likely,'' says
principal Deborah Low, who is serving as Wilton High's spokeswoman
on the matter, ``he'd be on the least likely list. When I heard, I
said, `Sam? Sam Hingston?' ''
</P>
<P>
   That's because this is the Sam Hingston they knew:
</P>
<P>
   To his admirers, it seemed he had a gift for both achievement
and service.
</P>
<P>
   At Wilton, he was a tricaptain of both the football and
wrestling teams this season, a designated hitter and second baseman
last spring in baseball, a member of Amnesty International, a
volunteer at a home for retired nuns, owner of a 3.7 grade-point
average who had applied to Georgetown, Harvard, and Yale but
already had settled on BC and a $23,000 ROTC scholarship, hoping to
pursue the military as a steppingstone to a career in either
business or politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made everybody feel special,'' says his sister Jane, 19, a
sophomore at St. Michael's College in Vermont. ``That's why
everybody liked him. He didn't focus on himself but on the other
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's why he made an instant impact in Wilton.
</P>
<P>
   After eight days of preseason football camp in August, he was
voted a tricaptain. ``I think he made an immediate impression as a
leader,'' says athletic director Doug Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   An unassuming one, apparently. ``He never told us he was a
captain,'' says his father. ``We had to wait until it was announced
at the first game to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   He was an undersized middle linebacker on a 1-9 team, but he
wound up with more than 100 tackles and was named second-team
All-Fairfield County.
</P>
<P>
   On the wrestling mat, he surpassed those achievements. Yet that
wasn't necessarily his major legacy. ``I sought his advice about
some things,'' says Rubin. ``His gentlemanliness on the mat. Win or
lose, he'd always shake hands with the opposing wrestlers and
coaches. I wanted to know what motivated him to do that so I could
learn from it.''
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't just a good sport. Community service is part of
the curriculum at Wilton, and Sam volunteered at the Mother House
for the School Sisters of Notre Dame, a retirement home with 136
nuns. His assignment was to feed those nuns who were unable to care
for themselves, but he exceeded the job description. ``They said he
was absolutely delightful,'' says Sister Amalia Menardi, director
of volunteers at the home. ``He would make them laugh, hug them.
And when his service requirement was completed, he wanted to keep
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   In the classroom, his influence went beyond his stature as a
National Merit Commended Scholar and National Honor Society member.
Marjorie recounts a conversation with the mother of a freshman who
was in Sam's marketing class. Marketing, like most studies, came
quickly to Sam; the freshman was struggling. They wound up as
partners on a project, and the freshman expressed his misgivings to
Sam.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what to study,'' Sam told him. ``We'll get a good
project grade, and that'll pump you right up.''
</P>
<P>
   They aced the project, and the freshman wound up greatly
surpassing expectations for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Marjorie Hingston heard about that two weekends ago, as she
heard countless tributes from Wilton citizens who couldn't
understand why it was necessary to speak of her son in the past
tense.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they would have had they been aware of the other Sam,
the tortured Sam, the young man who might not have shaken the
stigma of an allegation for which he was ultimately acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody I know of at school was aware of anything about his
past,'' says a Wilton High staffer. ``Just that he came from New
Jersey and transferred last April.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the Woodstown Diner and Restaurant, in a dreary hamlet of
some 3,800 set amid truck stops and farms near the desolate foot of
the New Jersey Turnpike, his supporters never believed the charge:
that four years ago, Sam Hingston raped a fellow eighth grader in a
shed behind a friend's house at a summer party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were best friends,'' says a former classmate, who requests
anonymity. ``He would have said something to his best friends, and
he never did.''

   MILLENNIUM-LUTHERAN _ On Oct. 31, 1517, Martin Luther tacked a
paper to the Palace Church door in Wittenberg, sparking a movement
that changed Christianity. But the church Luther founded finds
itself in deep trouble in Europe, where the Lutheran World
Federation reported a ``general reduction in numbers.'' And the
problem is even greater in Germany, the homeland of Protestanism,
where more than a million people have left the church rolls in
the1990s. (Gwhite, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 67. WITH PHOTOS.

   MILLENNIUM-PROTESTANTS _ Most German Protestants spend little
time in the pews, but the history of northern Germany, the
birthplace of the Protestant Reformation, can be traced through
three churches: The Palace Church in Wittenberg where Luther nailed
the theses that started the Reformation; the Berliner Dom, or great
emperial cathedral, that survived the tremendous forces that shaped
20th century East Berlin; and, St. Michael's in Hamburg, a city
famous for its churches and its red-light district, where the
rebuilding of St. Michael's after World War II has become a major
point of pride for the city. (Gwhite, Atlanta

   MILLENNIUM-LUTHER _ Although Catholic monk Martin Luther never

 WILTON, Conn.: ... never did.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To them, such an act would have been totally out of character.
Richard Hingston says his son had read Martin Luther King's
autobiography, ``Let My Trumpet Sound,'' and had been profoundly
affected by King's philosophy of effecting change without violence.
Josh DuBois, a childhood friend, recalls that ``with him, it was
sports mostly. He was always popular, really good-looking, very
sweet. He knew how to talk to the girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in death, apparently, support has not waned. A source says
the family of the girl who filed the rape charge has been harassed
since Sam's suicide and that patrol cars have been dispatched for
occasional surveillance of their house.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was another faction that considered him guilty.
Charges were filed some two years later, Richard Hingston said in a
prepared statement last week, and the case did not come to trial
until last summer. ``These juvenile cases can take forever,'' says
a source. Though juvenile records by law are sealed, sources have
confirmed both the allegation and disposition.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting to go to court, Sam seemingly thrived at Woodstown
High.
</P>
<P>
   A regional AAU wrestling champion at the age of 8, a year after
taking up the sport when he was inspired by watching two cousins
win Vermont state titles, Sam added to his laurels at the
interscholastic level.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball was hands down his favorite sport; his father remembers
young Sam insisting that they go to the playground so Richard could
hit him 200 grounders at shortstop, either to his right or his
left. ``He'd get mad if I hit them right at him,'' recalls Richard.
``He wanted to go in the hole and pick it.''
</P>
<P>
   It showed on the Woodstown varsity, where Sam was a slick second
baseman and solid hitter.
</P>
<P>
   And his football coach, Clint Ware, recalls him as a linebacker
``who always knew where the ball was. He was so smart on the
field.'' What impressed Ware, a guidance counselor at the school,
even more was that Sam was ``such a leader and organizer.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he was selected to attend Governor's School,
representing Salem County as one of New Jersey's most promising
teen leaders. There he and another student organized and staged a
variety show, donating the proceeds to the Count Basie Center for
inner-city youth.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the veneer of accomplishment, the impending trial
lurked. ``Most kids believed he didn't do it,'' says the Woodstown
classmate who requests anonymity. ``But some thought he did.''
</P>
<P>
   The tension broiled on March 19, 1998, when, at 2:26 p.m.,
Marjorie Hingston called police to say her son had been the victim
of assault and battery. While no charges were filed, sources and
friends confirm that Sam was attacked at his Woodstown school by a
17-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to say something, but I've been told not to comment
on it,'' says Billy Coles, the alleged assailant. But friends of
the Hingstons say Coles was convinced of Sam's guilt, and sources
indicate that was the motive for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Sam was treated for minor injuries at Salem County Hospital and
released.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he complained to friends that he and his family
were receiving death threats, though he took no action, says his
classmate, ``because he had a lot of other things to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, some two weeks after the attack, Marjorie left her
job as head of the Upward Bound program at the University of
Delaware and transplanted the family to Wilton, where they moved in
with her parents while Richard retained his teaching job in New
Jersey, planning to join them full-time this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The trial took place in juvenile court in Salem County last
July; by the following month, Sam was a Wilton football tricaptain,
and all seemed tranquil. Last month, he was selected Wilton's male
nominee for the Scholar-Athlete Award, ``and a minute after I made
the announcement over the loudspeaker,'' says Rubin, ``he was in
here thanking me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sam was not one of the Wilton baseball captains, but he was no
less a leader. He had established himself almost immediately after
his arrival last April, according to center fielder Gary Dunn, a
cocaptain who considered himself Sam's closest friend at school.
Though a lingering wrestling injury limited him mostly to DH duties
last spring, ``I led off and he batted second, and he was doing
well,'' says Dunn. ``Me and him were a 1-2 punch.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Ben Clar, the other cocaptain, recalls that Sam fit in
right away at school. ``We loved him,'' says Clar. ``He was the new
kid and he didn't come on. He laid low, knew his place. But on the
field, he stepped it up a little. He was kind of a sparkplug,
getting us going.''
</P>
<P>
   As this season approached, even while he was consumed by his
wrestling responsibilities, Sam didn't ignore his first love.
``He'd drop by every once in a while,'' says Clar, ``and he'd ask
us, `Are you guys ready for baseball? This is going to be our
year.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago during Wilton's spring break, many of the baseball
players attended an optional camp in Orlando, Fla. But Richard
Hingston said his son was suffering from a gastrointestinal virus
and headaches for which he was taking a prescription medication.
``The baseball camp was optional, so it didn't mean anything that
he didn't go,'' says Clar. ``And nobody knew he hadn't been feeling
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam spent the break with his father in Woodstown, keeping a
decidedly low profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sick the whole time,'' says DuBois.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never left the house,'' says Sean Lenahan, who lives across
the street and used to wrestle with Sam. ``He didn't really see
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The following Monday, Sam returned to school at Wilton, where
Low and her fellow faculty noticed nothing unusual in his demeanor.
That afternoon, the baseball team held its first practice, an
indoor session, and his teammates remember that Sam appeared
buoyant as he worked out with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really excited, talking about the season,'' says Clar.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't seem sick at all,'' says Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   While school attendance records are confidential, teammates
confirm that Sam was absent the next day. They thought nothing of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is absent from school once in a while,'' says Clar,
``so it was no big deal. We expected him back the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn saw Sarah Hingston in school and asked how Sam was feeling.
``She said he was doing fine,'' recalls Dunn. ``As far as I know,
the family were the only ones to see or talk to him that day.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, Sam Hingston took his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never seemed down,'' says Dunn. ``That was the whole weird
part.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked what might have prompted the act, Richard Hingston refuses
to speculate, instead issuing this statement:
</P>
<P>
   ``Our son was charged with a juvenile offense. The charges
stemmed from something that was alleged to have happened over four
years ago. The allegations surfaced two years later. My son pled
not guilty and he stood firm. It went to trial and he was found
innocent of all charges beyond a shadow of a doubt. The family had
already moved to Wilton, Conn., and had closed this chapter in our
lives. I would ask that you respect our privacy in this matter. Sam
had moved on to accomplish great things with humility and grace.
And this community of Wilton, Conn., embraced him wonderfully. The
family and the friends you must have talked to hold Sam in high
regard with loving memory.''
</P>
<P>
   But why would he kill himself? His classmate at the Woodstown
Diner has a theory: ``He did it on Billy Coles's birthday. It was
as if he was trying to send a message.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wilton and Woodstown sent Sam a posthumous message.
</P>
<P>
   The day after his death, Dunn cleared out Sam's school and
baseball lockers and returned the contents to the Hingstons. ``And
we're gonna make sure nobody else uses those lockers,'' says Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   That Friday, the Wilton girls' field hockey team, of which Sarah
is a member, brought dinner to the family. ``There must have been
30 of them here,'' says Marjorie, ``all in their team jackets.''
</P>
<P>
   Students at both Wilton and Woodstown flooded the Hingstons with
cards celebrating what Sam had meant to them.
</P>
<P>
   And on Saturday, which would have been Sam's first scrimmage of
the season with the baseball team, Our Lady of Fatima Church in
Wilton was jammed to the vestibule for a memorial Mass. The
congregation numbered about 1,000, and it included nine buses
filled with some 400 students from Wilton High. Another two
busloads of students, part of a caravan totaling almost 100, made
the 3 1/2-hour drive from Woodstown.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilton students wore white carnations in tribute, the
baseball team canceled practice to attend, and Sam's ashes lay in a
gold-plated urn atop a wooden table as the Rev. Michael Palmer,
pastor of the church, told the assemblage that Sam's final moments
_ when he complied with the EMTs' requests _ were life-affirming.
</P>
<P>
   Both his sisters spoke. And his father offered this eulogy:
``Sam and I always had catches. We used to say the best thing about
them was that it takes two people, one to throw, one to receive.
Sam, I hope you can catch everyone's tears and throw back some
strength.''
</P>
<P>
   He cannot throw them answers. Was Samuel Hingston's
self-destruction triggered years back by something stemming from
the rape charge, the details of which lie forever sealed among New
Jersey juvenile court records? By the harassment he endured at
Woodstown High? By an urge to deliver a grisly message to his
attacker? By the virus and headaches that plagued him in his final
weeks? By some undetermined development in Wilton after he
seemingly had started life anew among people who were unaware and
unconcerned about his past? By some sudden emotional or
psychological breakdown? By some combination of those
possibilities?
</P>
<P>
   Or, as his family and admirers always will believe, was there no
satisfactory explanation for terminating a life of such apparent
promise?

AFTER CLOUDY LATTER '98, MOST SEE BRIGHTER EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What happened to the doom and gloom?
</P>
<P>
   Corporate profits, the fuel for the stock market's climb,
weren't anything to write home about through the last half of 1998
and more dreary news had been feared for the beginning of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   But profits for the first quarter, which will be reported in a
blizzard beginning next week, now seem like relatively good news
waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that make up the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index are
expected to report earnings 6.1 percent higher than profits in the
same quarter of last year, according to First Call Corp., a Boston
financial data firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day earnings are going to drive the market
higher or lower, so for the time being, we have the wind at our
back,'' said Bob Jones, a portfolio manager at Boston Partners
Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, forty-four of the 100 largest public
companies, based on stock market value, are forecast by analysts to
report lower profits or steeper losses for the quarter, according
to a survey conducted by First Call.
</P>
<P>
   A similar survey conducted three months ago had also forecast
that 44 of 100 local companies would report declining performance
in the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   EMC Corp., the state's most valuable company and one of the
stock market's hottest issues, is expected to post first-quarter
profits 43 percent higher than earnings in the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Among the state's other large companies, Fleet Financial Group,
Raytheon Co., Staples Inc., State Street Corp. and Boston
Scientific Corp. are expected to report double-digit earnings
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette Co. earnings are expected to increase by 4 percent.
BankBoston Corp. profits are forecast to be 8 percent lower than
the year-ago quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings surprises, pleasant or disappointing, can rock
individual stocks. Gillette shares took their biggest one-day hit
since 1987 this week when the Boston company said profits would
probably fall a penny per share below forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Other stocks, particularly smaller issues, can take off like a
rocket on good news.
</P>
<P>
   For the broader stock market, corporate profits began to loom as
a serious problem last year because they were acting just as you
might expect in the late stages of an economic boom. They were
actually down slightly in the third quarter of 1998 and had been
forecast to only edge up in the last three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But the actual fourth quarter results tallied in January turned
out to be stronger than expected, up about 6 percent, and the same
kind of growth seems to be continuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there is a better-looking picture on the earnings
front than what we were talking about last year,'' said Charles
Hill, director of research at First Call.
</P>
<P>
   The message, say many analysts, is never underestimate the power
of low interest rates. Very low inflation and corresponding rates
have helped every part of the economy, especially consumer
spending, and stretched the good times beyond their normal limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you consider earnings growth in excess of 5 percent in
the eighth inning of the economic cycle, that's very positive for
investors,'' said David Sowerby, a portfolio manager and market
strategist for Loomis Sayles &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings outlook is not uniformly upbeat. Some technology
companies, particularly software producers, have ``preannounced''
disappointments to come in the weeks ahead. They are important
beyond their number because technology companies account for about
half the market's overall profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying there's some big negative going on, but there
are subtle changes that are enough to wave a caution flag,'' said
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a few weeks of mostly good news should be pushing the
market even higher from here, right? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have gotten the idea that first-quarter profits should
be upbeat and have already priced some of that optimism into
stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average got most of the attention
busting through 10,000, but the S&AMP;P 500 and the Nasdaq index both
rested at record levels Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   So, earnings news probably won't prompt another miniboom. But
they won't hurt, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect the next few weeks should be fairly positive
ones for the market,'' said quantitative analyst Evan Grace of
State Street Research and Management.

RUNNING TO THE MOUNTAIN 
A Journey of Faith and Change 
By Jon Katz 
Villard, 242 pp., $20 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A quick first look at Jon Katz's new book triggered a mental red
flag. The handsome little volume looked like another navel-gazing
saga by a baby boomer confronting his mortality and his personal
crisis of meaning. It's a theme that has spawned a publishing
boomlet, filling bookstores with sometimes irritating and whiny
laments.
</P>
<P>
   But Katz _ though he certainly seems to be gripped by a certain
angst as he faces turning 50 _ avoids any literary cliches, instead
offering a funny, moving, and triumphant voyage of the soul.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of this wonderfully hope-filled memoir, Katz finds
faith not by running away from family, friends, or work in search
of something more, but by realizing that spiritual sustenance can
come from within _ from the decency with which we handle our roles
as spouses, parents, and friends.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Running to the Mountain,'' Katz, a well-known media critic
and author, buys a rickety cabin with a magnificent vista of the
Adirondack Mountains in upstate New York because life on the bland
streets of suburban New Jersey is steadily sapping his vitality. In
lyrical prose, Katz succinctly captures the kinds of worries that
have become ubiquitous among many in the American middle class: a
sense of settling for safe choices, of settling for less, at home
and in the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not nearly as afraid of dying as I am of the hinges inside
my mind and soul rusting closed,'' Katz writes. ``I am desperate to
keep them open, because I think that if they close, that's one's
first death, the loss of hope, curiosity, and possibility, the
spiritual death. After that, it seems to me, the second one is just
a formality. I wanted to oil the hinges, force the doors to stay
open.''
</P>
<P>
   But what makes Katz's book so appealing and valuable is that he
wants to find answers that do not necessarily involve embracing a
creed, or subscribing to the teachings of whichever guru happens to
be in vogue at the moment. Indeed, he's leery of terms like
religion, divine, and spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ``As such notions _ solitude, spirituality _ have been made to
seem godly, they appear to float high above our mundane and
unheroic experiences,'' he writes. ``We want to read about
conversations with God but don't really expect to have any
ourselves. . . . My hope, coming to the mountain, was that change,
spirituality, and idealism aren't the only way Up There but also
Down Here, in the details of daily life _ family, work, friends,
dogs, dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   So he buys a dilapidated cabin _ against his own common sense
and despite the reservations of his marvelously supportive and
patient wife _ as a way to find himself and keep from becoming so
settled in life that ``he would vanish into the mud like some fat
old catfish.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz avoids the pitfall of becoming nauseatingly self-reflective
by leavening his tale with large doses of humor and with the
adventures of his faithful yellow Labradors, Julius and Stanley,
who accompany Katz to his mountain retreat. A pragmatic city
dweller whose father used to make fun of him for his awkward,
bookish ways, Katz is buoyed by his newfound competency as he
battles an army of mice and embarks on a quest to find well water
for his cabin.
</P>
<P>
   He also is pushed up the mountain by Thomas Merton, the
celebrated Trappist monk who had been a literary mentor to Katz
after he wrote to Merton as a lonely and unhappy child. But Katz
rejects the solitude, sacrifice, and physical hardship Merton chose
for himself. That's one level of spirituality that few people, Katz
believes, can ever attain. Instead, Katz finds inner peace in
helping a new friend he makes on the mountain prepare for
fatherhood, in his sense of accomplishment at having renovated the
worn cabin, and in learning to appreciate the sheer beauty of the
woods.
</P>
<P>
   Katz does not claim to have come down the mountain possessing
some unique brilliant spiritual insight. Doubt and crisis will
never be erased, he freely admits. But, he writes, ``I had stood my
ground, believed in myself, and so, in time, had some others. I had
clung for dear life to my dreams, in the face of common sense and
conventional wisdom, and they had not failed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Katz's inspiring book reminds us, we already possess
the great power of faith. Like others, Katz writes that he came to
believe he had ``a worthwhile place to be in the world, important
things to contribute; to accept that I, more than anyone or
anything else, could guide the way I fared.''

ROBERT ALTMAN'S `COOKIE' NEVER CRUMBLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
COOKIE'S FORTUNE 
Directed by: Robert Altman 
Screenplay by: Anne Rapp 
Starring: Glenn Close, Julianne Moore, Liv Tyler, Chris O'Donnell,
Charles S. Dutton, Patricia Neal, Ned Beatty, Courtney B. Vance,
Donald Moffat, Lyle Lovett 
Running time: 118 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (the depiction of a violent act and for sensuality) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Cookie's Fortune,'' the new Robert Altman film, is something
like the even-numbered symphonies of Beethoven. It's the work of a
master in a lighter mood. It's one of Altman's better recent films
and perhaps his most warmly disarming. Unlike ``Nashville'' and
``Short Cuts,'' where his intercutting of various story strands was
in the service of a larger, darker vision, Altman's purpose here
seems to be the much sunnier and more relaxed one of diverting and
entertaining us. And he does that with surehanded skill, filling
the screen in almost Faulknerian fashion with the color and
eccentricity we have come to expect beneath the placid facades of
small Mississippi towns.
</P>
<P>
   Nominally, it revolves around a death which for a while is about
to be pinned on the most likable character in the film, Charles S.
Dutton's large-hearted and easygoing caretaker named Willis.
Cookie, the matriarch of the title and Willis's employer, lofts the
film into a beguilingly loopy orbit for starters, thanks to
Patricia Neal's immersion in her own world. But then she's found
dead of a gunshot wound the morning after Willis came home drunk
and cleaned all the guns in her cabinet. That means Willis is in
trouble, even though Cookie's officious and pretentious niece,
Camille, played with a nicely gauged arc of febrile intensity by
Glenn Close as a Wicked Witch of the South, has inexcusably
tampered with evidence and disrupted the crime scene in her rush to
loot the place.
</P>
<P>
   The most moving part of the film is the dignity with which
Dutton's Willis sits calmly in the town jail with its cell door
permanently unlocked, waiting for the mess to sort itself out. As
the town sheriff, Ned Beatty is slyly amusing in his apologetic
manner to Willis, whose innocence he proclaims at regular
intervals. He bases his certainty on the fact that he has fished
with Willis all his life, which gives him all the insight he needs.
``Cookie's Fortune'' is less a murder mystery than a shaggy dog
story groping toward putting everything to rights, including
Camille's long-standing domination of her younger sister, Julianne
Moore's Cora, and the cloud under which Cora's daughter, Emma,
played by Liv Tyler, has been living.
</P>
<P>
   Emma is something of a renegade, who works delivering catfish
for local entrepreneur Lyle Lovett, whose crush on Emma looks
simultaneously pathetic and slightly creepy. Even though Emma is a
big-time bad girl by the standards of Holly Springs, Miss., having
logged $234 in parking tickets, her heart is pure. She insists on
being jailed with Willis as a gesture of criminal solidarity. It
may also have something to do with the fact that she wants her
hormones to be in the right place, too, since she and Chris
O'Donnell's bumpkin jailer lust for each other and break away for
trysts behind the Coke machine whenever time and circumstances
permit.
</P>
<P>
   Factor in a church production of ``Salome,'' being directed in
totalitarian fashion by Camille, also Donald Moffat's voice of
reason as the town's only lawyer who knows everybody's secrets but
can't reveal them, and you can see where Altman keeps the film at a
lively boil, even without the sight of John the Baptist's head
being served up on a platter. Never hitting anything too hard,
Altman keeps things fluid and his cast responds with spirited
portrayals that make the most of the telling details with which he
packs this folksy tapestry. All you need to know about Camille, for
instance, you're told on a sign that bills her as co-author of
``Salome'' with Oscar Wilde.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cookie's Fortune'' isn't in the suspense business, but it's a
humane comedy as well as a human comedy, given the emotional depth
it needs by Dutton's relaxed decency. He and Altman make it all
look easy, Dutton in his low-key naturalism, the others zestfully
eccentric in the best possible way, which is to say with never the
slighest hint that in their own minds they are anything but
paragons of normality. Pretty early on, the film signals us that it
isn't out to storm any heights, which adds to its appeal.
``Cookie's Fortune'' is a screenful of Southern comfort, lullingly
served up by a cast that persuades us it would be just as happy
going fishing, then cooking up a batch of catfish enchiladas, as
shooting a movie.

TOM PETTY ECHOES THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, ticket prices. They're still skyrocketing for big-name
rock acts. The Rolling Stones shattered all illusions with the $300
and $650 ticket peaks for their spring tour. And this summer's Bob
Dylan/Paul Simon bill and Crosby, Stills, Nash &AMP; Young tour have
$100-plus prices _ mere chicken feed next to the Stones, but still
deflating to fans who believe in rock as a populist, Everyman
genre.
</P>
<P>
   How refreshing, then, to hear Tom Petty cling to virtual
working-class hero status by keeping his tickets under $50 for a
summer tour with his band, the Heartbreakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to wind up just playing to the elite,'' says
Petty. ``I see some people that don't mind that, but I don't think
my fans would appreciate it too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sometimes we're fools for not going for the dough, but
I don't want to feel that we're taking advantage of people,'' adds
Petty, a hardscrabble Gainesville, Fla., native who now lives in
Los Angeles. ``I don't think ticket prices have to be so high _ and
we're not at the point where we're trying to cash in and retire or
anything. We don't even use sponsors.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty, whose new album, ``Echo,'' reaffirms his role as one of
rock's great songwriters, is so adamant on the ticket issue that he
also dismisses the ``golden circle'' seating concept that has been
fashionable in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't go for golden circle seating,'' Petty says of those
higher-priced seats. ``I always resisted that and have had huge
arguments with promoters about it. I just don't think that one part
of the audience ought to be treated better than the other, or
served drinks during the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty recently played a week of dates at the Fillmore Auditorium
in San Francisco _ and loved it because his fans had equal access
at getting up front. ``If you wanted to get up front, you just had
to kind of work your way up there. Nobody was paying more to get
there,'' says Petty, who used the shows to debut tracks from his
new CD, as well as range into cover songs by everyone from Bo
Diddley and Chuck Berry to the Box Tops and the Delmore Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to bring some of that same spontaneous spirit on
tour,'' says Petty, whose group performs on ``Saturday Night Live''
this week (April 10).
</P>
<P>
   A similar exuberance marks ``Echo,'' which comes out Tuesday.
It's filled with high-energy rock 'n' roll and suggests a return to
Petty's early, Byrds-and-British Invasion-influenced sound. It's a
departure from the Heartbreakers' last hit disc, ``Wildflowers,''
which was milder and more deliberate (and also sold 3 million
copies).
</P>
<P>
   ``We set out to make a rock 'n' roll record this time,'' says
Petty. ``We purposely wouldn't write any slow songs until the very
end of the record, because sometimes ballads creep in and you get a
whole load of them. It's like, `Gosh, we've got to get a few
uptempo things in here.' But this time we got a lot of uptempo
things in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt like I had done a lot of stuff based around the
acoustic guitar, so with this album, I set it up as more of an
electric thing,'' he says. ``We have such a good little rock 'n'
roll band, and I wanted to get them on record doing what they do
best. With the last few albums, I've been really concerned with
craft. But here, I just wanted to catch the vibe of what the band
does with a song.
</P>
<P>
   ``The band played a huge role in the record. I think it's the
first one in a long time when we had all Heartbreakers there every
day, right through the mixing. We had a marvelous time making it.
Right now, I'd say that we're closer than we've been in a long,
long while. We're very united in what we're doing and real happy to
have the band going, because we've seen so many of our friends have
to lay it down. We just feel real lucky and appreciate that it's
still so much fun to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The stars of the Heartbreakers, apart from Petty, are guitarist
Mike Campbell (who sings a track for the first time, the raucous
``I Don't Want to Fight'') and keyboardist Benmont Tench, whom
Petty has known since the age of 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Heartbreakers started in 1976, but I've played with Mike
and Ben since 1970,'' says Petty. ``I grew up with these people.
I'm much closer to them than to any family members. We've spent a
long time together.''
</P>
<P>
   That long time has taken Petty through nearly 20 Top 40 hits,
from the early ``Breakdown'' and ``Don't Do Me Like That,'' to
``You Got Lucky,'' ``Jammin' Me,'' ``Free Fallin','' ``Mary Jane's
Last Dance,'' and ``Learning to Fly.'' Whatever the trend of the
day, Petty seems to have transcended it with his honest, sometimes
defiant, sometimes whimsical, music.
</P>
<P>
   The new album runs from the chiming rock of ``Free Girl Now''
(about a woman freed from an abusive relationship) to the Everly
Brothers-like ``Accused of Love,'' the tongue-in-cheek ``Swingin'
'' (with humorous references to Benny Goodman and Sonny Liston),
and the gentle ``Room at the Top,'' a tribute to deceased Beach Boy
(and Petty idol and friend) Carl Wilson. It contains the line: ``I
got a room where everyone can get a drink and forget those things
that went wrong in their life.'' There are a couple of slower songs
that never jell, but they're more than offset by the abundance of
solid, straight-ahead rockers.
</P>
<P>
   A noted iconoclast, Petty recently released the album's first
single, ``Free Girl Now,'' over the Internet via the MP3 format,
which allows consumers to download it for free. His record company
(Warner Bros.) was not happy about it and asked him to withdraw the
free song, which he eventually did.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling was that singles have just become promotional tools
anyway and no one really makes any money on them,'' says Petty.
``If the technology is there, why not let the fans have this one
(for free)? It will be a good way to promote the record. But of
course, life isn't that simple. I think we had hundreds of
thousands downloaded in a day. We didn't really ask anybody at the
label when we did it. But I must say that Warner Bros. has been
pretty cool about it. They could have been really pissed.''
</P>
<P>
   His foray into the computer world, however, was done by
associates, not by himself. Petty does not profess to be a computer
expert. Far from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even turn one on,'' he says with a laugh. ``My
girlfriend can work one, but I don't want to sit for hours in front
of a computer. I'd rather play the guitar.''

THE STATE OF CAMPAIGN 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time for more free advice to the Baker's Dozen who aspire to the
job of succeeding Bill Clinton as commander-in-chief:
</P>
<P>
   Despite polls showing Vice President Gore trailing Republicans
George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole in preliminary trial heats, my
personal tout sheet rates Gore the most likely successor to
Clinton, followed by Bush, Lamar Alexander, John McCain, and Bill
Bradley, in that order. The rest? No shot.
</P>
<P>
   Gore needs a strong economy or else he's cooked. How will the
economy smell to grazing voters 18 months hence? Like a savory
roast, robust, gravy-drenched, flanked by steaming vegetables? Or
will it give off the telltale whiff of dead meat, a rotting carcass
of what once was grand? That's the smell test Al Gore must face.
From here, the economy in 18 months looks OK.
</P>
<P>
   Problem No. 2 for Gore: How mad will voters still be at Bill
Clinton? Will voters sickened over the Immorality Play in
Washington lash out at Gore when they can't get at Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   Problem No. 3: Al needs to find a political foe he can face
down. Right now, he's a stick figure, like Bush under Reagan, sort
of a butler to a political lord of greater charisma and appeal. Not
till Bush had to come forward to defend the floundering Dan Quayle
against charges of draft dodging did Bush flesh out his credentials
as a stand-alone political leader, out from under Reaqgan's
considerable shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Gore needs a defining moment; but his team is skilled; they'll
find one. He also has a re-energized labor movement and a ton of
money to bolster his chances. Even though Bill Bradley raised a
surprising amount of money this first quarter ($4 mil), Gore's
campaign appears to be on rails. Gore has never lost a high-profile
debate _ except with himself, in his stumbling press conference
over malodorous campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   With each fresh Serb atrocity building public support for the
war, Bradley's task of persuading Democrats to repudiate the
Clinton-Gore record becomes more problematic. While Bradley roams
the nation, Gore fences with the Russians in high-profile
diplomatic stakes. Dollar Bill needs more than money; he needs a
major scandal or a catastrophic turn in the Kosovo campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans? They've been marginalized by the war no one
expected, with the exception of McCain, the one-time POW who seems
bulletproof on the trail. Boldly calling for ground troops and a
vigorous prosecution of the air war, McCain has enhanced his
chances by vaulting to the forefront of the war policy debate.
</P>
<P>
   His party's congressional leadership, which fought all of
McCain's efforts on campaign financing and cable TV monopolies, is
sullen and mute, after impeachment and voting to oppose the NATO
bombing. On the war, as on campaign financing and regulating greed
in telecommunications, McCain is far out in front of his party. But
for McCain to come from the back of the pack, Bush has to falter.
</P>
<P>
   The decision of New Hampshire Senator Judd Gregg to put his
organization behind Bush is significant. Bush is top-heavy with
endorsements from governors and lobbyists. He'll probably spurn
public funding, and opt to carpet-bomb the airwaves with campaign
spots paid for with front-runner's easy money. But we've seen big
winds out of Texas blow themselves out before. John Connally, Phil
Gramm, and Ross Perot sputtered despite huge war chests. Bush
reminds some of Ted Kennedy in 1980, a front-runner with piles of
dough who peaks the day he announces.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has everything a candidate needs _ except a set of crisply
defined goals, and maybe the stomach for the fray. He's not yet
faced major league pitching. If Bush stumbles in Iowa, as his
father did in '92, the beneficiary might be Alexander. The former
Tennessee governor just lost a key organizer to Bush in New
Hampshire. But Lamar still has the best field organization in Iowa,
says Hawkeye handicapper Dave Yepsen of The Des Moines Register.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, who has been campaigning for six years, has not
broken through in national polls, which troubles some of his
backers. But he is the most disciplined man in the field, a
relentless honer of his message, who focuses tightly on GOP caucus
and early primary voters. Better organized than any rival in Iowa
and New Hampshire, Alexander can wait.
</P>
<P>
   What's with Elizabeth Dole? She speaks well and raises money.
But otherwise the first serious GOP woman candidate is timid and
hesitant. And her organization is amateurish. At 62, it's not clear
she has the stamina or resilience for the grind. I think her best
shot is to call Governor Bush and offer not to run against him if
he'll make her his running mate. Otherwise, I think she's just
along for the ride, like Steve Forbes, Pat Buchanan, Quayle, John
Kasich, Gary Bauer, and Alan Keyes.

SHEER DRIVE, GREAT ACTING MAKE `GO' GO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
GO 
Directed by: Doug Liman 
Screenplay by: John August 
Starring: Desmond Askew, Taye Diggs, William Fichtner, J.E.
Freeman, Katie Holmes, Jane Krakowski, Breckin Meyer, Zack, Timothy
Olyphant, Sarah Polley, Scott Wolf 
Running time: 102 minutes 
Rated: R (strong drug content, sexuality, language and some
violence) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Pulp Fiction'' wannabes don't get much slicker or edgier than
``Go,'' the new caper from ``Swingers'' filmmaker Doug Liman. It's
a hard-working film that overcomes its obvious manipulativeness on
the strength of sheer drive and a screenful of juicy performances.
It parodies a drug rush as it careens from one piece of danger to
another, relooping as it repeatedly goes back to the starting point
to tell the stories of three sets of characters before bringing
them together in a rueful convergence that's not so much a bang-up
ending as an ironic downer. Although the linkages don't quite
deliver the high they promise, they demonstrate conclusively that
Liman can bring off his off-the-wall juggling act.
</P>
<P>
   He's helped enormously by the performances. Those who aren't
playing LA thrill-seekers are playing LA thrill-avoiders. It's the
latter who come off best, starting with Sarah Polley's exhausted
supermarket checkout clerk talked into working an extra shift by
Simon, a co-worker and part-time drug dealer who wants to go to
Vegas to party with his pals and is willing to pay her $200 to
cover for him. The trouble is that she needs $380 to avoid
eviction. When a couple of TV cop show actors played by Jay Mohr
and Scott Wolf arrive looking for Simon and don't find him, they
ask her if she can supply them with the drug Ecstasy to bring along
to a Christmas rave.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing a way to erase her deficit, she arranges a meet with
them, then goes to Simon's supplier and talks him into giving her
the drugs, which she plans to sell for a markup. When the deal goes
bad, the dealer (Timothy Olyphant) goes gunning for her. Before he
can pull the trigger, she's hit by a yellow convertible and left
for dead in a ditch. That's hardly all there is to it. Polley,
building upon her intriguing performance in ``The Sweet
Hereafter,'' is too compelling a screen presence to die. Besides,
the film isn't through with Olyphant's drug dealer or the actors
played by Mohr and Wolf. ``Go,'' which consists of three half-hour
films covering the same interval of time, also has plans for Simon
and his bad-luck pals in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the ante on his own Las Vegas interlude in ``Swingers,''
Liman focuses on Desmond Askew's loose cannon, Simon, who manages
to bed two women, set a hotel room on fire, steal a car with a
loaded gun in the glove compartment, break the rules in a lap
dancing parlor and send tham all fleeing for their lives when he
shoots a bouncer. Yet for all the manic propulsiveness of Askew's
performance, it's Taye Diggs's cool companion, Marcus, who
dominates this episode with his poise in the face of constantly
being mistaken for hired help and his line of chat about tantric
sex. The two actors don't get off the hook easily either, being
railroaded through an unexpectedly weird evening with a cop. If
Liman's objective is more transparent than you would wish, ``Go''
is nevertheless entertaining on a moment-to-moment basis, thanks to
spirited playing and stylish, savvy workmanship. Nobody can say it
doesn't live up to its title.

IT'S ABOUT TIME CUP WAS RAISED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Peter Blake and the invincible Kiwis announced their plans
for the next America's Cup back in 1995 at the San Diego docks,
there were groans all around.
</P>
<P>
   The next Cup would be in the year 2000, Blake said, five long
years between challenges. Now, some 200 days before the gun starts
Round 1 of the Louis Vuitton Cup, the event picks up a thread after
the longest hiatus since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   For viewers and readers who used to expect to hear about the Cup
every three years or so, it has become a bit hard to pick up a
thread after such a layoff.
</P>
<P>
   Not so the sailing teams and fundraisers who have been working
since May 1995 to win a best-of-five match race final series that
begins Feb. 19, and whose winner will then hold the oldest trophy
in all sports.
</P>
<P>
   For most of us East Coasters that thread was easy to follow when
the Cup left Newport in 1983 and went to Fremantle, Australia,
where Dennis Conner won it back in 1987. But when it went to San
Diego and the next 12 years with legal battles, the Catamaran
fiasco, a new Cup class boat for a light air venue, and the victory
by New Zealand, the America's Cup has not been easy to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Whether a coherent story line will take shape by next fall to
reawaken interest in the Cup and whether Americans will stay up to
watch the races on ESPN _ as they did in 1986-87 _ is all an open
question.
</P>
<P>
   In that Australian season, the story line rang as clear as a
John Wayne movie, with Conner in the saddle: The Aussies had taken
away our Cup after 20 years of trying, using a sneaky weapon
(winged keel) at best, and by God, we were going down there and
show those upstarts a thing or two about American pride. For
emphasis, Conner flew a huge American flag from the masthead of
Stars &AMP; Stripes after every victory.
</P>
<P>
   And of course the conditions, those boisterous Australian winds
and big lumpy seas that blew out sails and dismasted many a
12-meter, all of which was compelling to the American viewers in
the early-morning hours.
</P>
<P>
   Sailboat racing as dull as paint drying? Tell that to the suits
at ESPN, for whom that '87 Cup was a watershed event. Unfortunately
for ESPN the magic never quite struck again when the Cup went to
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   What would spark some excitement around the old America's Cup
home grounds is if Young America, carrying colors of the New York
Yacht Club, can show some real strength in the early going. If they
look believable in the three fall round robins, with a bit of hype
going into the hoopla Down Under, the guess here is that the Cup
fans will be back.
</P>
<P>
   Once the dream becomes palpable (and rational) that the
America's Cup would be coming ``home'' to Newport, that droopy-eyed
legion of midnight race-followers will be back.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a few other challenging syndicates _ four from the
United States _ are trying hard to prove that this scenario remains
in the fantasy realm. One of them, America True from the San
Francisco Yacht Club, has just wrapped up four months of sailing in
New Zealand along with Young America and AmericaOne, Paul Cayard's
campaign, which is also based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are full on for New Zealand with a new boat,'' says Dawn
Riley, captain and CEO of America True, which is sailing in the
former Tag Heuer, Chris Dickson's boat in the last Cup. ``We are
really ahead, and on track. We have NASA and STRC software, and
also all of Bill Koch's '95 data.''
</P>
<P>
   America True, says Riley, has one boat under construction by
builder Jim Betts in Truckee, Calif., while both Young America and
America One claim to have two boat programs.
</P>
<P>
   But in some early intelligence gathering, Riley says she has
reason to believe that none of the other American challengers will
be able to pull off two boat programs.
</P>
<P>
   The difference could be night and day. Many Cup observers
believe that it is virtually impossible for a one-boat program to
beat a two-boat effort. The reason: A one-boat team simply can't
develop the design data fast enough to move forward at the speed of
a two-boat campaign, which can leapfrog its boats' performance
development.
</P>
<P>
   But Riley isn't so sure. ``The two-boat approach is minimized
these days by the strength of our computer programs,'' she says,
adding her serious doubts about the other US campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   To date, only three international America's Cup class numbers
have been assigned to US syndicates, one each to America One (USA
49), Aloha Racing (USA 50), and America True (USA 51). Under the
Cup rules, sail numbers are not allocated until boat building has
commenced, though two other US boats are under construction.
</P>
<P>
   Much speculation swirls around the question of how badly Young
America was set back in its fundraising when it had to break a
sponsorship deal with Fox Sports Net because of a conflict with
ESPN, the Cup's official broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox sponsorship deal included logos on sails and boats, and
ESPN objected to televising its rival's logos, so Young America was
released from that part of the Fox deal, said to have been worth
$2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Eagleson said Wednesday in a phone interview from the
Portland, Maine, offices of Young America, that the setback with
Fox would not in any way slow down the syndicate's two-boat
program. Its boats are being built at Goetz Custom Yachts in
Bristol.

PITY THE BU TRUSTEE, TOILING IN THE HOT SUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm not sure I could handle the pressure of being a Boston
University trustee. John Silber's vast amen chorus (some names:
Scientology maven Earle Cooley; Wall Street Journal honcho Karen
Elliott House; the ubiquitous Jim Howell; developer Alan Leventhal;
the delightfully named French Wallop, and many, many more) is
congregating this week at the plush Scottsdale Conference Resort
developed by BU trustee Richard Joaquim.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the pace! The first order of business, the meeting of the
Committee on Executive Compensation (read: John Silber's ATM), took
place Wednesday before lunch. After the first plenary business
meeting Thursday, Joaquim offered up a golf clinic, a visit to
Frank Lloyd Wright's home at nearby Taliesin West, or ``an
afternoon of health and beauty . . . at a nearby spa.'' In a letter
to the trustees, he adds: ``Last year's popular desert jeep tour
will be repeated, with a pontoon ride on beautiful Saguaro Lake.''
Swell!
</P>
<P>
   Joaquim lays out an equally grueling schedule for Friday.
Speeches by Chancellor-for-Life Silber and president Jon Westling,
followed by teatime for the ladies _ and for the men! ``A golf
tournament will also be held at McCormick Ranch, with tee-off
scheduled for 12:36 p.m.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Globe gets results &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How odd that I wasn't on the guest list for Monday's swank
dinner at the Kennedy School's fifth-floor entertainment aerie,
where the swells assembled to inaugurate the Jeane and Evron
Kirkpatrick Professorship of International Affairs, donated by
Newton's own Leo and Emily Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know Emily Kahn; Leo's an interesting guy. He attended
Harvard, then got a degree from the Columbia Journalism School. He
wised up soon enough and got a real job in his father's supermarket
business. (His son Joseph apparently lacks the father's good sense;
he writes for The New York Times.) Leo made a pile with Purity
Supreme, then invested wisely in start-ups like Staples and organic
marketer Fresh Fields, a fairly blatant Bread and Circus rip-off.
More recently he helped start up the Nature's Heartland stores here
(off-price Bread and Circus), since sold to a larger chain.
</P>
<P>
   Leo takes a genuine interest in public affairs, and says he was
startled to read a Globe op-ed article that described Jeane
Kirkpatrick's troubles at Brandeis University a few years ago. In
1994, vociferous student protests at Brand X prompted the former
United Nations ambassador to decline a proferred honorary degree.
``I was really turned on by the column,'' Kahn recalls. The writer
``suggested that a leading university in the area could make up for
the insult to Kirkpatrick.'' Emily Kahn also has a degree from the
World's Greatest University, and Leo sat on the board of the
Kennedy School.
</P>
<P>
   Brandeis's loss translates into Harvard's gain. Leo has endowed
two WGU chairs over the years but hasn't made a large donation to
Brandeis. ``I'm very loyal to Harvard,'' he explains,
diplomatically. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This just in &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Writer/collaborator Bill Novak, praised as a great writing coach
in the just-published George Stephanopoulos memoir, has an
intriguing new project: He's working on a book that will never be
published, at least not in the conventional sense.
</P>
<P>
   Novak, who has ghostwritten books for Tip O'Neill, Nancy Reagan,
and Magic Johnson was approached six months ago by Chicago-based
real estate magnate Jay Pritzker to collaborate on his biography.
Pritzker would probably be worth a conventional biography; the
grandson of Russian immigrants, he helped build a $13 billion
business empire that included the Hyatt hotel chain, Nevada
casinos, and Ticketmaster. He also endowed the Pritzker Prize,
regarded as the Nobel Prize for architecture.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the publicity-shy Pritzker, who had some
well-publicized run-ins with government regulators, stipulated that
the book would be distributed only to family and friends. He and
Novak logged many interview hours up until the businessman's death
earlier this year. The book should be ready in a year or so _ but
your local bookstore is one place you needn't look for it.

McIntyre has a Top 20 hit in ``Stay the Same,'' while Jordan Knight
hopes to challenge him with ``Give It to Me,'' which just jumped to
No. 54 in its second week on Billboard's Hot 100 and is the first
single from a new solo disc, ``Jordan Knight,'' due May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, who lives in Milton, Mass., telephoned this week from
San Francisco _ the latest stop on a hectic promo tour to remind
fans that he was the lead singer of the New Kids and has made a
``more mature'' solo album. (It was coproduced by Jimmy Jam and
Terry Lewis _ the architects behind Janet Jackson's biggest hits _
and by Robin Thicke, whose dad is TV star Alan Thicke of ``Growing
Pains.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``The schedule I have now does remind me of the New Kids,'' says
Knight. ``But the girls who were 14 are now 25.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Kids ruled in the late '80s _ long before the Spice
Girls, Backstreet Boys, or 'N Sync. But Knight admits ``the wave
crested'' in 1994 with the final Kids disc, ``Face the Music,''
which quickly hit the cut-out bins and caused him to take some time
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I signed a (solo) contract in 1995, but it took a long time to
find people that really had good chemistry with me _ one being
Robin Thicke, the other Jimmy Jam,'' says Knight, now 28. ``We were
able to hang out and listen to records we liked and really connect
on that level.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep in tune, Knight played occasional solo gigs in Boston,
but hardly anyone knew about them. He would show up unannounced at
the now-defunct Diamond Jim's Piano Bar in the Hotel Lenox in the
Back Bay, singing Elton John songs under a fake name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wore a baseball hat and some glasses that looked like
prescription glasses but weren't,'' Knight says. ``I was just
trying to stay low-key. It was an older crowd, too, so they didn't
know who the heck I was.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Knight's new album is a welcome step beyond
the New Kids. ``Give It to Me,'' while one of the weaker tracks, is
a sexy, come-hither pop tune with a calliope-sounding coda
recalling a ``Sgt. Pepper's'' tune (no surprise, since Knight is a
huge Beatles fan). A hip-hoppy remix of the song is also on the CD.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the record offers grown-up sounding ballads such as
``Broken by You,'' ``Never Take the Place'' (a Prince song slowed
down to striking effect), and the poignant ``Separate Ways.''
Knight always had singing ability that wasn't tapped in the lighter
New Kids fare but is more apparent now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love slow songs and pretty melodies _ and that's a lot of
what's on here,'' he says. ``I didn't want to go totally left and
try to be something that I wasn't, just because `Oh, I'm not cool
now because I was a New Kid.' I didn't want to fall into that trap.
People know when you're not being genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight also used a number of Boston folks on the album,
including guitarist Bobby Keyes (a versatile player who has worked
for Jerry Lee Lewis and Sleepy LaBeef), guitarist Tyrone Chase, and
production assistant Miguel Pessoa.
</P>
<P>
   The funkiest tune is ``A Different Party,'' which samples a
guitar riff from Sugarloaf's 1970 hit ``Green-Eyed Lady.'' Says
Knight: ``It was Jimmy Jam's idea. I didn't know it was a sample.
The (Sugarloaf song) was before my time. I just thought it sounded
like something Beck would do, like surfer music. But I said, `Hey,
this is cool. Let's go with it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rockapella in town: Admit it, you've heard the Folger's TV
commercial in which Rockapella sings, ``The best part of waking up
is Folger's in your cup.'' It's a ubiquitous ad that has given new
life to Rockapella, the vocal group (the ``in'' term as opposed to
a cappella group) that also sang for five seasons on the ``Where Is
Carmen Sandiego'' show in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Rockapella has come a long way from the late '80s when it sang
in the streets of New York. Back then, coins were thrown in a hat
by passersby, who shortly started throwing in business cards. The
momentum multiplied, and Rockapella has now made seven albums in
Japan and has issued one very lively US release, ``Don't Tell Me
You Do,'' on J-Bird Records.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are real pockets of popularity for a cappella. San
Francisco and Boston are two of them. A lot of it starts
collegiately,'' says Scott Leonard, adding that Rockapella mostly
evolved from a group at Brown University in Providence, R.I. ``A
cappella is at a high point right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a French horn player who went to Juilliard,'' adds
Rockapella singer Barry Carl. ``But the fun quotient is much higher
doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockapella could also swing into cover versions of Otis
Redding's ``(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay'' the Hollies' ``Long
Cool Woman in a Black Dress,'' and ``16 Tons'' by Tennessee Ernie
Ford.

COFFIN ACT AN OFF-BROADWAY HIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's like Lenin's Tomb on the Hudson, except that the
bearded guy in the coffin is the magician David Blaine, who has
turned the conceit into one of the season's most unlikely publicity
stunts.
</P>
<P>
   Game for a good show, New Yorkers are playing along. More than
10,000 a day line up _ at peak hours for as long as 30 minutes _ to
get their free 30-second glimpse of the man who has buried himself
alive.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old showman, who went underground last Monday
morning, plans to be dug up Monday morning, hours before ABC
broadcasts his television special, already taped.
</P>
<P>
   All day and night, Blaine lies shirtless in a plexiglass-topped
coffin that has been lowered six feet into the ground and then
covered with a two-ton tank of water _ to make escape, or even a
brief respite, out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   A ventilator pumps temperature-controlled air into the coffin.
He sips two tablespoonfuls of water a day. A catheter runs down his
left leg. A buzzer lets him call for help, in case anything goes
wrong. (A nurse and a crane operator, who can lift Blaine out in
five minutes, are constantly nearby.)
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, there's just a pillow, a sheet, and Blaine _ who
frequently waves and mugs to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   William MacLellan, one of two guards on the scene Thursday
afternoon, said, ``We're here 24 hours a day and there's literally
never a minute when nobody's viewing him.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the viewers are New Yorkers, possibly because the
locale is off the beaten track, a bleak construction site a few
blocks west of Lincoln Center, with nothing of note nearby but the
Hudson River and one of Donald Trump's residential towers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here out of morbid curiosity,'' said Alan Thompas, who
works for a publishing company in Midtown Manhattan. ``It's kind of
like a `Seinfeld' moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Bartlow, an actress, skipped a rehearsal to see Blaine
for the second day in a row. ``It's wicked cool,'' she exclaimed.
``It's just cool that he's in the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Her companion, Bonnie Smith, also an actress, was less
ebullient. ``I had to see what sombody without a brain looks
like,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This being New York, skeptics abound. Francis Bienvenido, who
was dragged to the site by his wife, shrugged. ``Where's the
dirt?'' he asked. ``When you're buried in real life, you got dirt
and you don't have any air pumped in. I'm not impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   James Reed, who took the subway down from the Bronx, entertained
still more cynical thoughts. ``You think he's really in there?'' he
mused. ``This guy's an illusionist, right? If he comes out of there
and doesn't look all emaciated, cheeks sunk in, all skinny, then
you know it's an illusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The event is being sponsored by a theater producer, James
Nederlander, at a cost of $200,000. Pat Smith, Nederlander's
publicist, explained Thursday, ``He is looking at a 25-year-old guy
who's going to be the next Houdini, and he wants to have a long
relationship with this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Other promoters have also found ways to get into the act. A few
feet behind the coffin stands a vase of flowers, with a placard
reading, ``Good luck, but just in case, Flowers by Reuven.''
</P>
<P>
   Blaine said, before going into the tank, that he has wanted to
be buried alive ever since reading that Houdini had planned to pull
off a similar stunt but died, in 1926, before getting around to it.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Blaine was a street performer who would waltz
into fashionable restaurants and do tricks with cards and
levitation that amazed the likes of Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino.
</P>
<P>
   Word of his exploits soon spread. Monday's ABC-TV special is his
second. Blaine also gained a sort of prominence among teenyboppers
when the New York tabloids displayed him as a member of Leonardo
DeCaprio's posse, prowling the bars of SoHo and TriBeCa through the
wee hours.
</P>
<P>
   Several celebrities have come to peek at his show on Riverside
Drive. Today, Cathy Rigby, who is playing ``Peter Pan'' on
Broadway, is slated to stop by, to sprinkle fairy dust on the
coffin and exhort the crowd to think happy thoughts.

AS CRISIS LIFTS HIS VISIBILITY, MCCAIN REJECTS HERO LABEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ This is John McCain's moment. His amiable
face, firm jaw, bone china hair, and hawkish views are on view
almost everywhere as the Kosovo crisis deepens.
</P>
<P>
   And, almost everywhere he goes, the Arizona Republican is
introduced as a hero for his 5 1/2 years as a prisoner of war
during the Vietnam conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he shuns the label.
</P>
<P>
   McCain would rather joke that it doesn't take much talent to get
shot down, leaving it to others to recount the torture, the
solitary confinement, the broken arms, the shattered knee and the
bayonet wounds that almost killed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not (a hero),'' he insisted. ``Because I did not perform
up to the standards I expected of myself and I saw others able to
perform to higher standards than I was.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the 62-year-old McCain makes his first run for president
it is his life story that propels him _ a story that his advisers
believe will persuade voters that he is a man of integrity who can
be trusted to do as he says, the consequences be damned.
</P>
<P>
   His 13 years in the Senate also reinforce McCain's image as a
conservative with a deep maverick streak. He has repeatedly taken
positions and pushed causes that aggravated and angered his
colleagues in the Republican Party, as well as key conservative
constituencies such as the National Right to Life Committee and the
National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   He is the Senate leader on reforming the campaign finance system
to ban unregulated contributions and political action committee
donations. He was out front on forcing the tobacco industry to ante
up to the states, raising the price of cigarettes along the way.
And he is an avid opponent of pork-barrel spending, often singling
out and killing other senators' pet projects slipped into
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an attempt to punish him on the right for showing
some courage on this issue,'' Senator Russell Feingold, a Wisconsin
Democrat and McCain's friend and partner in pushing campaign
finance, said of the legislation. ``In the long run it will be
unsuccessful because his credentials as a conservative are pretty
solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry, another close friend, worked with McCain
to get the United States to normalize relations with Vietnam, a
controversial decision among members of the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``He challenges the orthodoxy of his party,'' said Kerry, a
fellow Vietnam veteran. ``That makes them uncomfortable when he
doesn't toe the line and that's what makes him interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also stands out from the presidential field as a leader
on military and foreign affairs matters, keeping close tabs on the
unstable situation in Kosovo. On a recent morning at the Center of
New Hampshire Holiday Inn, McCain, a graduate of the US Naval
Academy and the son and grandson of naval commanders, touched base
with his buddies at the Pentagon for the latest update on the
Balkans crisis.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the day as he met with voters in Manchester and
Concord, he was asked first and foremost for his opinion on the
crisis in Kosovo. McCain minced no words, warning callers to the
Dan Pierce show on WGIR radio that his views may be unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know many of our listeners are going to go berserk when I
say this,'' said McCain, signaling the possibility that ground
forces may need to be used. ``We cannot rule out any option because
now we have to win. Look, in Pyongyang and Baghdad and Teheran and
in Tripoli they're paying attention, and if we lose to this Balkan
thug, they're going to be on the march, my friend, and we're going
to pay a very heavy price. We must win, we must keep our nerve.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also took issue with the nation's reticence toward losing
American lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another terrible thing to say, but the primary purpose
cannot be the security of your forces,'' he said. ``Your primary
priority has to be the accomplishment of the mission, and if that
means putting young people in harm's way, that has to be done, or
don't go in.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his tough words, McCain peppers his conversation with
humor, charm and sarcastic asides. When Pierce introduced him after
a commercial break, McCain began humming ``Hail to the Chief.''
When a caller refered to McCain as a former naval aviator, the
senator interjected. ``Albeit, a bad one,'' he said, a reference to
his being shot down in 1967. And he answered a caller who
identified himself as a former Army enlisted man, with: ``You are
absolutely right, even for a dumb enlisted Army guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Though McCain has never run for president before, he had a
bird's eye view of two Republican campaigns in 1996. He first
endorsed Texas Senator Phil Gramm, helping him until Gramm dropped
out of the race just before the New Hampshire primary. Then McCain
threw his support to Bob Dole, the Senate Majority Leader from
Kansas, becoming a frequent travel companion of Dole's.
</P>
<P>
   Over coffee, McCain said he learned a few things about what not
to do when running for president. From Gramm, McCain said, he
learned that it is not important just to raise money, it is also
important how it is spent. Gramm spent $19 million in 1995, running
out of cash by the time he got to Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, too, did a poor job of controlling his campaign money. ``I
saw people get on the campaign plane with Dole, who he was paying
$20,000 a month to that he had never even met,'' said McCain.
</P>
<P>
   He was impressed by President Clinton's tight circle of trusted
advisers, and their rapid responses to campaign attacks in both
1992 and 1996, which is something he hopes to emulate.
</P>
<P>
   He was unimpressed by Dole's message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing I learned is if you take a position on an
issue that you really don't believe in, the voters aren't going to
believe it either,'' said McCain. ``Somehow, they convinced Bob
late in the campaign to say he wanted a 15 percent across the board
tax cut. We all know that Bob didn't really believe in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The last point is clearly the most important to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be yourself. One thing I'm sure of, in fact I
know, I'll say something in this campaign that's stupid, that's
inappropriate, and more importantly may be harmful because it will
be an offhand remark like `maybe we should just nuke Bosnia' _
because that's my nature to be glib and humorous and all that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'd rather have that problem than. . .playing it safe,''
McCain said. ``Life's too short for me to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, however, there are similarities between McCain and
Dole's candidacies. Both men have substantial war stories that
tested them to extremes and later gave them an air of credibility.
And like Dole, McCain will be using his story to run for president
_ though he doesn't plan on talking about it himself.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is realistic about the odds his effort faces. His
advisers acknowledge that two likely candidates now leading in
opinion polls, Texas Governor George W. Bush and former Red Cross
director Elizabeth H. Dole, will have to stumble for him to win the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   And there are other obstacles. He has a reputation for having a
nasty temper, which he says he has tried to control in recent
years. He was tarred by the Keating Five scandal, though he was
later cleared of any wrongdoing. And his personal story is not
without its unflattering chapters _ he was a carouser during his
student years, graduating near the bottom of his Annapolis class _
and he has admitted his unfaithfulness to his first wife after his
years as a P.O.W. led to the break-up of their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is also likely to face tough going for his views in Iowa,
site of the first primary caucuses in 2000. Christian right
activists make up about one-third of the caucus-goers, and they are
upset with McCain for pushing campaign finance legislation. Both
anti-abortion groups and the National Rifle Association say his
proposals would prevent them from advocating for their causes.
Despite his own anti-abortion stance, he would tone down the
Republican platform to acknowledge that not all party members share
that position. And he's not too popular with farmers, either, for
his opposition to ethanol subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   So McCain, who postponed his formal announcement after the
Kosovo bombing began, is concentrating his efforts in New Hampshire
and South Carolina. He has cut back his appearances in Iowa, but he
is not about to curb his controversial views.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign is very, very important to me,'' he said at a
recent town hall forum sponsored by WMUR-TV and Citizens' Bank.
``It's not so important that I betray any principle or standard or
anything I believe in. After this is over, the one thing I'll be
able to do is look at myself in the mirror and say, `I didn't do
anything that I would do differently or I'm embarrassed or ashamed
of.'''

MISSOURI SMITES `MOSES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Charlton Heston played Moses in ``The Ten Commandments,''
he said, ``It would take more than a man to lead the slaves from
bondage. It would take a god.''
</P>
<P>
   That was easy for Heston to say when the script gave him a
hotline to God. This week Heston was Rameses. No matter how much
money he threw at the sea, it would not part. Despite his appeals
to patriotism, the voters stayed on the opposite shore.
</P>
<P>
   Heston found out this week that it takes more than being a god
of the silver screen to make people slaves to handguns. With the
script on his side, the sea would part. Heston railed in vain as
the waters turned green with his limp, rotting dollars.
</P>
<P>
   For several months, Heston, president of the National Rifle
Association, waged an all-out assault on the state of Missouri.
That state has had a ban on concealed handguns since 1875, a ban
enacted during the gunslinging of outlaw Jesse James.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri is one of only seven states that bans concealed weapons
(Massachusetts allows concealed weapons with a permit). This
enrages the NRA. Despite America's status as the firearm murder
capital of the developed world, the NRA will not rest until
handguns are as easy to buy as computers and Coke.
</P>
<P>
   So pro-gun activists got a binding measure, Proposition B, put
on the ballot. A Yes vote would have lifted the ban.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA fired every bullet. It outspent the gun-control forces
by $3.8 million to $800,000 a nearly 5 to 1 ratio and outspent by
27 times Handgun Control, which contributed $141,504 against
Proposition B. Handgun Control is headed by Sarah Brady, wife of
James Brady, the White House press secretary who was shot in the
assassination attempt on President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA sent out at least a million mailings. It gave out at
least 60,000 signs to post in front yards. Confident of bedrock
support in rural areas, it tried to woo urban voters by touting
handguns as a tool of self defense against crime.
</P>
<P>
   Heston came to Missouri three times. Though it has not been a
``right'' to carry a concealed handgun for 124 years, the NRA kept
saying, ``Don't Give Up Your Right!'' The NRA likened a yes vote to
the American Revolution, saying, ``Welcome to Concord Bridge. On
April 6, step onto that bridge at Concord, take up the musket of
truth and help finish the fight for freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Heston and the NRA took up their muskets declaring ``If we are
successful in passing Proposition B, Missouri voters can send a
shot across the bow of the anti-gun lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA assault was so withering that Carole Kennedy, a
middle-school principal and a co-chair of Safe Schools and
Workplaces, the key group fighting Proposition B, said, ``We felt
like David and Goliath.''
</P>
<P>
   The slingshot shattered the musket. The urban areas and many of
the suburbs, sick of the gun violence of the 1980s and early '90s,
galvanized. Many police chiefs, interfaith coalitions and newspaper
editorials decried the proposition. The Kansas City Chamber of
Commerce, and several major companies like Sprint and Hallmark
Cards, and even the Kansas City and St. Louis pro football and
baseball teams came out against the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the voters acted on the facts, such as that gun
ownership itself, as researched in medical journals, makes one far
more likely to be killed by a gun. They understood that gun
ownership does not deter crime, as in statistics that showed that
violent crime dropped in the 1990s at twice the rate of some states
that allow concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition B lost by 52 to 48 percent. Rural areas indeed voted
overwhelmingly for concealed handguns. But the cities and suburbs
came out in such force that Missouri set a record for April
turnout. In the city of St. Louis, 74 percent of voters rejected
Proposition B. In St. Louis County, 70 percent said no. In Kansas
City, 72 percent of voters rejected the proposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rev. B.T. Rice, president of St. Louis Clergy Coalition, said,
``Big Money can't buy us.'' State Auditor Claire McCaskill said,
``Money can't overcome common sense. Voters particularly in urban
areas, understand guns are not the answer for safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming just as many cities are suing gun makers, Missouri's vote
is one more sign that common sense is slowly becoming the rule,
rather than the exception of debate on handguns. No longer can the
NRA ride into town with a Ten Commandments that bear false witness
to the need for such weapons in a modern society. No longer can
Heston show up and assume that just because he has played Moses,
the sea will part on his command.

DAVIS WANTS TO EXTEND VOLUNTEERISM TO COLLEGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY and KATHLEEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Gov. Gray Davis wants to require students
in every public college in California to perform community service
as a condition for graduation, extending a trend that already is
popular in high schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the ethics of the World War II generation was a sense
of obligation to the future and an appreciation for what they
inherited,'' Davis said Thursday. ``That is being eroded.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the requirement would apply to every community
college, California State University and University of California
campus _ 1.3 million students.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he was working out the details with college
officials and his advisers, and had only started thinking about how
long students would be required to serve and what they could do.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteering in the community has been a mainstay of private and
Catholic schools for years. Many public high schools picked up the
trend after President Clinton made a big push early in his
administration, but only a few public colleges in California
require community service to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   But mandating public service has created problems in some cases,
including complaints that low-income students need paying jobs to
survive while in school.
</P>
<P>
   And a lack of guidance from the schools often means students
become a burden rather than a help to charities and nonprofit
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Some community groups have been unprepared for an influx of
hundreds of students, some of whom are less than enthusiastic about
being forced into service.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Neder, 19, a philosophy and religion major at San Francisco
State University, said he was required to perform 40 hours of
community service every semester at his Catholic high school in
Modesto.
</P>
<P>
   He said he often resorted to mowing people's lawns rather than
working in a convalescent hospital or a soup kitchen. The work
would be listed as miscellaneous, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in college, Neder estimates he has about only 12 hours of
free time each week with all his classes. He wasn't excited about
the governor's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really unnecessary because a lot of students already do
volunteer work as a part of their classes,'' Neder said, ``and with
the insane amount of requirements we already have, it's like one
more thing that makes it more difficult to get out of here in
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, the first state to mandate community service in all
high schools, thousands of students last year were required to
attend hastily prepared community events after officials realized
one-third of their students had failed to fulfill the requirement.
</P>
<P>
   In response to complaints from students, the Ayn Rand Institute
offers an internship that allows them to fulfill the requirement by
working against volunteerism.
</P>
<P>
   The courts have looked favorably on public service, despite
complaints from groups such as the Ayn Rand Institute. At least one
unsuccessful lawsuit from a libertarian group contended that
mandatory public service violates the 13th Amendment of the
Constitution, which outlawed slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the scattered complaints, the trend toward community
work is increasing. A nationwide study by the Educational Research
Service published in 1994 found that 36 percent of public schools
either required or offered volunteer service, and the figure is
certainly higher now.
</P>
<P>
   The movement gained force in the 1990s, in part because the
Clinton administration started the AmeriCorps national service
program and persuaded Congress to pump millions of dollars into
state efforts to tie volunteerism to education.

EDWARDS HAS A CHECKUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Robert Edwards was trying to be
inconspicuous on his journey back to Foxborough Thursday. He didn't
want to do interviews. He really didn't want to see too many
people, except the doctors and trainer Ron O'Neil, who needed to
assess the progress of his the running back's damaged left knee.
</P>
<P>
   But the visit was fruitful, one he may never forget.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after arriving, owner Bob Kraft called him into his
office and handed him an envelope.
</P>
<P>
   In it was a check for $1 million. It was the final installment
of a $3.1 million signing bonus that the NFL had informed the
Patriots that they were not liable to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob didn't feel that was right,'' said Patriots vice president
Andy Wasynczuk. ``He never felt comfortable with that.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the check was extended and accepted. Now Edwards, who
feels with every beat of his heart that he will play in the NFL
again, will not have to worry about finances. The league, which
gave the Patriots ``Paragraph 5'' salary cap relief, which is
basically Edwards's $350,000 salary this year, said they will
commit to paying Edwards's contract, reviewing it on a year-to-year
basis. That amounts to about $400,000 next year and in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't even thought about my contract and whether or not
I'd get paid,'' said Edwards after making the rounds at the stadium
Thursday. ``I was just trying to get better. I think I kind of took
for granted that things worked out money wise. I figured I'd have a
year of IR (injured reserve) to see how I'd do. I didn't know some
things until I spoke to Mr. Kraft today. I'm very thankful for him
and he's really reached out and lended a helping hand to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, dressed in a black warmup suit and able to get around
on his crutches pretty well, said he began his therapy in Georgia
last Monday. Doctors, he says, have been realistic about his
future, telling him, ``People have come back from this. They said
Bruce Armstrong had a similar injury, but they're also realistic
and tell me that I may never play.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly down and out emotionally and physically following the
Feb. 5 accident, Edwards has now stopped feeling sorry for himself
and has begun trying to buck the dramatic odds he faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is going well,'' he said. ``It's going to take
time. I'm not going to get impatient or anything. It's nothing I
haven't faced before.'' Edwards missed most of his junior season at
Georgia with a fractured foot.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said doctors haven't been very specific with him on a
timetable for a possible return. He tore three of the four major
ligaments, suffered extensive nerve damage, and the dislocation
forced emergency surgery as doctors feared that waiting too long
would cut off his circulation and force amputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't told me anything,'' he said. ``It depends on how
extensive the nerve damage is. That will tell the whole story. If
my nerves come back, that's the point where I'll be back
completely, but nerves take a long time to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking softly and now with a sense of optimism, Edwards said
he's already encouraged with recent progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've seen improvement and change already since I started
therapy. I'm able to move my foot out. I wasn't able to do that
earlier. That's improved, but there's a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard, especially when they told me I might not be able
to play again. It was hard on me because this is what I love to do.
And because I played only one year, it made it even harder. I had
to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards was playing for the AFC in the four-on-four flag
football game on the beach, prior to the Pro Bowl in Hawaii. He
went up with teammate Charles Woodson of the Oakland Raiders to try
to deflect a pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came down,'' he recalled. ``I don't know how it
happened, but I dislocated my knee. I felt it. I grabbed my leg,
but I wasn't in any pain. I just looked down and felt it wasn't
right. After I was in the hospital and they took some pictures, my
agent came over and said I messed up my knee. There was more of a
discomfort pain, because my knee was in the wrong place. It wasn't
really comfortable. When the doctor popped it back in place it was
one of the greatest feelings I've had.''
</P>
<P>
   After X-rays were taken, Edwards was rushed to surgery at the
Straub Medical Center in Honolulu. He said he was never really told
about the urgency of the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to and they'd already done the surgery,'' said
Edwards. ``When I was waking up they told me. I didn't know my foot
was almost amputated. God knows that in my heart I want to do this
more than anything. Out of every bad thing, something good comes
out of it. I don't know what it is. Nobody knows what it is. It may
be that I never play again, but I know something good will happen
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He can somehow equate it to his injury at Georgia, where he had
to watch the team play without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people wouldn't have bounced back from that as well
as I did, and I was able to accomplish things like have a good
senior year and get drafted in the first round, and do some things
for my family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is that hope that he lives with every day.
</P>
<P>
   He is also lifted by the hundreds of cards, letters, and phone
calls he's received.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of support,'' Edwards said. ``A lot of letters
and kids and letters. People are doing everything they can to help
me. (University of) Georgia and their staff has invited me back
there to do my rehab, and they're trying to help me out and making
sure I get the best care while I'm in Georgia,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   His workouts are 3 1/2 hours a day. He will likely be up to five
hours when the weight work and pool begin.
</P>
<P>
   He said he only faces more surgery if the work he's doing now
doesn't reduce the amount of scar tissue around the knee.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards has no idea what the future holds, but he said he will
be around Foxborough once the season begins. He said he hasn't
thought about life after football, if that's the way it has to be.
He says he'll stay involved in the game somehow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I can lend my dreams to my brother (Chris, a receiver)
at Georgia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if his dreams may no longer come true.

`DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS' IS ON SOLID GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS 
 
Directed by: Erick Zonca 
Screenplay by: Zonca, Roger Bohbot 
Starring: Elodie Bouchez, Natacha Regnier, Gregoire Colin, Jo
Prestia, Patrick Mercado 
Running time: 113 minutes(in French with subtitles) 
Rated: R (a scene of extreme sexuality) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a medium that's supposed to be about people, it's amazing
how rarely films convey the impression of just letting people be
people. Erick Zonka's remarkable debut feature, ``The Dreamlife of
Angels,'' is arresting precisely because it convinces us it's doing
just that. At once drifty and hurtling, it's deceptively artless
and always raw and immediate as it details the lives of two young
women escaping from dreary factory jobs in the northern French city
of Lille. Although nowhere close to anything resembling heaven,
they are the angels of the title and on them Zonca's verite style
is a knockout.
</P>
<P>
   Elodie Bouchez's Ida is the softly scrappy one with the gamine
look, her right eyebrow bisected by a scar and everything she owns
stuffed in a backpack. She begins the film on the road and for a
moment it looks as if we're getting a reprise of Agnes Varda's
``Vagabond.'' But no. Ida is more upbeat. As soon as she hits town,
she slices color reproductions out of an art book with a razor,
pastes them on heavy paper stock, and sells them for walking-around
money. She's handy and resourceful. She, it would seem, is a
survivor. But she can't sew very well, and quickly loses a job she
finds in a garment factory assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   She lasts just long enough there to befriend Natacha Regnier's
Marie, who needs only the impetus provided by Ida to walk out of
the place with her. They have one thing going for them. They have
the use of an apartment Marie has been occupying since the
residents _ a young woman and her mother _ have been lying comatose
in a hospital following a car accident. The more introverted Marie
appears to be a bit of a passive victim, but we soon see her
situation is more complicated than that. There's a lot of anger in
her, and she's determined not to end up bullied by a man, as her
mother has. But she feels powerless to do much about her
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The girls don't need much money, which means they have time to
get to know one another and note how different their personalities
are. They do a bit of mooching, a lot of time-killing, and
eventually they befriend a pair of greasy cycle-riding bouncers at
the local rock club. But Patrick Mercado's Charly and Jo Prestia's
Fredo are more than the bargain-basement thugs they appear to be.
They have feelings and a realistic view of the world and their
place in it. As Ida becomes engrossed in the diary of the comatose
girl, and continues making entries where its owner left off, Marie
begins a half-hearted affair with Charly.
</P>
<P>
   But her big problem becomes Gregoire Colin's Chriss, the
arrogant son of the club owner, whose brutality she tolerates as he
pushes her into sex and subservience. This soon tips her melancholy
personality into protracted brooding and clashes with Ida, whose
unsinkable nature prevents the film from sliding into
lugubriousness. Still, Regnier remains compelling, even in her
gloom, while Bouchez supplies nonstop sunny magnetism. It's no
accident that Zonca chose as his cinematographer Agnes Godard, who
photographed the invigorating ``Nenette et Boni'' (that film also
starred Colin, in a quite different sympathetic older brother
role). Her close-quarters hand-held camerawork imparts vigor and
parallels the jumpy tentativeness of the girls' lives. These angels
will grow on you, thanks to Zonca's up-close empathy and urgency.

LONGWOOD SET FOR US-AUSSIE MATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ He had only seen the winning point once.
``Through these eyes,'' Jim Courier said. ``I'm pretty sure it was
a serve to my backhand.''
</P>
<P>
   So when the Longwood folks punched up the video of Sunday's
stirring Davis Cup climax between the United States and Great
Britain, the man of the hour asked to have the monitor tilted his
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never saw so many people clapping for an error,'' Courier
cracked, after watching Greg Rusedski plop a volley into the net
and give the visiting Americans a stirring 3-2 victory in the 14th
game of the fifth set of the final match.
</P>
<P>
   At least it was a forced error, Courier was told, and only the
statkeeper cared anyway. What mattered was that the underdog Yanks
were still alive and slated for a dream quarterfinal against
archrival Australia (July 16-18) on the 100th anniversary of the
Cup at the club in the town where it was born.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until their celebratory dinner that all the lovely
coincidences sunk in. ``We're coming back home,'' Courier realized.
``We're coming to Boston. And we're going to play the Aussies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans were coming to Boston this summer anyway for the
Cup centennial, the first time at the Longwood Cricket Club since
Australia and India played a 1959 semifinal. The International
Tennis Federation decided that two years ago. But facing the Uzbeks
or the Ecuadorans in a relegation match would have been like
serving flat champagne and stale cake. ``Australia is the match
everyone wanted,'' says US captain Tim Gullikson.
</P>
<P>
   The Aussies, who zapped Zimbabwe on the road last weekend to
avenge last year's home loss, wanted the Americans, too. But they
wanted them in Melbourne, where they would normally have had them,
since Australia played in Washington two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to (Aussie captain) John Newcombe and they weren't
too happy about it,'' Gullikson said Thursday. ``We should be down
there. But it isn't like it was sprung on them last week.''
</P>
<P>
   So while Tennis Australia says it will appeal to the ITF to
switch the venue down under, there's no chance that will happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances of the decision being reversed are zero,'' Davis
Cup executive director Thomas Hallberg said by telephone from
London Thursday. ``No chance, I would think.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aussies weren't thinking about choice of ground last year,
when they had to beat the Uzbeks to get back into the World Group.
And the Americans were just hoping to survive last weekend's first
round in Birmingham after Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi both said
nix to a roster spot.
</P>
<P>
   So Gullikson went with Courier and Todd Martin and bristled when
critics said that Uncle Sam was going with the B team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, we're not sending the B team, we're sending the A
team,'' he says. ``This is America's team.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Yanks were decided underdogs against a British team
fielding seventh-ranked Tim Henman and 11th-ranked Rusedski and
playing on a carpet before 9,300 screeching Union Jack-bedecked
partisans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't just a tennis match,'' Courier realized. ``It was a
huge event for England.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was huge for Courier, who gets jazzed whenever he hears
the D-word.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Hong Kongs and Atlantas you play don't mean
anything,'' he says. ``You won't remember those when you're 80.
You'll remember what it was like at six-all in the fifth set of the
final match and you're playing for your country on the road with
everyone screaming. It doesn't get any more memorable than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Courier may be ranked 54th now, but he's been a part of two Cup
victories (in 1992 and 1995) and the Yanks have never lost (as in
13-0) when he's been aboard. So he's already volunteered for July's
match here and Martin is all but certain to re-up, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the right of first refusal,'' says Gullikson. ``They
were here at the beginning, so . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Sampras and Agassi, who've played 54 Cup matches
between them, are persona non grata.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a free country and they have freedom of choice,'' says
Courier.
</P>
<P>
   But Gullikson won't be asking pretty-please. Not a second time.
He and US Tennis Association president Judy Levering each went out
to California earlier this year to ask Sampras and Agassi in person
and were turned down flat. If you have to beg a man to play for his
country, Gullikson figures, why bother?
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is passion and commitment,'' he says. ``Those
are more important than rankings.''
</P>
<P>
   Courier and Martin told Gullikson they're available anytime,
anywhere, and that was before they squelched the Brits, whom Dwight
Davis and friends knocked off in the inaugural Cup in 1900.
</P>
<P>
   It's a year for symbolic symmetry _ the US and Aussies are the
two most successful nations in Cup history (57 titles between them)
and have met more often (44 times) than anyone else. Is it
coincidence that brings them to Hammond Street after a century? Or
destiny?
</P>
<P>
   ``Destiny? That's like talking about a no-hitter,'' Courier
mused Thursday. ``We'll just have to sit back and let it all pan
out.''

   SEATTLE _ Eagle Eye Cherry, son of late jazz trumpeter Don
Cherry, got a lot of encouragement from his famous father while
growing up.

   ``My dad loved life, and he loved music,'' Eagle-Eye Cherry said
this week in a phone interview from Los Angeles. ``There was always
music when he was around.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he never pushed me too hard. I think he understood that
there's a balance you have to find when your parents are trying to
get you into something, and you just want to hang out with your
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Eagle-Eye, so-named because of how he squinted as a newborn,
pursued an acting career, unsuccessfully, before turning his
attention to music in the mid-'90s. It proved auspicious.
</P>
<P>
   The singer-songwriter's debut album, ``Desireless,'' has sold
more than 1 million copies since its release last year and spawned
a hit single, the sultry and romantic ``Save Tonight.'' The album's
smooth blend of rock, soul, jazz and blues evokes memories of
Marvin Gaye.
</P>
<P>
   ``The album's success is way beyond anything I expected,''
Cherry said. ``The label gives me (sales) numbers, and it's not
really tangible, but it sounds good. It's not until I get out on
stage and play the gigs and have a good crowd that I realize, `Oh,
OK, I guess it is going really well.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cherry, 27, also learned a lot from his half-sister, singer
Neneh Cherry, who recorded the 1989 hit ``Buffalo Stance.'' He was
18 at the time and proud of her albeit fleeting success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm savoring this moment in my life, because I know everyone
has their ups and downs,'' he said. ``If I were 10 years younger, I
would totally be taking this for granted and probably wasting a lot
of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherry grew up in Sweden but moved to New York with his parents
and siblings when he was 14. Like a lot of famous American jazz
musicians in the '60s, his dad had been attracted to Europe by the
receptive audiences there.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, being black in the States was still a pretty
tough scene,'' Cherry said. ``There was a certain vibe, especially
in Stockholm and Paris, where the jazz scene was really bubbling
over, and there was a certain respect for the musicians that they
weren't getting over here.''
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Cherry returned to his native Sweden with his
actress-model girlfriend, Helena af Sandeberg. The furnished
apartment they rented in Stockholm came complete with a guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all the instruments I owned, I never had an acoustic
guitar, oddly enough,'' Cherry said.
</P>
<P>
   The newfound guitar, as well as the couple's relaxed Stockholm
lifestyle, spurred Cherry's songwriting. ``The songs just started
coming, and one day I realized, `This is it, here I go,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Save Tonight,'' the debut album's first single, was like a
gift. ``It just kind of hit me while I was strumming the guitar,''
he said. ``It felt like it had already been written.''
</P>
<P>
   The song, about savoring romance before a separation, has been
so popular on ``adult top 40'' stations that the Sony-distributed
Work label has delayed release of the follow-up single, ``Falling
in Love Again.''
</P>
<P>
   ```Save Tonight' is a stubborn tune,'' Cherry said. ``It keeps
getting played.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his love of Sweden, many of Cherry's songs were inspired
by life in New York, the Grammy-nominated singer's favorite city.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is a very intense town,'' he said. ``It's the
greatest city in the world if you're into music and art and all
that kind of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But New York's dark side is reflected in ``Shooting Up in Vain''
and ``Death Defied by Will,'' two songs about ``characters going
down the wrong road.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You see it all there in New York,'' Cherry said. ``It's part
of my love-hate relationship with the city. It's the dark side of
reality, just staring you in the face. You can't sweep it under the
carpet.''
</P>
<P>
   The album's title song was written in the '70s by Cherry's
father. ``It was one of the first songs he taught me on the piano.
It's one of my favorites,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Cherry died in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had lived such a full life, made so many records, traveled
so much and touched so many people, it made me realize that I
hadn't even started what I wanted to do in life. It was a real kick
in the butt. You never know when your time's up.''

SASQUATCH BOOKS STEPS OUT INTO CALIF., ALASKA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL SHUKOVSKY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Sasquatch Books, the Seattle-based regional publisher
which has so successfully harnessed the Northwest muse, is seeking
to repeat its winning formula in California and Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The formula is just plain common sense. ``Our editorial stance:
give the people who live here what they want and need to know,''
said Publisher Chad Haight. Sasquatch signs homegrown writers _
experts in their field _ and publishes books about regional travel,
gardening, food, and literary nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   The results are well known to many Northwesterners who rely on
the utilitarian books in the Best Places series of guidebooks like
Northwest Best Places, Seattle Best Places and Oregon Coast Best
Places. Sasquatch titles revel in a sense of place such as a new
children's book called ``The Miser on the Mountain, A Nisqually
Legend of Mount Rainier'' and ``Gone Whaling, A Search for Orcas in
Northwest Waters.''
</P>
<P>
   Now California and Alaska can expect to see more Sasquatch
titles that reflect the land and life of those states. ``The reason
we are successful in the Northwest is that we know the region and
are part of it,'' said Haight. ``But we could not export it to
California. We need to organically grow it from within the state
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent hiring of Sasquatch's first California-based editor
Jennie McDonald marks the publisher's commitment to that organic
growth. There are already Best Places books like ``Northern
California Coast,'' which Sasquatch's spring catalog pegs as ``a
personal, portable guide ... written from a local's perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   But with McDonald on board, Bay Area book sellers will see even
more titles like the newly released ``A Yardscapes Year, Ideas and
Plants for Bay Area Gardeners.'' (The author was a long-time
columnist for the San Francisco Examiner.)
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area book, like so many on Sasquatch's list, boldly
proclaims that singular sense of place in a spot where people are
proud to live. The back cover reflects Sasquatch's editorial and
marketing strategy of how to grab the regional publishing niche.
``Here are innovative ideas for horticultural success in the
challenging and complex Bay Area ecosystem, which offers up
rainless summers, fickle fogs, and the occasional earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   Sasquatch, when it first decided to expand its market, was
unsure whether to move into other regions by simply expanding the
definition of the Northwest. ``We were so in love with our region
that we decided to make it bigger,'' said Haight with a chuckle.
``But we were really deluding ourselves to think California had
anything to do with the Pacific Northwest. And we have observed the
same thing about Alaska too.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the March 1 opening of an office in Berkeley and the
hiring of McDonald. ``Regional publishing must begin with local
book acquisition and development and that's precisely what Jennie
will be doing,'' editorial director Gary Luke said.
</P>
<P>
   Luke said there is not a regional press in California quite like
Sasquatch. ``Many publishers in the Bay Area publish regional
titles within their national lists, but they do not focus on a
complete California program. We plan to publish a steady list of
titles _ all the books you'll ever need to travel to or live in
California.''
</P>
<P>
   Haight expects in California the kind of strong competition that
Sasquatch has avoided up to now. ``In the Northwest, most of the
regional publishers didn't publish travel guides,'' Haight said.
``On the regional bookshelves, there is no one solely dedicated to
what we were trying to do.'' While there is some competition from
the Seattle-based Mountaineers, which publishes specialized outdoor
books, and Gaphic Arts Publishing of Portland, ``we have the place
(the Northwest) to ourselves in many ways,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The California market is immensely bigger than the Northwest.
But there are many more publishers, said Haight. ``To us, it will
be a matter of establishing the quality of books we publish in a
more frenzied environment. It is going to be a war.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on March 1, Sasquatch expanded its title list and
geographic reach with the purchase of Paws IV Publishing of Homer,
Alaska. The 14-title, Paws IV line of children's book for the
school and trade markets include titles that speak of place like
``Alaska's Three Bears.''
</P>
<P>
   While the company so far has avoided the expensive temptation to
develop a nationwide distribution infrastructure, the Alaska
expansion could make it more tempting. Because books about Alaskan
intrigue people everywhere, ``you have this very ripe opportunity
to distribute Alaska titles anywhere in the country,'' said Haight.
</P>
<P>
   When Sasquatch began distributing Paws IV titles, ``sales were
so strong that we knew it was a great fit right from the start,''
said Haight. ``We plan to change little, if anything about Paws IV.
Every region has its own personality. Sasquatch is one of the few
publishers to faithfully publish for a regional audience. We have
stretched our boundaries, but we intend to stay true to the
concept.''
</P>
<P>
   The privately held company will not release financial figures.
But Haight says Sasquatch has grown 30 to 50 percent every year
since its founding in 1986. Haight owns the company with Susan and
Furman Moseley, who is a retired president of Simpson Investment
Co.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1986 that David Brewster, then publisher of the
Seattle Weekly, sought out ideas to expand and capitalize on the
Weekly franchise. Haight suggested going beyond guidebooks and the
company began to grow. In 1995, the publishers of Seattle Weekly,
which included Brewster, sold Sasquatch to Haight and the Moseleys.

HOW TO EASE DIFFICULT WORKPLACE CONVERSATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone' had them. Everyone dreads them.
</P>
<P>
   They're difficult conversations. Whether it's delivering
criticism to an employee, asking for a raise, or firing someone,
the workplace is filled with hazardous negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But there are ways to make such conversations less
anxiety-provoking and more productive.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Stone and Bruce Patton, both lawyers with the Harvard
Negotiation Project, have had more than their share of such
conversations. In the course of their careers, however, they've
discovered that people tend to make the same kinds of mistakes
whenever the stakes are high and they feel vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``A difficult conversation is anything you dread talking about,
that keeps you up at night in anticipation and that you have no
confidence is going to go well,'' said Patton, co-author with Stone
and Sheila Heen, of ``Difficult Conversations; How to Discuss What
Matters Most,'' (Viking, 1999, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``Every difficult conversation is really three conversations at
once,'' Stone said. These three get mixed up in ways that confuse
people and make it difficult to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   The first involves the substance of what happened. The substance
conversation looks at who did what and how we got here, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The second underlying conversation involves feelings.
</P>
<P>
   At work, people are taught to ``check their feelings at the
door,'' Stone said. ``People try to check them, but they leak out
in other ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Feelings come out in tone of voice, or in actions, such as
avoiding working with certain people, or talking behind their
backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody with a job knows (the workplace) is fraught with
feelings,'' Patton said. ``The question is not whether there are
feelings involved, but how are you going to have them at work.''
</P>
<P>
   People tend to disguise their feelings as judgments when they're
in the throes of a difficult conversation. Telling someone their
actions are selfish is a judgment. Telling someone you felt hurt by
their actions is a feeling. Since people respond better to feelings
than judgments and it's important to sort them out before you talk.
</P>
<P>
   The third conversation underlying any difficult talk is the
``identity conversation,'' Patton said. Any time you're having
trouble with a particular conversation, it's probably because it
involves some aspect of your own self-image.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you're a boss who has to let someone go, but you don't
think of yourself as someone who is unkind, or who fails at
spotting talent. Having to fire someone is bound to generate
conflicts on both counts.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy for dealing with a difficult encounter is to think
through each of the three underlying conversations. What happened,
what feelings it brought up, and what aspect of your self-identity
might be under attack.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to consider what you want to accomplish in the
conversation. Maybe you want the other person to understand your
point of view. Maybe you want an apology. Maybe you want to solve a
problem. Knowing what you want will help you stay focused.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to get information.
</P>
<P>
   Most people attack a difficult conversation from their own point
of view, Stone said. It's important to spend some time figuring out
how the other party might view things.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can approach them by saying, `I know my story here, but
there's a whole bunch of stuff I don't know,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to reframe the conversation into an inquiry, a
chance to learn new information that could change the way you view
the situation and affect the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people at work play a kind of blame roulette,'' said
Patton. The objective is to find the person who screwed up and then
tell them it can't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's never just one person (to blame),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest mistake people make when trying to have a difficult
conversation is assuming that they are right, Patton said. But
difficult conversations aren't about getting all the facts right,
they are about understanding conflicting perceptions, feelings and
values.
</P>
<P>
   Spending some time in advance thinking about how the other
person views the situation will also help you when you initiate the
conversation, Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Every story has three sides _ the way you see it, the way the
other person sees it, and the way it would be perceived from the
``outside.''
</P>
<P>
   This so-called ``third story'' is the way a mediator might
describe what's going on, he said. It doesn't involve judgments
about who is right or wrong, but describes the issues on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Starting from the third story is a good neutral place to begin a
difficult conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to leap into problem solving,'' Stone said.
``First you need understanding.''

LIGHTEN UP ON BACKPACKS, STUDENTS, PARENTS TOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DEBERA CARLTON HARRELL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In a spinal twist to education reform, more and more
kids are literally stooping to conquer.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters, some carrying half their body weight in overloaded
backpacks, have become unwitting beasts of burden, some physicians
and chiropractors say.
</P>
<P>
   Their message to kids and parents: Lighten up.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about increasing numbers of kids with head, neck,
shoulder and back pain _ and worried about potential long-term
spinal problems _ some chiropractors in the Seattle area are
launching a public awareness campaign starting in the Bellevue,
Wash. School District later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The American and the International Chiropractic associations
have endorsed the non-profit ``Backpack Safety America'' campaign,
which already is under way in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The trend of kids from kindergarten through high school carrying
too much stuff in their backpacks is evident on any campus,
according to chiropractors, physicians and school administrators.
</P>
<P>
   With more books, after-school activities and less time between
classes to go to lockers, some kids carry not just classroom
supplies, but gym clothes, athletic shoes, water bottles,
calculators, CD players, cell phones and even inline skates and
skateboards, physicians and chiropractors say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Backpacks have become self-contained life-support systems for
adolescents,'' said Howard King, a pediatric spine physician with
Northwest Spine and Pediatric Orthopedic Surgeons and a clinical
associate professor in orthopedics at the University of Washington
Medical Center in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys who climb Mount Rainier and Mount Everest don't have
as much weight on their shoulders, even with 45-pound packs, as
these kids,'' King said, adding that climbers, unlike most
schoolchildren, use frame packs with waist straps designed to
transfer weight to their pelvises.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a simple but entertaining 8-minute video and numerous
``do's'' and ``don't's,'' chiropractors Sheri Sherwood-Bolton and
husband Brett Bolton have received permission to visit Bellevue
schools to promote the backpack campaign. They want to persuade
kids _ and their parents _ not to carry backpacks that weigh more
than 15 percent of their body weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Common sense tells us that a heavy load, distributed
improperly or unevenly, day after day, is indeed going to cause
stress to a growing spinal column,'' Sherwood-Bolton said, adding
that she has been seeing more patients at a younger age suffering
from non-traumatic back pain.
</P>
<P>
   The pain is not caused by accident or injury, Sherwood-Bolton
said, but from the stress of carrying too much weight in a backpack
or not loading or wearing the backpack properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old adage, `as the twig is bent, so grows the tree' comes
to mind,'' Sherwood-Bolton said. Teaching kids good habits early in
life ``could eliminate a lot of pain and grief later in life,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   King said he also has seen an increase in the number of kids
complaining of shoulder, neck and back pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We truly have seen more kids with vague upper neck and back
pain. It's not severe, but a 12-year-old with back pain is not a
normal thing,'' King said. ``When you point out how heavy their
backpacks are and encourage them to lighten their load, ... the
pain usually goes away.''
</P>
<P>
   King said he and his associates weigh kids' backpacks. One girl
who weighed 90 pounds was carrying a 29-pound pack _ one-third her
body weight, King said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about scoliosis or spinal deformities forming
from backpack use,'' King said. ``But it's not a bad idea to make
people aware that they don't need to carry everything they own on
their backs and shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bolton's Bellevue office, Melissa Hendrix, 14, a Highland
Middle School student, offered her backpack for a weigh-in
Thursday. Injured in a car accident last November, Melissa
aggravated the injury by carrying a backpack that was too heavy.
But even though she trimmed her previous 45-pound pack to 35
pounds, it's still too heavy for her body weight, Sherwood-Bolton
said.
</P>
<P>
   A 974-page American history book, a 726-page science book and a
552-page French book _ all hardback and homework for the night _
made up the bulk of a pack that weighs more than two average
bowling balls. (An average bowling ball and an average human head,
Sherwood-Bolton said, each weigh about 16
</P>
<P>
   pounds.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It has helped to be more aware, but it's hard to cut down when
the books are all required,'' Melissa said. ``I'll catch myself
leaning forward, and by the end of the day, my back will be killing
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherwood-Bolton said when the heavy backpack pulls down and back
on Melissa's shoulders, the girl's head compensates by tilting
foward, further straining the neck, shoulders and back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It completely alters the mechanics of the spine,'' Brett
Bolton
</P>
<P>
   said.
</P>
<P>
   Tips for relieving stress from backpacks
</P>
<P>
   -Choose the correct size backpack for your body size. A backpack
with a waist strap helps distribute weight evenly.
</P>
<P>
   -The maximum weight of the loaded backpack should not exceed 15
percent of body weight. Pack only what is necessary. If the
backpack forces the wearer to bend forward, it's overloaded.
</P>
<P>
   -Lift correctly. Face the pack; bend at the knees; use both
hands and check the weight of the pack; lift with your legs. Apply
one shoulder strap, then the other. Don't sling the backpack onto
one shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   -Wear it right: Use both shoulder straps, snug but not too
tight.

QUEEN OF THOROUGHBRED RACING CALLS IT QUITS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAMAICA, N.Y. _ The queen of thoroughbred racing is abdicating
her throne.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Krone, far and away the most successful female rider in
racing history, said Thursday that she would compete in her last
race April 18 at Lone Star Park near Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Krone cited a ``constellation of reasons'' in announcing her
retirement, not the least of which was a series of injuries that
have damaged her physical ability and her psychological health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to go out on top. I'm only 35, I don't want to get
hurt anymore, and I don't have anything to prove,'' said Krone, the
only female rider to win a Triple Crown race.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three months after her greatest triumph, aboard
Colonial Affair in the 1993 Belmont Stakes, Krone suffered a severe
ankle fracture in a spill at Saratoga Race Course on closing day.
</P>
<P>
   The ankle required two plates and 14 screws to reconstruct. Two
weeks after having the screws removed, Krone broke both hands in a
fall at Gulfstream Park in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Krone regained her effectiveness only this past winter, when she
raced at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans for the first time. She
finished third in the jockey standings, but she said a frightening
incident in the starting gate in mid-February made her realize it
was time to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``This horse reared up and was just smashing me like this,'' she
said, banging her hands together. ``I hurt my knee and my stomach,
and I couldn't hardly ride for three days; my ankle hurt so much. I
would go to sleep and have jumpy dreams after that. Way down deep,
I knew I didn't want to fall again.''
</P>
<P>
   Krone, a 4-foot-10-inch, 100-pound favorite of fans everywhere
was adamant that her decision is final.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Christian, and it's so intense to make this decision
that there's no chance of me riding again after the 18th,'' Krone
said. ``Physically, I'm not capable of riding anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Krone, who lives in New Jersey, said she wants to take a break,
but hopes to pursue other interests, including TV analysis. She
said she also plans to return to school and possibly get a
psychology degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, I'm not retiring from the work world; it's just a
job change. I've been working since I was 17,'' said Krone, who
didn't rule out a second career in training horses.
</P>
<P>
   Krone is married to Matt Muzikar of Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and
she indicated the couple might build a house not far from the track
she loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she'll be missed by racing in general and Saratoga
specifically,'' said Glen Mathes, a spokesman for the New York
Racing Association. ``She was a great role model, especially for
young girls. She contributed a lot to the community and racing, and
we hope she will continue to do that in a different capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Krone won for the first time aboard Lord Farkle at Tampa Bay
Downs on Feb. 12, 1981. She has 3,541 victories to date, more than
three times as many wins as Donna Barton, who is second all-time
among female jockeys. Krone's mounts have collected more than $81
million in purses. Barton, who is retired, had 1,130 wins and
$19,084,603 in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``For (Krone) to win 3,500 races is pretty remarkable,'' said
Hall of Fame trainer Allen Jerkens, who sent plenty of business
Krone's way over the years. ``She always worked hard, especially in
the morning.''

</P>
<P>
   Krone also rode several stakes winners for Hall of Famer Scotty
Schulhofer, including Colonial Affair, Rubiano, Tactical Advantage
and Montreal Marty.
</P>
<P>
   One August day in 1987, Krone brought home a track-record-tying
six winners on a card at Monmouth Park in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Her dominance at Monmouth and The Meadowlands in the late 1980s
eventually led Krone to New York and Florida, where she quickly
became a fan favorite as well as a successful jockey.
</P>
<P>
   Krone won the riding title at Gulfstream in 1992 and 1993 and
also won the Belmont Park Spring Meet title in 1992. She often rode
day-night cards between New York and New Jersey, but one of her
greatest moments came at Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Belmont, which doesn't really count, I'd have to say
my biggest moment was winning five races at Saratoga,'' Krone said.
</P>
<P>
   That was on Aug. 20, 1993. Ten days later she was in a hospital
bed with a severely injured ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Tony, my valet, brought me the five-win picture in the
hospital before my ankle surgery, I couldn't stop crying,'' Krone
recalled. ``It was like going from the very best of it to the very
worst of it; the top to the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Krone always was a well-respected wet-track and turf rider, but
her career wasn't the same after her second serious spill. She
appeared to be making a comeback this winter, winning 84 races at
the New Orleans track, but by then, it was more than a game of
winning and losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember reading a magazine article about an Olympic runner
who was tired of training,'' Krone said. ``She went to the Olympics
and broke three records. I felt like that after Louisiana; I just
wanted to get it over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would go to sleep at night thinking, `I just can't wait to
get this over. I just don't want to do this anymore.'''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   As the 20th century fades away, so too does the international
consensus on when to get involved in another state's affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and NATO _ with little discussion and less
fanfare _ have effectively abandoned the old U.N. Charter rules
that strictly limit international intervention in local conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   They have done so in favor of a vague new system that is much
more tolerant of military intervention but has few hard and fast
rules. What rules do exist seem more the product of after-the-fact
rationalization by the West than of deliberation and pre-agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But the death of the old rules on peacekeeping and peacemaking _
under which most bloody conflicts were simply ignored as ``domestic
matters'' _ should not be mourned. Events since the end of the Cold
War starkly show that the old anti-interventionist regime has
fallen out of sync with modern notions of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in Kosovo illustrates this disjunction and America's
new willingness to do what it thinks right _ international law
notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The horror of ethnic cleansing in the Serbian province was well
publicized. As Slobodan Milosevic thumbed his nose at the
international community, pressure built to use force against him,
whether the U.N. Charter allowed it or not. Thus when the Western
allies launched air strikes, the move was largely popular.
</P>
<P>
   It was not, however, technically legal under the old U.N.
regime. After all, Kosovo is still part of Yugoslavia. No
cross-border attack _ the one circumstance where the charter allows
an international military response _ had occurred, and the Security
Council had never authorized NATO military measures.
</P>
<P>
   Thus in Kosovo, justice _ as it is now understood _ and the U.N.
Charter seemed to collide. But it is not only that the U.N. Charter
prohibits intervention where enlightened states now believe it to
be just. Its problems run even deeper.
</P>
<P>
   For the charter is grounded on a premise that is simply no
longer true _ the assumption that the core threat to international
security still comes from interstate violence. What's more, thanks
to Cold War deadlock and the veto power held by the Security
Council's five permanent members, the old rules never even
prevented interstate violence in the first place _ witness
Afghanistan, Vietnam and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Just as generals too often refight the last war, when the
drafters of the U.N. Charter set its limits on state power, they
responded to the crises precipitating World War II, without
anticipating those that would follow it.
</P>
<P>
   They devised a legal regime they hoped would govern the use of
force for generations to come _ recognizing all states as sovereign
equals, prohibiting interference in their internal affairs, and
permitting the nondefensive use of force only when authorized by
the U.N. Security Council, and then only in limited circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Today's recurrent problem, which is intrastate violence, is not
addressed effectively by the charter.
</P>
<P>
   Thus in Haiti, Somalia and Rwanda _ all conflicts within a
single country _ when the international community stepped in to
halt the slaughter of civilians, it did so without the blessing of
international law. Although intervention was authorized by the
Security Council, its consent flew in the face of the constraints
of the charter and 40 years of U.N. precedent that virtually
ignored civil war and instability.
</P>
<P>
   The charter regards internal violence as a question of
``domestic jurisdiction'' only _ that is, beyond official
international concern.
</P>
<P>
   When American embassies were bombed in Kenya and Tanzania last
August, world attention focused entirely on the propriety of
American air strikes against perpetrators allegedly ensconced in
Afghanistan and Sudan. The idea that the United Nations might
actually DO something to combat such bombings was never even
raised, so conditioned had observers become to expect it to do
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Had the United Nations ever been effective in curbing interstate
violence, its charter's anachronistic focus might be tolerable. But
it was not.
</P>
<P>
   The charter generated no formal international response to Soviet
intervention in Hungary, Czechoslovakia or Afghanistan, none to
American intervention in the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Panama or
Nicaragua, and none to that of India in Goa, Indonesia in East
Timor, China in Tibet, Argentina in the Falklands or Vietnam in
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic historians have yet to identify a single instance of
interstate violence that was actually stopped by the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The West's new rules of thumb on intervention accord less
deference to the old idea of sovereign equality _ the erstwhile
notion that all countries, large or small, are equal in the eyes of
the law. The new posture recognizes the hollowness of this concept,
accepting that all states are not in fact the same in their power,
wealth, or commitment to human rights or peace.
</P>
<P>
   The new system acknowledges something else the U.N. Charter
overlooks: that the major threats to stability and well-being now
come from internal violence as or more often than they do from
cross-border fighting _ and that to be effective, international law
needs to stop the former as well as the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the cost of abandoning the old anti-interventionist
system will be offset by the benefits of the newly emerging one
remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, replacing a formal system with a set of vague,
half-formed, ad hoc principles can be dangerous. Untested rules may
have unexpected consequences, and justice formed on the fly may
come to be resented. But the failings of the old system were so
disastrous that little will be lost in the attempt to forge a new
one.
</P>
<P>
   No one, as yet, has devised safeguards to guarantee that power
will not be abused by the strong, that coercion will not be
misdirected to undermine the values that it was established to
protect. Until such safeguards are devised, the global rule of law
will remain a dream.
</P>
<P>
   But what of justice? Can it be achieved in the meantime? That a
new interventionist regime might not at the outset be a legal one
does not mean that enhanced global justice need remain a fantasy.
International justice can in fact be pursued ad hoc, without a
fully functioning legal system.
</P>
<P>
   This evidently is what NATO and the United States have recently
set out to do. And they have achieved some success: A child saved
from ethnic cleansing in Kosovo by NATO's intervention is no less
alive because the intervention was impromptu rather than part of a
formal system.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is dangerous for NATO to unilaterally rewrite the rules
by intervening in domestic conflicts on an irregular, case-by-case
basis.
</P>
<P>
   The test of the new interventionism is not whether it can be
contrived to generate immediate popular support. Of course it can,
at least in influential Western publics, in ways known to all
military planners and their publicists: with smart-bomb strikes
portrayed in the media as being undertaken only after patience has
run out. Such attacks are a swift, short, and successful method of
punishing a demon and vindicating international honor.
</P>
<P>
   They produce few (CNN-reported) civilian deaths and still fewer
Western casualties. The script for successful military spinning is
no state secret.
</P>
<P>
   But that script is not the best way to give a new
interventionist regime long-term acceptance. The real test of a new
system will be whether succeeding generations throughout the
community of nations _ not simply in centers of wealth and power _
believe the system and the actions it prescribes to be just.
</P>
<P>
   Even if its purposes are widely approved of, sooner or later the
exclusionary decision-making process is likely to create
resentment, particularly as inevitable foul-ups occur and lives are
lost through error and oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Justice, it turns out, requires legitimacy; without widespread
acceptance of intervention as part of a formal justice system, the
new interventionism will appear to be built on neither law nor
justice, but on power alone.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, unless a critical mass of nations accepts the
solution that NATO and the United States stand ready to offer, that
solution will soon be resented.
</P>
<P>
   But the new interventionists should not be daunted by fears of
destroying some lofty, imagined temple of law enshrined in the U.N.
Charter's anti-interventionist proscriptions. The higher, grander
goal that has eluded humanity for centuries _ the ideal of justice
backed by power _ should not be abandoned so easily.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving justice is the hard part; revising international law
to reflect it can come afterward. If power is used to do justice,
law will follow.

READY-TO-ROLL   MURALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Don't have the artistic talent or the money to
hire someone to paint your favorite scene?
</P>
<P>
   Someone's already thought of you.
</P>
<P>
   Step into a home improvement store, or browse a catalog or the
Internet, and find ready-made rolls of ``murals'' you can slap on
your own walls _ just like wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   Many murals are enlarged photographs; others depict painted or
sketched subjects. Scenes range from cartoon characters to
landscapes, from characters out of children's literature to city
skylines, from outer-space scenes to the interior of your favorite
baseball stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some companies that offer do-it-yourself murals:
</P>
<P>
   _ Environmental Graphics of Jopkins, Minn.; (800) 328-3869; Web
site is www.egproducts.com. The firm's murals are also available at
most Home Depot stores; at Dunn-Edwards stores in Pasadena,
Glendale, Topanga Canyon and Mission Hills; and at Wallpapers to Go
in Studio City. Murals, including new fairy tale murals in its
StoryBook Hollow line, range from $60 to $129.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wallpapers Etc., Decorating Super Store, in Denver, Colo.;
(303) 756-9000; www.wallpaperetc.com. Available only by mail order,
most murals cost less than $75.
</P>
<P>
   _ Murals of Carlstadt, N.J.; (201) 438-8875; www.decdim.com.
Available only by mail, murals sell for $25 to $120.
</P>
<P>
   Most murals come in sections or rolls for easy matching. If
they're too big, most murals can be trimmed to fit a wall; all can
be trimmed to an 8-foot height, the standard residential ceiling
height. If the mural is smaller than the wall, it merely can be
centered or can be ``framed'' with painted or stained wood trim
that can be purchased at a home improvement store.
</P>
<P>
   Preprinted murals also can be fitted around a corner for a
realistic touch.
</P>
<P>
   The wall must be smooth, or sanded smooth, before the murals
will adhere to a wall with a special adhesive _ sometimes included
with the purchase of the mural or available at home improvement
stores. The ideal surface is inexpensive flat latex (water-based)
paint. If the existing paint is gloss or semi-gloss, it can be
roughed up slightly with sandpaper.
</P>
<P>
   Most preprinted murals, which are painted on heavy paper with a
top finish added, can be peeled off without damaging the wall
underneath.

DEPRESSION, WARM SPELL DOGGED THE FIRST LAKE PLACID GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 11)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM REYNOLDS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. _ It was wrought with controversy, hampered by
the warmest weather ever recorded and handcuffed by the worldwide
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1932 Winter Olympic Games in the tiny Adirondack
Mountains village of Lake Placid also gave the United States its
own winter sports mecca, a status the village clings to more than
67 years later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1932, three narrow, windy, two-lane roads were the only land
routes into and out of Lake Placid, proving that some things never
change. The population is about the same now as it was when the
village found its way onto the world's map.
</P>
<P>
   But if Lake Placid hasn't grown, its legacy certainly has.
</P>
<P>
   Women's bobsledding still is not part of the Winter Olympics.
But New York's first lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, already decades ahead
of her time, caused a stir at the opening ceremonies by jumping
into a bobsled and demanding to be driven down the track at the
Mount VanHoevenberg complex.
</P>
<P>
   Women's speed skating was introduced as a demonstration sport
that year, 28 years before its athletes competed for medals.
Curling and sled-dog racing also were demonstration sports in Lake
Placid.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most recognizable athletes of that era, Norwegian
skating goddess Sonja Henie and U.S. bobsledder Billy Fiske, both
won gold medals at Lake Placid. Henie would win her third
consecutive gold medal at 23 at the 1936 Games. Fiske later became
the first American to join Britain's Royal Air Force in World War
II and died a hero in the Battle of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Henie and Fiske left indelible marks with their achievements in
Lake Placid. So did Jack Shea, Lake Placid's native son, who won
the first gold medal awarded in the Games as champion of the
500-meter speed-skating competition and later won the 1,500-meter
race.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps Lake Placid's biggest Olympic hero wasn't even an
athlete. His name was Godfrey Dewey, and he was the force behind
Lake Placid's successful bid to play host to the 1932 Winter
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Dewey was the son of Melvil Dewey, owner of the elite Lake
Placid Club and developer of the Dewey Decimal System.
</P>
<P>
   Godfrey Dewey was a one-man presentation team when the
International Olympic Committee met in Lausanne, Switzerland, in
early 1929 to hear the bids for the 1932 Games. Officially, five
locations offered bids for review: Montreal; Oslo, Norway; a
collective effort from Great Britain; Yosemite National Park; and
Lake Placid.
</P>
<P>
   The two American sites were the front-runners going in, and
``Dewey felt hopelessly outnumbered,'' said Mary McKenzie, who was
a 17-year-old secretary for the 1932 Lake Placid Olympic Committee,
in a 1994 interview.
</P>
<P>
   There is no record of what exactly Dewey said in that 1929
meeting. The consensus is that he presented plenty of facts and,
when necessary, bluffed.
</P>
<P>
   Dewey addressed the IOC at length about Lake Placid's proud
half-century as a winter sports haven. He spoke of ice-harness
racing, the town's passion for ice skating and how Lake Placid had
organized a town hockey team at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   He talked about his father's decision to keep his Lake Placid
Club resort open during the winter of 1904. That was the year when
skiing came to Lake Placid for the first time, as Melvil Dewey
ordered several pairs of skis from Norwegian businesses and invited
club members back to Lake Placid to determine whether fun could be
had in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   As the younger Dewey detailed for the committee, Lake Placid
evolved during the 25 years after that weekend folly into a
world-class site for national and international winter sports
events, such as ski jumping and cross-country skiing.
</P>
<P>
   Dewey _ who carried the U.S. flag into the stadium during
opening ceremonies for the 1928 Winter Games in St. Moritz,
Switzerland _ also vowed Lake Placid would build an indoor arena
capable of hosting figure skating and ice hockey and would
construct what would be the United States' first bobsled track.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Placid was awarded the bid to host the third Winter Olympic
Games on April 10, 1929. Then the fun really began.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Depression started six months later, spurring rumors
that the Games would be postponed or canceled because many nations
did not have enough money to send their athletes to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, 350 or so athletes from 17 nations came to
Lake Placid, but about half of the competitors were from the United
States or Canada. Crowds during the 10-day period were estimated at
about 10,000, filling hotels and boarding houses. Many visitors
skied to and from venues to avoid the automotive logjams.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks before Feb. 4-13, 1932, there was an unanticipated
absence from the Olympics: snow.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 17, 1931, heavy snow blanketed the Lake Placid region
and was believed to be a harbinger of a long, hard winter to come.
But what followed were the most unusual weather conditions recorded
by the Lake Placid weather bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The ground had bare spots. The Hudson River did not freeze over
for the first time since at least the mid-1700s. Snow had to be
trucked in from Canada, and volunteers tobogganed snow from high
terrain to cover dangerous areas on ski trails. Even the bobsled
competition was postponed until after the closing ceremonies
because of rainy weather and temperatures near 50 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Every event was staged, despite the weather. And despite
worldwide financial turmoil, many of the premier athletes in the
world found their way to Lake Placid.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Henie won the gold medal in women's figure skating by a narrow
margin over 11-year-old Ceceilia Colledge of Great Britain, who,
appropriately, wore a silver-colored dress during the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Legendary Finnish speed-skater Clas Thunberg, who came to Lake
Placid ready to compete, refused to take part because he disagreed
with a rule change that required skaters to race pack-style against
one another rather than in pairs against the clock. Ultimately, he
won his protest: Pack-style skating was dropped after the 1932
Games, but not before Shea, who made an arduous five-hour car ride
from his college studies at Dartmouth to come home and compete, and
Irving Jaffee each won two gold medals for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers, a group composed mainly of Lake Placid businessmen,
would lose millions of dollars building a new stadium and two other
major venues for the Games. However, even before the 1930s ended,
the village was already plotting how to bring the Olympics back to
Lake Placid.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-eight years later, that dream came to fruition, and
although television had dramatically changed the face of the
Olympics, the face of Lake Placid remained essentially the same.

 &HT;    Public must demand legislature toughen educational standards
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Politicians talk a good game when it comes to
improving public education _ identified as the political hot-button
issue this year.
</P>
<P>
   All that bold talk about the critical need to improve public
education turns to Jell-O when politicians get around to enacting
meaningful reforms.
</P>
<P>
   About as bold as most lawmakers get is to give away public
school funds to private, parochial or charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   A better solution would be to fix, not transfer, the problems
that have been allowed to develop in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Few politicians or public officials, however, are willing to put
their big talk into action when the time comes to approve the
salaries that would attract and keep quality school teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and public officials tuck tail and run when the
subject of weak teacher education programs is mentioned.
Intellectually feeble schools of education _ teacher mills _ have
remained largely unchanged for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers go all wobbly when education reformers mention the
need to test teachers to see if the people in charge of educating
the nation's children possess the basic skills needed to teach
assigned classroom courses.
</P>
<P>
   School teachers are models. Teachers who misspell words on the
blackboard, cannot solve simple math problems or use improper
grammar should be found out and fired.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers should ratchet up teacher pay in step with tougher
teacher standards and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of higher standards, it's been obvious for years that
America's public school students need to be held to higher
standards.
</P>
<P>
   America's young people have been graduating from high school
with excellent grades only to find that they score so poorly on
college-entrance examinations that the Scholastic Assessment Test
was dumbed down. Colleges across the nation have been forced to
fund an explosion of remedial programs for entering freshmen who
failed to learn enough to take first-year college courses.
</P>
<P>
   By giving students inflated grades, little homework and
undeserved promotions, America's young people graduated with high
self-esteem but tested at the bottom of all industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's quite another matter to get public officials to
actually increase academic standards and require objective,
standardized measurements to determine if learning has taken place.
</P>
<P>
   It is easier to talk about school prayer, vouchers, charter
schools, school uniforms, local control and other subjects rather
than require high standards and top-to-bottom accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians would rather talk about the importance of improving
public education than actually requiring it because they know if
they demand the best they will have to pay for the best.
</P>
<P>
   It's much easier to talk a good game while keeping public
education funding low enough to promise tax cuts. Besides, by
shifting some of the current funding to private and church schools,
perhaps someone else will solve the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Not all politicians and public officials run from the
accumulated problems that plague many of the nation's public
schools. With luck, public support will swing behind those
courageous politicians who are willing to put actions and funds
behind their words.
</P>
<P>
   Texas and North Carolina have begun to make steps toward raising
student standards and putting in place the beginnings of an
accountability system. Much more needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians who talk a good game when it comes to improving
public education know that there's no such thing as a free lunch.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for lawmakers and public education officials to
recognize that education is like everything else in life _ you get
quality when you demand quality. And you get what you pay for.

CHEVROLET RETIRES ITS 2-DOOR TAHOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Chevy's full-size, two-door sport-utility vehicle,
beloved for three decades by hunters, campers and cruising
teenagers, goes the way of the dodo after this year.
</P>
<P>
   The two-door Chevy Tahoe, formerly called the Chevy Blazer
before that name was downsized to a compact, is a big, brawny
heavyweight based on the Chevy half-ton pickup with a shortened
wheelbase, two rows of seats and a utility body.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of sport-utility vehicles, the first-generation Blazer
was the original Tonka Toy, a way for adolescents and young
grown-ups to relive their sandbox fantasies, only life-size. But
its compromises as a large, somewhat ungainly two-door utility
truck made it a niche vehicle, overshadowed in recent years by the
four-door sport utes that are popping up everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The big two-doors, including the erstwhile full-size Ford Bronco
and Dodge Power Ram, are a dying breed, and the departure after the
'99 model year of the two-door Tahoe leaves their ranks empty.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, everything changes for Tahoe, Yukon and Suburban as a
new generation of full-size GM sport utes are hustled in. New look,
new suspension, two new engines and the general upgrades afforded
the acclaimed Silverado pickups will be rolled out for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   No two-door Tahoe is planned. So this is the end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the longer, heavier four-door Tahoe, the two-door
drives sportier, if such a term can be applied to a
two-and-half-ton truck. This is the funmobile Tahoe, aimed at a
younger population, who couldn't care less if it has four doors to
ease access to the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, climbing into the back seat can be a real hardship,
especially in the four-wheel-drive version tested here, because of
its increased ride height. Once back there, it's plenty roomy and
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   GM could have come up with a third-door arrangement, similar to
what's available on the Saturn coupe, which would have made this
shortened version more palatable to people who actually wanted to
use their back seats.
</P>
<P>
   The driver and front-seat passenger will find the short Tahoe to
be as comfortable as any Suburban or stretch-cab pickup. For
extra-tall drivers like me, these behemoths are a perfect fit,
though shorter drivers also should appreciate the extra elbowroom.
Lots of headroom for a 10-gallon hat, too.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is very roomy and comfortable, and the thronelike
driving height creates a panoramic view of traffic or scenery. The
dashboard is the same as the pickup or Suburban, and generally, all
the sensory inputs driving the Tahoe are about the same as its
bigger brethren. The ride is a bit jouncier than the rest of the
group because of the shorter wheelbase.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the full-size Blazers and two-door Tahoes you see
bouncing down the road have been jacked-up, with huge tires and
plenty of attitude. Chevrolet's Z71 off-road package, which
includes huge all-terrain tires on custom-looking wheels, speaks to
that market. This is only a $400 option on the Tahoe, and certainly
worth it if you're planning on doing some boondocking. Or
profiling.
</P>
<P>
   The big expense on our tester was $5,700 over base for a
preferred equipment group, including leather seats and a full boat
of comfort and convenience features, including full power
accessories and a decent stereo.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Tahoe was reasonably nice to drive, the handling
does feel squirrelly, especially on curving roads where you have to
stay on top of things to keep it from wandering off on its own.
Cornering takes some skill and finesse. The steering is a bit too
light and numb, especially considering the size of the vehicles,
though its response is quick.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't get a chance to take the Tahoe off-road this time, but
I have in the past. It will take you anywhere you want to go with
ease.
</P>
<P>
   The standard engine is big and powerful, scooting the
heavyweight from a standstill with a rush. It's a thirsty beast,
though, slurping down the gasoline with great enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Tahoe is a good choice as a towing mule, and you can
see plenty of them on any weekend hitched up to boat trailers. The
sturdy automatic transmission is built for such heavy labor.
</P>
<P>
   All four-wheel-drive functions are push-button, a $400 option,
including an automatic setting that decides electronically whether
to add torque to the front wheels, depending on road conditions.
</P>
<P>
   With its load of options, the test Tahoe hit the $35,000, scary
territory for a Chevy. There's lots of choices out there at this
price.
</P>
<P>
   The two-door Tahoe, nee Blazer, was always a vehicle with lots

uptown. &QL;

   Chef Ben Leach used a trio of small paring knives to do many of
the garnishes explained in this story. Buy these tools at a
reputable cooking store and you will have them for many years of
garnishing. Shown from the top, clockwise, are:

MOVIES, VELCRO, HAIR CARE: A CHAT WITH CRYSTAL GAYLE

   PHOENIX - If you're over the age of 25, there are some things
you probably know about Crystal Gayle: She's got a ton of country
hits, a beautiful voice, a famous sister (Loretta Lynn) and some
absurdly long hair that she could sweep the floor with if she
wished. But who knew she hated Velcro?
</P>
<P>
   At age 48, the former Brenda Gail Webb is as busy as ever. She's
currently working on two albums _ one a collection of standards,
the other a long-promised duet disc with her big sis. Just having
gotten back from a relaxing weeklong cruise with her
manager/husband and two teenage kids, she was in a playful mood to
answer questions that were a little . . well, unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Randy: &UR; Your first top-10 hit was ``Wrong Road Again.'' When was
the last time you got lost?
</P>
<P>
   Crystal: Actually, I got lost on the cruise. I (begin ital)
always (end ital) got lost on the cruise. I could never find my way
to the dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Randy: Do fans still check to see what color your eyes are?
</P>
<P>
   Crystal: (sighing) All the time, ever since ``Don't It Make My
Brown Eyes Blue.'' ``I thought your eyes were brown!'' I tell them
that they used to be but they changed color because of the song.
</P>
<P>
   Randy: Weirdest question a fan ever asked you?
</P>
<P>
   Crystal: I try to block them out. Once, one of them asked me
what the definition of love was. I was like, ``Wait a minute _
isn't that a very broad question?''
</P>
<P>
   Randy: Last good movie you saw?
</P>
<P>
   Crystal: On the cruise, every time I turned on the TV they were
showing ``(There's) Something About Mary.'' I am so sick of that
movie, so it's not that. I love intrigue and suspense movies. That
one with Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman (``Crimson Tide'') _
that was fabulous. And Charles Bronson is my hero. I like action _
I don't want to cry in a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Randy: As someone with a famous sibling, who do you prefer: Don
or Phil Everly?
</P>
<P>
   Crystal: That's hard! (laughing) You're trying to be mean now. I
have to pick both of them because I'm trying to be nice.
</P>
<P>
   Randy: Your Tempe (Ariz.) shows (she will perform two shows
April 11 at the Red River Music Hall) are the same day as Andrea
Bocelli's Phoenix debut. MTV's ``Celebrity Deathmatch,'' you
against the tenor: Who wins?
</P>
<P>
   Crystal: Me, of course. I would just hit him a few times with my
hair.
</P>
<P>
   Randy: Since you brought it up, what kind of shampoo?
</P>
<P>
   Crystal: I tend to use different shampoos. Lately, I've been
using quite a bit of L'Oreal. I tend to use whatever's available _
it's not like I can let it go for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Randy: Do you ever get your hair caught in things?
</P>
<P>
   Crystal: What I hate the most is Velcro. My hair will get stuck
on Velcro on belts and purses and things like that. I have to be
careful around Velcro. If the TV remote control has Velcro on the
back, little bits of my hair will wind up on it. I've lost a lot of
hair to Velcro.
</P>
<P>
   Randy: Allen Reynolds, who produced many of your greatest
records, also produces Garth Brooks _ any advice for Garth on his
new baseball career?
</P>
<P>
   Crystal: Tell him to bat left-handed. And if he wants someone to
record with, I'm here. &QL;

BOCELLI: PHENOM OF THE OPERA? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA AND KENNETH LAFAVE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Andrea Bocelli is blessed with a very distinctive form
of popularity. That is, people either seem to fall at his feet in
worship or hate the ground he walks on.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the 40-year-old tenor so far has sold more than 14
million albums. His fourth disc, a collection of Italian pop epics
dubbed ``Sogno,'' was released last week. He has almost sold out
America West Arena for his first Phoenix appearance; even a $500
ticket price didn't seem to deter hungry fans. His accessible style
has brought people to opera who normally would shy away from the
mere concept.
</P>
<P>
   But that's where it starts to get as fuzzy as the stubble on
Bocelli's chin. Classical purists aren't exactly singing the
praises of the guy. While ``Sogno'' and his massive-selling
``Romanza'' disc are basically pop offerings, his other two solo
albums were straight opera releases. And die-hard opera fans aren't
exactly fond of his technique, which lacks the polish and finesse
of the genre's greats.
</P>
<P>
   Pop music writer Randy Cordova and Classical music writer
Kenneth LaFave took a listen to ``Sogno'' before discussing the
pros and cons of Bocelli.
</P>
<P>
   Ken: I hope I won't disappoint you by being less spiteful than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   There are two issues: the music and the musician. I think I
understand the appeal of the latter, and I'm all but certain I
understand the appeal of the former.
</P>
<P>
   My critical calls regarding either are not so important, I
think, as the reasons Bocelli and the music he sings are loved.
</P>
<P>
   Randy: I agree. And I think part of the whole deal with the
Bocelli phenomenon _ and it is a phenomenon _ has to do with the
way the singer has been marketed and presented. In many ways, he
allows those who otherwise have little tolerance for the fine arts
to indulge and feel like they are somehow connecting with their
refined, gentler side. That's why you hear so many people saying
things like, ``I don't like classical music, but that Andrea
Bocelli _ wow!''
</P>
<P>
   Ken: And, Andrea Bocelli is attractive to the ladies, with a
face halfway between cute and dangerous. Then there's the
``he's-blind-but-look-how-he's-overcome-his-handicap'' thing, which
may be politically incorrect to observe but is too obvious to be
avoided. He sings mostly romantic-cum-sentimental repertory with a
very pleasant, if not always secure, voice. Package those elements
with the proper marketing, get the imprimatur of PBS, and there's a
mansion with your name on it and a Maserati in the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; And, he's a lot better than Michael Bolton.
</P>
<P>
   Randy: That's for sure. But I'm surprised that you sound like
you actually like Bocelli.
</P>
<P>
   Ken: Am I a fan? No. Do I resent him? No. But any pleasure I
might get from Bocelli's singing is undermined by his lack of pitch
focus. I can't always trust that the next note I hear will be in
tune. Sometimes, I can safely assume he'll be (begin ital) out (end
ital) of tune _ and I'm proven right.
</P>
<P>
   Randy: That may be true, but I don't think that affects the
listening pleasure for the average pop fan. Popular music is full
of singers that are technically awful, so most people are used to
voices that are full of imperfections. And Bocelli sounds
positively heavenly next to most pop singers, with his sweet,
quietly radiant tenor.
</P>
<P>
   Ken: The pop songs Bocelli sings seem meant to imitate the
operatic attitude _ the pleasant chords, the heroic melodies _ and
also a feeling of gentle restlessness, like wanting to go on a trip
somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Current pop culture offers instead a selection of attitudes. You
got your hip-hop attitude, your rock and roll attitude, your pop
attitude, your country attitude, etc. This is the addition of
another attitude. Call it the opera 'tude, a shadow of its
namesake, but still more or less aiming in that direction. One can
only hope that people sampling this weak tea will go on to better,
stronger stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Randy: But the people who enjoy Bocelli for what he is _ a pop
star with a quasi-operatic style _ probably have no real interest
in the stronger stuff. If they did, they would have discovered the
real thing six years ago. When those singing monks made Gregorian
chants all the rage a few years ago, it didn't spark a hotbed of
new fans for centuries-old religious tunes. I think Bocelli's fans
are going to enjoy Bocelli the same way they enjoy Will Smith or
Barbra Streisand or Smashing Pumpkins or whoever else is in their
collection. Because ultimately, he is a pop star _ one with a
grand, melodramatic style _ but still a pop star. &QL;

SAY GOODBYE TO PIANO MAN, HELLO TO MAESTRO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Billy Joel has had so many hits over such a long
period of time, it's difficult to imagine the pop-music landscape
without him. Yet that's exactly what may happen after his current
``Greatest Hits'' tour wraps up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say this is the end of something,'' Joel said
last year in an interview with CNN. ``But I don't think I'm going
to do any more long tours after this tour.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing that seems to be occupying much of his time in recent
years is composing instrumental music for piano and orchestra.
Though no recordings have yet to appear, he has stated his
intentions several times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't walked away from rock and roll,'' he said in a 1997
interview on National Public Radio. ``I'm just concentrating on
writing orchestral and piano pieces. . . This is where my interest
is right now.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does become a full-time member of the tux-and-tails
brigade, it may mean the end of an era. Or it could simply be
another era in the wide-ranging history of Joel. From a distance,
his career looks like one long string of recognizable tunes, from
1974's ``Piano Man'' to 1993's ``River of Dreams.'' But he has
encompassed several different personalities and styles within that
span:
</P>
<P>
   The Tin Pan Alley Era _ This is perhaps Joel's most beloved
phase, which found him a lot closer to Cole Porter than to Paul
McCartney. In the early '70s, Joel was a rocker who did not rock.
Instead, he was known for his sharply literate songs that featured
instantly hummable melodies. Think of ``Piano Man,'' with its
familiar chorus and Broadway-esque story line. The song almost
sounds like the missing link from some long-ago theater production.
</P>
<P>
   Another highlight from this period is ``Just the Way You Are,''
a lounge-music standard with an oddly sexist lyric: ``I don't want
clever conversation . . . I love you just the way you are'' _ yes,
illiterate dummies make the best romantic partners. But people
overlooked the sentiment and embraced the song.
</P>
<P>
   Other Tin Pan-esque tunes include ``New York State of Mind''
(covered by the queen of Tin Pan Alley, Babs Streisand) and ``The
Entertainer,'' a dark look at the rock-star life driven by some
rollicking piano licks.
</P>
<P>
   The Leather Jacket Era _ The cover of 1980's ``Glass Houses''
said it all: Billy could rock. Well, Billy thought he could rock,
anyway. The disc, which spent six weeks at No. 1, featured Joel
throwing a rock at a glass building, perhaps a nod to him
shattering his image as a popster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Still Rock and Roll to Me'' signaled the new direction,
by de-emphasizing the piano and focusing instead on the song's
urgent rhythm track. ``Pressure,'' from ``The Nylon Curtain''
(1982), was another single that dropped the hummability, instead
going for an edgier, tenser vibe.
</P>
<P>
   The Christie Brinkley Era _ The time when almost every
red-blooded American male looked in the mirror and wondered, ``What
does Billy Joel have that I don't?'' In his ``Uptown Girl'' (1983)
video, Joel strutted with one of the most popular models in the
world. They later married and had a daughter, Alexa.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, Joel and Brinkley were the epitome of
celebrity-couple togetherness. She often was seen in the front rows
at his shows. The model even painted the cover for his ``River of
Dreams'' disc from 1996. ``(It's) a mixture _ some Expressionism,
some Impressionism. It's naive. It's, well . . . original.'' Whatta
guy!
</P>
<P>
   The couple split the following year, a bittersweet close to one
of Joel's most high-profile times. But musically, he left it with
some of his most distinctive music, including ``A Matter of Trust''
and ``I Go to Extremes.'' Then again, this era also produced the
excruciating ``We Didn't Start the Fire.'' Oh well, it's probably a
great history lesson for little Alexa.
</P>
<P>
   The Middle-of-the-Road Icon Era _ Where we stand today, when
Joel is able to sell out an arena with nothing new under his belt.
``Greatest H its Volume III'' came out more than a year ago,
featuring a number of hit songs and three new tracks.
</P>
<P>
   But what Joel offers is a hipper, less-spangly version of what
Neil Diamond gives to his audience: An astonishingly deep catalog
of familiar songs, performed with a crisp professionalism. You may
not be a fan, but it's next to impossible not to know at least a
few of his songs. And he's the kind of guy your dad loves, just as
his dad loved Perry Como. &QL;

CHOOSING THE RIGHT MURALIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ How can you tell which muralist is the right one
to decorate your home? Most muralists don't advertise, relying
instead on word-of-mouth recommendations. So get the names of
artists who have done murals at friends' homes and local businesses
and call them. Most will visit your home to discuss their painting
styles and your likes and dislikes.
</P>
<P>
   If an artist-patron match is made, the cost of the project can
be negotiated. Most muralists charge based on the time the work
takes _ and, yes, they figure in research time and the time it
takes to travel to your home.
</P>
<P>
   Projects can cost $100 or so for a bit of floral decoration in a
bathroom to several hundred dollars for a mural on a nursery wall
to $1,000 or more for a large mural in a living room or dining
room.
</P>
<P>
   Check your Yellow Pages under ``murals'' for artists. Here's how
to reach the muralists we talked to: Ignacio Gonzales, (818)
344-3228; Linda Hager, (805) 527-0079; Colette Stroffolino, (818)
990-3975. &QL;

CELEBRATION TO HONOR THE AUTHOR WILLIAM KENNEDY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The First Friday Club is being called to order on
the wrong day of the wrong week this month, yet it's hard to
imagine a more fitting occasion for the high-spirited literary
group than a celebration for one of its most esteemed members:
William Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   There are no requirements for being in the club. Irish-American,
male and gifted storyteller are traits most participants share. The
only dues are the blood and sweat one parts with in the course of
writing a book.
</P>
<P>
   Core members began meeting almost 20 years ago in Manhattan.
They named themselves after the Catholic tradition that encourages
going to church on the first Friday of the month. So doing for nine
consecutive months is believed to ensure dying with a priest at
your side. Their pact has a twist: If you make nine club meetings
in a row (usually held in bars, not churches), you will die with a
bartender. Members originally included Frank and Malachy McCourt,
Dennis Smith and Peter Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   All have since enjoyed literary success, but during the early
years of the club's pint-filled lunches only Smith, author of
``Report From Engine Company 82,'' had been published.
</P>
<P>
   One of the group's early heroes was Kennedy, the Albany writer
who was said then to be coming out with the final book in a trilogy
of literary novels set in his hometown. Quinn, a speechwriter for
then-Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, phoned Kennedy and asked if they
might come have lunch with him, a meeting of the First Friday Club.
A date was set: Jan. 6, 1984, the Feast of the Epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came up on the train and met Bill for lunch at Lombardo's,
but I don't think we ever got around to ordering food. I can't say
we drank everything in the place, but we tried,'' Quinn recalled.
``Bill never got a chance to say a word. Frank and Malachy held
court all day long, telling stories about their childhood and
singing songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bill was flabbergasted. He thought he was going to be
questioned about symbolism and metaphors,'' Quinn said. ``When he
gave us a ride back to the train station that afternoon he said he
had laughed himself sick. We've stayed friends ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank McCourt, who refers to his friend affectionately as ``the
Reverend William Kennedy,'' remembered the day: ``We were fans of
his, but we didn't go as groupies. It was a rather rowdy afternoon.
If I recall correctly, Bill was a bit taken aback by all of us
because we didn't ask him any questions.''
</P>
<P>
   McCourt was teaching creative writing at a New York City high
school at the time. Later, he would write the best-selling memoir
about his childhood in Limerick, ``Angela's Ashes.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, McCourt, Quinn, Smith and a few hundred others are
gathering at the Omni Hotel in Albany for the beginning of a
three-day celebration of Kennedy. The tribute is in part a belated
70th birthday party for the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer, who
turned 71 on Jan. 16, and it will be held in conjunction with a
national conference of the Associated Writing Programs taking place
at the Omni.
</P>
<P>
   Added Quinn, who would go on to write the acclaimed historical
novel ``Banished Children of Eve,'' about the New York City draft
riots during the Civil War: ``The First Friday Club was a group
that talked about writing without managing to write. Bill Kennedy
helped change that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For all of us, he was a role model,'' Quinn said. ``He'd laugh
to hear that, I know. I don't think he wants to think of himself as
a role model and he's not looking to be the head of a group of
writing disciples, but we all feel lucky for having met him.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said he had been flattered to meet these men, who would
become his good friends. ``I had never been to a First Friday. It
was an afternoon like I hadn't had before. It was very Irish,'' he
remembered. ``It was a rollicking time.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, Kennedy has become a cottage industry in
the halls of academia.
</P>
<P>
   Six scholars have just completed or are about to complete full
critical books about Kennedy, and each is scheduled to present
papers during the upcoming conference. Some, such as Benedict Giamo
of the University of Notre Dame, author of the 1997 book ``The
Homeless of Ironweed: Blossoms on the Crag,'' will be meeting
Kennedy for the first time. Kennedy's novel ``Ironweed,'' later
made into a feature film, won the Pulitzer Prize for literature in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to expect and I don't know how to behave.
It's strange. I haven't figured it out,'' Kennedy said recently,
sitting in a leather-covered chair in the family room of his home.
``It can't be anything but fun with all of the great pals who'll be
there, so I'm not dreading it. I'm just a little trepidatious.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his academic treatments, the conference will
showcase the novelist, screenwriter, playwright and one-time
journalist as both friend and mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who taught writing at the University State University
of New York at Albany in the late '70s and early '80s and at
Cornell for the '83-'84 school year, nurtured students, some of
whom have gone on to establish themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill was the guy who opened the gate for me, not in a business
sense but in an artistic sense,'' said Douglas Bauer, whose most
recent novel, ``The Book of Famous Iowans,'' has received high
praise.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Fischkin, author of the 1997 book ``Muddy Cup: A
Dominican Family Comes of Age in a New America,'' also had Kennedy
as an instructor at SUNY-Albany. ``I am a writer because of him, as
much a writer as I am,'' she said. ``He was my first teacher and
continues to be the best teacher I've ever had. I rarely write any
large project without remembering things he taught me or recently
said to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy has been working on his eighth novel for the past three
years. It's about the Albany political machine between the first
and second World Wars.
</P>
<P>
   He recently completed a screenplay of his most recent novel,
``The Flaming Corsage'' (1996), but refuses to set a deadline for
finishing the novel in progress, which was tentatively titled
``Roscoe.'' Billy Phelan, the pool hall wizard and protagonist of
his 1978 novel ``Billy Phelan's Greatest Game,'' may make an
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legs is back, that much I know,'' said Kennedy, referring to
the colorful gangster ``Legs'' Diamond, for whom the first of the
Albany trio of novels is named. ``I haven't gotten to him yet, but
I know Legs is back.''

INTERIOR MURALS CHANGING THE SCENERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Editors: Note use of italics throughout) 
By CAROL BIDWELL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sponge-painting? Rag-rolling? Wood-graining?
</P>
<P>
   They're (ITALICS)so(END ITALICS) five minutes ago, positively
passe painting trends. If you've had it with wallpaper and you're
ready for a new challenge, try murals. Yes, those b-i-i-i-g
pictures. Yes, inside your home.
</P>
<P>
   Once an art form reserved for the rich and richer, murals are
now more affordable than they've ever been. And more homeowners are
going beyond a simple splash of color, instead covering their walls
with scenery or themes. Every room in the house _ the nursery,
recreation room, dining rooms, living rooms _ is fair game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murals aren't anything new,'' said Stephen Stoner of Stephen
Stoner Associates in West Hollywood, a member of the American
Society of Interior Designers. ``In fact, they're very old. People
are just rediscovering them. And discovering that, today, they can
be affordable.''
</P>
<P>
   Think the Sistine Chapel. Think the Palace at Versailles.
Today's homeowners can have the same effect, on a (ITALICS)much(END
ITALICS) smaller scale, for a (ITALICS)much(END ITALICS) smaller
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Today's murals are vivid and not too costly because of the
invention, in the 1970s, of acrylic paints, said 80-year-old
Ignacio Gonzales of Van Nuys, who's painted murals in homes,
restaurants, hotels and other businesses for the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before that, if somebody wanted a mural, they brought somebody
over from Italy,'' Gonzales said. ``They thought you had to be
Italian to paint a mural. That was because the Italians, who had
been at it for centuries, knew how to mix paints so they wouldn't
fade, so they'd stay beautiful for years. It was their secret. But
with acrylics, anybody who bought a set of paints was a muralist
all of a sudden.''
</P>
<P>
   For Maureen Celusta of Simi Valley, hiring muralist Linda Hager,
also a Simi resident, meant she could add a personal touch to her
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could do exactly what I wanted instead of being limited by
wallpaper,'' Celusta said.
</P>
<P>
   The result: The dining room walls in her Simi Valley home are
covered with scenes of citrus orchards, complete with crates marked
with the fictional ``Celusta'' label. But the real fantasy mural
was finished only a couple of weeks ago in the foyer of Celusta's
newly purchased beach house in Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors who open the front door and step inside get the
sensation of being at the bottom of the ocean. The dark blue walls
are filled with realistic-looking rocks and plants, fish,
jellyfish, a giant sting ray, a sea turtle swimming out of an
undersea cave, two kissing dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Hager, who gave up a 17-year career teaching oil painting to
fill an increasing demand for painted-on-the-wall artwork, has
painted more than 500 murals _ most of them in homes, but a few in
businesses _ in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   In one home, she added a fanciful garden scene to the sweeping
wall behind a curved staircase. In another, she added a touch of
old Tuscany to a wine cellar. She's daubed cartoon figures around
babies' rooms, and added fruits and vegetables to kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   Colette Stroffolino of Sherman Oaks gets more smiles per mural
than most painters: Most of her work goes in children's bedrooms,
although she's also painted murals in pediatricians' offices,
elementary schools and kids' furniture stores.
</P>
<P>
   As she put the finishing touches on a moon-and-stars mural in a
Sherman Oaks home a couple of weeks ago, nearly-2-year-old Parker
Converse clapped his hands with delight. ``Moon!'' he exclaimed,
pointing. The gold crescent moon with a smiling face hovered just
above his crib, ringed by blue and gold stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves the moon _ when we go out at night, he points and
goes, `Moon, moon!' '' said Parker's mom, Tricia Converse. ``Now,
whenever he goes down to sleep, it's going to be like an adventure
for him. He'll have his moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Converse said she was a bit hesitant about commissioning a mural
for her son's room, believing it would cost too much. But she saw
Stroffolino's work in a friend's home and decided to call anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize you could hire somebody to do something
small, by the hour,'' she said. ``It's exactly what we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The muralist said it's sometimes hard for potential clients to
visualize what a mural will look like in their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of clients are very unsure,'' Stroffolino said.
``They've never hired this type of service before. They're unsure
about the cost. But I work really fast, so it generally doesn't
take long. And when they see it done, they say, `Oooh, wow!' And
they call me later and say, `I just go sit in that room and wait
for the baby to come. I love it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales, who studied painting in France and Germany after World
War II, originally envisioned himself as a master portrait painter.
But there was little demand for that kind of work in California, so
he turned to painting murals in restaurants and other businesses,
including an Indian restaurant in the Glendale Galleria and the
original guest rooms when Caesars Palace was built in Las Vegas.
Patrons who saw the work and liked it hired him to decorate their
homes in similar fashion.
</P>
<P>
   While other muralists paint realistic scenes or copy cartoon
characters, Gonzales' favorite works _ his best, he says _ pay
homage to the French impressionists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really have a style,'' he said. ``I can't afford it. I
do whatever people want.''
</P>
<P>
   His work has included painting historical Hollywood figures
around the movie screen in the screening room of one mansion;
turning a bedroom wall into a replica of ancient Greece, complete
with ruins and a lake; and making an Iranian family feel at home by
painting the walls of their large home with scenes from their
native country.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few years ago, he also did broad expanses of exterior
walls _ mythical figures along a wall shading a swimming pool, a
French cafe scene on a guest house wall facing the main house.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of his career, he'd paint anything, anywhere.
When block after block of apartment houses were being built in the
Valley after the war, he painted murals in the dining rooms of most
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would knock out 40 apartments in a day,'' he said. ``The
painting was the easiest part. The hard part was the planning, the
sketches. It took no time at all to do the painting.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales doesn't work as often as he'd like because, he says,
people want to buy art like they buy wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call up and say, `I've got a wall 15 feet by 8 feet. How
much for a mural?' And they're unhappy when I say I can't tell them
until I see the wall, the house. So, they call some young kid who
will work cheap, like I used to. I can't blame them, though. That's
how I got started.'' &UR; !end! &QL;

 HOW ABOUT A BIT of URBAN CLEANSING?

   ``Stop Urban Cleansing!'' __ Hand-lettered sign in the window of
a building on Orleans, just south of Division Street, in an area of
Chicago where projects are being torn down and $300,000 townhouses
are going up.
</P>
<P>
   ............................
</P>
<P>
   My teenage nephew got on the wrong bus the other day and ended
up in an unfamiliar and scary neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like a bomb hit it,'' he told me.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, I said, we've got a lot of those kinds of places in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   If you've spent any time at all here _ and this is true of a lot
of big cities today _ you've seen the pockets of rubble and decay
and desolation. These areas are so bleak as to seem without hope.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you come from just such a place; maybe you live there now.
Maybe your old stomping grounds, the place where you grew up, has
turned into one of those ``bombed-out'' no man's lands.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you've only seen the gravel lots and the boarded-up houses
and the crumbling projects from the relative safety of your car as
you tried to figure out how to get back on a main road or the
expressway.
</P>
<P>
   Every big city, no matter how magnificent its downtown and its
parks and its skyline, has these pockmarks. They dot the landscape
like BB holes in a stained-glass window.
</P>
<P>
   I think about such neighborhoods every time we get involved in
some conflict overseas and we try to make the world a better place,
because after all that's our job as the wealthiest and most
powerful country in modern times. I think about how readily we vow
to clean house elsewhere, when there's still a heck of a mess in
our own basement.
</P>
<P>
   Each time America jumps into a conflict, most of us have to dive
for the Atlas and dig into the handy maps provided by the
newspapers. Where's Somalia? Remind me where Kuwait is again. Can
somebody pinpoint Bosnia, Lebanon, the Panama Canal, Grenada, Iraq,
Iran?
</P>
<P>
   That's what's happening right now, on a daily basis. We read the
reports of the latest bombing or the most recent counterattack in
Yugoslavia, and we turn to the accompanying maps so we can get our
bearings. All right, I know where Skopje is, but where's Tetovo?
</P>
<P>
   And there's always a new Hitler to be defeated, or so we're
told. Amin, Ghadafi, Hussein, Milosevic. Our leaders draw the
Hitler comparison, not to insult those who remember the Holocaust,
but to provide easy shorthand for those who don't. Equating some
modern potentate-thug with the most hated man of the century is an
easy way to get the semi-interested populace emotionally involved
in the cause. If this guy is as evil as they're saying he is, we
have to step in!
</P>
<P>
   As the pictures are beamed into our living rooms, we shake our
heads at the barbarians on the other side of the world. Why are
those people still fighting one another? How can they treat their
own people like that? What kind of civilization needs to be saved
from itself?
</P>
<P>
   We conveniently forget that someone might have the same thoughts
while watching CNN's coverage of the riots in Los Angeles, or a
documentary about crack babies in Chicago, or a news report about
the murder rate in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Our world is not a simple place, and the United States of
America's place in this era is more complicated than at any time in
history. We can't just announce we're no longer the bodyguard of
underdog nations and peoples; we can't just take the $2 billion
that would be spent on the construction of a top-of-the-line
stealth fighter and redistribute it to the worst neighborhoods in
Detroit. It doesn't happen that way, and it never will.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's a kind of controlled insanity in the way things
work. Americans have been told by NATO and by our president that
Kosovo is now the most important region in the world _ even though
you can find horrific examples of ethnic cleansing, oppression,
starvation and injustice in three or four dozen other areas around
the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Try that logic out on a 10-year-old girl who has to ride her
bike in the fence-enclosed walkways of her inner-city high-rise
because the sidewalks outside and below are too dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows how long we'll stay there, and how much net value our
involvement will yield. Our track record in these affairs since
Vietnam is spotty at best. Last time I looked, Saddam Hussein was
still strutting tall and talking tough, eight years after Operation
Desert Storm.
</P>
<P>
   This much I'll guarantee: We'll get out of Kosovo one day, and
then we'll turn our full attention to some other godforsaken
outpost _ but it won't be the Bronx or South Central or the West
Side of Chicago.

bike in the fence-enclosed walkways of her inner-city high-rise

   Who knows how long we'll stay there, and how much net value our
involvement will yield. Our track record in these affairs since
Vietnam is spotty at best. Last time I looked, Saddam Hussein was
still strutting tall and talking tough, eight years after Operation
Desert Storm.
</P>
<P>
   This much I'll guarantee: We'll get out of Kosovo one day, and
then we'll turn our full attention to some other godforsaken
outpost _ but it won't be the Bronx or South Central or the West
Side of Chicago.

<TEXT>
<P>
   You'd love to shoot the moon with your mutual fund, slapping
your money down on the wildest bet you can find. But, of course,
you're worried that you could lose your whole nest egg.
</P>
<P>
   If that describes your outlook, a handful of the nation's
biggest insurers have got a deal for you. Well, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   First, you pick one of their funds, from high-risk to
mild-mannered _ your choice. Then, for as little as 0.1 percent of
the investment annually or possibly as much as 0.5 percent, these
companies will guarantee that the money you put up, plus an annual
gain of 4 or 5 percent, will always be there, no matter how far the
market plunges.
</P>
<P>
   On a $50,000 investment, then, that guarantee would cost $50 to
$250 a year. Sounds good, but there is a catch: You have to die in
order to collect on the guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   What the companies are selling is life insurance tied to your
mutual fund or funds. You make a bad guess on the market, and you
will have less to spend, as usual. But under their new plans, your
gambling won't hurt your heirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, what we're doing is creating peace of mind,'' said
J. Steven Neamtz at SunAmerica, where he is in charge of marketing
mutual funds, including what the company calls its Asset Protection
Plan.
</P>
<P>
   Peace of mind surely has its value. But many financial advisers
say that this is insurance that most people don't need. The reason,
they say, is that since the end of the Depression, long-term
investors in stocks have generally ended up with more than they
started with _ a lot more, actually, than if they had put their
money into absolutely-safe certificates of deposit, money funds or
almost-sure-fire bonds.
</P>
<P>
   With these new products, if your investment beats the gain
guaranteed by the insurers, you simply walk away with your higher
earnings. So an insurance company can collect premiums for years
and never have to pay out anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably makes sense for somebody who is older and wants to
take a little more risk to grow his nest egg for his family,'' said
Patrick Reinkemeyer, an analyst at Morningstar, the Chicago
financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   But, experts say, the fund insurance offers little to younger
investors with long horizons.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance is available with no questions asked about health.
That means people who are elderly or in poor health and cannot buy
ordinary life insurance at a reasonable price can insure at least
some of their assets.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced 18 months ago by American Skandia Life Assurance as a
sort of a stripped-down variable annuity, the product seems to be
an idea ahead of its time. While American Skandia and the two other
companies offering it _ SunAmerica and the Prudential Insurance
Company of America _ are effusive about its potential, customers
are not rushing to embrace the concept of fund insurance.
</P>
<P>
   SunAmerica and Prudential acknowledge that business has been
slow, but they won't say how slow. American Skandia says it has
signed up about 1,000 of the 100,000 owners of its affiliated
mutual fund accounts.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the lack of enthusiasm, the sellers say, has been
the bull market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sun isn't going to shine on this option until the market
backs off,'' said Michael Murray, who is in charge of marketing the
mutual funds of American Skandia and its version of the product,
known as AS Goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   The new investment, sometimes called a protected mutual fund,
gives you one of the most popular features of variable annuities _
a guarantee that you won't lose your initial investment _ while
eliminating other features, some positive and some negative.
</P>
<P>
   With a variable annuity, for example, you pay a penalty to the
insurance company if you withdraw your money within seven years or
so of investing it, as well as a 10 percent penalty to the federal
government if the withdrawal comes before you are 59{. With the new
product, you can cash out any time without penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But the new product does not shelter your investment gains from
taxes, as variable annuities do. Your money is taxed on withdrawal,
at your then-current income tax rate. With the insured accounts,
you pay taxes on gains as you go along (as with any mutual fund),
and then pay capital gains taxes when you begin withdrawals.
Prudential alone sells the coverage in combination with
tax-deferred Individual Retirement Accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Both Prudential and Skandia also lock in the value of an account
on the anniversary of its initial investment, as some companies do
with variable annuities. That provision can benefit investors: Say
the market drives up an original investment of $100,000 to $130,000
on its third anniversary. You die in the fourth year, when the
guaranteed value, at 5 percent, would be $121,554.94, but your
investment's market value has fallen to, say, $110,000. Your heirs
would still collect $130,000 _ some $20,000 of it free of income
tax because it is regarded as a life insurance benefit.
</P>
<P>
   With a variable annuity, finally, you can choose to have the
insurance company pay you a stream of regular payments for as long
as you live. This is known as annuitization. With the new product,
there is no annuitization option.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest complaints about variable annuities is the
costs: Insurers charge an average of about 1.24 percent of the
value of the investment for insurance and administrative expenses,
in addition to the management fees for the funds within the
annuity.
</P>
<P>
   These fees can put an enormous drag on the growth of variable
annuities, so that for the first 10 years or so, investments in
pure mutual funds almost always grow faster. As time goes on, the
variable annuity's tax deferral pushes its cumulative growth ahead
of the simple mutual fund's.
</P>
<P>
   The fees for the new fund insurance plans are much lower.
Prudential charges 0.1 percent annually for investors who are under
60 years old, 0.25 percent for those 60 to 69 and 0.5 percent for
those 70 and older. The other two companies charge everyone the
same amount: for SunAmerica, the cost is 0.2 percent annually; for
American Skandia, the fee is 0.3 percent. (Both SunAmerica and
Skandia also charge a start-up fee of $25.)
</P>
<P>
   Some investors might be discouraged from buying the new products
because the funds themselves have sales charges and, in some cases,
relatively high annual administrative charges _ expenses that cut
into returns.
</P>
<P>
   The companies, of course, do not want people to take advantage
of the guarantee by signing up right after they've had a heart
attack or a few days into what they figure is a market avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're at the blackjack table at Vegas,'' said one
insurance executive, ``you can't say, `Well, deal me a few hands;
then I'll decide whether I want to play.'''
</P>
<P>
   To improve the odds for themselves, the insurance companies
limit the period in which you can decide to insure your mutual
funds. American Skandia and SunAmerica give you 30 days from the
time you buy into their funds; Prudential gives you six months.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, with no provision for checking on people's health,
the insurers could find themselves with some pretty risky
customers. ``But so far,'' said Murray of American Skandia, ``that
hasn't been a problem.''

OFF THE SHELF: MOM AS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 11)  
(ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.
Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling (888)
603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.) 
 (bl)  
 By DEBORAH STEAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   How to explain what seems to be a sudden interest in linking
family life to business management skills?
</P>
<P>
   One catalyst may be ``The Time Bind: When Work Becomes Home and
Home Becomes Work,'' Arlie Hochschild's 1997 book about the
blurring of domestic and office life. Or maybe business writers
have been mining so many other spheres for management ``wisdom'' _
including sports, Winnie the Pooh stories and the life of Jesus _
that they are low on inspiration and turning to the home in
desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, two new books attempt to put a domestic
spin on management. Taken together, they argue that managers should
listen to their moms and that moms should act as managers do.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Wear Clean Underwear: Business Wisdom From Mom'' (Villard,
$22.95), Rhonda Abrams trots out business success stories and links
them to the ``familiar sayings and lessons'' of our mothers. Each
chapter revolves around a mom-ism: ``Don't Get Too Big for Your
Britches,'' ``Share'' or ``How Do You Know You Don't Like It When
You've Never Tried It?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a forgivable gimmick, perhaps. But some of the business
tales are themselves too familiar: In a chapter entitled ``It's Not
the End of the World,'' Ms. Abrams retells the story of how Post-It
Notes emerged from 3M's high tolerance for trial and error. In ``I
Don't Care Who Made This Mess, Just Clean It Up,'' she revisits
Nordstrom's commitment to customer service.
</P>
<P>
   In other chapters, she describes the much-noted quirkiness at
Southwest Airlines and the well-publicized altruism at Malden Mills
in Massachusetts, the Polartec fabric maker that kept all its
workers on the payroll while it rebuilt a factory that burned to
the ground in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Mom-think is also discovered at other companies whose core
values the author admires. But even these unfamiliar stories begin
to sound the same, as the author praises this or that hiring policy
or employee motivational tactic. Also predictable are the sidebars,
in which business types talk about the wisdom they garnered from,
yes, their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abrams, a columnist for Gannett News Service and the author
of a best seller, ``The Successful Business Plan,'' is so
relentlessly upbeat in this book, in fact, that it ends up as a
collection of illustrated bromides. The mom-sayings are all benign.
(I looked in vain for the chapter called ``You'll All Be Sorry
Enough When I'm Dead.'') And the profiles are paeans to the
companies. That's what comes of listening to mom: You start to
accept that ``if you can't say something nice about someone . . .
''
</P>
<P>
   HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, Inc.: Taking Your Work Skills Home,'' by Neale S. Godfrey
with Tad Richards (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $23), tries to get harried
working mothers to manage their families by using tactics they've
learned at the office.
</P>
<P>
   The book, of course, isn't the first to suggest imposing a
business model on the home. In the early part of the century, Frank
Gilbreth, an eccentric efficiency expert, adapted ``scientific''
factory management to his household _ a lifelong experiment
described charmingly by 2 of his 12 offspring in ``Cheaper by the
Dozen,'' published in 1948. And Ms. Godfrey herself, in her earlier
book, ``Money Doesn't Grow on Trees,'' outlined a financial
services setup at home for teaching children about spending and
saving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, Inc.,'' as its title suggests, declares that ``you are
the CEO of your life'' and must manage your ``employees'' _
children and husband _ accordingly. ``At home you handle more
personnel changes than the human resources manager of a Fortune 500
company,'' the author writes, arguing that a 2-year-old becomes a
completely different ``employee'' when he or she turns 3.
</P>
<P>
   This being a modern management guide, the dreaded ``mission
statements'' are recommended, as are ``project'' teams _ for every
task.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the book is belabored. Readers are encouraged to make
charts to see if solutions used at work can be found for the home;
lists must be drawn to figure out which tasks you love and which
you find ``yucky.'' (Ahem. Would a book aimed at male ``CEOs'' use
that word?) Over all, ``Mom, Inc.'' seems thin, with meat enough
for a magazine article perhaps, but not a book.
</P>
<P>
   But it is redeemed by the determination of Ms. Godfrey, formerly
a single parent of two, to give her readers some relief by teaching
them to delegate at home. This is a woman on intimate terms with
child-raising and housework. And a few of her tips _ a list of
weekly chores, for example, that can be performed by children of
various ages _ might just startle an overburdened or indulgent
working mom into action.

MP3.COM'S MICHAEL ROBERTSON: THE MUSIC MAN OF THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 11) 
(ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   `Hell's Bells,'' a raucous anthem by the rock group AC/DC,
blared from loudspeakers as Michael Robertson, the chief executive
of MP3.com, walked to the podium. It seemed an unlikely
introduction at last month's New York Music and Internet Expo for a
man who wore a conservative camel hair sports jacket _ and who had
an evangelical Christian background.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after his keynote speech, Robertson, a 32-year-old
entrepreneur with blond surfer looks, received warm handshakes from
teen-agers with nose rings and hip-hop artists in baggy jeans. In
the 16 months since he started his San Diego-based business, which
distributes music over the Internet with a digital compression
technology known as MP3, Robertson has been embraced by struggling
musicians as a fellow revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he says he really isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no revolutionary, I'm a purebred capitalist,'' Robertson
said later. ``I'm just talking about a new way of delivering
music.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Robertson is hoping that his outsider reputation will be
a plus. When he introduced his service, which enables musicians to
distribute their music cheaply over the Internet, he was virtually
ignored by top labels. But now that MP3.com offers free music from
7,000 artists and gets 250,000 visitors a day, the labels, as well
as investors, are taking notice. That brand recognition should come
in handy Tuesday, when Microsoft will introduce a rival music site
and its own compression software, MS-Audio.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson says he doesn't worry much about competition, even if
it's Microsoft. Over takeout chicken and french fries in his New
York hotel room, he asserted that in the Internet world, timing and
instincts could be as valuable as capital. It is a lesson he says
he learned observing his idol, Steve Jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did it with Apple; he did it with Pixar,'' said Robertson
said. ``I've got a lot of respect for him because he zigged when
everybody else zagged, and that's what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com began two and a half years ago as the Z Company, a
Yahoo-style search engine founded by Robertson. In October 1997,
Greg Flores, now MP3.com's director of sales, showed the MP3
software to Robertson, who was impressed enough to buy the rights
to the MP3.com domain name and to rename his company.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, MP3.com had four employees, including Robertson,
working out of their homes. Last summer, it expanded into a
1,000-square-foot loft. ``We had this sign up for new employees,''
he recalled. ``It was the steps you had to do to join the company:
Order chair. Put chair together. Order desk. Put desk together.''
The business has since moved to a larger office and employs about
35 people.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Robertson's gamble appears to have paid off. In
January,  &UR; Sequoia Capital,  &LR; a venture capital firm, invested $10
million in the company. Then Tom Petty posted a new song on MP3.com
to promote an album. At the end of March, Gateway chief executive
Theodore Waitt signed on to MP3.com's board. The computer
mainstream has, in effect, signaled that Michael Robertson is the
leader in his field.
</P>
<P>
   Musicians also like Robertson's enterprise, which uses free
music as a lure to sell compact disks, because he pays a generous
50 percent royalty rate. He can pay more than the 7 to 10 percent
offered by record labels because he has none of their overhead or
distribution costs and he pays no advances. Like other commercial
sites offering free downloads, MP3.com makes money selling
advertising and marketing information about its visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics argue that Robertson has not built a viable business
model and that any free download policy can facilitate piracy. ``If
he sells music, more power to him,'' said Hilary Rosen, chief
executive and president of the Recording Industry Association of
America. ``I think it's the notion that music can be given away for
free forever and there not be a return that is the economic joke.''
</P>
<P>
   But observers like Ken Hertz, a partner in the law firm Hansen,
Jacobson, Teller &AMP; Hoberman, which represents popular acts like
Alanis Morissette and No Doubt, said the association was
misinterpreting Robertson's intentions. ``Michael Robertson is not
interested in being in the record business,'' said Hertz.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson is the first to say that he is an music industry
novice. Before starting MP3.com, his main music credential was
playing clarinet in his high-school band in Huntington Beach,
Calif. He grew up in a working-class, fundamentalist household _
his late father was a handyman _ where listening to popular music
was discouraged. He graduated from the University of California at
San Diego in 1990 with a degree in cognitive science.
</P>
<P>
   After college, he started a computer consulting firm and later
sold software tools he had developed. Looking to expand, he started
Media Minds, which sold software for digital cameras _ a business
that ultimately failed. To start MP3.com, Robertson, who is married
and has two young children, took out a second mortgage on his home
in San Diego. Before receiving capital from Sequoia, he said,
MP3.com made a modest profit.
</P>
<P>
   These days, he spends most of his time traveling around the
country to meet with investment bankers, artist organizations and
other Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson anticipates a battle between his company and the
recording labels, something that has not been cause for concern so
far. ``I don't have any friends in the music industry,'' he said,
``so I didn't have to worry about upsetting anybody.''

A 1935 PACKARD IN FORMER SOVIET GEORGIA: THE TALES IT COULD TELL!

<TEXT>
<P>
   KUTAISI, Georgia _ Nodar Chechelashvili is a man with a sweep of
silver hair and a classic American tale _ of youth, of a car, of
romantic summer drives to the beach. But the cast of long-dead
characters, like Lavrenti Beria, Stalin's secret police chief, are
towering figures in Soviet history. And the story, stuck in a sad
cul-de-sac, still awaits an ending. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chechelashvili, 64, a Georgian pensioner, is quaintly out of
place amid civil war and economic ruin. He is absorbed in the
appalling state of the only car he has ever owned _ a red, white
and blue 1935 Packard that he bought when he was 20. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have seen its beauty before, and the good times I
had in it,'' Chechelashvili said, tears welling when a foreign
reporter and photographer appeared unannounced at his gate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you crying?'' asked his wife, Alla. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``From happiness,'' Chechelashvili replied. ``That they paid
attention.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chechelashvili's story reveals the lengths to which many people
went during the Soviet era and afterward to maintain possessions
that would have been long ago discarded in the West. It is also a
tale of the exceptional reach of what in the 1920s and '30s was a
premier American car _ the Packard, more prized even than Cadillac
and shipped around the globe to admiring leaders like Stalin, who
owned several. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In July, collectors will gather in Warren, Ohio, for the
centennial of the first Packard, built by the brothers William and
James Ward Packard. Hundreds of the cars are expected, including at
least one from each of the vehicle's 60 years of production. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But here in Kutaisi, a quiet city of 200,000 people, it has been
easy for Chechelashvili to feel misunderstood. While he has
conducted an international letter-writing campaign to save his
cherished car, unknowingly addressing his pleas to a company that
went out of business four decades ago, even some of those closest
to him have looked on with the sympathy accorded an eccentric. And
he has watched his Packard slowly deteriorate, parked in front of
his ramshackle wooden house next to a railroad depot. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chechelashvili found the seven-passenger touring car in 1955
when, gassing up the taxi in which he earned his living, he noticed
a broken-down vehicle nearby. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Its dark green paint was faded, its convertible top ripped. The
upholstery was cracked and torn. The gas station owner said the car
had sat for seven years, abandoned by the police chief from
Tbilisi, the capital city 120 miles east, after a rod blew as the
rear axle snapped simultaneously. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Examining the Packard, Chechelashvili saw that the body was
undented, its detail intact. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked it,'' he recalled, wearing a green V-neck sweater
under a leather jacket. ``I asked him to sell it to me. He said,
`I'll pay you to take it.' See, it was just occupying a lot of
space. So someone called the police chief and said, `There are some
boys here who want to take your car.' And he said, `Why not?''' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So it was that Chechelashvili ended up paying a token 3,000
rubles _ even a bicycle cost 1,500 rubles at the time _ and, using
a bus, towed it home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tracking its history, Chechelashvili learned that the vehicle
was initially used by Beria, the first secretary of Georgia's
Communist Party, before Stalin summoned him to Moscow in 1938 and
he became one of the most feared men in Soviet history.
</P>
<P>
   A brass factory plate in the car is stamped ``1927,'' but the
model number supports the assertion of a Packard expert, Donald
Peterson of Roswell, Ga., that it is actually a 1935 Super Eight
Touring Car.
</P>
<P>
   The Packard Super Eight _ just 1,392 were made in 1935 in 16
body styles _ came with an 8-cylinder, 150-horsepower,
385-cubic-inch engine. In the United States, it cost $3,690. ``That
would buy you six, maybe seven new Chevys,'' Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Packard buff, Jim Pearsall of Zarephath, N.J., said he
was unaware of any surviving '35 Packards with this body style. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As popular as Packards were with Soviet strongmen, spare parts
were hard to come by. Chechelashvili has had access only to Russian
hardware and local ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   Working for two years to repair his car, he installed a
six-cylinder Soviet Gaz-51 engine. Inside, he upholstered the seats
with fake black leather and the door panels with striped,
multi-colored cloth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friends convinced him to replace the original paint. When
sanding didn't work, they tried a welding torch. ``It melted the
tin, and it was dripping into the bottom of the repair pit,''
Chechelashvili said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet the result _ he repainted the Packard black and white _ was
a wonderful cruising car. He began making grand tours. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over tea and the local cheese-filled bread called khachapuri,
Chechelashvili leafed through albums of photos in which he posed
with relatives in the Black Sea resorts of Georgia and Yalta. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Around Kutaisi, grown men describe being taken as boys by
Chechelashvili for marvelous summer rides to the beach. He himself
recalls some hellish adventures, like the seaside drive during
which he flipped the car and crushed the windshield, and another in
which a fire consumed the interior. The repairs resulted in the
car's somewhat blockish appearance, including a windshield salvaged
from a three-ton cargo truck. The door panels are steel sheets.
</P>
<P>
   A curious sense of aesthetics accounts for other alterations.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, a local film company wrote the car into a script,
and the director ordered it repainted red, white and blue;
Chechelashvili decided he liked the colors, and he pocketed the
cash he was given to restore the old finish.
</P>
<P>
   He cannibalized Volga sedans for the front and back bumpers,
rear windows, hubcaps and _ extended from the rear _ a huge trunk.
(``Now there's room for 300 liters of gas,'' he said.) He
jury-rigged the taillights (salvaged from different trucks, and not
identical) and grille, and installed roll-up windows. The car
originally had side curtains that snapped into place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is, of course, highly modified,'' said Peterson, the
Packard authority, with considerable understatement. Art James, an
expert in Toronto, had a harsher assessment. ``It will never stand
on its own as a Packard,'' he said. ``It will stand out as a freak
model, which is not all that great.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but around here the car still attracts appreciative
gawks. To begin his ritual spins through town, Chechelashvili
simply twists the crank and pulls the choke. The Packard starts
instantly, rumbling more like a tank than a luxury cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   Chechelashvili suggested that surviving members of the Packard
family might help, out of pride, to restore the car ``as it is in
the pictures.'' It is a measure of his isolation that he learned
only this year that Packard has long been out of business.
Struggling by the mid-1950s, it merged with Studebaker, which last
used the name on some bizarre Studebaker-derived models in 1958.
Studebaker was itself faltering, and it produced its last cars in
Canada in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Summers, a surviving Packard relative by marriage who
helps to administer the family inheritance from his home in Santa
Barbara, Calif., said he recently donated ``a sizeable sum'' for
restorations at the Packard Museum in Warren, Ohio, ``and it's
there that anyone should go for help.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the museum director, Terry Martin, said he had barely enough
money to restore the first Packard built, in 1899. ``I was hoping
you'd say he wanted to find it a home,'' Martin said. ``We accept
vehicles given to the museum. That's a good way of getting them
restored.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, that could happen, Chechelashvili said, but not so
fast. ``I bought this car when I was 20, and I've had it since,''
he said. ``For this, I deserve a reward. If the Packards facilitate
it, and they desire it after I restore it, I'll give it to them.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He paused to add another condition. ``In two or three years,''
he said.

<P>
   My father had two investment caveats _ and I heard them often as
I was growing up: Don't buy mutual funds, and don't touch
principal. I knew that if he ever caught me doing either, I'd be in
big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Dad was a psychologist in private practice. His investing
originally was intended as a way to save for retirement; after all,
unlike his friends in the corporate world, he wouldn't get a
pension. Gradually, however, investing also became his hobby _ and,
at times, his obsession.
</P>
<P>
   My role, beginning when I was about 9 years old, was to check
the newspaper and read aloud the stock prices of the blue-chip
companies in his portfolio, names like AT&AMP;T and General Motors. Dad
happily became his own fund manager, buying and selling his own
stocks instead of letting someone else make the decisions _ an idea
he abhorred. To support his strategy, he directed my brother and me
to use the goods and services of the companies he owned.
</P>
<P>
   Dad took his portfolio very seriously. Proud of his AT&AMP;T shares,
he flaunted the keychain he once received at its annual meeting. On
vacations, when we drove past a telephone booth, he'd check to see
if someone was using his ``store.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, my family always owned GM cars _ Chevrolets when
my brother and I were young and Oldsmobiles and Buicks after Dad
put us through college.
</P>
<P>
   Mom owned stocks, too, and she adopted Dad's caveats
wholeheartedly. But she added a few money-related rules of her own.
Never consent to a joint bank account, she advised, because it can
take away your independence. When it comes to stocks, she said, you
should hold 'em, not trade 'em.
</P>
<P>
   If my brother and I had a favorite stock, it was one of Mom's:
American Chicle _ now Warner Lambert, and still one of my choices.
Every Christmas, it sent her a gift packet of Chiclets, Sen-Sen and
Beemans gum. We'd find them in the toes of our Christmas stockings.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, times have changed greatly since the 1950s, when
there were only handfuls of mutual funds _ and relatively few
sources of advice. So, several years ago, because my parents were
no longer here and my brother was refusing to advise me, fearing
he'd be blamed if my investments sank, I decided to seek counsel
from a financial planner.
</P>
<P>
   When the planner first broached the subject of mutual funds, I
began to hyperventilate. After all, his advice flew in the face of
Dad's: You need mutual funds to diversify your investments, the
planner said. As for principal, he added, it's OK to tap some of
it, as long as it continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, I was a good candidate for investing in mutual funds.
I knew I could never devote the time my father had to investing _
nor did I want to. I didn't even check my stocks' performance every
day _ or every week or month.
</P>
<P>
   I quieted my queasy stomach and thought long and hard about a
new strategy. Finally, I took action: I sent for mutual fund
prospectuses and moved some of my money from individual stocks to
stock and bond funds. I even cashed in some stock, to give myself
something to live on during my upcoming early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Some days, Dad's warnings still ring in my ears. But what he
taught me best was to trust my instincts _ even if those instincts
were to seek advice from someone else. Not only do times change, so
do investment strategies and life plans.
</P>
<P>
   Separately and together, my parents passed on their wisdom as
well as a decent-sized nest egg. For both, I am eternally grateful.
</P>

NOISES OFF: A MUZZLE FOR CELL PHONES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 11)  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID WALLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are places where cellular phones are as
unwelcome as fire ants at a picnic. Just ask Laurence Fishburne.
</P>
<P>
   During a performance of ``The Lion in Winter'' at New York's
Roundabout Theater in early March, Fishburne suddenly stepped out
of character and growlingly upbraided a man in the audience whose
cell phone had been ringing for half a minute. The play resumed
only after a long, loud ovation.
</P>
<P>
   But gentle or ungentle reminders from actors, not to mention
librarians, symphony conductors, maitres d'hotel, and other public
shushers, have so far not succeeded in keeping America's 60
million-odd cell phones (and their owners) from making nuisances of
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, a small company in Israel is offering a
technological fix: a device about the size of a cigar box called
C-Guard Cellular Firewall, which is said to block cell phones
within a hundred-yard radius from sending or receiving calls. It is
a cure that may prove as controversial as the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Netline Technologies Ltd. of Tel Aviv, sells the
Firewall over the Internet for roughly $1,000. The device detects
the activity of any nearby wireless device and emits bursts of
static on the same radio frequency. Cell phones in its area of
influence report ``no service'' or ``signal not available'' to
their owners, and incoming calls do not get through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every medicine has side effects, and so does cellular
service,'' said Netline vice president Gil Israeli, one of the
Firewall's designers and a retired Israeli military officer. ``We
are simply offering a pill that reduces those side effects.''
</P>
<P>
   But irritating chatter and ill-timed rings were not the side
effects that prompted Netline to develop the device; security
lapses were. ``Some years ago, several officers were having a
meeting,'' Israeli recalled. ``One of my colleagues sat on his cell
phone, which pushed the `send' button. He had dialed someone who
listened in. Luckily, it was another officer.''
</P>
<P>
   Unluckily for Netline, cell-phone jamming runs afoul of the
Federal Communications Commission, whose approval is required for
devices that send signals over the air. ``We would not authorize a
device that's intended to deliberately interfere with authorized
radio services,'' said a senior FCC official, speaking on condition
of anonymity. Nonetheless, the official acknowledged that trying to
police Internet sales of the Firewall could prove as difficult as
stopping New Yorkers from jaywalking.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of deliberate dead zones worries the cell phone
industry. ``If one of our members learns that jamming equipment is
in use, the FCC will find out about it in short order,'' said
Geoffrey Nelson, spokesman for the Cellular Telecommunications
Industry Association, who cited the 98,000 emergency 911 calls his
group reckons are made on cell phones daily.
</P>
<P>
   And experts say anyone who installs a C-Guard Cellular Firewall
would be skating on thin legal ice. Under federal law, interfering
with legal over-the-air communication is punishable by fines of up
to $11,000 and a year in prison for each incident.
</P>
<P>
   But Israeli argues that there is a sound defense for his
company's device. ``When cellular operators were awarded a license
to exclusively use frequency bands, no permission was granted to
invade one's private property and disturb the rightful owner,''
Israeli said. ``Just as anyone is entitled to remove a trespasser
who causes damage, an owner is entitled to use C-Guard to protect
himself from nuisance.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli, who asserted that the device had been sold to American
customers but would not name them, said his company did not rule
out challenging the FCC in court. In the meantime, he said, ``We
are optimistic that many enlightened countries will accept C-Guard
as beneficial.'' Last June, the Japanese government said it would
accept applications for licenses to install such devices.
</P>
<P>
   Legal issues aside, restaurants might seem a fertile market for
the Firewall, both because loud phone conversations can ruin the
mood and because of the profits from in-house pay phones. But
restaurateurs are divided on the device's desirability.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Meyer, who owns several Manhattan luxury restaurants,
including the Union Square Cafe and the Gramercy Tavern, loves the
idea of cellular-free dining. ``If I had known about that Firewall
I would have put one in'' when he opened Gramercy Tavern, he said.
``Cell phones have become the cigarettes of the '90s,'' he added,
because of the way users irritate nonusers with them. (It turns out
that cell phones usually don't work in the Gramercy Tavern anyway.)
</P>
<P>
   Karen Waltuck, co-owner of Chanterelle in Manhattan, thinks the
Firewall idea smacks of authoritarianism. ``You don't have to go
the Giuliani route and jam people's phones because one person may
not behave properly,'' she said.

   Which Spouse Wields The Power at Tax Time?
</P>
<P>
   Handling the money used to be a sign of authority in marriages,
but with financial options and couples' work time expanding, the
most powerful partner may now be the one who can talk the other
into the task _ especially at tax time.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by Yankelovich Partners for the Lutheran Brotherhood,
an insurance and financial company in Minneapolis, confirms that
working on income taxes is no one's favorite job. Asked to rate a
list of chores on a scale of loathsomeness, 1,006 American adults
rated tax preparation second-worst, behind window-washing. Even
cleaning basements was preferable.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which interviewed only one person in each household,
found that men and women disliked tax preparation equally.
Nevertheless, both husbands and wives tended to say that they did
more of the work than their partners. Among the 534 respondents who
said they were married, 67 percent of the men said they did most of
the tax work and 20 percent said their wives did. Among married
women, 45 percent said they did the job and only 42 percent said
their husbands did.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, more men seem to be stuck with the job: When the
responses were combined, 54 percent said the husband in the family
did the taxes, and 33 percent said the wife did. Most of the
remainder said the job was shared.

   What Goldilocks learned about choosing a mattress still applies.
Selecting from among all the models, sizes, brands and types is as
complicated as it has ever been _ even when you order on line.
</P>
<P>
   Several mattress retailers that have long sold their kings and
queens in stores and by telephone now have sites on the World Wide
Web. But so far they offer only window-shopping on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   E-mattress, at www.emattress.com, staked out a different kind of
Internet presence in March, , offering consumers the convenience of
selecting, ordering and paying for a mattress online.
</P>
<P>
   But as Goldilocks might note, there is more to shopping for a
mattress than convenience. How about making sure it's not too hard
or too soft?
</P>
<P>
   E-mattress says it is looking into offering an in-home trial
period, but for now the best it can offer is approval on delivery.
(That means Goldilocks could refuse to take the mattress before the
truck drove away.) The more traditional companies have more
traditional guarantees. Dial-a-Mattress, for instance, will let a
consumer exchange a bed within 30 days, and the same deal is
offered for 60 days by Sleepy's _ plenty of time, presumably, to
make sure the mattress really is just right.

   Work Less. Get a Promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Working less than full-time need not mean leaving the fast
track, according to a two-year study by researchers at Purdue
University in West Lafayette, Ind., and McGill University in
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   The study followed 87 corporate professionals and managers, many
of them women, in 45 American and Canadian companies, who chose to
scale back work by an average of 18 hours a week, at salary
reductions of 20 to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new schedules made 91 percent of the workers happier with
the balance between work and home, and 70 percent of their
supervisors said they supported the change. Thirty-five percent of
the workers were promoted after reducing their work time.

(jt) 
 By RACHEL LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's a Saturday evening in the East Village, and the
streets are pulsing with bar-hopping young people. But Candace
Walsh and her posse of girlfriends _ most of them artists and
writers in their 20s and 30s, mostly single _ have gathered in her
one-bedroom apartment for Beauty Parlor Night.
</P>
<P>
   The coffee table is scattered with powder puffs, nail files and
hot-pink Hard Candy nail polish. A mix tape of '80s pop songs
blasts in the background, as Shelby Gates, a freelance
photographer, describes how a police officer recently ejected her
from a subway station for conducting a photo shoot without a
permit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that annoying,'' she says, smearing a mask of
moisterizing lotion on the face of Tiffany Licorish, a production
artist at an advertizing agency.
</P>
<P>
   The talk ricochets from bad bosses to recent books to body hair.
Although the monthly Beauty Parlor Nights are distant descendants
of consciousness-raising groups, Ms. Walsh, a writer, drew on an
altogether different inspiration when organizing the gatherings:
the slumber parties of her adolescence. Surveying the roomful of
wet toe nails and masked faces, someone asks skeptically, ``Has
feminism taught us anything?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' replies Barbara Stone, a make-up artist who works for
Bobbi Brown. ``It's taught us to take care of ourselves. It's the
new `Our Bodies Ourselves.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Part career and romance support group, part retro coffee klatch,
a new genre of women's group has been emerging, one that emphasizes
the role of gossip and ``girl talk'' as much as weightier subjects
in the life of the '90s woman. The gatherings draw from such
post-feminist touchstones as ``The View,'' the all-woman daytime
talk show with Barbara Walters that mixes serious news with
off-color sex chat, and ``Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,''
the best-selling novel that tells of a 40-year-old career woman who
longs for the female friendships that her mother enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   The new groups meet in Brooklyn lofts and at the Cosmos Club in
Washington, a bastion of inside-the-Beltway power. Not all meet in
person. Web-based women's communities have sprung up like iVillage
and Chickclick, where recent discussion topics included Madeline
Albright and one titled ``Underwear: granny style, bikini or
thong?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I live in an all-men's world so I never get to do girl talk,''
said Dr. Florence Haseltine, 56, the director of the Center for
Population Research, who started the monthly Cosmos Club dinners
for high-ranking women in the Clinton administration in 1992. ``In
a group with men, women tend to feel they have to talk about more
weighty topics. But one of the biggest weighty topics is that women
in Washington don't gossip enough. What I mean is exchange
information about the unwritten rules and about who you can and
cannot trust.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Divine Secrets of The Ya Ya Sisterhood'' by Rebecca Wells has
inspired close to 35 Ya-Ya groups across the country, patterned on
the sisterhood portrayed in the 1996 novel, which has more than two
million copies in print.
</P>
<P>
   Leighanne Bramlett, 26, an aspiring actress from Louisiana who
moved to New York a year ago, formed a Ya-Ya group with two other
New Yorkers she met through a Web site devoted to the book. ``New
York is so cutthroat, and there are so many distractions,'' Ms.
Bramlett said. ``It's hard to establish the level of friendship
that you had with girls when you were a kid. Our group is about
unconditional friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   A nostalgia for the bonding and values of early and
pre-adolescence, when girls have been shown by some studies to
exhibit self-confidence they later loose, flavors many of the new
women's groups. It is the same sensibility that spawned the ``girl
power'' slogan of the Spice Girls and post-feminist zines like

order,'' it calls itself), all of whose Web sites are linked to
ChickClick.

<P>
   Nikol Lore, 28, the editor in chief of Smile and Act Nice, is
planning a group of women's slumber parties around the country this
summer that will be connected through her Web site. ``It's an
educated return to those girly gatherings of our adolescence'' she
said. ``As we get older, women get away from that kind of
bonding.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Abby Weintraub, 28, a book jacket designer at Random
House and a graduate of Brown University, has been hosting a
regular Ladies Night at her apartment in the West Village for the
past two years. ``In college, we were together all the time in
groups, but now that we're older and more people are pairing up, so
it's important to set aside a time to be alone with the girls,''
Ms. Weintraub said.
</P>
<P>
   And recently Belinda Miller, 33, a deejay at WFMU radio in New
Jersey, organized an all-women clothing swap for 40 friends at
Maxwells in Hoboken. She plans to make it a yearly tradition.
``It's not that we want to be our grandmothers and go back to
single-sex activities,'' Ms. Miller said. ``It's just that it's
important to be with the girls and talk about goofy stuff and walk
around in your bra and underwear.''

   Claiming a right to such indulgences without being accused of
being reactionary is a typical stance in this post-feminist moment.
The agenda of the new groups is a mix of the everyday and the
frivolous _ parenting advice and beauty tips _ but almost never the
political. ``It's used to be about getting angry, now it's much
more practical,'' says Nancy Evans, the editor in chief of
iVillage, a popular Web site for women that recently sold stock to
the public for the first time and saw its founders become paper
millionaires. ``Women don't have time to gab at the beauty parlor
anymore and they can't meet over the backyard fence because the
person on the other side is at work,'' Ms. Evans added.
</P>
<P>
   Marla Walker, 30, a children's television producer, and Caroline
Schutz, also 30, a musician, have convened the Williamsburg Ladies
Club in Brooklyn for two and one-half years. They chose their
old-fashioned name to distance themselves from doctrinaire
feminists who spell ``women'' with a ``y.'' They insist they are
not a consciousness-raising group. ``Our consciousness is already
raised,'' Ms. Schutz, a graduate of the Spence School and Oberlin
College, said. ``We know there is still inequality, but this is
more about just being with each other alone.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Williamsburg Ladies Club _ five of whose
members met recently for conversation that ranged from Monica
Lewinsky to venereal diseases to foot ailments _ insists it is not
just a modern-day canasta club or tea party. ``If you asked any of
us if we were feminists we would all say yes, but we would just
never call it a group with a women's agenda,'' Ms. Schutz said.
``Of course we do talk about important women's issues such as
trading health information. We're much more connected to
consciousness raising groups than we are to Tupperware parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walker said: ``Now that we have our jobs and our freedom to
do anything, we're learning that it's impossible to have it all. So
talking among ourselves is a way of choosing other roles. There's a
certain amount of intimacy in our girl time that let's you talk
about anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl'' and ``girl talk'' are still loaded phrases for many
women, of course, especially those over 35 who remember the
demeaning use of the words in the past. Feminists of the '60s and
'70s campaigned to banish ``girl'' as a term for adult women. But
many younger women embrace it and its constellation of associations
_ from the power of women's sexuality to dominate men through
history, as argued by Camille Paglia, to the warm and fuzzy
memories of girlhood friendships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl-talk is a way of measuring your own experience. It's
about letting your hair down in a place where you're not taking on
a role as a worker or a wife or a mother,'' said Peggy Orenstein,
the author of the 1994 book ``School Girls: Young Women, Self
Esteem and the Confidence Gap.'' Last year she began interviewing
small groups of women for a book about women's life choices from
their mid-20s to mid-40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw in these groups that women have a yearning to connect
with other women,'' she said. ``And whether women believe it or
not, girl talk is also inherently political, and inherently
subversive because historically there's been so little value placed
on what t means to be a caretaker, or a wife or a female worker.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether as inspiration or mirror of a trend already underway,
``The View'' with five women hosts of different generations has
built a strong following. The show was inspired by an early-1960s
news show called ``Girl Talk'' starring Virginia Graham. ``The
show's format is somewhat old-fashioned,'' Bill Geddie, a
co-executive producer, said. ``But I think it's a sign that women
have come full circle. Now that women have proved that they can
hold their own in a man's world, it's safe and there is a need to
have a show where women act like women. It's okay to use the word
`girl-talk' again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's is a sign of progress that women can do a serious story
about women in Afghanistan and then talk about nail polish in the
same show,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Five or 10 years ago, the format might have made serious
newswomen worry about appearing too frivolous. But now even Barbara
Walters lets her hair down with ``the girls.'' The day before she
interviewed Monica Lewinsky for ``20/20,'' Ms. Walters' ``View''
co-host Meredith Vieira handed out thongs to the other women on the
show. Ms. Walters placed hers on her head. ``Does it have a look?''
she joked.
</P>
<P>
   Even traditional feminists are embracing the shift. For a brunch
to celebrate the relaunch of Ms. magazine under new ownership
Monday, an invitation asks women to gather to discuss ``money,
power, liberty, politics, facts 'n' facelifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Steinem, Ms.'s founder, maintains that '70s-era women's
groups had plenty in common with today's. ``The early
consciousness-raising groups were fun and full of jokes and bawdy
and crazy and serious,'' she said. ``They were everything. But
every generation deserves a language of their own.''

DESPITE DIVORCE, IN VITRO DAD NOT JUST SPERM DONOR, COURT SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A husband who donates sperm for the in vitro
fertilization of his wife's eggs is the legal father of the
resulting child even if the embryo is implanted after divorce, a
state appeals court ruled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In what could be a groundbreaking decision, the 1st Court of
Appeals upheld a March 1998 ruling by Harris County Family Law
Judge Don Ritter granting Don McGill of Houston parental rights to
Grace McGill, born in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this was a wonderful victory, it's a fair and
appropriate decision,'' said McGill, 64, who owns Toyota, Porsche
and Audi dealerships in the Houston area.
</P>
<P>
   His ex-wife, Mildred Schmit, 44, said from her home in
Lexington, Miss., that she was ``horribly disappointed'' and did
not know if she would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don McGill is the one with all the money, I've had to borrow
money to go as far as I've gone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel of the appellate court unanimously agreed
that there were no laws or court decisions addressing the legal
issues in the case, and invited ``the Texas Legislature to enact
legislation deciding the rights of parties involved in the in vitro
fertilization process.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Grace was conceived through in vitro fertilization in
1994, when the parents were still married, the embryo was frozen
and implanted three months after they divorced in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Schmit claims she had the embryo implanted because McGill
promised he would not seek parental rights. She said their 20-year
marriage was miserable and she did not want him to be the father.
</P>
<P>
   Her attorney, Earle Lilly, has argued that because the embryo
was implanted after the divorce and McGill agreed not to seek
parental rights, he was no longer the father, but the sperm donor.
</P>
<P>
   But McGill claims he only allowed Schmit to undergo the implant
on the condition he would be the father. He claims Schmit agreed to
that but changed her mind one month after Grace was born because he
became engaged to another woman.
</P>
<P>
   When the couple divorced, they had no written agreement on the
disposition of the four frozen embryos remaining from the 1994
fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   This decade there have been two highly publicized cases, in
Tennessee and New York, involving divorced couples who had produced
embryos in vitro. In both cases, the women wanted to have an embryo
implanted after the divorce, but the men said they had the right to
veto it because they did not want to be fathers if they were not
married.
</P>
<P>
   The highest courts in both states prevented the women from
acting without their ex-husbands' permission. In both decisions,
the embryos were considered property, not children.
</P>
<P>
   But this case is the only known instance in which an embryo
produced by a married couple was actually successfully implanted
after a divorce without a written agreement on parental rights.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, a jury granted Schmit primary custody of Grace and
gave McGill weekend and holiday visitation rights. He said he ``can
only hope'' that Schmit gives up her legal fight.
</P>
<P>
   Schmit had asked the appellate court to award her $320,000 in
legal costs she has incurred so far. The appellate court denied the
request.
</P>
<P>
   McGill's attorney, Roy W. Moore. said that if Schmit appeals he
expects the Texas Supreme Court to uphold the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court's decision did not allow a mother to bastardize a
child,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said Schmit had testified she believes childbirth begins
at conception, but ``she changes her story to suit what she
wants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad, sad situation she puts her interests before the
little girl's,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schmit said she wanted to raise the child without McGill because
he was not a good husband or father to their three other children.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going back to the 18th century to say I'm bastardizing a
child,'' she said. ``If Rosie O'Donnell or Madonna raise a child by
themselves, do people call it bastardizing?''
</P>
<P>
   Her attorney, Lilly, said if the decision stands it will set a
dangerous precedent, turning back the clock on artificial
conception laws designed to protect parents and donors.
</P>
<P>
   He said the ruling ``should put fear in prospective donors''
that they could be forced to take on parental responsibilities.
Women who do not want sperm donors to share parentage may risk
losing their rights to be the sole parent, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lilly had argued that since there were no laws to address such a
situation, the court should have looked at the rights of donors in
Texas' artificial insemination statute, which says the contractual
agreement between the donor and the mother determines parental
rights. He said a jury should have decided in this case whether
there was a binding oral contract determining parentage.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court took ``a narrow reading'' of the statute,
saying the artificial insemination statue could not be applied to
in vitro fertilization, Lilly said. In artificial insemination,
sperm is injected directly into a woman's uterus.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court said since there are no laws addressing such
circumstances, it had to rely on general paternity laws. Because
McGill was listed as the father on the birth certificate, the court
said he is the legal parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed,'' Lilly said. ``The court didn't deal
with the issue other than taking the technical position that there
is no specific statute.''
</P>
<P>
   Pamela George, an attorney who helped with McGill's appellate
briefs, said, ``the court can't take a specific statute and expand
it to fit all circumstances.''

NEW YORKERS KEEP JAYWALKING AS CRACKDOWN FADES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Eighth Avenue, during afternoon rush hour, they
stride four abreast in traffic lanes as if marching in a parade,
then cross en masse on the diagonal, mid-block, to stream into the
Port Authority Bus Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Jaywalkers, declared an endangered species in January 1998 as
part of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's quality of life campaign, seem to
be thriving. On the Avenue of the Americas at 50th Street, home of
the infamous pedestrian barricades, a police officer stationed at
the corner one afternoon this week simply advised people crossing
outside the crosswalk to be careful.
</P>
<P>
   And on Lexington Avenue, a jay-jogger (jay-runner?) scooted
between the cars to get across. It's enough to make that
proverbially jaded New Yorker think that the mayor's crackdown
isn't all it was cracked up to be. But take a closer look. Check
the facts: The New York Police Department issued 99 jaywalking
tickets last year.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds like a lot, think about how many times a day you
cross against the light. Now multiply by 7 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we can tell, there never was a jaywalking crackdown
_ it never started and it never stopped,'' said John Kaehny,
executive director of Transportation Alternatives, a pedestrian
advocacy group that takes such things pretty seriously. ``It was
much more a rhetorical crackdown than an actual crackdown.''
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani revived his civility campaign this week with a
push for police politeness, it seemed an apt moment to check up on
what has happened in the 15 months since the mayor hiked the fines
for jaywalking tickets from $2 to $50 and suggested that officers
start writing them.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Police Department wavered between saying the
anti-jaywalking initiative was over and that there never was an
anti-jaywalking initiative. The president of the police officers'
union said he had forgotten all about the crackdown. At 346
Broadway, where the few jaywalkers who have been nailed come to
appear before a judge and pay their fines, the clerks said they
have not noticed any spike in errant pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   In midtown Manhattan, illegal walkers by the dozen said they had
seen no change in behavior by pedestrians or the police since the
supposed crackdown began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen a cop give anyone a ticket, nor have I ever
heard of a cop giving anyone a ticket,'' said Alan Pollack, a
lawyer who lives on the Upper East Side and was a little sheepish
after having crossed Lexington Avenue practically halfway between
the two corners. ``But I think it's the right thing to do, because
it's intended to protect pedestrians. Sometimes, pedestrians need
to be protected from themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, jaywalking is illegal, a clear violation of the
city's traffic rules. That means no crossing in front of oncoming
vehicles, no crossing mid-block, no crossing against the light, no
crossing anytime it says, well, ``Don't Walk.'' But, after all,
this is New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is New York, we do things in a New York minute,'' said
Debbi Robinson, 34, as she strode up Lexington, crossing against
the light at 49th Street, then again on 50th, and again on 51st.
``We've got places to go, things to do. We don't pay attention to
the lights.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Macluso, 26, who lives in Greenwich, Conn., but jaywalks
daily to get to his hotel-industry job, actually has gotten a
ticket. In Milwaukee. He paid his $50 fine, came home, and _ except
while on vacation _ kept on jaywalking.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The ecology of New York is based on ignoring arbitrary
rules,'' explained Mitchell Moss, director of the Taub Urban
Research Center at New York University. ``Jaywalking isn't an
ailment to people; it's a coping mechanism. Penalizing jaywalkers
is the equivalent of imposing martial law. The police are too smart
to start arresting jaywalkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunny Mindel, Giuliani's press secretary, and Marilyn Mode, the
Police Department's top voice, said the point of the crackdown had
never been to write a lot of jaywalking tickets. Rather, they said,
it was a broad-based initiative to make the streets safer through
stricter enforcement of all the city's traffic laws.
</P>
<P>
   And they have pronounced it a success, noting that pedestrian
deaths were down to 193 last year, from 277 in 1997, and have
continued to fall, with just 35 in the first three months of this
year, compared with 51 during the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue here is safety,'' Ms. Mode said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a decline in pedestrians being killed _ that would
lead me to believe that people are being more cautious,'' Ms.
Mindel said. ``To focus on the violations is a mistake.''

BACHELOR PARTIES TO MAKE A SATYR WEEP 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., April 11) 
(jt) 
 By RICK MARIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In every man's life there comes a time when he must
ask himself, On a scale of Alan Alda to Maxim magazine, where do I
fall? His bachelor party is one of those times.
</P>
<P>
   Some men choose the traditional evening of red meat, alcohol
poisoning, verbal abuse and silicone-enhanced strippers. Others opt
for revelry that is more ... how shall we say? ... evolved.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a bunch of bankers will arrive in New York from
Wilmington, Del., to re-enact this rite of manly passage. Their
first stop: the Dorit Baxter day spa at 47 West 57th St. Here, the
20 men, all in their late 30s and early 40s, will indulge in an
afternoon of facials, pedicures, massages, salt scrubs and algae
wraps. You know, just one of those fabulous ``me'' days after a
stressful, pore-clogging day at the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all going to wear white robes and slippers and hang
around and chat between appointments in the reception area,'' said
the spa's owner, Dorit Baxter. ``It will be really a great event.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be such a thing as  &UR; too &LR;  evolved. Is an afternoon at
the beauty parlor any way for men to send off their fellow men from
singledom into ball-and-chaindom? Apparently, yes. In fact, it's
just one of the many new toxin-free, smutless forms of bachelor
recreation. Golf weekends, paint ball, laser tag, fly-fishing,
barbecues with the parents and civilized evenings of oenophilia
devoid of pornophilia haven't totally replaced old-school triple-X
entertainment. But they're gaining.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Beeman, a partner in a New York law firm, was the guest
of honor at a two-day bachelor marathon in New York in September.
The highlights: an epicurean tour of the Fulton Fish Market, pate
at Petrossian, a few spirited games of court tennis at the Racquet
Club, a sail around Manhattan for which all the men donned black
tie and dinner at the Four Seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a frat house,'' said Beeman, 37. ``No cigarette
butts in beers. No vomiting.'' And needless to say, no strippers.
Beeman was subjected to some ``lighthearted ribbing'' during
dinner, he said. ``But there weren't any vulgar references to the
more embarrassing parts of our lives. The tone was elegant and
fun.'' The theme of the toasts was promarriage.
</P>
<P>
   The whole point of a bachelor party used to be to lament the
bridegroom's final night of freedom, his last shot at
nondivorceable infidelity. But at his bachelor dinner last year,
Robert Boynton, a magazine writer, toasted Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
for cleaning up the city's strip joints. Thanks to the crackdown,
Boynton explained, his buddies couldn't drag him out for a seedy
night of liquor and lap dances.
</P>
<P>
   An invitation via E-mail to New York friends of a Boston police
officer included the following stipulation: ``Jesse has made it
clear that he does not want any hired talent, and has very little
interest in going to see any talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, a bridegroom may not want a booze-up with hired talent
handcuffing him to his chair. But his friends often do. As much as
it purports to be a celebration of the poor sap who's getting
hitched, the bachelor party is a sanctioned excuse for the sap's
pals to carouse _ the single ones, and the marrieds paroled for the
night from their wives and children. They often end up feeling
burned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a married man, I don't get that many chances to see
naked women other than my wife,'' said David Eddie, a novelist who
flew in from Toronto for the Beeman weekend. ``So I guess I felt
like that would have been an opportunity.'' Although he enjoyed the
pate, the first-growths and all the clubby perks, he felt that
something was lacking. ``My thought was, There's only so much
happiness you can take in through your mouth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And only so much ribaldry you can get away with in an atmosphere
of polite decorum. Roasts ridiculing the bridegroom and maligning
the bride's virtue are out at these wholesome gatherings.
Earnestness is in. Chris Calhoun, a literary agent who attended
Boynton's dinner, complained that the toasts ``sounded like a
Chamber of Commerce meeting.'' This was in stark contrast to
another bachelor bash a few years ago attended by virtually the
same circle of New York publishing types. ``I did a Carnac act,''
Calhoun said. ``I almost got my throat cut, we were saying such
horrible things.'' The bridegroom at that party had greeted his
guests naked. But Boynton said that after his party, ``I was in bed
by midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   An aversion to strip clubs is the reason many bridegrooms would
prefer their parties to be G-rated rather than G-strung. ``It
seemed like something out of a bad teen-age sex comedy,'' said
Philip Baltz, a New York publicity agent. To him, going somewhere
like Billy's Topless seemed too embarrassing or cliched. His
bachelor dinner at the Cub Room in SoHo was described by one guest
(who asked to remain nameless) as ``the tamest night of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Morrison, editor in chief of Modern Bride, attributed the
trend toward tameness to ``the demystification of stripper
culture.'' She said she knew one bride who gave her husband-to-be
vouchers for a strip club in Queens. That pretty much killed the
fun of it for the bridegroom, Ms. Morrison said, and he refused to
go. It's not exactly transgression if your fiancee gives her
permission.
</P>
<P>
   Couples are also more mature. A 1997 Roper study found that the
age of the average bridegroom had risen to 27.5 from 23 over the
previous 15 years, and of the average bride, to 26 from 21. ``This
generation is taking marriage very seriously,'' Ms. Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Mike Souter, a British magazine editor, will arrive
in New York to take the helm at Maxim, the monthly bible of bad
male behavior. He sounded appalled by the squeaky-clean bachelor
parties in this country. ``Men bond better when they're blind
drunk, I always find,'' he shouted into the phone. ``You can't bond
with another guy in a dressing gown, getting your nails done.''
</P>
<P>
   There are various interpretations of the old-school bachelor
debauch:
</P>
<P>
   _It's just a cheap sleaze rush.
</P>
<P>
   _Flushing out wanderlust is a necessary catharsis before a man
assumes the responsibilities of monogamous married life.
</P>
<P>
   _The raunchier the party, the more a man is ready to quit the
bachelor life. But this argument, acting in a manner one's future
wife would find appropriate, even commendable, may defeat the
purpose of the event.
</P>
<P>
   See, for instance, a movie called ``The Bachelor Party'' _ not
the 1984 Tom Hanks thing, but a dark 1957 drama written by Paddy
Chayefsky. A young newlywed played by Don Murray has just found out
that his wife is pregnant. Feeling boxed in by work, night school
and their tight budget, this is the last news he needs. That night,
he goes on a bachelor bender. The shy guy in the group is tying the
knot, with a woman he barely knows. The office playboy, played by
Jack Warden, with a black book full of hot ``broads,'' leads the
boys on a steamy summer night of burlesque shows, stag films and a
wild party in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the guys drop out, until just Murray's and Warden's
characters are left. Warden, drunk and pathetically lonely, begs
him to stay out. But Murray, after a flirtation with a
nymphomaniacal beatnik, has seen enough. By daybreak, the bachelor
party has made him realize he  &UR; wants &LR;  to go home, to his pregnant
wife and their cramped apartment in Stuyvesant Town.
</P>
<P>
   Some wisdom, it seems, a guy can't get from a pedicure and a
glass of chardonnay.

TEXANS PITCH IN TO HELP ALBANIAN REFUGEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Ragan is among a group of Texans who see the Kosovo crisis
as more than a gruesome headline.
</P>
<P>
   He is interrupting his life to help Muslim refugees fleeing into
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those God things,'' he said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Ragan, a Wichita Falls native, is one of 12 Texans who will
travel to Albania next week to assist in purifying water,
distributing food and providing medical aid in the refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still can't believe I'm going,'' said Ragan, a ministerial
student at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Watching television in his dorm room, Ragan saw the fleeing
refugees, many carrying babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart was breaking for those people,'' he said. ``I began
praying, asking God how I could help. I never thought of going over
there, though.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Ragan learned that Texas Baptist Men, a Southern
Baptist group that often helps in disasters, had been asked to set
up refugee camps in Korce and Peshkopi, Albania.
</P>
<P>
   He asked how he could help, and was invited to go.
</P>
<P>
   The team plans to leave Wednesday from Dallas/Fort Worth Airport
and to spend two weeks in Albania, said Jim Furgerson, executive
director of Texas Baptist Men.
</P>
<P>
   Ragan, who spent three years in Ukraine working as a missionary,
said he wants to help the refugees to show that Christians care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here are these Muslims being run out of the country by
Orthodox Christians,'' he said. ``I don't think that is showing the
love of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO began the current bombing campaign to try to stop
Yugoslavia's President Slobodan Milosevic from having thousands of
Muslim ethnic Albanians killed or ousted from the small province.
As many as 500,000 have fled their homes.
</P>
<P>
   All major religious groups _ including Jewish, Muslim, Catholic
and Protestant benevolent groups _ are collecting money to help
refugees. Many are also organizing volunteer teams.
</P>
<P>
   Another Texas organization giving direct aid to refugees is
Mission Possible, a Denton-based group that has had a staff of six
in Tirania, Albania, for six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually we focus on distributing Bibles, but now everything
has been dropped to help the refugees,'' said Jim Mann of Denton,
an official of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Another Texan scheduled to go on the trip to Albania with Texas
Baptist Men is Robert Mann of Arlington, a pediatrician and trustee
of Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Mann was part of a Texas Baptist team providing medical aid in
the Kurdish refugee camps of Turkey and Iraq in the aftermath of
Operation Desert Storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what you are getting into,'' he said this week.
``When I was in Iraq we found (that) many refugees were so
dehydrated that we immediately began giving IVs.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann said he expects that many refugees in Albania who have been
living in squalid conditions will be suffering from respiratory and
skin problems.
</P>
<P>
   Also a part of the Baptist team will be Mann's son, Brad Mann,
who is taking time off from graduate studies to work with Mission
Arlington, a ministry of the First Baptist Church of Arlington that
gives food, clothing and other assistance to the needy.
</P>
<P>
   People of faith are drawn to helping people whether at home or
abroad, said Tillie Burgin, a former foreign missionary who founded
Mission Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Burgin mentioned the biblical command in Matthew 25, when Jesus
tells his followers to feed the hungry and thirsty, take in
strangers, visit those in prison, provide clothes for the needy and
give care to those who are sick.
</P>
<P>
   It's kind of a God thing.

CAN MICHAEL MOORE AND BRAVO FIND HAPPINESS _ AND VIEWERS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Moore is a pest, plain and simple. Anyone who has ever
dealt with him understands this, considering it either a compliment
or a complaint, depending on the side of the fence from which he's
eyeballing you.
</P>
<P>
   If you've seen his classic ``Roger &AMP; Me,'' which shook the
publicity foundation of General Motors, the short-lived ``TV
Nation,'' or any of his many interviews, it's clear that you want
him for you and not against you. The defiant Moore isn't a
journalist as much as a pit bull camouflaged in droopy jeans and
dirty sneakers. He latches on, refusing to let go until you yell
``uncle.''
</P>
<P>
   That's never more evident than in the premiere episode of yet
another series of gotcha exposes on corporate greed and the little
people it often tramples in the name of profits.
</P>
<P>
   Bravo is hoping the 12 episodes of ``The Awful Truth,''
beginning at 8 p.m. CDT Sunday on the arts channel, are the right
vehicle for Moore. But is Moore the right vehicle for Bravo?
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Roger &AMP; Me,'' with which Moore will forever be linked,
the film provocateur has bounced around in search of a place to do
what he does best. Moore needs flexibility and autonomy. He needs
the support of those who feel that our health care system is sleazy
and our big corporations cold-hearted. And his thing is to expose
them with both facts and fun _ ``60 Minutes'' with a laugh track.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Moore's ``TV Nation'' aired briefly on NBC and later
on Fox. The series never built much of a fan base and was kicked
around the Fox schedule in 1994 and part of 1995. Moore has said
publicly that network censors chained him, the result being that
viewers expecting his irreverent style thought he'd gone soft. It's
a no-brainer that Moore would prefer the sizable viewership of
broadcast networks. But just as clear is the trade-off, that
networks would never go for anything that stings the advertisers
who pay the bills.
</P>
<P>
   What Bravo wants out of this marriage is a popular series giving
it reason to air more original programming and decrease its
dependence on films. The arts channel originated as a kind of
obscure supplier of fine arts like dance, opera, Broadway plays and
art films.
</P>
<P>
   But series like ``Inside the Actors Studio,'' where artists
explain their craft in uninterrupted detail, have attracted a
different viewer _ younger, inclined to at least occasionally watch
``E!.'' Moore falls within this new strategy, bringing with him
another segment Bravo often misses: the working class. But how will
Bravo's older audience take Moore's constant challenge of
authority?
</P>
<P>
   With due respect to the arts channel, you get the feeling that
this is one of the last places Moore can attempt his type of
guerrilla filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's cinema verite style is common to Bravo viewers, but his
ambush-style, in-your-face tactics are another matter. Take the
second segment in the two-story ``The Awful Truth,'' which involves
the plight of Christopher Donahue, a Florida man with a
life-threatening pancreatic illness. A transplant would save his
life but his health-care provider, the billion-dollar Humana, won't
pay for the operation.
</P>
<P>
   So what does Moore do? After explaining the situation to
viewers, showing refusal letters from Humana and even a close-up of
Donahue sobbing at the thought of leaving his 4-year-old daughter
fatherless, they show Donahue at his hometown Palm Beach Post
newspaper, listing his own obituary.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper staff member looks dumbfounded but takes it down,
word for word, as Donahue lists ``lack of quality care from his
HMO'' as cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Moore and Donahue travel to the corporate offices of the
insurance giant in Louisville, Ky., where Moore and his cronies
stage a mock funeral as company employees look on in shocked horror
and a bit of amusement.
</P>
<P>
   There's a casket brought in and taken out by a hearse, and some
eulogizing, mostly by Moore, with Donahue standing next to him,
adding bits and pieces of information about the life he's about to
lose.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Moore is at his pesky best when testing the patience of
a Humana public-relations type, who meets with Moore and Donahue.
Aware of the camera and probably of Moore's reputation for getting
spokesfolk to humiliate themselves and thus their companies on
camera, he is obviously peeved but amazingly restrained in showing
them both the door.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the segment is quite effective, as is the previous
story, in which Moore stages a witch hunt on the lawn of
independent prosecutor Ken Starr's home and in the corridors of
Congress with Bible-toting Puritans. At one point, he strolls into
U.S. Rep. Henry Hyde's office to ask, ``Isn't Henry Hyde an
adulterer?''
</P>
<P>
   A future segment includes Moore traveling with a group of
homosexual men in a recreational vehicle he calls ``the
sodomobile'' into states where sodomy is outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   Another brings a group of Christmas carolers to the headquarters
of a tobacco company. As tobacco executives look on, they quickly
learn that all are lung cancer victims singing with croaky
artificial voice boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Moore say he's nothing more than a comedian with a
camera crew, that he merely tricks his subjects into talking,
refuses to let them speak their mind and conveniently leaves out
the other side. (Moore says it's his nonthreatening manner that
makes people open up.)
</P>
<P>
   In ``Awful Truth,'' Moore does fancy himself as a stand-up
jokester. Before introducing segments, he stands before a live
crowd dishing on politics.
</P>
<P>
   Moore calls those who follow him ``The People's Democratic
Republic of Television,'' and insists at the end of tonight's show,
``We need to take on one of these guys every week.''
</P>
<P>
   How great that will be. But will anyone notice?
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere this week:
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Moon'' (8 p.m. CDT Sunday, CBS) _ This story about
longtime lovers (Sharon Lawrence and Jeffrey Nordling) struggling
with a marriage, a daughter's severe hearing impairment and other
pressures turns out sweet and a little more high-minded than the
usual made-for-TV fare. Always nice to see Lawrence tussle with
emotions. This also represents the late Richard Kiley's final role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love Letters'' (8 p.m. CDT Monday, ABC) _ A sort of jolting
made-for-TV adaptation of the enduring play about a lifelong
bittersweet relationship, told in letters read by two actors, Laura
Linney and Steven Weber. A.R. Gurney's work has been performed on
stage by dozens of pairs of noted actors _ more than 60 in Los
Angeles alone. Filmmaker Stanley Donen directed this version, and
most of it works. Kirsten Storms and Tim Redwine portray the couple
as teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear America: Dreams in the Golden Country'' (6:30 p.m. CDT
Tuesday, HBO) _ A 12-year-old Russian immigrant (Nathalie Vansier)
struggles with her family to adjust to a new life on New York's
Lower East Side during the early 1900s. This is the second in a
terrific series of family specials about heroic young women from
different cultures and times. Great stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scared Straight! 20 Years Later'' (7 p.m. CDT Thursday, UPN) _
Twenty years ago, producer Arnold Shapiro's landmark documentary
``Scared Straight!'' brought youthful offenders face-to-face with
inmates as part of a special program at New Jersey's Rahway State
Prison. Shapiro revisits the offenders and convicts to see what
impact the meetings had on their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homicide: Life on the Street'' (9 p.m. CDT Friday, NBC) _
Here's another chance to see that ``Subway'' episode, which is
among the highlights of Andre Braugher's amazing work on this
low-rated but respected drama. Even if you've seen this 1997
episode a few times, see it again.

 &HT;    Ground troops: America must prepare to take the next step
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though we're willing to kill for Kosovo, we're not willing to
die for it. The Serbs, on the other hand, are willing to do both.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the core of our problem.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's air campaign in Kosovo has undoubtedly had an impact. It
has forced the Serbs to disperse their troops, hide their armor and
artillery and perhaps now to use kidnapped Albanian civilians as
human shields. There are also signs that the bombing campaign is
beginning to drive home the seriousness of the situation to the
Serb public.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Serbs' sole advantage in this conflict _ NATO's
unwillingness to risk casualties _ has given NATO an even greater
handicap. The hard truth is, you can't fight a war without
fighting, and slowly, reluctantly, the American public and their
leaders seem to be coming to that conclusion. The gravity of the
humanitarian crisis in Kosovo, the brutality of the Serb attacks on
civilians and the inability of NATO air power to stop the killing
on the ground have begun to change the thinking on use of U.S.
ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   After all, there's an inherent absurdity in our current
strategy. We're trying to stop a coldblooded killer by
compassionate means. Last week, before we launched cruise missiles
at two government buildings in Belgrade, we were so polite that we
made sure they had been emptied of personnel, even though they
served as headquarters for the police units conducting ethnic
cleansing in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   By the time we attacked _ in the middle of the night, as further
assurance that no one would be hurt _ the buildings had become
empty symbols. Our attack became an empty symbol as well, with no
real impact.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, President Clinton has refused to even consider the
option of ground troops. But events may soon force him to. Serb
President Slobodan Milosevic has succeeded now in much of his
original aim, having emptied the Kosovar cities and countryside of
much of the Albanian population. He's ready to talk terms, and
NATO's refusal to consider ground troops gives it little ability to
alter the facts that Milosevic has created. On the other hand, an
announcement by Clinton that he had ordered the mobilization of
troops for use if necessary would greatly alter Serbian confidence
in their military situation.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, the troops would not have to be used in
combat. During the several weeks it would take to mobilize and
deploy them, continued bombing will have further degraded Serbian
military capacity and civilian willpower, and the threat of fresh
Western troops should prove decisive. And once a peace agreement is
reached, the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have fled
Serbian atrocities will not return to Kosovo without real assurance
of their safety, and it would be immoral to force them to do so. A
significant commitment of troops will be necessary to restore
Kosovar confidence.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if the mere threat of NATO troops is not
enough to force Milosevic to negotiate seriously, ground combat may
eventually be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   That's a sobering thought, but having begun this fight we have
no choice but to finish it. And as bad as the humanitarian
situation is right now, things have the potential to get much
uglier in the days ahead. To remain totally unprepared to intercede
is simply wrong. We have taken on a responsibility for the lives of
many thousands, and we have to fulfill it.

RATING LATEST MODELS OF SCANNERS, PRINTERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Finding a scanner or printer that hooked up to a newer
personal computer's Universal Serial Bus was a real challenge a
year ago. Users who understood that USB is a much faster connection
were left with an empty sense of longing.
</P>
<P>
   Today, USB devices are coming into their own and are much easier
to find. Most USB printers will allow you to connect to either a
traditional parallel port or the USB port, while most USB scanners
limit you to that type of connection.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at products from Epson America and Hewlett-Packard
_ two USB printers and two USB scanners.
</P>
<P>
   __ DeskJet 882C Printer _ $299, Hewlett-Packard. In the past,
I've not been overly fond of HP's color inkjet printers. They were
a little slow, the colors were not quite as bright as I like and
they went through ink cartridges too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   My, how things have improved. This new DeskJet printer is fast,
with gorgeous colors and _ so far _ I've not had to replace the
cartridge.
</P>
<P>
   The 882C replaces the DeskJet 880C, which was one of HP's
best-selling home printers. This is not a budget printer, but
rather one that would be excellent for those who run a home
business or do a lot of printing that requires high-quality output.
</P>
<P>
   It connects to the PC via either the parallel or the USB port.
However, print speed is limited by how fast the print head can spew
its ink, so you won't necessarily see zippier printing by using the
USB connection.
</P>
<P>
   The DeskJet 882C is rated at eight pages per minute for
black-and-white printing and five pages per minute for color.
However, that's in its fastest mode and thus lowest quality. Switch
to photo-quality, and the speed drops dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   It prints black and white at a resolution of 600 dots per inch.
HP does not list the resolution for color, instead saying it uses a
layering method called PhotoREt II for high-end color reproduction.
This reduces the banding effect you sometimes see on
high-resolution color prints.
</P>
<P>
   The 882C is very quiet, which is a plus because many new inkjets
are quite noisy. It also doesn't go through lengthy turn-on and
shut-down gyrations common to new Canon and Epson printers.
</P>
<P>
   __ ScanJet 5200Cse Scanner _ $299, Hewlett-Packard. &UR;  &LR; Scanning is
where USB's speed advantage really comes into play. The ScanJet is
an incredibly peppy little scanner _ at least as far as the scans
themselves are concerned. The software used to initiate them ...
well, that's another matter.
</P>
<P>
   The 5200Cse is very easy to use, with a single button on the
front panel to initiate a scan. It comes with software that can
automatically direct a scanned image to your e-mail program or
Web-page authoring package.
</P>
<P>
   This 36-bit color scanner can handle resolutions up to
600-by-1,200 dots per inch in hardware, or 9,600-by-9,600 dots per
inch with a software boost. It produced some of the best quality
images I've seen in a home scanner at this price, even at
relatively low resolutions. The 5200Cse also did it very quickly _
about as fast as if it was using a SCSI connection. If need be, you
also can plug the scanner into a parallel port.
</P>
<P>
   However, the software used to invoke and manage the TWAIN
drivers _ the components used to pull images from the scanner into
the computer _ is not fast at all. I first tried it on a
200-megahertz Pentium MMX system with 64 megabytes of memory, and
it sometimes took as long as 30 seconds just to launch. A friend
who bought a 5200Cse and ran it on his new 500-megahertz Pentium
III system reported much faster results. Beware if you have a
slower system. HP says the software is simplified, but frankly, it
lacks the image controls found on other scanners' software.
</P>
<P>
   __ Stylus Color 900 printer _ $399, Epson America. &UR;  &LR; Epson claims
this is the fastest inkjet printer you can buy, and I'm not going
to argue with them. This baby zips along at an unbelievable clip. I
won't say it is as fast as a laser printer _ but it's close.
</P>
<P>
   The Stylus Color 900 prints black and white at 12 pages per
minute, and, even more impressively, 10 pages per minute in color.
Moving to photo-realistic printing slows it down markedly, but it
still is relatively quick.
</P>
<P>
   There's one drawback to this warp speed, however. The 900's
print head moves back and forth so quickly that it's noisy, and it
literally shakes the table it's sitting on.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case with all Epson printers, the color is excellent.
Some people find the Epson ``look'' to be a bit saturated, although
I think it produces more realistic photo images. The fact that it
can handle resolutions of 1,440-by-720 dots per inch doesn't hurt,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Like the HP printer, it connects to your PC using either the
parallel or USB port. Unlike the HP, though, it goes through
incredible gyrations when it is turned on or off. I'll be glad when
Epson figures out a way around that.
</P>
<P>
   __ Perfection 636U _ $299, Epson America. &UR;  &LR; This is an excellent
scanner for home users, though it's priced a little higher than
competing products _ many scanners of this quality sell in the $250
range.
</P>
<P>
   The Perfection 636U is a USB-only scanner, though a model is
available for those who prefer a SCSI connection. In fact, that one
even comes with a SCSI card for your computer.
</P>
<P>
   This 36-bit scanner handles resolutions of up to 600-by-2,400
dots per inch in hardware, and 9,600-by-9,600 with a software
boost. The images were not quite as nice as the HP scanner, but
they were still excellent.
</P>
<P>
   The scanning software, though, was much better than the HP's.
You can set up the Epson's software to run in a simplified view, or
click a button and adjust many different details. The software also
launches much faster than the HP's, though scans were a bit slower.
</P>
<P>
   It also has single-button launch to initiate a scan, but there's
another button on the front that many home scanners lack _ a power
button. Most folks don't use their scanners that frequently, and
having the ability to turn it off and save electricity _ and
possibly extend the life of the scanning lamp _ is a plus.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress returns from its spring break this week
with some Republicans ready to renew their own air and ground war
on President Clinton's handling of the Balkan crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, meanwhile, appear ready to rally around Clinton and
the NATO bombing campaign aimed at forcing Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to halt Serbian attacks in the embattled
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Lurking in the background is the War Powers Act, a 1973 law
approved by Congress as U.S. forces departed from Vietnam. It
requires presidential troop commitments to end within 60 days
unless Congress declares war or authorizes continuation of the
deployments. But the law has never been invoked to prevent or
curtail a U.S. military action.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show rising support among Americans for the NATO air war,
and last week, Washington Post-ABC News and Wall Street Journal-NBC
surveys showed 57 percent and 53 percent, respectively, favoring
deployment of U.S.-led NATO ground forces in the region.
</P>
<P>
   But the polls are not deterring a few House Republicans who
oppose U.S. presence in the NATO effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is war, and it's not an inherent power of the
commander-in-chief,'' said Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif.,
.MDRV/.MDNM/a House International Relations Committee member. ``I'm
not an isolationist. My sense of it is this (the Kosovo dispute) is
a civil war, and by invoking (the words) `genocide' and `Hitler,'
we make it into something that is very different.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, a former Stanford law professor, said he plans to
invoke the 1973 law by introducing two resolutions Monday: a
declaration of war plus a measure calling for the withdrawal of
U.S. air and ground forces from the region. The twin votes,
Campbell said, will force lawmakers to choose which way to go and
end the state of undeclared war.
</P>
<P>
   On March 11, the House approved sending 4,000 U.S. peacekeeping
troops to carry out the peace accord signed in Rambouillet, France.
But Milosevic refused to endorse the agreement, a move that
precipitated NATO's air attacks that began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   In Campbell's view, the conflict in Kosovo _ the southern
province of Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia _ springs
from a tit-for-tat situation in which the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo
Liberation Army and Serbian military forces are both guilty of
atrocities against innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, said Campbell, ``This is not something we should be
engaged in.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, a presidential contender, also argues
the U.S. has no national interests at stake in the Balkans, but he
prefaces his criticism with strong support of America combat units
in the air war.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. William Goodling, R-Penn., the committee's second-ranking
Republican, plans to introduce a resolution requiring congressional
approval of any plan to send U.S. ground forces to Kosovo. Goodling
has enlisted six GOP co-sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite last week's polls, Clinton continued to discount the
need for ground forces. But Goodling said he wants to take no
chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've depleted the military so dramatically, but we continue
these so-called peacekeeping missions,'' he said. ``If we
reinstitute the draft or if Americans start coming back in body
bags, I'll guarantee those polls will change very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodling said the 1991 Persian Gulf War ``spoiled'' the American
public because it was over quickly and it had the clear objective
of removing Iraq's military forces from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Goodling said, ``I don't know what our purpose is''
in the Balkans. ``I don't see (victory) happening quickly in
(mountainous) terrain such as that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most House Democrats support Clinton. ``I think the policy we're
executing is the right one,'' said Rep. Sam Gejdenson of
Connecticut, the House International Relations Committee's senior
Democrat, after returning from a 48-hour fact-finding mission to
Brussels and the U.S. air base in Aviano, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   One Democrat, Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., senior Democrat on the
House Armed Services Committee, supports the air war but has
criticized Clinton, saying he could have done better in preparing
the nation for the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., sided with Republicans in
their unsuccessful opposition to the House resolution supporting
U.S. participation in a NATO peacekeeping force. Now, Frank says
that if Milosevic gives in, he would reluctantly support some U.S.
troop involvement in a peacekeeping force. The brunt of the burden,
however, should fall on Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't any fundamental reason why the large collection of
prosperous, technologically sophisticated nations of Western Europe
can't have a ground presence capable of acting without us,'' Frank
said. ``But I recognize they don't have that now.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank still opposes ground troops in a combat situation, but he
insists the House has in effect already authorized them by voting
for a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between ground troops to enforce a coerced
peace agreement and ground troops now is not of constitutional
significance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is less dissension in the Senate, which voted 58-41 to
support the air campaign on March 23, the day before NATO bombs and
missiles started falling on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., another presidential contender, has
strongly supported the military effort, and he was among the first
to call for considering the use of U.S. ground troops. Among those
supporting the McCain position are Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., and
Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb.

TODAY'S INEXPENSIVE COMPUTERS 
GREAT BARGAINS FOR AVERAGE USER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Q. I am very tempted to buy one of these new
under-$1,000 computers. (I guess you can't call them ``sub-$1,000''
anymore, since they are really ``sub-$500'' in some cases!) I've
read reviews of systems such as the eMachines, but I am still wary.
These manufacturers have to be cutting corners, big time! When I am
shopping for a budget PC, what should I look out for?
</P>
<P>
   A. Low-priced PCs really are a miracle of our time. They are
being snapped up by the thousands, so much so that the penetration
of PCs in U.S. homes as measured by the market research firm
Dataquest has now passed 50 percent for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the inexpensive machines are excellent bargains.
Processors have become powerful enough that even the
least-expensive ones can run most modern software _ even
power-hungry games _ quite nicely. Memory, hard drives and other
components are quite cheap, and competitive PC makers pass the
savings on to you.
</P>
<P>
   But yes, there are things to watch out for. Corners are being
cut. Some of them you can't avoid _ others you can.
</P>
<P>
   First, nearly all manufacturers include a very limited amount of
consumer software on these computers. That means you'll have to buy
your own, if you don't already have it. You can download many
shareware and even freeware titles from the Internet, but if you
are a novice, this can be confusing and daunting. Consider buying
software a hidden cost you'll likely have to bear.
</P>
<P>
   Some manufacturers use processors _ such as the MII from Cyrix _
that can use part of the standard system memory for video memory.
That means if the computer comes with 32 megabytes of random access
memory, only some of it will be available for programs. Usually,
these chips take two to four megabytes away. However, the MII is
not always set up this way, so if you see a system that interests
you, ask how video memory is handled.
</P>
<P>
   PC makers also may scrimp on the video. Systems with just two
megabytes of video memory _ often used in the MII machines _ are
inadequate for many games. Those systems that have separate video
cards often come with just four megabytes of video memory, when
eight megabytes is really better for graphics applications and
games.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, many PC makers use winmodems as opposed to traditional
modems. Winmodems only can be run with Windows programs _ they
won't work with older DOS applications _ and they seem to be not as
good at handling dirty phone lines. However, winmodems almost are
universal in low-cost PCs, and it's almost impossible to avoid
them.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the sub-$500 models come with just 32 megabytes of
memory, and if you can afford to do so, it's a good idea to bump up
to at least 64 megabytes. This should be a minimal cost _ $35 to
$45 _ and it's worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Suddenly, I am not seeing any graphics in Internet Explorer
5.0! All I see are little boxes where the pictures are supposed to
be, but no pictures! Help!
</P>
<P>
   A. You're surfing with the graphics turned off. Although you are
missing things, you actually have one big benefit _ your surfing
sessions are probably faster!
</P>
<P>
   Here's how to fix it: Go to Tools, Internet Options, and click
the Advanced tab. Scroll down to the Show Pictures box and check
it. Click Apply, then OK to exit.
</P>
<P>
   You also can turn graphics on and off in Netscape Communicator.
Go to Edit, Preferences, then Advanced. To turn images off, click
``Automatically load images.''

COMMENTARY: DIALLO'S TALE COMPLICATES MANY QUESTS FOR ASYLUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEW YORK _ In death, Amadou Diallo has become an important symbol
on several fronts, but one is not much to brag about. He was _ and
there is really no polite way to say it _ an immigration cheat.
When you talk to immigration lawyers, you realize that in filing a
fraudulent claim to political asylum, he did no favor for
foreigners genuinely in need of a haven from oppression.
</P>
<P>
   ``A case like this,'' said one experienced lawyer, who insisted
on anonymity to avoid any whiff of trouble for her clients, ``can
make it much more difficult for people who are true
asylum-seekers.''
</P>
<P>
   Her point was fleshed out by John Assadi, another New York
lawyer specializing in these matters. ``Every time you have a
high-profile negative case like this,'' he said, ``there's a
perception among everyone involved that the next guy may be
lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, nothing about Diallo's bogus search for asylum seems
likely to affect the central questions about police performance
that have arisen since he was shot 19 times on Feb. 4 by officers
of the Street Crime Unit.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, his blatant falsehoods to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service are not easily shrugged off by some
advocates for refuge-seekers. Even with no evidence yet of anyone
being caught in a bureaucratic backlash since Diallo's asylum
situation became known in mid-March, the advocates worry that
anti-immigration forces have been handed free ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, 22 at his death, came here from Guinea, in West Africa.
He had a legitimate visa to work or study, which had been due to
expire this month.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently hoping to stick around longer, he filed an asylum
claim with the INS. It turned him down. He then went before a judge
working under the aegis of the Executive Office for Immigration
Review, a branch of the Justice Department. This time, he pushed
all the right buttons.
</P>
<P>
   He was from Mauritania, Diallo said. That was a good choice for
the man from a prosperous family in Guinea. Mauritania is
considered a disaster area by human-rights groups: a bastion of
slavery, they say, where the dominant light-skinned Moors have
rounded up black citizens, stripped them of their papers and
property and deported them.
</P>
<P>
   He was a victim of ``ethnic cleansing,'' Diallo said in a sworn
deposition, asserting that Mauritanian soldiers killed his parents
and made prisoners of him and an uncle, who later died of torture.
``They beat us with sticks, tied us and dragged us to their trucks
and took us to the military camp,'' he said. After ``two cruel
weeks,'' he was taken at gunpoint to Senegal, and from there made
his way to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The entire story was untrue. Among other things, Diallo's
parents are alive and highly visible these days in New York. But he
told his tale well enough to convince an immigration judge, though
the INS was appealing the decision when Diallo was killed. ``This
is somebody who took a system to help people who truly need help,
and just scammed it,'' one official said.
 &UR;  &LR; How widespread is this kind of fraud?
</P>
<P>
   Not very, lawyers for asylum-seekers contend.
</P>
<P>
   More than the advocates may care to admit, government officials
respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come here from very desperate circumstances, and they
will do anything to survive,'' said Richard L. Kenney, a spokesman
for the immigration review office. ``It's human nature. And the
more resourceful find ways to tell the better story. There are a
lot of people coming from China, and they all know what to say:
they're fleeing the one-child-per-couple rule.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that the national mood toward illegal immigrants
is hardly a smile button. Last year, the review office disposed of
231,194 cases, and in 200,261, or 87 percent of them, people were
deported or left the country voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   And Diallo's use of Mauritania underlined a particularly thorny
problem. He had no documents to back up his claims. But many
genuine asylum-seekers from that country also arrive without
papers. A similar situation is unfolding with the refugees from
Kosovo, who have been systematically stripped of proof of identity.
</P>
<P>
   So what may well be the result of the Diallo affair?
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine lawyers representing people from Mauritania are
finding themselves more closely scrutinized,'' said Kerry Bretz, an
immigration lawyer in Manhattan who used to work for the INS.
``After a case like this, antennae go up.''

   INTERNET-ECOSYSTEM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Scientists at the Xerox
Palo Alto Research Center have squeezed a big portion of the Web,
about 55 million pages, onto 400 billion bytes of disk space. Held
in captivity, this Web in a box is poked and prodded by researchers
studying it like a great beast _ or, to use the metaphor they
prefer, like an ecosystem. They seek the laws by which the members
of the planetary community of Internet foragers compete and
cooperate in the constant search for information. The Internet is a
living laboratory to study mass human behavior with a precision and
scale never possible before. By George Johnson. (`a' category)

<P>
   KOSOVO-GENOCIDE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Amid growing signs of a
genocidal campaign by Serbian forces against Kosovo's Albanians,
the conduct of ordinary Serbs is starting to attract the kinds of
questions raised in Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's book, `Hitler's
Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust.'
Goldhagen himself thinks that questioning the behavior of the
Serbian nation at this moment is not only fitting but essential. By

<P>
   KOSOVO-NATO-REVIEW (Brussels) _ NATO has been planning a 50th
anniversary summit this month to chart a new `strategic concept'
defining its role in European security. But that role is instead
being redefined in Kosovo. The role has become that of a bulwark
against the consequences of ethnic instability in Europe's
southeastern periphery, which is today the biggest threat to
European security, just as it was a century ago. If it cannot
resolve the Kosovo crisis, NATO may go the way of the League of
Nations. By Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MIDEAST-REVIEW (Damascus) _ NATO's punishment of Serb
Christians for their persecution of Kosovar Muslims presented the
Islamic world with a campaign that it could identify with. After
all, the U.S. and its allies were siding with Muslims this time,
not bashing Iraq or supporting Israel. But while sympathies for the
Kosovars are strong in the Muslim Middle East, they are tangled
with an abiding mistrust of the West, whose use of force against
the Serbs is seen as less than heroic. By Douglas Jehl.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-FUGITIVES-REVIEW (Mexico City) _ A look at the
frequently-occurring phenomenon of Mexican government officials who
are accused of corruption and then flee. There are so many such
cases that, to Mexicans, the public figure turned fugitive has
become a cliche. `In our system, there's a thin line separating
public officials from outlaws, and legality from illegality,' said
poet Homero Aridjis. `Overnight, they can leave behind their
prerogatives of power and turn into fugitives.' By Sam Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   GADHAFI-LOCKERBIE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Sources close to Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi say his agreement to turn over the suspects
in the Lockerbie jetliner bombing was not greatly influenced by
sanctions or other economic pressures. A need to end his isolation
and salvage his place in history may have been the most important
factor. By Barbara Crossette.

   COLDWAR-HEROES-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Cold War Recognition
Certificate took its place in the pantheon of military honors last
week, when the Pentagon began accepting applications. Anyone who
served in the armed forces or in one of several federal government
positions between Sept. 2, 1945, when Japan surrendered to the
U.S., and Dec. 25, 1991, when Mikhail Gorbachev resigned as
president of the Soviet Union, is eligible to apply. The
certificate could go to as many as 22 million people. It carries no
financial benefits or privileges whatever _ but, oh, the glory! By
David Stout.
</P>
<P>
   TAX-CUT-REVIEW (Washington) _ Recent public quiescence on the
issue of taxes is puzzling to conservatives who think that the time
is ripe for significant tax cutting or a sweeping overhaul of the
tax code. But Americans appear to have turned their political
energies and interests elsewhere. Although they would not reject a
tax cut, polls indicate many would prefer the money be dedicated to
Social Security or other programs. So congressional Republicans
have been working to tell Americans that they don't have to choose.
By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ECON-JOBLESS-REVIEW (Washington) Unemployment has been falling
for seven years and economic growth remains robust. By conventional
economic theory, this should be producing inflation. But in fact,
inflation is nowhere to be found. And while theoretical economists
have been debating the issue for years, doubts about this
conventional wisdom on unemployment are now are beginning to change
the way the Federal Reserve sets policy. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   CONFIDENTIAL-SOURCES-REVIEW (Cincinnati) _ Cincinnati Enquirer
reporter Mike Gallagher's decision to reveal the identity of a
confidential source, along with notes, documents and secretly taped
conversations, is echoing through the legal and journalistic
communities as a major assault on the revered principle of
protecting sources. The case is raising new questions about the
legal rights of sources who are burned by journalists. By Douglas
Frantz.
</P>
<P>
   ENTREPRENEUR-ADS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Get-rich-quick schemes
have been around a long time. But with this era's remarkable
economic expansion and concurrent growth of home-based businesses,
magazines that cater to small-scale entrepreneurs lately have
become thick with ads placing the home business smack dab on the
road to Easy Street.

THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF COMMERCE ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you buy a book at a bookstore in Massachusetts, you pay a
sales tax. If you buy the same book over the Internet, you don't
pay a sales tax (in most cases).
</P>
<P>
   This is one reason why e-commerce, as it has come to be called,
is growing exponentially and why Web sites like Amazon.com have
become so popular.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by Chicago economics professor Austan Goolsbee
suggested that Internet sales would fall by 30 percent if sales
taxes were applied. Partly as a result of this study, the Clinton
administration and Congress last October agreed to a three-year
moratorium on Internet taxation.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet tax moratorium is, on balance, smart public policy.
Encouraging and enhancing e-commerce makes sense. It breaks down
trade barriers and fuels economic growth. And legislation that
prevents federal, state, and local governments from extracting yet
more tribute from creators of economic value is, almost by
definition, a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, the policy is working. The growth of e-commerce is
phenomenal. This is especially true in the business-to-business
category. According to Business Week magazine, ``e-commerce between
businesses is five times as much as consumer e-commerce, or about
$43 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   And by 2003, Forrester Research Inc. figures it will balloon to
$1.3 trillion. That's 10 times consumer e-commerce, constituting 9
percent of all US business trade _ more than the Gross Domestic
Product of either Britain or Italy. Around 2006 or so, it might
reach up to 40 percent of all US business.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people in Washington expect that after the moratorium runs
out in 2001, some kind of sales tax will be imposed on e-commerce.
The idea is that by then the e-commerce model will have ``matured''
and thus serve as a veritable gold mine for federal, state, and
local taxation. By not taxing it now, the argument goes,
governments will be able to tax it to the teeth in a few short
years.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but the law of unintended consequences will almost
certainly come into play. The Internet is not just another
marketplace where taxes can be levied. It is a transforming
technology, one that rewrites rules and erases traditional
boundaries. Nowhere is this truer than in the area of taxation.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the corporate income tax. In the physical world, US
companies are subject to local, state, and federal tax laws. In the
Internet world, companies need not be physically located anywhere
in the United States to do business with the world's largest
consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the idea of moving a company from a place where
taxation was considered onerous to a place where taxation was
considered less onerous was problematic. It cost a lot of money and
involved a ton of aggravation. If the company was moved overseas or
off-shore, there were real concerns about political stability,
labor pools, delivery of materials, existing infrastructure and the
like. There were ample reasons to just suck it up and pay the
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But in the world of e-commerce, you can move a really big
company from Virginia to the Cayman Islands in two days. FedEx can
ship the computer servers and modems overnight. You plug all the
hardware into a satellite telecommunications system and _ presto _
America On Line is now a registered corporation in the Cayman
Islands, paying no federal, state or local corporate income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the information age, companies can be
``headquartered'' anywhere there is low or no taxation without
losing market share. My wife works for an advertising and marketing
company that last year paid more than $200 million in corporate
income taxes. Why would they continue to do that if they didn't
have to? Eighty percent of what they actually do can be converted
to the Web in 10 years. The rest is meetings.
</P>
<P>
   If 40 percent of all business commerce in 2006 takes place on
the Internet, it stands to reason that by 2015, more than
two-thirds of all business transactions will be e-commerce. It also
stands to reason that new and improved technologies will
dramatically increase consumer e-commerce. If the majority of all
business transactions and a large number of consumer sales are
occurring on the Web, what difference does it make where a company
is based? Companies will be based in cyberspace, out of reach of
traditional taxing authorities.
</P>
<P>
   This is why so much of the current debate in Washington about
tax policy has such a hollow ring to it. It is discussed in the
context of a model that soon will no longer apply. In the near
future, the policy-makers are going to have to create a new
taxation model. That model almost certainly will have to be based
on consumption taxes. Corporate income taxes will soon be made moot
by Internet technology.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AFFLICTION,' starring Nick Nolte, James Coburn (winner of the
Oscar for best-supporting actor), Willem Dafoe, Sissy Spacek and
Mary Beth Hurt. Directed by Paul Schrader (R, 114 minutes). Nolte
is devastating in the performance of his career, as Wade
Whitehouse, a New Hampshire loner fighting a losing battle with
demons from his past. Foremost among them: Coburn, terrifyingly
authentic as the drunken, abusive father who long ago cowed his
sons into submission. As directed by Schrader, this pure,
unfettered adaptation of Russell Banks' novel starts on a
deceptively ordinary note, then escalates into inexorable fury.
Every little detail matters. Ms. Spacek and Ms. Hurt expertly play
the women who trigger Wade's crisis (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ANALYZE THIS,' starring Robert De Niro, Billy Crystal, Lisa
Kudrow and Chazz Palminteri. Directed by Harold Ramis (R, 110
minutes). The title, concept and teaming of these co-stars are all
funny before the lights go down, so think of this comedy as an
offer you can't refuse. Cast as a mobster whose confidence is
shaken, De Niro is hilarious simply by playing his role halfway
straight, in classic goodfella style. His mobster finds just the
right comic foil in Billy Crystal, as the psychiatrist who utters
the immortal: ``When I got into family therapy, this wasn't the
family I had in mind.'' There's a lot more where that came from in
this breezy comic treat (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BABY GENIUSES,' starring Kathleen Turner, Christopher Lloyd and
many toddlers. Directed by Bob Clark (PG, 94 minutes). One way to
get through this guaranteed 100 percent laugh-free comedy is to
wonder whether it really is the worst film you've even seen.
Probably not, but it's pretty darn close. Woefully substandard
production values give it a ghastly look, made all the worse by the
grotesque computer morphing of young children into adult-style wise
guys. The plotting is shrill, bordering on incomprehensible. Ms.
Turner lurches through the film with a performance that just says,
``Hey, it's a living'' (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BLAST FROM THE PAST,' starring Brendan Fraser, Christopher
Walken, Alicia Silverstone and Sissy Spacek. Directed by Hugh
Wilson (PG-13, 105 minutes). More amusingly than might be expected,
this comedy tells the story of one very nuclear family that has
been hiding in a fallout shelter since 1962 and emerges into a '90s
world of grunge and attitude. In fact, it's funnier underground,
with Fraser as the strapping son of a cheerfully mad scientist
(Walken) and sherry-sipping housewife (Ms. Spacek), 1962 style.
Once he comes above ground and meets a hard-boiled Ms. Silverstone,
it's clear that Fraser is once again a film's true ingenu, doing
the wide-eyed hunk thing that has become his specialty. He does it
a lot better in ``Gods and Monsters,'' but this comedy is still
lighthearted fun (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `CENTRAL STATION,' starring Fernanda Montenegro, Vinicius de
Oliveira and Marilia Pera. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 115
minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless older
woman crosses paths with an orphaned boy. There's plenty of room
for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Salles' film is all in
the telling. As these characters develop a fractious bond, then
embark on a road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's
hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Salles brings great
tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate their journey.
Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance was one of last year's
very best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `COOKIE'S FORTUNE,' starring Charles S. Dutton, Glenn Close,
Patricia Neal, Julianne Moore and Liv Tyler. Directed by Robert
Altman (PG-13, 118 minutes). What a treat. The sweet assurance and
guerrilla wit of Altman's vintage ensemble films make a copacetic
return with a Southern small-town black comedy. Seamlessly made and
completely enveloping, it tells of the machinations set off when a
wealthy old woman (Ms. Neal) outrages her diabolically genteel
niece (Ms. Close) by committing suicide. As the old woman's dearest
friend and the niece's unwitting nemesis, Dutton is rock-solid and
appealing. The entire cast works on a single wavelength as Altman
makes the most of a well-woven screenplay by Anne Rapp (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE CORRUPTOR,' starring Chow Yun-Fat and Mark Wahlberg.
Directed by James Foley (R, 111 minutes). A conventional but
above-average police drama set in Chinatown in New York City, ``The
Corruptor'' finds the rookie cop Danny Wallace (Wahlberg) learning
the ropes from his rule-bending partner, Nick Chen (Chow), who has
gotten dangerously chummy with Chinatown's mob bosses. The
atmosphere is gritty, the action sequences sleek and the questions
the story raises about loyalty, ethics, friendship and betrayal,
although familiar, are still worth bringing up. ``The Corruptor''
is a more effective showcase for the brooding charisma of Chow, a
Hong Kong action superstar, than ``The Replacement Killers,'' his
English-language debut (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS,' starring Elodie Bouchez and Natacha
Regnier. Directed by Erick Zonca (R, 113 minutes; in French with
English subtitles). In this very special French film about two
freewheeling young women, their turbulent friendship is frayed by
sexual passion and economic realities. The weaker and more
head-turning of the women (Ms. Regnier) falls for the advances of a
rich nightclub owner, while her fiery friend, played with
unforgettable immediacy by Ms. Bouchez, rages against what she
views as imminent disaster. In the process, Zonca shows astonishing
acuity in observing how the women's diverging values affect every
aspect of their lives. A rare and wrenching drama (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `EDTV,' starring Matthew McConaughey, Ellen DeGeneres, Woody
Harrelson, Martin Landau, Jenna Elfman and Rob Reiner. Directed by
Ron Howard (PG-13, 120 minutes). In this good-humored, deceptively
easygoing satire, Howard holds up a fun-house mirror to a world
ruled by voyeurism and specious fame. The subject matter is
familiar by now, but this film about a Trumanesque nobody as
24-hour-a-day television star has a shrewd way of drawing the
audience into its web. Permeated by all the crassness and absurdity
inherent in celebrity-mad culture, and by our collective obsession
with snoopy trivia, it features a fine ensemble cast and a
dependably jokey screenplay by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel. It
helps that most of the principals, in a cast that also includes
Elizabeth Hurley, have played this game for real and act their
roles with a comic vengeance (Maslin).

   `ELIZABETH,' the Oscar winner for best makeup. Starring Cate
Blanchett, Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey Rush and Christopher Eccleston.
Directed by Shekhar Kapur (R, 124 minutes). In this lurid costume
drama depicting Elizabeth I as a royal rookie, the impressive Ms.
Blanchett plays the queen as if her principal responsibilities were
being bejeweled, selecting consorts and saying ``Leave us!'' with a
wave of the hand. For all its putative concern with Roman
Catholic-Protestant strife at the start of Elizabeth's reign, this
is historical drama for those whose idea of history is back issues
of Vogue. Intent on spectacle, complete with burning at the stake
and one dance scene reminiscent of ``Saturday Night Fever,'' it
winds up imagining the queen as a glamorously stressed-out modern
woman afflicted by a super-intense case of having it all (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `FOLLOWING,' starring Jeremy Theobald, Alex Haw and Lucy
Russell. Directed by Christopher Nolan (not rated, 70 minutes).
This artfully manipulative black-and-white film noir, recently
shown as part of the New Directors/New Films series, doles out its
plot details in cryptic fashion. ``I decided to structure my story
in such a way as to emphasize the audience's incomplete
understanding of each new scene as it is first presented,'' the
filmmaker has said. And he makes that technique work in shattering
a tale of James M. Cain-style conniving into several time frames. A
man named Bill likes to follow strangers until he finds one named
Cobb, who is curiously helpful as a mentor in crime. No-budget
enough to have been shot on a year's worth of Saturdays while the
principals held weekday jobs, it ties together neatly in the end
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `GODS AND MONSTERS,' starring Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser.
Directed by Bill Condon (not rated, 105 minutes). In a performance
that well deserves to be remembered, McKellen becomes the
deliciously urbane James Whale, depicting the gay ``Frankenstein''
director late in life. Shaken by the aftereffects of a mild stroke,
this Whale finds his past coming back to greet him just as the
present offers new fascination in the Adonis-like form of the
gardener (Fraser, also fine), whom Whale finds mowing his lawn.
This beautifully acted, witty and heart-tugging film, from a
Christopher Bram book, imagines what Whale's final days might have
been like while shaping a splendid character study and a droll
portrait of closeted gay Hollywood. Lynn Redgrave provides ballast
and comic relief as Whale's perpetually scandalized housekeeper
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `FORCES OF NATURE,' starring Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck.
Directed by Bronwen Hughes (PG-13, 102 minutes). Does Ms. Bullock's
loopy girl-next-door charm really make audiences want to follow her
anywhere? If so, they'd better be prepared for an amusement park
ride with senior citizens, a long romp through K-mart and the other
equally desperate settings for a road movie that otherwise has
nowhere to go. A would-be screwball romantic comedy about a man
thrown together with a zany drifter en route to his own wedding, it
shows off Ms. Bullock to amusing if overly frenetic advantage.
Affleck fares less well with the film's wimpier role. Some of the
material's many gaps are filled by special-effects hail and
windstorms, which are as close as the title comes to making any
sense (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL' (the Oscar winner for best foreign film and
best dramatic score), directed by and starring Roberto Benigni
(named best actor) (PG-13, 122 minutes). Italy's most antic
funnyman dares to find humor and tenderness in the midst of the
Holocaust, and his risk pays off. This Cannes prize winner is as
stubbornly entertaining as its central character, a Jewish waiter
named Guido who jokes his way through the nightmare for the sake of
his loved ones. Daring also to combine an opening hour of romance
and pranks with a more somber second act, Benigni avoids all traces
of the maudlin and effectively creates a situation in which comedy
is courage. In this unpretentious, enormously likable film, he
shines as a father whose fibs and hilarious buffoonery know no
bounds, and no fear (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS,' starring Jason Flemyng,
Dexter Fletcher, Sting, Jason Statham, Vinnie Jones and Nick Moran.
Directed by Guy Ritchie (R, 106 minutes). Not since ``The Usual
Suspects'' has there been such an oversupply of cool macho schemers
in a single film. And they're served up with a quick, tart economy
that bespeaks the filmmaker's background making videos and
commercials _ actually an advantage, for a change. There's not much
beneath the surface here; what's most entertaining is Ritchie's
droll, hard-boiled storytelling and the rogue's gallery of a cast
that he has assembled. All the film need do is juggle assorted
miscreants and four separate gangs who, figuratively speaking,
can't shoot straight (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE MATRIX,' starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and
Carrie-Anne Moss. Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski (R, 120
minutes). The time-traveling story steeped in virtual reality will
be all but incomprehensible to non-technofreaks. And the film
borrows unapologetically from other sci-fi extravaganzas, with a
big debt to ``The X-Files'' in the paranoia department. But the
storytelling is intricately bizarre and the special effects are
indeed special, notably when it comes to midair martial arts with a
gravity-defying gusto. And Reeves shows that you can look like a
Prada model while behaving like an action hero. One of the main
stars here is Bill Pope, an inventive cinematographer. He and the
Wachowskis provide a couch-potato epiphany: while the characters
seem to be performing marvelous feats, they're often lying
stock-still in the grip of virtual reality (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `PAYBACK,' starring Mel Gibson, James Coburn and Gregg Henry.
Directed by Brian Helgeland (R, 110 minutes). In this inept,
excessively sadistic film-noir spoof adapted from the same Richard
Stark novel (``The Hunter'') that inspired the 1967 genre classic
``Point Blank,'' Gibson is a thief named Porter who retaliates with
a vengeance after an attempt on his life. Determined to recover
$70,000 that was stolen from him by a double-crossing partner in
crime, he works his way up the pecking order of a crime syndicate,
brutally dispatching all who stand in his way. The hard-boiled
dialogue is ludicrous, the storytelling clunky, the acting fair to
awful, the gore ankle deep. Credit the star with being able to keep
a straight face through this loathsome mess (Holden). &QL;

   `SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE' (the Oscar winner for best film, best
original screenplay, best art direction, best costumes and best
comedy score.) Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow (the
best-actress winner), Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench
(best supporting actress). Directed by John Madden (R, 113
minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate delight, with an
exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets better as the film
unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm
and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of
his ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,'' dares to imagine
whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic
passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty.
Meanwhile, this tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an
Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving
we enjoy today and has great fun presenting the creation of ``Romeo
and Juliet,'' glitches and all. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a
fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully
realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TANGO,' starring Miguel Angel Sola. Written and directed by
Carlos Saura. Cinematography by Vittorio Storaro (PG-13, 100
minutes). A thrilling display of tango heat and virtuosity. And
it's no slight to the actors who play lovers to say that the
dancing here is steamier than any kiss. In his most electrifying
dance film, Saura offers transfixingly beautiful glimpses of the
dance and the great range of emotions it can conjure. Storaro's
dazzlingly fluid cinematography captures all the nuances this
material demands. Everyone in the film is utterly consumed by tango
fever; audiences will be, too (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE THIN RED LINE,' starring Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin, Nick
Nolte and Sean Penn. Directed by Terrence Malick (R, 166 minutes).
From the first frame of this huge, drifting war epic loosely
derived from James Jones' Guadalcanal novel, it's viscerally clear
that Malick is back. The exquisite, oddly detached visual style
that made ``Badlands'' and ``Days of Heaven'' the most beautiful
films of the 1970s is instantly apparent here, even if the
narrative vagueness and brooding voice-overs are also familiar. The
film sprawls, gets lost and occasionally delivers visual poetry,
the kind that could have been greatly helped by tighter editing.
Bottom line: No one who admired Malick's early work should miss
this. But those expecting anything simple will not find it here
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `T-REX: BACK TO THE CRETACEOUS,' starring Peter Horton and Liz
Stauber. Directed by Brett Leonard (not rated; 45 minutes).
Passions for the prehistoric that remain unsated after the two
``Jurassic Park'' films are likely to be requited by this latest
Imax 3-D film. Drooling and menacing, the monsters of the Mesozoic
are on the march again in this brief, enjoyable dip into
paleontology, teen-age adventure and parent-child relationships.
Seen in 3-D and set against the lush ferns, moss and ancient trees
of the Olympic rain forest in the state of Washington, these
creatures seem marvelously lifelike. Better yet, ``T-Rex,'' written
by Andrew Gellis and Jeanne Rosenberg, doesn't rest on its
technological splendors.Its time-tripping story takes the viewer to
a paleontological dig, raises unanswered scientific questions and
introduces some of the major figures in the history of the subject.
To be sure, seeing ``T-Rex'' won't qualify anyone for a doctorate
in paleontology, and an intriguing subplot that hints at a troubled
family background for its teen-age heroine is left unresolved; but
the film is likely to whet active young minds to learn more about
the past. At Sony Theaters Lincoln Square, 1998 Broadway, at 68th
Street, Manhattan (Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   `TRUE CRIME,' starring Clint Eastwood, Isaiah Washington, James
Woods and Lisa Gay Hamilton. Directed by Clint Eastwood (R, 127
minutes). In his most quietly poignant film since ``A Perfect
World,'' Eastwood directs a death row thriller with redemption on
its mind. Beginning almost casually, and taking on growing urgency
as it moves toward an imaginatively suspenseful ending, it tells of
a jaded newspaper reporter who, to his own surprise as much as
anyone else's, finds himself fighting at the 11th hour to save a
possibly innocent man from execution. Eastwood is older than the
man he plays, but not too old to be plausible as the father of an
adorable little girl in the cast; she happens to be his real
daughter (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `A WALK ON THE MOON,' starring Diane Lane, Viggo Mortensen, Liev
Schreiber, Tovah Feldshuh and Anna Paquin. Directed by Tony Goldwyn
(R, 107 minutes). This evocative 1969 period piece, set on the
brink of Woodstock in a Catskills holiday camp, is as seductive as
the handsome, itinerant hippie who turns its heroine's life upside
down. Thoughtfully conceived and movingly acted, it sweeps a
housewife and mother named Pearl Kantrowitz (Ms. Lane) into a
torrid extramarital romance and then weighs the consequences. With
a tenderness that's unusual for a contemporary American film, it
tells an enveloping tale enhanced by artfully selected
Woodstock-era music. Mortensen may strain credulity as the foxiest
blouse salesman in the Catskills, but he certainly does wonders for
the movie (Maslin).

<P>
   `A RISING TIDE: NORWAY'S NEW WAVE.' Films from Norway occupy the
screen at the Walter Reade Theater as the Film Society of Lincoln
Center presents a 10-film series called ``A Rising Tide: Norway's
New Wave.'' Comprising two classics and eight recent films, the

new generation of filmmakers from a country whose cinema is not as
widely known as that of its neighbors, Sweden and Denmark. Among
the highlights this weekend, at 4 p.m. tomorrow and 8:15 p.m.
Sunday, are ``Frozen Heart'' (1998), Stig Andersen and Kenny
Sanders' documentary about the Norwegian polar explorer Roald
Amundsen; and at 4 p.m. Sunday, ``Gjest Bardsen'' (1939), the tale
of a daring and romantic robber, directed by Henrik Ibsen's
grandson, Tancred Ibsen. The film series continues through Thursday
at the Walter Reade Theater, at Lincoln Center. Information and
screening schedule: (212) 875-5600 (Van Gelder).

WITH PRIMARIES ON HORIZON, SOUTH ATTRACTS PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SEAN LOUGHLIN AND CARL HULSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the azaleas in bloom and spring in the air,
the presidential contenders for 2000 are heading South, hoping some
early spade work will blossom into money and support.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican field, candidates appear to be focusing on
different states. Arizona Sen. John McCain has built an impressive
organization in South Carolina while conservative commentator Pat
Buchanan is concentrating on Louisiana, where he won the early
party caucuses four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative activist Gary Bauer, New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith
and former Vice President Dan Quayle also have Louisiana on their
Southern tours.
</P>
<P>
   Florida isn't proving to be much of a GOP draw as yet despite it
sizable bloc of GOP voters because many party activists assume
Texas Gov. George W. Bush will lock up support there with the help
of his younger brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina political activists are feeling some frustration.
The state's relatively late primary _ May 4 of next year _ makes it
something of an afterthought for candidates looking to build
momentum with earlier wins in New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina
and the Super Tuesday states.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, a North Carolina native, has brought some
presidential attention to the state, but, interestingly, her
candidacy has not yet generated much enthusiasm in the South.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of Tar Heel state legislators, for example, have
endorsed Bush. In neighboring South Carolina, GOP executive
director Trey Walker was almost dismissive of Dole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being from Salisbury, North Carolina, doesn't translate into
being a South Carolinian,'' Walker said of any possible Dole
advantage. Besides, Walker added, ``She's not lived in North
Carolina for a long time. She's a national figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle visited South Carolina and is planning trips to Alabama.
Former Tennessee governor Lamar Alexander has already been to
Birmingham this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody really has an edge yet,'' said Chris Neeley, executive
director of the Alabama GOP.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic front, Al Gore appears to have the Southern
stage to himself for now. He's regularly in Florida and flew to
Alabama to pick up the endorsement of Gov. Don Siegelman. His only
rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, has so far been
virtually invisible in the South.
</P>
<P>
   CARTE BLANCHE WITH TOBACCO SETTLEMENT
</P>
<P>
   The nation's governors are ecstatic that Congress is about to
grant them carte blanche over the $246 billion states won from the
tobacco companies in the national settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked in an emergency spending bill that is high on the
congressional agenda is a provision authored by Sens. Kay Bailey
Hutchison, R-Texas, and Bob Graham, D-Fla., that would block any
Clinton administration claim on the funds and let states spend the
money as they see fit.
</P>
<P>
   But tobacco foes say states won't be the only winners if the
measure passes. They say the tobacco companies, losers in the legal
fight, will also come out ahead if none of the money is required to
be spent on reducing smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tobacco companies are certain to be elated if the states
get all the settlement money without being required to spend it on
tobacco prevention,'' said the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids,
which wants 25 percent of the money earmarked for such efforts.
</P>
<P>
   CROSSING THE AISLE
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Southern Democrats are forging a close relationship
with the new Speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert, an Illinois
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama's Bud Cramer and Louisiana's Chris John were among
others who worked with Hastert on several recent issues, including
the GOP budget resolution and a Republican education initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has bent over backward to meet with us to talk about some
of the issues,'' said John.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Cramer, head of the Blue Dog coalition, was part
of a bipartisan, Hastert-led delegation that flew to Europe for a
spring recess work trip. The congressional travelers visited
Germany, Lithuania, Britain and Ireland, meeting with leaders to
discuss currency developments and the crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Given his narrow majority in the House, Hastert knows he needs
the support of conservative Democrats to keep his agenda moving.
</P>
<P>
   VISITING LOS ALAMOS
</P>
<P>
   While much of official Washington remains fixated on the bombing
of Yugoslavia, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., has another crisis on
his mind.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence,
Shelby wants to get to the bottom of what happened with reported
espionage by the Chinese at a U.S. nuclear laboratory in New
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   He organized a committee trip to the Los Alamos National
Laboratory for this weekend with plans to meet with senior managers
at the facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``This visit represents an excellent opportunity to see first
hand what is going on in the wake of revelations about possible
theft of some of our most important nuclear secrets,'' Shelby said.
``We must understand what happened and fix the problem.''

   KOSOVO-HUNGER (Washington) _ Hundreds of thousands of ethnic

<P>
   KOSOVO-MONTENEGRO (Podgorica, Yugoslavia) _ Soldiers bearing
conscription notices have come to Dragon Soc's house on three
separate occasions, most recently Thursday morning, to demand that
he come with them to their barracks near the airport. Soc says he
regards these invites as a provocation for civil war. And he ought
to know. He is the Minister of Justice for the Yugoslav republic of

   KOSOVO-MILITARY (Washington) _ The United States said Friday it
had reports of the systematic rape of Kosovo women at a Yugoslav

   KOSOVO-RUSSIA (Moscow) _ Developments in Russia as politics

   VENEZUELA-PRESIDENT (Caracas, Venezuela) _ To the adoring,

is El Comandante, their protector and benefactor, the bold leader
who will wipe out 40 years of inequality and corruption and
redirect this country's enormous oil wealth to better their lives.
To his opponents, the 44-year-old former army paratrooper who is
Venezuela's new President represents something unsettling, even
dangerous. With his talk of ``revolution,'' his contempt for
institutions he calls decadent and his violent coup attempt seven
years ago, he strikes many of them as an autocrat in the making. By

Singer, a world renowned animal rights advocate, for a chair in

COLUMN: EVERYONE HAS AN APRIL MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday, April 15)  
(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late in February I passed a woman walking down the street
wearing cutoffs and sandals, looking out of place among the rest of
us still swaddled in wool scarves and fleece jackets. She seemed
quite comfortable, however, and had the private smile of someone
who has just discovered it will not be cold and wet forever.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that she was from Des Moines and celebrating a
California day of relative balminess, but I imagined she was merely
having a premature April moment.
</P>
<P>
   We feel it in our own time, following our own clock and
thermostat. One day you just start having a spring attitude.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't have to be the vernal equinox or Easter or Passover
or the day you move the clocks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   It is the morning you'd rather be outside than in bed under the
comforter. Even if your coffee gets cold and the newspapers fly off
in the wind, you are summoned to walk out the door, sweep the old
leaves off the chair and sit shivering, to wait to be touched by
the sun.
</P>
<P>
   It is when you want to simply stare at a vase of pink tulips,
the color of ballet slippers.
</P>
<P>
   Spring is about change and new possibilities. It also makes you
want to do something that feels slightly out of character, like
taking off your shoes and running through the high grass, or being
a kid and going to hunt tadpoles in the creek and bring pussy
willow branches home to your mother.
</P>
<P>
   If autumn is the time when people well past school age have an
overwhelming desire to get serious and go back to class, spring is
the time when responsible people yearn to hop on a motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   But not quite yet. Right before spring blinds you with its
enormous beauty, it draws you out with little promises and sneak
previews. In the middle of a gray day there will be one brief hour
when you know how it is to be needing sunglasses. For a moment the
bird song will be louder than traffic and the light on a patch of
forget-me-nots will stop you in your tracks.
</P>
<P>
   You never know how spring is going to come and get you. It may
tempt you to call in sick so you can sneak out to weed the garden,
get dirty and dream of delphiniums.
</P>
<P>
   It may have you consider wearing colors that go by the names of
melon and citrus instead of basic black.
</P>
<P>
   There's a decided change in your energy. A quickening. It's like
being pregnant. You suddenly need to clean the house and put away
your boots. You crave a bowl of strawberries. You are a little bit
giddy.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't be touched by spring stuck inside a building and
staring at a calendar. You don't get it merely by shifting from
gabardine to linen.
</P>
<P>
   The cat understands. No longer resentful when ordered outside,
she one day lifts her head, twitches her nose, leaps off the couch,
lands on the window ledge and begins pacing like a lover, ready for
the primo spot on the chaise lounge.
</P>
<P>
   We have the religious rituals for spring with the joyful songs,
the eggs and the lilies, and if we're pagans we can get into it by
lighting green candles, planting seeds and dancing with ribbons in
our hair.
</P>
<P>
   But culturally, except for baseball training and department
store sales, we don't do much. We need to bust out. Spend a day
pursuing only pleasure. Blast ``Carmina Burana'' from the city
square.
</P>
<P>
   Can you feel it? The Earth is turning. The wisteria is fat and
feathery. Ignore the little voice saying, ``Those legs are not
ready for shorts.''

MAN'S BEST FRIEND, AND DOESN'T BITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 11)  
(lh) 
 By GEORGEANNE BRENNAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Chinese proverb says, ``The only way to keep a family in
existence for generations is to think cabbage-stalks nice.'' The
humble cabbage has long been associated with poverty and endurance.
Since a bit of it, boiled, might be the only food available,
countless cooks have encouraged their families to like it.
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed by the cold weather and frosts that kill other
vegetables, cabbage has long been a mainstay of humankind. It can
be stored for months and is edible raw or cooked, pickled or
salted. There is evidence that wild cabbages were commonly used as
early as 2000 B.C. in Europe, and the wild version (from which
brussels sprouts, broccoli and cauliflower were developed, along
with modern cabbage) still grows along the rocky chalk coasts of
England and Denmark, in parts of France and along the
Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Wild cabbage, which doesn't form a head, is thought to have been
domesticated first in the eastern Mediterranean, then taken to
Europe. By the Middle Ages, the kind with a head that is commonly
grown now was being cultivated, and early voyagers and settlers
took seeds to North America.
</P>
<P>
   In China, a different cabbage developed. There is no evidence of
wild cabbage there, so the Chinese cabbage is thought to be a cross
between the loose-heading bok choy of the south and the wild turnip
of the north. Records of the cultivation of Chinese cabbage date to
500 A.D.
</P>
<P>
   While originally loose and floppy-leafed like the European wild
cabbage, today's main types of headed Chinese cabbages are tightly
packed barrels or cylinders of leaves, called, respectively, nappa
and michihli. Chinese seeds also arrived in the United States with
immigrants. Various Chinese cabbages are available now, many of
them hybrids.
</P>
<P>
   Cabbages are such an important crop, especially in cold
climates, that hundreds of varieties have been developed that
mature from May through November, and in warmer climates, from
December through February as well.
</P>
<P>
   European, or head, cabbages, are classified in Byzantine
fashion, first for their head shape (with ``pointed,'' ``drumhead''
and ``round'' being the most common), and then by their harvest
season (early, mid or main, and late). They are also classified by
purpose, mainly fresh market, storage or sauerkraut- and
slaw-making.
</P>
<P>
   They are further distinguished by color (green, sometimes called
white after the interior leaves, and red) and by leaf shape. Savoy
cabbage, sometimes called Italian cabbage or chou de Milan, has
puckered or blistered leaves that are dark green outside and pale
green inside. Cabbages range from a pound or 2 up to 11 pounds for
the hulking sauerkraut varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Home gardeners can grow many cabbages that rarely make it into
homogeneous supermarket displays. It is important to choose and
plant them according to their seasons; most seed companies will
answer questions on this point or give the information in catalogs.
Plants can be started from seed or bought at nurseries. Once the
danger of frost has passed, seeds can be planted directly in the
garden.
</P>
<P>
   Among the early varieties are the pointed-head Early Jersey
Wakefield, a 19th-century English heirloom with a fine, sweet
flavor. It is quick to grow, maturing in just over 60 days from
transplanting. Although it is an early type where winters are warm,
it is best planted in fall.
</P>
<P>
   Copenhagen Market Early is an old-time open-pollinated favorite,
with a crisp round head that is ready to harvest as early as June,
maturing in only 68 days from transplanting. Charmant, a hybrid, is
ready to harvest in 65 days. At the other end of the spectrum, some
sauerkraut varieties can take 110 days.
</P>
<P>
   The tasty red cabbages include Fire Dance, a hybrid that
requires 90 days from transplanting to produce a 3{-pound head, and
Red Jewel, which can be harvested at 1{ pounds, a good family size
for making sweet and sour red cabbage. For a home garden, it is a
good idea to make successive plantings of early, mid- and
late-season varieties to ensure a steady supply most of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Most Chinese cabbages have a shorter growing period than the
European cabbages, about 50 to 80 days. These are best planted from
May to July and, unlike European cabbages, tolerate warm weather.
They are likely to bolt, so use bolt-resistant varieties for
early-spring planting, like Eiki or Kasumi, among the nappa types,
or the michihli Jade Pagoda.
</P>
<P>
   Both European and Chinese cabbages require quite a bit of space
in the garden, with seeds initially planted 2 to 3 inches apart,
then thinned to 1{ to 2 feet apart in rows 2 feet apart for the
European, and somewhat less for the Chinese. Transplants can be put
in at the final spacing.
</P>
<P>
   Some sources for cabbage seeds: Stokes Seeds, P.O. Box 548,
Buffalo, NY 14240, (716) 695-6980 (free catalog; 43 varieties,
including Early Jersey Wakefield, Red Jewel, Fire Dance, Charmant
and Copenhagen Early Market; 9 varieties of heading Chinese
cabbages, including Jade Pagoda, plus a selection of loose-heading
types), and Reed's Seeds/Cabbage Specialists, 3334 State Route 215,
Cortland, NY 13045, (607) 753-9095 (free catalog; 63 varieties of
European cabbage, including Charmant).
</P>
<P>
   This Week: Nematodes, for a Good Night's Sleep
</P>
<P>
   Black vine weevil is as destructive as it sounds: Its larvae
feed on and destroy the roots of rhododendrons (a favorite),
daphnes, roses, blueberries and many other shrubs. Some people wait
until adults emerge in summer, hand-picking them by the hundreds at
night when they feed. But it's more effective to spray the soil now
with beneficial microscopic nematodes that control the weevil's
grubs and those of cutworms and Japanese beetles.
</P>
<P>
   Introduce plants like fennel, yarrow, bee balm and tansy that
will attract insects that devour aphids, scale and mealybugs.
Divide overcrowded snowdrops (Galanthus species) when they finish
blooming. Lift and replant immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Many Easter lilies will bloom again next year if planted
outside. After they flower, cut back the flower stem to the base
and plant in soil amended with organic fertilizer.

REV. MOON TO SELL OPULENT TEXAS RANCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID HENDRICKS  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ One of Texas' more opulent ranches _ Crawford
Farms _ is on the auction block again. The seller this time is the
Rev. Sun Myung Moon of the Unification Church.
</P>
<P>
   Near Carrizo Springs, some 90 miles southwest of San Antonio,
the ranch was auctioned for $8.1 million seven years ago after the
original owner, entrepreneur Don Crawford, had poured as much as
$30 million into it during the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The winning bidder in 1992 was the Han Corp., a New York-based
business that is part of Moon's global business empire. Han Corp.
also owns a multimillion-dollar equestrian center in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The National Auction Group of Gadsden, Ala., will auction the
3,029-acre estate on May 4 on a no-minimum basis.
</P>
<P>
   Moon's Unification Church is known worldwide for its legions of
members, referred to as ``Moonies,'' and for mass marriage
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want someone in Texas to own the ranch,'' said William
Bone, president of the National Auction Group. ``The Rev. Moon said
they don't use it much anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The South Texas ranch had been used mainly as a family retreat
during the past seven years. At times, Moon's business associates
were invited to stay there, Bone said.
</P>
<P>
   Moon visited the ranch about five times, but his children and
grandchildren visited more often.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ranch was never a haven for a bunch of Moonies,'' Bone
added. ``The Rev. Moon enjoyed his visits. He loved it. They went
down there and rode horses. One day he whispered in the ear of his
son-in-law, James Park, `We ought to sell it. We don't use it
anymore.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bidders must first submit $100,000 in certified funds to qualify
for bidding, down from $250,000 required in 1992 when there were 12
registered bidders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rev. Moon has no concern over price,'' said Bone, who was
the auctioneer for the 1992 event.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they want to have a big Texas party at the auction,
like a big going-away party, just like Crawford did'' in 1992, Bone
said. ``They even want to hire the same mariachi band.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1992 auction was patterned after Crawford's legendary
parties at the ranch, including catered food, champagne and
cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   When the gavel closed after five minutes of bidding in 1992,
Crawford quickly approached Park, who had placed the winning bid,
and gave him a hug.
</P>
<P>
   The price ``was a little low,'' Crawford admitted then, adding,
``But I'm going to fish anyway. I'm one of the fortunate ones not
to lose this in foreclosure.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, 65, now lives on South Padre Island. He said he was
unaware that the ranch was to be auctioned again until contacted by
a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the neighbors (of Crawford Farms), the owners
never used it for anything. It's a strange deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone looking for a good horse farm, this is the best for the
money there is,'' Crawford said. He predicted the winning bidder on
May 4 will get a bargain price.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real steal when I sold it. I loved building it. But
now I fish every day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crawford became wealthy through a variety of businesses. He grew
up near Seminole, Okla., the son of an oil company production
foreman, then worked as a flood-control draftsman in Houston and
for Cherco Engineering Inc. of Longview.
</P>
<P>
   He founded Compression Inc. in Houston in 1963, later selling
the company for $4.6 million and using the proceeds to buy a Pearl
Beer distributorship in Corpus Christi. He later sold that and
founded Crawford Enterprises, a company that fabricated natural-gas
compressors, which generated most of his wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Bone said Crawford Farms has been kept in ``immaculate,
manicured condition.''

AUSTRALIA SEEKS RELEASE OF 2 AID WORKERS HELD BY YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID BEARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yugoslavia seized two Australian aid workers nine days ago,
Australia said Friday, a development that has heightened concerns
of Slobodan Milosevic's possible use of foreigners as human
shields.
</P>
<P>
   Following the failure of private efforts to free the two men,
Australia Friday issued a public appeal for their release. The men
were arrested at the Yugoslav-Croatian border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can think of no reason for them to be held, and every
reason for them to be released,'' said Malcolm Fraser, the former
Australian prime minister and director of CARE Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser identified the two as Steve Pratt, operations manager of
CARE Australia's office in Yugoslavia; and Peter Wallace, another
member of the office. He said Australia had received assurances
from Yugoslavia's deputy prime minister, Vuk Draskovic, that the
two were safe and in good health.
</P>
<P>
   By making a public appeal, Fraser is hoping the two aid workers
will not be left behind if President Milosevic's government
eventually makes good on promises to free three US servicemen
captured during a reconnaissance mission near the
Yugoslav-Macedonia border. Both the soldiers and the aid workers
were seized March 31.
</P>
<P>
   CARE Australia joined other aid groups in pulling out of
Yugoslavia's troubled Kosovo province ahead of NATO's air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt, 49, and Wallace, 30, were headed to neighboring Croatia
when they were arrested by Yugoslav border guards, said Fraser, in
Boston for a conference at Harvard University's Kennedy School of
Government.
</P>
<P>
   The two were en route to the Yugoslav republic of Macedonia to
set up a camp for Kosovar Albanians driven out by Yugoslav
Milosevic's forces, Fraser said. He had no details on why they were
detained.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers said the capture underlines the dangers of doing
good in turbulent places. US and NATO officials have previously
expressed fears of Kosovar Albanians and other foreigners being
used as human shields to deter NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fear is something aid workers feel every day. Aid is put
on the front lines every day. We are looking at brave people who
are on the front lines who just want to help poor people,'' said
Rita Stone-Smith, a spokesman for CARE-USA in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser and aid workers, seeking more details on the detention,
remain mystified on why Yugoslavia would target members of a
non-NATO nation, uninvolved in the current bombing campaign.

 49ERs SUE OUSTED CO-OWNER  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The corporation that controls the San Francisco
49ers has sued ousted co-owner Edward J. DeBartolo Jr. in a
stunning move that could kill any chance of a quick end to the
family feud that is casting doubt over the future of the team's
$525 million stadium project.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo was accused Thursday in the lawsuit filed in San
Francisco Superior Court of reneging on a $94 million debt to the
corporation and cutting a side deal on the stadium project with the
developer of an adjoining mall, the Mills Corp. of Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged deal would have paid him $10 million and given him a
22 percent interest in the mall, according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo's conduct, the lawsuit said, ``jeopardizes the team,
the stadium project, and the interests of the greater San Francisco
community.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo's spokesman, Rick Rice, denied the charges and said
DeBartolo intended to countersue for more than $100 million in
damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lawsuit is a sad and desperate act,'' Rice said, saying it
was intended to keep DeBartolo from controlling the club and from
regaining an ``equal say in the running of the family businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The football team is controlled by the Edward J. DeBartolo Corp.
of Youngstown, Ohio, which is co-owned by DeBartolo and his sister,
Denise DeBartolo York, the corporation's chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
   The siblings have been sparring for more than a year over
ownership of the team and its future. In late February, York placed
her husband, John York, in charge of the football team and ordered
Niners personnel not to answer DeBartolo's questions about the team
or allow him access to the club's cash without her written
approval.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, sources said DeBartolo owed the corporation more
than $90 million.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear how the lawsuit filed Thursday
would affect the long-delayed plans for the stadium and adjoining
mall, originally intended to be completed by the 2003 football
season.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Singer, a spokesman for the DeBartolo Corp., said the
company remained committed to the project.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the club said, ``Anytime you get in a lawsuit,
it puts a damper on things, but it doesn't keep the corporation
from doing the work to make the stadium and mall a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit shows that ``if you lie down with crooks, you're
going to get dirty,'' said Doug Comstock, a leader of the Committee
to Stop the Giveaway. The group has sued to overturn the June 1997
ballot propositions narrowly approved by San Francisco voters that
gave the 49ers a green light for the stadium and mall and
authorized $100 million in city bonds for construction of the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit's allegation that DeBartolo engaged in
``self-dealing'' in a side arrangement with Mills ``is just
beautiful _ it makes my day,'' Comstock said.
</P>
<P>
   National Football League commissioner Paul Tagliabue suspended
DeBartolo from activity related to the Niners through February
2001. The suspension came after DeBartolo pleaded guilty in October
to a federal felony for his role in a Louisiana
gambling-and-bribery case. He has had no official position of
authority in the DeBartolo corporation or with the 49ers since
December 1997, when he stepped down voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit accuses DeBartolo of, among other things, ``verbally
abusing team officers'' and ``charging substantial personal
expenses to the team.'' It also accuses him of ``orchestrating
meetings regarding the stadium project, arranging off-site meetings
of team managers, and demanding a voice in team affairs including
... top management and other personnel and player issues.''

THE TRUTH ABOUT `NO-GAS FRIDAY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LONNIE BROWN   
 The Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On April 30, you, gentle reader, can bring the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries to its knees. And, even better, see
gasoline prices plummet.
</P>
<P>
   That's the claim behind the latest chain-letter e-mail making
the Internet rounds. It calls for a No-Gas Friday on April 30;
purchases are to be made on the day before or the day after.
</P>
<P>
   That tactic won't make one whit of difference in the price of a
gallon of gasoline, which, even after creeping up 15 cents or so in
past weeks, is still priced at its lowest level in decades. But
this idea could have another _ albeit misdirected _ result: It
could show the power of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   First, here's the text, sent by an anonymous author and passed
along by millions:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time we did something about the price of gasoline in
America! We are all sick and tired of high prices when there are
literally millions of gallons in storage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Know what I found out? If there was just ONE day when no one
purchased any gasoline, prices would drop drastically. The
so-called oil cartel has decided to slow production by some 2
million barrels per day to drive up the price. I have decided to
see how many Americans we can get to NOT BUY ANY GASOLINE on one
particular day!
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's have a GAS OUT! Do not buy any gasoline on APRIL 30,
1999!!!!!
</P>
<P>
   ``Buy on Thursday before, or Saturday after. Do not buy any
gasoline on FRIDAY, APRIL 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we need is a few million to participate in order to make a
difference. We CAN make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you get the impression that this is written by the same type
of person who writes about the viruses you can get by opening
e-mail ``SO DON'T OPEN `WIN A HOLIDAY' OR YOUR VCR WILL STOP
FLASHING 12:00!!!''
</P>
<P>
   Yep, there are all-capital letters here and the obligatory row
of exclamation points designed to lend urgency to the message.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another thing that's troubling: ``Know what I found out?
If there was just ONE day when no one purchased any gasoline,
prices would drop drastically.''
</P>
<P>
   Sez who?
</P>
<P>
   Where do you suppose the writer learned of such economic theory?
Alan Greenspan? Jay Leno? Cher? There's no attribution.
</P>
<P>
   I'd bet it wasn't Federal Reserve Board Chairman Greenspan. He
knows too much about economic theory, particularly about the
supply-and-demand part that works like this:
</P>
<P>
   OPEC isn't getting the prices it wants for its oil, so it cuts
production. That means there's less gas to go around, and people
who want it will bid up the price for what's left.
</P>
<P>
   The prices go up because the demand has not decreased along with
the supply.
</P>
<P>
   What does No-Gas Friday propose to do? It simply wants to move
the purchase date of gasoline from Friday to a day before or a day
after. Only the date of purchase has been changed _ not the demand
for gas.
</P>
<P>
   Customers are buying gas on a different day, but in the scheme
of things, no one has reduced consumption one ounce. Do you really
think OPEC cares if you don't buy gas collectively on a Friday or a
Wednesday _ so long as you buy the same amount?
</P>
<P>
   But that's one of the reasons this message is making such quick
rounds on the Internet: It requires no real sacrifice on anyone's
part, yet some great amount of good is supposed to be the end
result.
</P>
<P>
   It's like the e-mail (hoaxes, I'll warn now, so you don't fall
for them) messages that tell you to send copies of the e-mail to
the American Cancer Society (or some organization) and they'll
donate $5,000 to research for every 10,000 copies they receive.
``Buy gas on a day other than Friday and OPEC will send gasoline
prices tumbling.''
</P>
<P>
   No skin off your nose. Plenty of skin off the kneecaps of Saudi
kings when they hit the desert sand begging consumers to buy gas on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Let's also remember that gasoline prices have dropped in the
past decade, reaching their lowest point last year _ on an
inflation-adjusted basis _ in 30 years. We're now supposed to
launch a one-day boycott because gas prices are still at their
lowest prices in years?
</P>
<P>
   Why do I bother to even pass the message along?
</P>
<P>
   Unintentionally, this e-mail may have a different result than
its goal.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline prices aren't going to tumble because we buy gas on
Thursday or Saturday instead. But what it could demonstrate is the
tremendous influence, communication power, and consumer-buying
power of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And if you'd like to give the clueless a clue about what the
Internet is all about, you might want to stay away from the gas
pumps on April 30. You might even want to buy gasoline on Friday,
April 16, and again on Friday, April 23, leading up to the
last-Friday-in-April Gas Out to make the impact even more
noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   Before you decide to participate, I'll point to a cautionary
flag raised by Barbara Mikkelson, who helps run The San Fernando
Valley Folklore Society's Urban Legends Reference Pages
(www.snopes.com). She debunked the ``No-Gas Friday'' e-mail
recently and noted: ``Who's to say that service stations won't
simply cash in on a bonanza by jacking up their prices the day
after the great gas out?''
</P>
<P>
   Good question.
</P>
<P>
   Will they notice in OPEC headquarters? They'll miss Friday
purchases as much as if someone had stolen a grain of sand from the
desert.
</P>
<P>
   Will they notice in corporate offices in America? If they're
smart they will.

`LEAF ON A PILLOW': A DAY TO DAY EXISTENCE IN INDONESIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Leaf on a Pillow,'' the Indonesian filmmaker Garin Nugroho's
dispassionate portrait of lower-class street life in Jakarta, hits
you in the face with almost unimaginable squalor and a patchwork of
teeming sights and sounds that are more than the senses can take
in. The film, which has a sketchy screenplay, follows three
footloose boys _ Sugeng, Heru and Kancil _ who portray dramatized
versions of their own directionless lives.
</P>
<P>
   Without education or supervision, the ragged youths who drift
around the city doing odd jobs have no future other than the work
they can scrape up from day to day. They are sheltered in the dank,
rotting workshop and living space of Asik (Christine Hakim), a
hard-working batik merchant who supplements her meager income by
making wedding garlands and other decorative items. Asik is
estranged from a bitter, abusive husband who behaves violently on
the rare occasions when he shows up. Despite her hardships, Asik
comports herself with an almost regal dignity as she makes her
daily rounds.
</P>
<P>
   The movie trails the boys as they search for work, play
children's games and engage in petty wheeling and dealing. One boy
imagines that because someone has taught him to write the letter A,
he is suddenly literate and can make a living as an engraver.
</P>
<P>
   The loosely structured, documentary-flavored film doesn't grab
the emotions by asking us to care about these people. It is a
really detached, despairing distillation of the impoverished
existence of millions of urban Indonesians who are defined in the
movie more by their social circumstances than by individual
personality traits. The boys are at particular risk because they
have no legal identities. In a ruthless insurance scam that claims
one of their lives, young men without papers are recruited,
supplied with false identities, then killed to collect the
payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaf on a Pillow'' shows that no matter how hard the struggle
for survival may be for the underclass, the life force keeps them
going.  &QL;

CAPITAL GIRDS FOR GRIDLOCK AND TIGHT SECURITY AT NATO SUMMIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 11)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If you're planning a spring vacation in the
nation's capital on the weekend of April 23-25, you might want to
think again.
</P>
<P>
   The city is in a dither preparing for NATO's 50th anniversary
celebration, a weekend of pomp, parties and police dogs. U.S.
officials hosting the delegates from the 19 NATO nations are
bracing for the largest Washington gathering of foreign leaders
ever.
</P>
<P>
   The festive event was planned long before NATO began military
attacks last month against Yugoslavia. Suddenly, in the middle of
NATO's first-ever attack on a sovereign country, security concerns
are threatening to overwhelm what should have been a celebration of
allied unity and victory in the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Although few details have been released, streets for blocks
around the White House will be closed during the summit to local
traffic as 1,700 dignitaries _ including 42 heads of states _ and
3,000 international media representatives descend in miles of
motorcades.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say security demands will require rerouting of traffic
and a small army of bomb-sniffing dogs, Secret Service,
metropolitan police, U.S. Park Police, State Department security
personnel and agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Most official summit activity will take place between the White
House and the Ronald Reagan Building several blocks east on
Pennsylvania Avenue. Other summit events will stretch across town,
from Capitol Hill to Vice President Gore's residence on embassy row
along Massachusetts Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government is so concerned about the gridlock caused by
the security requirements and 40-plus motorcades that 90,000
federal employees are being told to stay home on Friday, April 23.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a city long accustomed to car-bomb barriers and stretch
limousines, the birthday party for the NATO alliance founded in
1949 as a counterweight to the Soviet Union is a major event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of it as a state visit times 50,'' said Mary Anne
Reynolds, a spokeswoman for the Greater Washington Board of Trade,
the regional chamber of commerce for the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of workers are hammering out logistics. The executive
branch has opened an office with 50 employees to work on questions
of security, hotel rooms, food and transportation for the
delegations.
</P>
<P>
   The total price tag for the event is estimated at about $24
million, with the U.S. government contributing $16 million to $18
million, and private donations picking up the rest, according to
Kim Rubey, a spokeswoman for the NATO summit.
</P>
<P>
   Carla Hargrove, vice president of Hargrove Inc., in suburban
Lanham, Md., which is providing the stage sets and tables for the
meetings, said ``it isn't quite as big as an inauguration for us
because there aren't the parades and galas, but it's close.''
</P>
<P>
   The event will kick off on April 23 with a military ceremony
outside the Andrew Mellon Auditorium, site of the signing of the
original NATO treaty, on Constitution Avenue. The gathering will be
the first attended by NATO's three newest members: Poland, Hungary
and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony, foreign ministers from the 19 NATO countries
will move into the auditorium for a meeting of the North Atlantic
Council, NATO's governing political body. The meeting, which is
likely to focus on the current crisis in Yugoslavia and shaping
NATO for future peacekeeping missions, continues through the next
day.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday afternoon, the NATO representatives will meet with
foreign ministers from 25 central and eastern European countries
which once were in the Soviet orbit to discuss military security
matters in the post-Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
   The summit concludes Sunday with a press conference by NATO
secretary General Javier Solana. NATO officials are expected to
unveil what they call a new strategic concept for the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from sobering matters of state, there are parties, galas,
banquets and schmooze opportunities galore.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is hosting a dinner for the leaders of the
NATO countries; Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Secretary
of Defense Cohen are hosting a dinner for foreign and defense
ministers; Hillary Clinton is hosting a luncheon for the spouses of
heads of state; Tipper Gore is planning a luncheon. And those are
just a few.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the diplomatic corps is planning parties at
embassies across town.
</P>
<P>
   The menus are varied for the weekend, but the emphasis is on
American-style food.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't going to be a lot of fancy-shmancy European fare''
like caviar, said Susan Lacz, a partner at Ridgewell's Caterer,
Bethesda, Md., one of the area's largest caterers.
</P>
<P>
   Dignitaries coming to the United States usually expect American
food, Lacz said. ``We're going to serve traditional American foods
like lamb and asparagus and tenderloin of beef,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most pressing logistical feats is transportation for
low- and mid-level dignitaries who don't merit their own limousines
and motorcades.
</P>
<P>
   That job is managed by Event Pro-ssss, an event-planning company
in Silver Spring, Md. Sue Fern, a managing partner at the firm,
said 80 buses will be on hand to shuttle the delegations. ``We are
having high-caliber, high-quality buses,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kane, a vice president of International Limousine
service which is providing about 35 buses for the NATO festivities,
said his drivers are girding for long days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to be moving people around town about 19 hours a
day,'' said Kane, with many runs to the region's three airports and
Andrews Air Force Base to pick up delegations and stragglers.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service is demanding that all bus drivers undergo
extensive background checks. Each vehicle will be searched for
weapons and bombs when seeking entry to an area sealed off to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Housing the crush of diplomats and international media hasn't
been difficult because the city has ample space, about 24,000 hotel
rooms, said Dan Mobley, president of the Washington, D.C.
Convention and Visitors Association.
</P>
<P>
   But a deft diplomatic hand at the State Department was
occasionally required to sort out conflicting hotel requests from
different delegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem was that some delegations from different
countries like the same hotels,'' said Mobley. ``Several countries
might want Hotel X and everybody can't have Hotel X.''

 &HT;    GUANTANAMO BAY PREPARED FOR REFUGEES ... BUT WILL ANYONE COME?
 &HT;    Moving in (i) international and (w) Washington categories
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   MIAMI -- Aritonne Georges grew up in Haiti, the western
hemisphere's poorest country. At age 21, he spent three days at sea
aboard a flimsy boat in an attempt to escape a brutal military
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he claims he passed the worst days of his life at Guantanamo
Bay, the U.S. Navy base in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toilets spilled over and no one bothered to clean them,''
said Georges, 28, a Lake Worth, Fla., resident who stayed at the
base for a month in 1992. ``You had to wait two hours in the hot
sun to get your meals.''
</P>
<P>
   Georges said he prays none of the Kosovo refugees ever steps
foot on the base, some 4,700 miles from their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of that happening, however, was announced
Tuesday by President Clinton. He said the United States would
provide temporary refuge for up to 20,000 Albanian victims of the
Kosovo crisis there.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, some administration officials hinted the plan might
be scrapped because refugees are being better cared for in Albania,
Macedonia, and in other parts of Europe thanks to widespread relief
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   And many refugees have expressed a desire to stay close to home.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, officials said they planned to retain the option of
housing refugees in Cuba. They said that just because Kosovo
refugees aren't anxious to go now does not mean they won't want to
go in two or three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This option may look more attractive to refugees down the
road,'' said Navy Lt. Jane Campbell of the U.S. Southern Command,
or Southcom. ``This may be an option the U.S. government keeps open
for weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin acknowledged Friday
that -- for now -- most refugees aren't interested in being moved
to foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``we are prepared to implement our commitment, but the
commitment will be determined by what is required on the ground,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Southcom officials continued Friday to prepare the dusty,
45-square-mile base for the refugees, saying they could immediately
accommodate 500 people, and up to 7,500 in one or two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   They said ``several hundred'' planners, medical personnel, and
U.S. Army engineers from bases in Puerto Rico were due in Cuba over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the military transported enough lumber from Gulfport,
Miss., to build frames for at least 100 tents. The military is also
searching for linguists fluent in Albanian, and has found a Muslim
chaplain in the U.S. Atlantic fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that there's a strong reconsideration of the entire
plan, but we're still driving onward unless we're told to stop,''
said Southcom's Lt. Col. John Snyder of Southcom.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Charles E. Wilhelm, the head of Southcom, which oversees
military operations in the Caribbean and Central and South America,
visited Guantanamo Bay on Thursday to check on preparations. He was
expected to make a return trip within the next several days.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim ends)
</P>
<P>
   Civilians who have spent time at Guantanamo Bay said they're
appalled that preparations continue, while refugee officials --
including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees --
urged the Clinton administration to scratch the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heat and the isolation and the mosquitoes, which are
called teeth because they hurt so bad, are enough to drive most
people nuts,'' said Joyce Feilke, a school counselor from Austin,
Texas, who worked on the base in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place is so isolated that living there feels like living
on Mars,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Feilke and others argue that Kosovo refugees --already
traumatized at the hands of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
-- should be housed at a comfortable, less-isolated location on the
U.S. mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can accommodate more than 20,000 people at rock concerts in
Austin,'' she said. ``Believe me, they'd be happier staying at a
campsite here than in Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugee advocates also protested an announcement by the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service that refugees at Guantanamo
Bay would not be allowed to apply for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the U.S. Committee for Refugees, a private
humanitarian group in Washington, estimated it would cost the
United States $180 million to house 20,000 Kosovars in Cuba for six
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe money should be put into helping Albania and
Macedonia care for them,'' said John Fredriksson, associate
executive director. ``We hope the administration will completely
change its policy by early next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hammer, a spokesman for the National Security Council in
Washington, said preparations at Guantanamo Bay will continue,
although no one will be forced to go there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we've heard any cries of outrage over the idea
of going to Cuba,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is figuring out the logistics of offering people
the option of going to different places,'' he said. ``It's not like
we have one table set up for Turkey, and one set up for Germany,
and then one for Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammer said no refugee has even been ``formally asked'' to go to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps over the weekend we might learn if anyone wants to
come,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. plan to shelter refugees in Cuba has drawn a unique
offer of cooperation from the Cuban government, which condemns the
NATO attacks on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human beings are really suffering and so the Cuban government
wants to support these people any way it can,'' said Luis
Fernandez, a spokesman for the Cuban Interests Section in
Washington. ``We offer our assistance, especially medical
assistance, which we're in a better position to give than food.''
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   The government of Fidel Castro objects to the U.S. presence at
Guantanamo Bay, some 620 miles from Havana. It which was leased in
perpetuity to the United States by Cuba's pre-revolutionary
government.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, the base was used to house some 50,000 Cubans
and Haitians trying to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
   When he was there, Georges said, he shared a tent the size of a
typical U.S. bedroom with 15 other Haitian men. The tent had no
windows, meaning almost no air circulated inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would sit in that hot tent, day after day, playing cards or
dominoes, always wondering when we'd be able to get out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a prison,'' he said. ``I almost went insane.''

FAT WALLETS AND PRICEY SCOTCH: WHISKEY AS RARE AS FINE WINE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 11)  
 (bl)  
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   LONDON _ A broken barrel stave found in the 1970s. Britain's
wartime energy pinch. What could such historical flotsam have to do
with modern American liquor chic?
</P>
<P>
   Ask the drinkers who pay up to $980 to taste one shot of fine
single-malt whiskey. Their palates and wallets, and their interest
in the curious origins of some of their favorite tipples, have set
off a scramble by Scottish distillers and their American marketers
to uncover ever rarer, more exotic single malts. Unlike blended
whiskeys, single malts are those produced in a single distillery in
a single production run.
</P>
<P>
   Single-malt drinking has become something between a mini-boom
and a cult phenomenon in some American bars, and the most prized
bottles can be as avidly pursued by as fine old Bordeaux: The
Macallan '46, for instance, is sold (mainly to collectors) at
$2,500 a bottle, and the Bowmore 40 _ referring to its age, not a
year _ brings $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   The cachet of top single malts like these rubs off on sibling
whiskies. ``In marketing jargon, it's the halo effect,'' said David
Cox, marketing controller for the Macallan brand at Highland
Distillers. ``It elevates the quality image of the whole range.''
</P>
<P>
   Scarcity is part of the appeal. ``People love the fact that it
can never happen again,'' said James French, of Remy Amerique, the
unit of Remy Cointreau that markets The Macallan in the United
States. ``Once you've got a bottle of that, there's no more left.''
The Macallan distillery turns out 220,000 12-bottle cases a year
these days, but only 250 cases were ever made of the Macallan '46 _
and 150 of them were exported, mostly to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowmore 40, produced by Morrison Bowmore Distillers, is even
rarer. Just 294 bottles were produced, said Anne Riives, who
handles the company's public relations in New York, and only 60
were shipped to America. Burglars stole a bottle from a Canadian
store, Ms. Riives said, and told the owner, `` `Pay us $3,000 or
the bottle gets it.''' The store did not pay and the whiskey was
not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Collectors buy by the bottle, but drinkers buy by the shot, at
astonishing prices. A shot of Bowmore 40 fetches $980 at the Hole
in One bar on Second Avenue in Manhattan; other rare malts cost up
to $385 a shot, and The Macallan '46 usually runs to $250.
</P>
<P>
   Who is paying? Recent recipients of fat Wall Street bonuses are
often cited. ``It's the result of a very healthy economy for six
years,'' said Michael Stoner, of Schieffelin &AMP; Somerset, which
markets the huge United Distillers and Vintners line in the United
States. ``This is an indulgence that people can afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming at a time when Americans are buying less imported blended
whiskey, the high-end single-malt phenomenon has distillers hunting
for ever more arcane whiskies to offer. ``There has been an
enormous proliferation of expensive, rare bottlings,'' Stoner said.
But though the special bottlings grab the headlines, the single
malts selling for $30 to $60 a bottle drive the market. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From 1992 to 1997, imports of leading single-malt Scotch
whiskies almost doubled, to the equivalent of 512,000 nine-liter
cases, according to the Adams Liquor Handbook; the much larger
volume of blended scotch imports fell 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Experts don't think drinkers of blended scotch are switching to
single malts. ``They are not the same guys,'' Stoner said. ``The
single-malt game is 25- to 50-year-olds coming in without drinking
scotch before.'' If blended scotch is associated with
run-of-the-mill watering holes, single malts evoke upscale spots
where a shot is accompanied by a fine cigar or, at least, a
discussion of the whiskey's pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a fair amount of ritual that goes along with it,''
Stoner said. ``The first sip is so important: they look and smell
it first, swirl it around and they love the ritual of it. For a
moment there, they are very alone with their favorite malt.''
</P>
<P>
   Single-malt whiskies are usually aged in wooden casks previously
used for other beverages, most often Spanish sherry or bourbon.
Distillers now try to invent new candidates for special single-malt
bottlings by shifting liquor among different combinations of casks
as it ages. But the top single malts got their special
characteristics largely by chance.
</P>
<P>
   While taking inventory in late 1997, David Robertson, Macallan's
whiskey maker, found six vats that had been aging unnoticed since
1946. On tasting it, he found a remarkable smoky ``nose,'' Cox
said, which was traced to a short-lived wartime switch to burning
peat for fuel in the distillery when coal was rationed.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowmore 40 was another accident. ``When it was made, nobody
had any intention of keeping it for 40 years,'' Ms. Riives said.
But, 20 years into its maturing, an apprentice cooper, Jim McEwan,
discovered a broken stave on a sherry cask full of whiskey. He
salvaged what he could and put it in a bourbon hogshead.
</P>
<P>
   His career took him away from the distillery, and the switched
barrel was overlooked for another two decades, until McEwan
returned to Bowmore as general manager and recognized his
handiwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tastes absolutely amazing,'' Ms. Riives said. ``At the end,
you get a little whiff of spice. If anything, it's exotic tropical
fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing was a complete fluke.''

   Big, tough rams may get more sex, but they're victims of their
own success. They run out of sperm before the mating season is
over, so their scrawny competitors end up fathering most late-born
lambs, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Preston of the University of Stirling and his colleagues
studied a flock of wild Soay sheep on the Scottish island of St.
Kilda over three years. They observed the behavior of more than 100
sheep during the mating season, which runs for five weeks in
November and December.
</P>
<P>
   During this time, the heaviest males copulated most. Some had
sex more than 10 times a day thanks to their skills at fending off
other males. But blood samples later revealed that although big
sheep fathered most offspring overall, small sheep fathered just as
many lambs as large ones in the last two weeks of mating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lighter males were gaining in paternity toward the end of
the rut,'' Preston concluded at a meeting of the Association for
the Study of Animal Behavior in Newcastle last week. He believes
this happens because the promiscuous large sheep simply run out of
sperm. &QL;

   Why do we yawn? For no reason, apparently. It's an essential
part of normal lung development in unborn babies, but serves no
purpose in adults, say two researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Other theories on the significance of yawning have ranged from
social cues to a craving for oxygen. But Richard Roberts of the
Genetics and Prenatal Diagnostic Center in Signal Mountain, Tenn.,
thinks differently after studying hour-long ultrasound scans of
fetuses with possible medical problems. The scans showed that
fetuses yawn and hiccup as early as 11 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts and his colleague, Will Blackburn, of the Greenwood
Genetic Center in South Carolina, think these actions reduce
pressure in the lungs and clear out webs of tissue that might block
the airways. Fetal lungs secrete liquid that makes up the amniotic
fluid, along with urine. If the liquid can't escape the lung, the
airways overdilate and are damaged. Babies with congenital
obstructions that prevent fluid from escaping are sometimes born
with deformed lungs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason why babies and adults and children need to
yawn and hiccup,'' says Roberts. He believes these movements
persist in adults as a ``leftover'' behavior that serves no
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it interesting,'' says Robert Provine of the University
of Maryland in College Park, who believes adult yawning is a social
cue to switch activities. He and others have speculated in the past
that yawning might ensure proper development of a fetus's skull.
But he notes that fish and turtles also yawn, so it might merely be
an activity of an ancient ancestor that's now redundant, although
possibly still serving a secondary social role in adults. &QL;

   Q. I am black and a middle manager at a large company. Before
joining it several years ago, I made sure the company had strong
anti-discrimination policies and rising numbers of black and
Hispanic employees. But now it's apparent that members of racial
minority groups are concentrated in departments like public
relations and human resources, with limited prospects for
promotion. Some colleagues are considering a group complaint to the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Should I join them, or
should I try to find a department that gives blacks the best
chances? Or should I leave?
</P>
<P>
   A. What you should do depends a great deal on what kind of
person you are _ and what cost you are willing to pay _ because
there really is no way forward without a price tag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are revolutionaries,'' said Ralph Dechabert,
director of diversity and employee relations at American President
Lines, a shipping company based in Oakland, Calif. ``When they
perceive injustice, they voice displeasure, push overtly, try to
kick in doors. Other people are reformers who say, `I will work
from within.''' The risk for revolutionaries is to find themselves
marginalized; for reformers, to appear to have been co-opted.
</P>
<P>
   Filing a complaint with the EEOC is the revolutionary's path.
You will get your employer's attention, but it is often not the
best first step.
</P>
<P>
   Executives can ``get into a defensive mode,'' said Kevin
Bradley, diversity manager at R.R. Donnelley &AMP; Sons, the commercial
printer in Chicago, which was sued by a group of African-American
former employees in 1996 over allegations of discrimination in
layoffs and transfers. Once a threat of legal action is in the air,
he said, opportunities to discuss the issue rationally and
professionally are more limited.
</P>
<P>
   Opening lines of communication and gathering information about
the problem _ the reformer's path _ is generally a smarter way to
start, said Bradley, who advised finding both minority and
nonminority managers with whom you feel comfortable airing
concerns. ``Talk to people who have been in the trenches and may be
able to help you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a personal level, if you feel undervalued for whatever
reason, you may want to transfer to another department. But
gravitating toward bosses who are seen as giving blacks the best
opportunities may be what caused the imbalance in the first place.
Rather than being shunted there deliberately by the company,
employees may be choosing to work in peripheral departments because
that's where the most enlightened bosses are. Consider whether a
move to a more supportive department is ``putting you in the
mainstream or taking you out,'' Dechabert said. ``Then decide if
you're willing to make that kind of trade-off.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can leave the company, but even that has a price.
A common corporate excuse for falling short of diversity goals is a
lack of good candidates in the pipeline, Dechabert said. ``If you
move on,'' he said, ``you make that real.''

`XIAO WU': PORTRAIT OF A THIEF

<P>
   Like ``Tokyo Eyes'' and ``Trans,'' which are also in the New
Directors/New Films series, the Chinese film ``Xiao Wu'' deals with
a young criminal alienated from his society.
</P>
<P>
   In this instance he is the title character, a nondescript young
man in a shabby city who practices his trade without remorse,
compassion or evident fear although he is known to police, who are
in the midst of a crackdown on crime announced in broadcasts
audible in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   As skillfully written and directed by Jia Zhang Ke, a product of
the Beijing Film Academy who uses a nonprofessional cast, the
cool-eyed ``Xiao Wu'' appears to be more than a relatively
nonjudgmental portrait of an emotionally repressed young thief
turned against the weight of conformity.
</P>
<P>
   The film is also a commentary on a society in flux. Xiao Wu's
old partner in crime is now a wealthy entrepreneur, a cigarette
wholesaler and club operator who is interviewed on television on
the eve of a lavish wedding at which Xiao is pointedly unwelcome.
But in Xiao's eyes, little has changed except nomenclature:
Trafficking in cigarettes is now free trade and running clubs
filled with bar girls is the entertainment business.
</P>
<P>
   Around the rundown city, tenants of small shops are being
evicted so buildings can be torn down to make way for more modern
structures. Mei Mei, the pretty club girl who manages to touch
Xiao's heart and make him drop some of his reserve, promptly runs
off with someone clearly more wealthy and financially stable. And
when Xiao returns to his native village, where he is condemned by
his father, it is a community still living in a past of peasantry,
tradition, dirt roads and crude dwellings.
</P>
<P>
   It is an irony of this film that Xiao is undone by that modern
instrument of communication, the pager, and that in the end, his
skilled hands are shackled.
</P>
<P>

today's cars. Some newer vehicles have up to 42 built-in computers,
controlling everything from the fuel mixture to the brake lights.
When something goes wrong, these can all be accessed through an
onboard diagnostic computer using special equipment. Car
manufacturers give their own dealers the computer protocols and
codes needed to understand the diagnostic system. They are also
supposed to supply it to independent repair shops and makers of
spares, but are often failing to do so _ especially in California,
where strict emission rules were introduced in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Now, say garage owners, the typical three-year warranties on
cars made around that time are running out. And rather than take
their vehicles to garages approved by the maker, owners are going
to cheaper independent mechanics who are being frustrated by the
lack of computer information. They need reference material that
explains how to interpret the output from the onboard diagnostic
computers in the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the window into the electronic world of the car,'' says
Mark Warren, president of the Service Technicians Society, a
professional association that is based in Warrendale, Penn. ``In
order to do the repair properly, all of the information has to be
shared.''
</P>
<P>
   The independent garage owners and parts makers are now asking
the state of California to intervene, because they say it is
largely the state's air pollution regulations that have driven the
development of sophisticated emissions control computers.
</P>
<P>
   But California is slow to react. ``Qualified people must be able
to get the information. To our knowledge that is happening,'' says
Jerry Martin of the California Air Resources Board. The information
can be slow to arrive or be prohibitively expensive, however. And
to get it, Warren says, some mechanics are being forced to buy
proprietary diagnostic equipment when they could easily use their
own systems.
</P>
<P>
   The same applies to spare parts. ``We're trying to get the
information we need to make sure the parts do what the onboard
diagnostic system expects,'' says Aaron Lowe of the Automotive
Parts and Accessories Association in Bethesda, Md. ``We find it
kind of disturbing that California officials don't want to work
with us to resolve the issue.'' One effect could be to worsen air
pollution, Lowe says. Because lack of competition makes parts and
repairs more expensive, people may begin to ignore the warning
lights on their dashboards.
</P>
<P>
   John Cabaniss of the Association of International Automobile
Manufacturers believes that a standard format for the exchange of
engine computer information could help. But he adds that car makers
might not want to share information that could aid tampering with
the emission control system: ``Aftermarket shops really don't need
a lot of the information to do maintenance and service.'' Equipped
with the full information, amateurs or unscrupulous garages
sometimes hack into engine management systems to override the
controls and boost horsepower _ sometimes with dangerous results. &QL;

<P>
   Male flour beetles can impregnate females they have never even
met by getting another male to do the dirty work for them,
biologists have found. Mating by proxy is unheard of in other
animals, and might be a cunning evolutionary strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Gage of Liverpool University and his colleagues were
studying the mating behavior of the flour beetle Tribolium
castaneum to try to find ways of keeping their numbers down. The
beetles are a major pest in stored cereal grain, and are becoming
resistant to the insecticide malathion.
</P>
<P>
   The grain-gobbling insects have complicated sex lives. They
crowd together in bundles of over 100 individuals and are very
promiscuous. Males can mate with three females in a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers watched as flour beetles mated several times
with either malathion-resistant beetles or with a strain
susceptible to the insecticide. Whether or not the offspring had
the single gene that confers resistance revealed the father's
identity.
</P>
<P>
   Males increase their chances of fertilization by using their
spiny genitalia to scrape out a previous suitor's sperm, the team
found. Two-thirds of the time, the second male to mate, rather than
the first, wins the battle to fertilize the female.
</P>
<P>
   But the sperm ousted by the second male seem to have developed a
cunning countermeasure. They stick to a male's genitalia, and if he
mates again within a short period, they can survive the journey to
a second female. In this way, around one in eight females are
fertilized by males they have never met. ``It seems unique. Mating
by proxy is not known in any other organism,'' says Gage.
</P>
<P>
   He believes that sperm have evolved this trick to counter the
males' ability to scoop them out of the females' reproductive
tract. By sticking to the genitalia and remaining viable, the sperm
get a second chance. ``We assume that it's adaptive. Every male is
trying to get the upper hand,'' says Gage. The findings will appear
later this year in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results are bizarre and striking,'' says Scott Pitnick, an
evolutionary biologist at Syracuse University in New York State.
However, he points out that the evolutionary ``strategy'' may
simply be chance. The beetles' sperm may survive no longer than
those of other species, and the effect may simply occur because the
animals mate again so quickly. ``The jury's out in terms of what
this means for evolutionary thinking,'' Pitnick says.
</P>
<P>
   Gage says the beetles' behavior could explain, however, why the
pests are so hard to control. ``Translocation of sperm results in
an extra degree of gene mixing, which could in turn help the spread
of malathion resistance,'' he says. &QL;

TEXAS TOWN IN A STREET FIGHT OVER BIRDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, April 11) 
 
By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   McALLEN, Texas _ This fight is for the birds.
</P>
<P>
   It's for the ungainly chachalaca, known for its shrill morning
wake-up call, the brightly plumed green jay, the raucous great
kiskadee, and the red-crowned parrot that nests in the tall palms.
</P>
<P>
   In this growing border city that calls itself ``The City of
Palms,'' the people who live along South McColl Road are gearing up
for a battle seldom seen in the Rio Grande Valley. The city wants
to widen the last three-quarters of a mile of this street from two
to four lanes.
</P>
<P>
   City leaders estimate that would require cutting down or
transplanting up to two dozen trees that are home to numerous
species of birds. Residents fear many more trees could be lost, and
they say the cost of losing scarce habitat is too great.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trees we have through here just aren't going to be
replaced. They just aren't going to be grown again,'' said longtime
resident Trev Sparks, an organic farmer and musician who also sells
collectible automobiles. ``Man is real good at building things, but
the birds and the trees are God's creations and they have to be
tended by us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamberto ``Bobby'' Balli, city engineer and director of the
Public Works Department, said the street widening is needed to
accommodate the 20,000 vehicles that travel down South McColl every
day. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``I think we're trying to be sensitive to the environmental
issues as best we can while still being sensitive to our growth and
vehicular needs,'' he said. ``I do believe this would cause minimal
impact to the birding environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Balli emphasized that the city is also exploring a
less-intrusive option for widening the road that would reduce the
number of trees that would have to be cut or transplanted. A public
hearing on the project is set for April 19.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the quandary a visitor need only drive down
Business 83, a thoroughfare that cuts across McAllen and as the
name indicates, is all business. This stretch of pavement in the
Valley's busiest city is a four-lane, bustling corridor with block
after block of shiny new and used cars for sale, restaurants and
hamburger stands, gas stations, sporting goods shops, bargain
furniture outlets and tire stores.
</P>
<P>
   But turn off of Business 83 onto South McColl and a lush green
canopy closes in from both sides of the narrow, tree-lined street.
</P>
<P>
   And something else is immediately apparent: The air is filled
with the calls of scores of birds that glide from tree to tree or
graze the undergrowth and flower beds many residents have
cultivated to attract them to their yards.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are semitropical birds such as the chachalaca, a
variety of Mexican parrots, the green jay and others whose range
extends into South Texas and are seldom seen elsewhere in the
country. The local Chamber of Commerce, in the running for a
state-funded birding center, already includes the neighborhood in a
self-guided birding tour pamphlet it distributes.
</P>
<P>
   But now dozens of tiny blue survey flags wave in the front yards
of South McColl, evidence of a plan hatched by city traffic
engineers to widen the street to four lanes, and in some places
carving out a fifth turning lane. On the north side of Business 83
McColl has been widened to five lanes the entire six miles to the
city of Edinburg, and engineers want to finish the job by widening
the last mile of McColl where it runs into the Valley's east-west
expressway and a new shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   The project would create a swath of destruction in the front
yard of Sparks' rambling home at the corner of McColl and Dallas,
gobbling up a huge mesquite tree, a towering anacua tree favored by
birds for its plump berries, 60-foot washingtonia palms and a dozen
other oak, ash and cedar trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it would mow down everybody's trees up and down the
street,'' Sparks said in exasperation.
</P>
<P>
   City leaders, Sparks contends, have lost sight of the fragile
natural beauty that attracted so many to this border city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten so excited that we've become a commercial center
and we're on the map that it's numbed people's minds to what we
have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks' list of birds he has observed in his yard or the
neighborhood has reached 30, including four species of parrots,
four kinds of doves, two varieties of owls and two types of
woodpeckers.
</P>
<P>
   As Sparks sat in his living room, a pair of chachalacas strutted
atop a fence near one of 10 bird watering holes on the property,
searching for a morning meal. One of three mating pairs living on
Sparks' one-acre lot, the birds are part of a neighborhood flock he
estimates at more than 100 of the large, brownish pheasant-like
birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (city planners) seem to think the birds are going to go
somewhere else, but where are they going to go? Every year there
are less and less trees,'' said Virgil Cragar, a retired jet
fighter pilot from the Houston area who lives down the street from
Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to have to scrape out trees on both sides of
this street, and every time you lose a tree you're going to lose
wildlife.''
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife experts agree the remaining habitat in cities is
critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a valid concern,'' said Larry Ditto, a U.S. Fish
and Wildlife biologist who is overseeing a federally funded project
to assemble a 132,000-acre wildlife corridor along the Rio Grande.
During this century, 95 percent of the Valley's native brush and
hardwood thickets were cleared as the region was converted into a
vast winter garden where citrus, vegetables, cotton, grain and
sugar cane are grown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't realize it, but there are so many people in the
Valley that have created habitat in their yards and are feeding
wildlife, providing nesting cover areas for wildlife,'' Ditto said,
adding many cities encourage the practice by passing habitat
ordinances. ``We've done all this habitat creation along the river,
but the cities have a critical role to play in wildlife
conservation in South Texas. It's not just a rural thing.''
</P>
<P>
   What is especially galling to Sparks, Cragar and other residents
is that when residents requested stop lights or stop signs to slow
down the existing traffic, they were told there wasn't enough
volume to warrant the expense.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy City Manager Brent Branham defended the project as a way
to eliminate a traffic bottleneck on what is fast becoming a major
north-south artery, but he said city leaders will listen to the
residents' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is up to us to work with the neighborhood and determine if
there are alternatives that are more acceptable,'' he said.

 `FOOLISH': LAUGHING UNTIL IT HURTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Eds: Production notes appear at end of review.)  &HT;     By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Foolish Waise sort of grows on you. This is, after all, a
streetwise black stand-up comic who performs with a microphone in
one hand and a glass of white wine in the other. His humor can be
painfully simplistic, consisting sometimes of the observation that
there are white people in his audience and boy, are they nervous! A
lot of the time he just seems to be trying to see how many times he
can use the vulgar slang terms for sex and genitalia in a single
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But once in a while, he bursts out with humor that comes from
somewhere deeper. Like the comments about his father, who
disappeared before Foolish (originally named Miles) was born but
now turns up asking for a free ticket to his son's show. Free
ticket? How about what his father owes him? ``Hey, where's my Big
Wheel?'' Foolish demands in his stand-up routine. ``Where's my G.I.
Joe?'' He also has some clever observations about slave trade
routes and hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Foolish is played by Eddie Griffin (the star of the UPN sitcom
``Malcolm and Eddie''), and his story is loosely based on Griffin's
own road to success. ``Foolish,'' which also stars the rapper
Master P as the title character's criminal brother, is rough and
blustery, but its heart is often in the right place and Griffin
shows some real acting ability in the more serious scenes,
especially when he's required to shed his bravado.
</P>
<P>
   The plot is primarily about Foolish's struggle to succeed as a
comic without selling out, but there are subplots about his rocky
relationship with his girlfriend and his brother's career woes. The
brother, who does well enough as a gangster to wear a chunky gold
chain, diamond-framed eyeglasses and frighteningly bright clothes,
runs into some trouble when he is accidentally responsible for the
death of his boss' cousin. That takes place in a peculiar early
scene about poker players and an armed robbery (or what seems to be
one) that leads to a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The film loses complete credibility when the audiences at the
comedy clubs where Foolish works go wild with delight, way out of
proportion to the hilarity of the material. Foolish is just a
little too smug about his artistic integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there really are struggling young comics out there who
would be able to turn down a Paramount film offer of a starring
role (possibly with Harrison Ford) because cross-dressing was
involved _ without even thinking it over for a few minutes; when
Foolish does it, it's not convincing. But then this is not a
tolerant man; in his comedy act he ridicules the gay pride parade,
uses the word ``Chinaman'' and spews misogyny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foolish'' is rated R. It includes strong profanity, graphic
sexual references, full frontal female nudity and violence
involving guns and baseball bats.
</P>
<P>

   Long, long before scientists figured out a way to clone sheep,
filmmakers had divined the secrets of turning one actor into two.
</P>
<P>
   So it comes as no surprise to see the popular Jackie Chan, Hong
Kong's comic master of martial arts, in a double role in ``Twin
Dragons,'' the high-spirited entertainment directed by Tsui Hark
and Ringo Lam, with action sequences contributed by them and an
assortment of Hong Kong directors like John Woo and Kirk Wong.
</P>
<P>
   Made as a fund-raising project for the Directors' Guild of Hong
Kong, this enjoyable blend of action, romance and humor requires
only that the audience suspend its disbelief at the popcorn
counter, ignore the paper-thin plot and dubbed dialogue and watch
the two Chans work out their destinies as twins separated at birth.
</P>
<P>
   As always in Chan's films, the screen is filled with spectacular
stunts: the escape that begins the film, a speedboat pursuit in the
harbor, a fight in the sporting goods section of a department
store, a bus and car chase, a dockside battle involving magnetic
crane and cargo netting and a prolonged finale in an automobile
test shop, where cars are drenched, heated and crashed into solid
walls at 50 miles an hour, the occupant's survival rate depending
on the use of a seat belt.
</P>
<P>
   And as always, no matter how many villains assault him, no
matter how many shots they fire, Chan comes up with a smile and
maybe a scrape or two.
</P>
<P>
   But this time he not only shows his sensitive side, as a
world-famous musician, he also winds up with not one girl but two.
</P>
<P>
   The action starts in 1965, when a wounded gangster shoots his
way out of a Hong Kong hospital, taking hostage a newborn twin boy,
who promptly gets lost in the gunplay, rolls down a hill in a
wheelchair and winds up as the object of devotion of a drunken
young lady of the night. Known as Boomer, he grows up to be an auto
mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   The other infant, John Ma, taken to the New World aboard a Pan
Am flight by his distraught parents, is a childhood piano prodigy
and, at 20, a renowned conductor who arrives in Hong Kong for a
concert, unaware that he has a brother.
</P>
<P>
   In the mischievous screenplay concocted by Barry Wong, Cheung
Tung Jo, Wong Yik and Hark, Boomer and his pint-sized pal, Tyson,
(Teddy Robin, the film's producer) are already in deep trouble with
an army of gangsters demanding that Boomer serve as their driver in
a plot to free their imprisoned boss. If not, Tyson, hospitalized
after a chase, will be penalized.
</P>
<P>
   When the reserved John Ma reaches Hong Kong, an old friend of
his father rapidly propels his pretty daughter, Tammy (Nina Li
Chi), into his bedroom, and it is not long before Tammy and Barbara
(Maggie Cheung), the object of the uninhibited Boomer's affection,
are confusing one for the other. So are the gangsters and the hotel
staff and just about everyone else in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Ma, of course, cannot understand why his physical actions
sometimes uncontrollably mimic those of someone steering a bouncing
boat. And Boomer, who is forced onstage in a packed concert hall
before an orchestra astonished at his technique, which resembles
that of a man steering a getaway bus, is equally puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured that matters sort themselves out in time for a
happy ending.
</P>

ADMISSIONS ASIDE, GET ON WITH LIFE

<TEXT>
<P>
   (Editor's note: This is the 13th year this column has run in
response to reader requests at college acceptance time.)
</P>
<P>
   The rejections arrive this time of year in thin, cheap
envelopes, some with a crummy window for name and address, as if it
were a bill, and none with the thick packet you'd hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear So-and-so: The admissions committee gave full
consideration . . . but I regret to inform you we will be unable to
offer you a place in the Class of 2003.'' Lots of applicants,
limited number of spaces, blah blah blah, good luck with your
undergraduate career, very truly yours, signed: Assistant Dean
Blowhard, rejection writer, Old Overshoe U.
</P>
<P>
   Your space odyssey for 2002 means no space for you. Ugh.
</P>
<P>
   This is the season of college acceptance letters. So it's also
the time of rejection. You're in or you're out. Today is the day
you learn how life is not like high school. To the Ins, who got
where they wanted to go: congrats, great, good luck, have a nice
life, see you later. The rest of this is for the Outs:
</P>
<P>
   You sort of felt it was coming. Your SAT scores weren't the
greatest. Your transcript had some holes in it. You wondered what
your teachers' recommendations would really say, or imply. And you
can't help thinking about that essay you finished at 2 o'clock in
the morning of the day you absolutely had to mail in your
application, that essay which was, well, a little weird.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you could have pulled that C in sociology up to a B-minus.
Maybe you shouldn't have quit soccer to get a job to pay for your
gas. Maybe it was that down period during sophomore year when you
had mono and didn't talk to your teachers for three months while
you vegged out. What difference does it make what it was? It still
hurts.
</P>
<P>
   It hurts where you feel pain most: inside. It's not like the
usual heartache that kids have, the kind other people can't see. An
alcoholic parent, a secret shame, a gaping wound in the family
fabric, these are things one can carry to school and mask with a
grin, a wisecrack, a scowl, a just-don't-mess-with-me-today
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   But everybody knows where you got in, and where you didn't.
Sure, the letter comes to the house. But eventually you've still
got to face your friends. ``Any mail for me?'' is like asking for a
knuckle sandwich. Thanks a lot for the kick in the teeth. What a
bummer.
</P>
<P>
   How do you tell kids at school? That's the hard part. The
squeals in the corridor from the kids who got in someplace
desirable. The supercilious puss on the ones who got early
acceptance, or the girl whose old man has an in at Old Ivy. There's
the class doofus who suddenly becomes the first nerd accepted at
Princeton, the 125-pound wrestling jock who, surprise, surprise,
got into MIT.
</P>
<P>
   But what about you?
</P>
<P>
   You've heard about special treatment for this category or that
category, alumni kids on a legacy ticket or affirmative action
luck-outs or rebounders or oboe players. Maybe they were trying to
fill certain slots.
</P>
<P>
   But you're not a slot. You're you. They can look at your grades
and weigh your scores and see how many years you were in French
Club. But they can't look into your head, or into your heart. They
can't check out the guts department.
</P>
<P>
   This is the important thing: They didn't reject you. They
rejected your resume. They gave some other kid the benefit of the
doubt. Maybe that kid deserved a break. Don't you deserve a break?
Sure. You'll get one. Maybe this is the reality check you needed.
Maybe the school that does take you will be good. Maybe this is the
day you start to grow up.
</P>
<P>
   Look at some people who've accomplished a lot, and see where
they started. Ronald Reagan? Eureka College. Jesse Jackson? They
wouldn't let him play quarterback in the Big Ten, so he quit
Illinois for North Carolina A &AMP; T. Do you know that the heads of
both General Motors and General Electric graduated from UMass? Bob
Dole? He went to Washburn Municipal University.
</P>
<P>
   The majority leader of the US Senate, Sen. Tom Daschle of South
Dakota, went to South Dakota State University. Speaker of the US
House Dennis Hastert went to Northern Illinois University. Dick
Armey, the House majority leader, took a bachelor's degree from
Jamestown College. Winston Churchill? So slow a learner they used
to write to his mother to come take this kid off our hands.
</P>
<P>
   I know what you think: Spare me the sympathy. It still hurts.
But let's keep this in perspective. What did Magic Johnson say to
the little kid who also tested HIV positive? ``You've got to have a
positive attitude.'' What happens when you don't keep a positive
attitude? Don't ask.
</P>
<P>
   This college thing? What happened is you just rubbed up against
the reality of big-time, maybe big-name institutions. Some they
pick, some they don't. You lost. It'll happen again, but hopefully,
it won't have this awful, nasty kick.
</P>
<P>
   You'll get tossed by a girlfriend or a boyfriend. You won't get
the job or the promotion you think you deserve. Some awful disease
may pluck you from life's fast lane and pin you to a bed, a
wheelchair, a coffin. That happens. Bad habits you can change; bad
luck is nothing you can do anything about.
</P>
<P>
   Does it mean you're not a good person? People like you, if not
your resume. There's no one else that can be you. Plenty of people
think you're special now, or will think that, once they get to know
you. Because you are. And the admissions department that said no?
Screw them. You've got a life to lead.
</P>

`TRANS': YOUTHFUL TURMOIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prisons, real and metaphorical, frame ``Trans,'' the atmospheric
first feature written and directed by Julian Goldberger.
</P>
<P>
   Its poignant focus is Ryan Kazinski (played by Ryan Daugherty),
a 16-year-old inmate who escapes from a work detail at the
Southwest Florida Juvenile Detention Center and embarks on a
frenetic, yearning adventure to nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   In a moment of relative relaxation among some good ol' boys at a
rural general store, Ryan speaks his inchoate dream: Move out to
Colorado. Just live.
</P>
<P>
   But as sketched by Goldberger in ``Trans,'' Ryan is a prisoner
of his youth, his ignorance, his lack of money and the
psychological wounds represented by absent parents and solaced only
by an adoring younger brother (Jon Daugherty).
</P>
<P>
   As Ryan makes his way home and struggles toward freedom,
``Trans'' is at its best in depicting a night world of speeding
cars, roadside markets and fast-food shops, knots of young people
out too late _ all cast in the beams of headlights and the glow of
street lamps and neon signs and surrounded by the intermittent wail
of police sirens.
</P>
<P>
   At its weakest, ``Trans'' overstays its welcome among the
real-life characters at the general store and pads Ryan's thieving
visit to a supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Living in the moment, the slim narrative slights the story of
Ryan's past, but ``Trans'' remains a sensitive evocation of
youthful turmoil.
</P>
<P>

 By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the evening began, Taylor Stein, dressed in a
black and white form-fitting Gucci suit, went to find her jacket. A
furry white low-cut tank top she had on was drawing too much
attention from the young (and not so young) gentlemen arriving
Thursday night at Brown's, the new Upper East Side boite where Ms.
Stein is an owner.
</P>
<P>
   One after another, men, some in navy blazers, others in
collarless Armani shirts, flirted with her, caressing her tan fit
arms, as they asked for tables at the club, whose patrons range
from boarding school chums to international playboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh Taylor, we love you,'' said Aram Moezinia, who was sitting
by the open french doors having drinks with three other men.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stein sat on the lap of one of his friends. ``We all tried
to date her at the same time,'' said Moezinia, adding they first
saw Ms. Stein at a nightclub. ``We met her when she was dressed as
Pocahontas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of those guys owns an island off of Brazil,'' Ms. Stein
whispered, ``and we're all flying there in a private plane next
month.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she's known for her flamboyant outfits and blunt chatter,
Ms. Stein, 29, wants to be taken seriously. That's why she took on
Brown's. The American grill restaurant, bar and lounge had been
Gertrude's, a more sophisticated establishment with an older
clientele, run by her father, Howard Stein, who owns clubs like Au
Bar and keeps a watchful eye on this one. He turned it over to Ms.
Stein two months ago to convert into a hot spot. She immediately
replaced what she calls the ``fancy waiters'' with ``great-looking
disco waiters,'' turned up the music and invited her friends.
</P>
<P>
   Stein bankrolled his daughter's new project because he wanted
her to get back on her feet. What had knocked her down was an
article in The New York Observer in December naming her ``This
Year's Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My life fell apart,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The article portrayed her as an outspoken, partying dilettante.
Soon after it was published, she lost her job at William B. May,
the conservative real estate company, where she had almost married
the owner's son.
</P>
<P>
   She retreated to Palm Beach for a few weeks. To her shock when
she returned, the embarrassing press had turned her into a
mini-media star. Someone from the office of Judith Regan, the
celebrity publisher, called to talk about doing a book titled ``How
to Be an It Girl.'' Last week, she said, producers on ``20/20''
interviewed her for a Diane Sawyer segment on New Yorkers who play
hard and work hard. Meantime, Ms. Stein's father gave her the
restaurant, now packed every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called in every favor I could,'' said Ms. Stein, who created
buzz for the restaurant by giving free dinner parties to
journalists, publicity agents and friends. Ms. Stein is at her
clubby restaurant every night, acting as impresario, like the late
Glenn Bernbaum of Mortimer's. Although he certainly never greeted
customers the way she does _ throwing her arms in the air, shaking
her body and cooing, ``Hel-lo.''
</P>
<P>
   Around 10, Ms. Stein was in the upstairs dining room with a
friend from Locust Valley. Within minutes, four well-mannered men
sat down to chat. When Ms. Stein went downstairs, Leonardo
Valentino, a tanned jet-setter in a neon yellow blazer, grabbed her
and wouldn't let her go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love all this kiss-kiss stuff,'' she said, glancing at her
watch, a Cartier Pasha with a diamond tick-tack-toe board (a
present from a former beau). But it was time to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to keep moving,'' said Ms. Stein, heading toward Ralph
Destino III, the 30-something heir to the Cartier fortune. Jacket
off.

SPORTS COLUMN: '69 METS GIVE US REASON TO BELIEVE IN UNDERDOGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BOB PADECKY   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing is too extreme. Nothing is too far from reality. This is
their gift to us.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how powerful the Yankees and Braves might be. No
matter how much we consider them a lock for the 1999 World Series
and the regular season just a tune-up, we have the '69 Mets to give
us hope, the '69 Mets, the little ant who indeed carried that load.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a surprise to us, too,'' said shortstop Bud Harrelson.
</P>
<P>
   We have the '69 Mets, those Amazin' Mets, those incredible,
ridiculous, absurd, goofy, longshot,
put-on-your-seatbelt-daughter-I-can't-believe-this-is-happening
Mets. The '69 New York Mets are to baseball what the '69 Jets are
to football and what the 1980 U.S. men's hockey team are to the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are the reason we still will pay attention to this
baseball season, no matter how preordained it appears, no matter
how boring are the predictions.
</P>
<P>
   We will look for a team this year that finds the lucky bounce
...
</P>
<P>
   ``In Pittsburgh a ball bounced off the top of the fence and back
to Cleon Jones, our left fielder,'' Harrelson said. ``Cleon catches
it on the fly and throws Richie Zisk out at home. He saves the
ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   We will look for a team this year that has a below average
hitter who decides to be Babe Ruth for an afternoon ...
</P>
<P>
   ``In my whole life, I had one hit off Steve Carlton, and it was
a single,'' said right fielder Ron Swoboda. ``Until that game ...
The Cardinals go up, 1-0, and I follow with a two-run homer. The
Cardinals go up, 3-2, and I follow with another two-run homer.
Carlton sets a National League record for most strikeouts in a game
(19) but I beat him with two two-run homers.''
</P>
<P>
   We will look for a team this year that has a pitcher who
suddenly becomes a hitter ...
</P>
<P>
   ``We won a doubleheader against Pittsburgh,'' Harrelson said,
``and the only run driven in each game was by a pitcher (Jerry
Koosman, Don Cardwell).''
</P>
<P>
   We will look for a team this year that gives us a sign from
above ...
</P>
<P>
   ``We were playing the Cubs, the team we were trying to catch,''
said Swoboda, ``and during the game a black cat hops out on the
field. He doesn't go to our dugout. No, he walks right in front of
theirs. It was like right out of central casting. `Hey, let's cue
up the black cat.' And the cat doesn't leave. He keeps walking in
front of the Cubs.''
</P>
<P>
   We will look for a team this year that has no history, no
prospects, a team like the Mets who finished their previous seven
seasons averaging 45 games out of first place ...
</P>
<P>
   ``A victory for us would have been a season in which we ended up
with a .500 record,'' said Swoboda.
</P>
<P>
   We will look for a team that's a bigger loser than a 40-year-old
fat guy with bad breath and protruding ear hair trying to pick up
college coeds. We will look for a team ignored more than a stop
sign in Boston. We will look for a team that will be loved by its
fans for all those reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mets fans just wanted us to entertain them,'' said Swoboda.
``We didn't coe with heavy expectations. So when we won, it was
like paying off a loan. Going down Broadway in a New York City
ticker tape parade, we just slapped a smile on a million faces. We
grabbed a little piece of their heart and we never gave it back. I
know we did because every time I go back to New York, everyone
tells me what I did for them 30 years ago. This is heady stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   So heady the Mets will hold numerous celebrations in this 30th
anniversary year over that '69 team. It's as if the '69 Mets are as
alive now as they were then.
</P>
<P>
   ``No team has lived this long,'' said first baseman Ed
Kranepool. ``To think we would still be celebrating 30 years later,
name a team that has done that. I grew up in the Bronx as a Yankee
fan and as great as those Yankee teams were, I can't remember now
one over another.''
</P>
<P>
   But these are the '69 Mets, the hope for every fan this year who
lives outside of New York City, Atlanta and perhaps Los Angeles.
These are the '69 Mets, with a team batting average of .242, with
just 109 homers, with Tom Seaver the only one Hall of Famer (Nolan
Ryan was in a supporting role), beating the great Aaron and Niekro
in playoffs, and the great Brooks and Frank Robinson and Jim Palmer
in the Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a laughingstock,'' said Kranepool, an opinion he
doesn't dispute. ``Of course, Baltimore was a better team than us.
So was Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   But they won. They won just months after Neil Armstrong walked
on the moon, an accomplishment that left some people no more in
disbelief than calling the Mets the best team in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what it felt like?'' said Harrelson. ``It was like
you remembering where you were when it happened. Like you
remembered where you were when Kennedy was assassinated. Like you
remembered where you were when man walked on the moon. Like you
remembered where you were when the Mets won the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   And oh, some of you might say, this couldn't have happened. How
absurd this sounds. And you'd be right ... if you are under the age
of 35. Yes, it was absurd and ridiculous and unimagineable. Too bad
you weren't around for it. It was fabulous. Absolutely fabulous.
Real heady stuff.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A condom confrontation is taking place in a federal courtroom in
Newark in an emotionally charged dispute over the exquisite
architecture of the prophylactic.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the imbroglio is Dr. Alla Venkata Krishna Reddy,
59, a surgeon turned businessman and inventor, who for the last
decade has been a quixotic and controversial figure in the
prophylactic world. Reddy's designs for condoms with built-in
bulges are an attempt to rethink the way condoms work, prompting
Adam Glickman, the founder of Condomania, a specialty retailer and
Internet-based mail-order company, to call the taciturn Indian
designer ``the Leonardo da Vinci of the condom.''
</P>
<P>
   The court case, which involves a patent dispute over two Reddy
designs, has unwittingly opened a window on the high art of condom
design, as conservatively dressed lawyers, clutching male
mannequins reduced to their most essential parts, argue the fine
points of pouches and bulges and what constitutes design innovation
in a condom.
</P>
<P>
   One of humankind's most ubiquitous, if humble, products, the
coiled protector secreted in foil had a Renaissance period during
the 1980's, when sales surged in the wake of AIDS anxiety. But
recently, in part because of fear fatigue and a reluctance even
among the converted to keep using condoms, sales nationally have
plateaued. Recent studies by Family Health International, a company
that focuses on reproductive health and intervention, show that
condom use disappears three months into a relationship, one reason
why, this summer, New York University will be the host of the third
annual National Symposium on Overcoming Barriers to Condom Use.
</P>
<P>
   Reddy, who is not affiliated with a big company, has been part
of a new school of thought that seeks to revamp the contemporary
image of condoms from necessary evil to alluring sex enhancer. He
began designing barrier contraceptives, some of them downright
bizarre, in 1986 while researching the AIDS virus, convinced that
condoms were the only hope. ``My gut feeling was there was not
going to be a cure or a vaccine,'' Reddy recalled.
</P>
<P>
   His Pleasure Plus condom, which when inflated resembles an
upside-down Boeing 747, was considered by some to be a radical
departure when it was introduced in the early 1990s. It embodied
Reddy's belief that ``if you developed a condom with more pleasure,
people would use it regularly.''
</P>
<P>
   Although condoms with mildly flared tops had been introduced
before, Pleasure Plus was notable for its asymmetry and for
exploiting the friction inherent in moving latex. It had a baggy
tubular pouch that sidled up against the underside of the glans
penis. ``He understood nerve endings and anatomy,'' Glickman of
Condomania said, adding that the Pleasure Plus developed a
``cult-like following'' and outsold all other condoms in
Condomania's retail stores in New York and Los Angeles by 10 to 1.
``Compared to what was out there, it was the difference between the
San Fernando Valley and the Grand Canyon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But less than a year after it was introduced, the Pleasure Plus
disappeared from shelves because of manufacturing problems. Reddy's
company went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tragedy _ consumers were desperately trying to find
this condom that had changed their sex lives,'' said Davin Wedel,
the founder of the Global Protection Corp., a Boston-based company
trying to bring back the Pleasure Plus. The company is working with
Portfolio Technologies, a group of investors based in Kenilworth
Ill., who bought the rights to the condom.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Reddy, who divides his time between Chennai,
India, and Plainsboro, N.J., has dreamed up a new design, the
Inspiral, which he calls ``the best I've created.'' It is indeed a
visually stunning work that, when active, has a spiral shape
evocative of a whipped-cream dollop or a Nautilus shell. More
important is its spring action, a motion Reddy's patent lawyer,
John C. Evans, likens to a pogo stick and the doctor himself
compares to ``the shock absorber of a car.''
</P>
<P>
   Reddy has invested $7 million, including a $4 million loan from
the Indian Government, to build a factory in India, with 60 to 100
employees, to make the Inspiral. About 590,000 of the condoms were
on the verge of being distributed to the Eckerd and Genovese drug
store chains, to Planned Parenthood and to other customers when the
current legal squabble began. In the case, Portfolio Technologies _
the owner of the rights to the Pleasure Plus _ is seeking a
temporary injunction in the U.S. district court in Newark to block
the Inspiral, which the plaintiffs say is basically the same condom
as the Pleasure Plus.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the debate centers on whether there is a difference
between Pleasure Plus' pouch and Inspiral's grand, helix-shaped
bulge. ``If there's a bulge that creates a looseness in an area
that contacts the user, and moves back and forth to create enhanced
sensation, then it's covered by the patents,'' said Robert W.
Smith, a lawyer specializing in patent infringements who is
representing the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Reddy, who has been a far better designer than businessman _ he
left a string of creditors in the wake of his Pleasure Plus
collapse _ is arguing that the spring action of the Inspiral and
the resulting movement make it novel. A patent for the new device
is pending. Although not on the market, the condom was included in
a test by Cosmopolitan magazine recently, and was the only model
awarded a 10 out 10 by groups of men and women. Amy Fraley, a
health care clinic worker in northern Michigan who has tried the
Inspiral, said she noticed increased sensation. ``It was the closet
thing to not using anything at all I've had with a condom,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   A judge's ruling on the injunction request is expected this
week. If the injunction is denied, Reddy says he is prepared to
have his 590,000 Inspirals, now in a warehouse in Tulsa, Okla.,
distributed immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Reddy said he ``never touched a condom'' until his AIDS
research. He is married with three sons _ ``three sons and a tubal
ligation, that's it!'' he muttered. He seems sincere, if fixated,
on his cause and speaks in the guarded, measured manner of a
doctor. He comes across as a reluctant entrepreneur, although he
stands to grow rich if the Inspiral captures even a fraction of the
market for condom sales in the United States, which was $247
million for the last 52-week period, according to A.C. Nielsen, the
ratings company.
</P>
<P>
   Like many inventors, Reddy's obsession borders on the eccentric,
and he always seems to be looking over his shoulder. ``The more
they know about the Inspiral, the crazier they will be to stop
it,'' he said of his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   His quest for the perfect condom is part of a grand tradition
documented in the book ``American Sex Machines: The Hidden History
of Sex at the U.S. Patent Office'' by Hoag Levins (Adams Media,
1996). Reddy's first ill-fated design was the so-called ``Bikini
condom,'' a scary looking contraption for women that looked like an
errant rubber garter belt. .....ke other products, condoms have
gone through booms and busts. Before the 1980s, when AIDS sparked a
flurry of new designs, the stylistic apogee came in the wake of the
1936 nullification of the Comstock Law, a 19th-century Act of
Congress that prohibited contraceptives, including ``immoral rubber
articles.'' The law had forced the condom underground, where it was
furtively sold in barbershops and shoeshine parlors.
</P>
<P>
   Condoms, which throughout their history have mirrored society's
attitudes toward sex, disease and body image, are believed to date
back to linen sheaths worn 3,000 years ago by the Egyptians. The
modern era of condom design began with the vulcanization of rubber
in the 1840s, which, as Levins writes, provided the first ``safe
and effective interface between machinery and internal human
organs.'' Attitudes toward the condom changed radically between the
two World Wars, culminating in the distribution of millions of
condoms to GI's during World War II by a military worried about the
spread of venereal disease.
</P>
<P>
   The embrace of the Pill in the 1960s rendered the condom almost
obsolete. But it rebounded in the 1980s with concern about AIDS.
Condom manufacturers flooded the market with new textures, colors
and scents. In 1987, the Japanese introduced the Kimono brand, a
superthin latex condom in which the idea of pleasure was prominent.
Thin condoms now account for 28 percent of the American market,
said Carol Carroza, marketing director for Ansell Healthcare
Products, makers of the Life Styles brand.
</P>
<P>
   Large-scale manufacturers are now attempting to tackle new
frontiers. Chief among them is anxiety about using condoms, or what
Catherine Taylor, a group director for London International Group,
makers of Durex, the world's largest condom brand, calls ``the
fumble factor _ where in the throes of passion you have to open the
pack.'' The prime reason condoms fail is because of misuse. The new
Durex Topaz condom, not yet available in the United States, is
geared to new users or ``those lacking confidence,'' Ms. Taylor
said. It comes with a glow-in-the-dark ring to guide quavering
fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Ansell recently introduced packaging inspired by single-serve
butter packs with peel-off lids. It automatically positions the
condom. The idea came from a designer who noticed that many people
open condom packs with their teeth, Ms. Carozza said.
</P>
<P>
   The Reality female condom, made out of polyurethane, has been
widely distributed in developing countries. ``The issue is
attitude,'' said Mary Ann Leeper, president of the Female Health
Co., its manufacturer. ``The bottom line is that men and women want
to have naked sex, period.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Reddy's fate hinges on the Inspiral, which he views
as ``a beautiful barrier for population control and disease
prevention.'' As a surgeon, he said, he was held in the highest
esteem by his patients; but now, he says somewhat wearily, ``when I
meet someone he thinks I'm there to sell him something.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Sarojini, does not approve of the turn his career has
taken. ``She thinks I'm crazy,'' he said. ``She says one man cannot
save the world.''

MORE OPEN MARKETS COULD THREATEN HONG KONG'S ROLE AS MIDDLEMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ For China, which has spent years trying to claw its
way into the world's club of trading nations, the benefits of such
an expanded reach and strong connections are clear.
</P>
<P>
   But for Hong Kong, which has thrived as a middleman between
China's closed markets and the outside world, the possibility of a
more open China raises hard questions about the future of this
trading post.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, China's success in moving closer to joining the
World Trade Organization has buoyed local investors, on the theory
that Chinese membership would be a good thing for Hong Kong. Stocks
rose to their highest level in 12 months Friday, capping a week of
powerful gains, in part because investors liked the progress they
had seen in negotiations between the Chinese and U.S. governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of people who think if China wins, Hong Kong
wins,'' said Marc Faber, the managing director of Marc Faber Ltd.,
an investment firm here. ``But I'm not sure. I think, on balance,
the entry of China into the World Trade Organization is a negative
for Hong Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a deal would greatly expand business with China, Faber
said it could also threaten Hong Kong's role as the broker for much
of the wheeling and dealing that surrounds the China trade. With so
many more ways into China, foreign companies may be ready to cut
their own deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is further marginalizing Hong Kong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a former British colony and now a semiautonomous region of
China, Hong Kong is a separate trading entity with its own
membership in the WTO. But its economic fortunes are so intertwined
with China that people here have followed Beijing's campaign as if
it were their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WTO issue has helped sentiment in the market,'' said Miron
Mushkat, global head of economics and strategy at Indocam Asset
Management. ``But it doesn't take much for sentiment to turn
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, investors might have second thoughts if they scrutinized
the implications of China's admission to the organization that sets
the rules of global commerce and arbitrates disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some of the concessions Beijing has made in trade
negotiations pose a threat to companies here. On Wednesday, just
before Prime Minister Zhu Rongji flew to Washington, Chinese and
U.S. officials agreed to double the frequency of commercial flights
between their countries and to increase the number of Chinese
cities that U.S. air carriers can serve with direct connections.
</P>
<P>
   That could deprive Hong Kong _ and its new $20 billion airport _
of its role as a gateway to China. Dragonair, the regional airline
that serves many mainland cities, could lose Western passengers who
fly to Hong Kong and switch carriers for the short hop to popular
Chinese destinations like Xian and Guilin.
</P>
<P>
   As China opens other industries, like telecommunications,
financial services, and accounting, some analysts said foreign
companies would rely less on Hong Kong as an interlocutor. That
shift is already occurring in shipping, where Hong Kong's role as a
gateway is still most pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, half of all Chinese exports passed through Hong Kong's
container port on their way out of the country. But as China has
opened more ports on the mainland, Hong Kong's share of exports
declined, from 60 percent in 1992. Last year, container traffic
rose less than 1 percent in Hong Kong, while Shenzhen, a large city
nearby in Guangdong Province, reported a 70 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, more and more trade is carried out between China and
other countries directly, rather than through Hong Kong,'' Faber
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for every downbeat consequence of freer trade with China,
there is an offsetting positive one. Even if China opens its
markets and adheres to global trade rules, analysts say it will
still be a bewildering place to do business. The only difference is
that more foreign companies will be taking the plunge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a proliferation of people outside who are dealing
with China, you need someone to act as a go-between,'' Mushkat
said. ``It doesn't necessarily mean pushing cargo through Hong
Kong. But it may mean more skill-intensive activities, like lawyers
or bankers.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other experts said Hong Kong could assume a new role as an
anchor of stability in a commercially freer China. Once China gains
entry into the WTO, analysts said it would be likely to make its
currency, the yuan, fully convertible. The Hong Kong dollar, with
an exchange rate linked to the U.S. dollar, could offset
fluctuations in the value of the Chinese yuan.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's local companies would also benefit from having
greater access to Chinese markets. Although Hong Kong is the
largest source of direct foreign investment in China _ a cumulative
$99.3 billion through 1996 _ its companies are still classified as
foreign entities. Like American companies, they are barred from
ownership in many Chinese industries.
</P>
<P>
   Once those restrictions were lifted, Hong Kong companies could
have an edge over others. For example, Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Corp., a unit of HSBC Holdings, has decades of experience
in China and would be well placed if foreign banks were allowed
into Chinese consumer banking. Shares of HSBC helped propel the
stock market rally here over the last couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong should have demanded that its companies be
classified as Chinese when it was negotiating the handover,'' said
Robert C. Broadfoot, managing director of the Political and
Economic Risk Consultancy in Hong Kong. ``Now, it has a second
chance to invest in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the links between Hong Kong and China, some
economists said it would be several years before the impact of a
Chinese membership in the WTO made itself felt here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt the business community would regard this as a
positive,'' said Ian K. Perkin, chief economist of the Hong Kong
General Chamber of Commerce. ``Just how positive is impossible to
tell without knowing the details.''

BALKAN RECOVERY EXPERTS SAY KOSOVO FACES A LONG ROAD BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 11)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After the guns fall silent across Kosovo, the
U.S.-led alliance will face open-ended challenges when it tries to
transform the province into a peaceful homeland for embittered
ethnic Albanian Muslims and the Serbian Orthodox Christians who
once governed them.
</P>
<P>
   Experts who have worked on recovery operations in the Balkans
say America and its allies will confront immense difficulties
trying to create a secure environment and provide emergency relief
to hundreds of thousands of Kosovar Albanians driven from their
homes by Yugoslavia's scorched earth-campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The allies will also have to create a new political system for
the province that guarantees the autonomy that Yugoslavia stripped
away a decade ago, setting the stage for the Kosovar Albanians'
struggle for independence that culminated with NATO intervention on
March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans of Balkan relief and recovery efforts say it is too
early to forecast the cost of rebuilding Kosovo or the time it will
take.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting from square one,'' said Robert P. DeVecchi, who
dealt with refugees from the war in neighboring Bosnia. ``We have a
catastrophic humanitarian situation. No one expected its scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Recovery still lags in Bosnia, for example, where a
U.S.-brokered peace agreement ended three years of fighting in 1995
that claimed 200,000 lives and drove 3 million people from their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   International donations are falling behind for Bosnia's $5.1
billion recovery fund, and political wrangling continues between
rival ethnic factions there.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnian refugees have been slow to return: 400,000 of the
700,000 who fled elsewhere in Europe still live in the other
countries. Another 800,000 who were routed from their homes in
Bosnia but stayed in the area have yet to return to those homes.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Adm. Leighton Smith, the NATO commander who began
implementing the peace agreement in Bosnia in 1995, says of the
Kosovo challenges: ``Until the local politicians decide they want
peace and they want to contribute to reconstruction, you're dead in
the water.''
</P>
<P>
   _On providing security:
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that at a minimum, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization will have to field a mobile force of more than 30,000
troops capable of quelling rear-guard resistance from either
Yugoslav Serbian forces or break-away elements of the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   As Smith put it, the alliance will need ``a robust force that
can kick the hell out of Serbian forces, if necessary.'' He added,
``No matter what's agreed to in a political settlement, the force
you send in is going to be challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony H. Cordesman, a military specialist at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies here, foresees allied forces
remaining in Kosovo for a decade to enforce ``some kind of no man's
land'' between Yugoslav Serbs and Kosovar Albanians. He added,
``One way or another, NATO and the U.S. are probably stuck the
Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   _On aiding the refugees:
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has funneled $150 million in
emergency relief since last month, and other nations and
humanitarian relief organizations so far have contributed more than
$80 million.
</P>
<P>
   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton flew to Dover Air Force Base,
Del., Friday to watch a giant C-5A Galaxy being loaded with daily
ration packs for refugees in Albania and Macedonia _ part of the
1.1 million daily rations pledged by the administration last week.
</P>
<P>
   A United Nations relief effort is being bolstered by NATO
forces, including 8,000 soldiers bound for Albania and 12,000
troops already in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Experts disagree on whether the estimated 510,500 ethnic
Albanian refugees driven from Kosovo to Albania, Macedonia, Bosnia
and elsewhere in Yugoslavia in the last three weeks will return to
their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   H. Roy Williams, director of emergency humanitarian relief at
the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID), foresees a
gradual return by the refugees, including 100,000 ethnic Albanians
being offered temporary asylum in NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has certainly been my experience that refugees above all
want to return home,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   But DeVecchi, former president of the International Rescue
Committee who has handled refugee crises dating back to Vietnam,
disagrees. He said ethnic Albanians may not return to Kosovo unless
allied troops permanently partition Kosovo and set up a cordon of
protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course refugees will say they want to go back,'' DeVecchi
says. ``But the prospect of having an international protection
force only for a limited period of time means it's unrealistic to
expect them to return to their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   _On creating a new political system:
</P>
<P>
   Michael Salla, a Balkans expert at the American University here,
said the allies will have to craft a new political structure that
protects the rights of both ethnic Albanians and Yugoslav Serbians.
The best way to do it is with a patchwork of powerful county-level
councils across the province that report to an umbrella assembly
that represents all ethnic factions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Salla, noting the difficulties of such a system, predicted
that ethnic Albanians will insist on control of the international
borders between Kosovo and neighboring Albania and Macedonia to
prevent the kind of Yugoslav clampdown on the borders that trapped
tens of thousands of fleeing Kosovars last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Handing over control of those borders to the ethnic Albanians
will be a touchy issue for the Yugoslavs,'' Salla warned.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance also have to bolster the reform-minded leadership
in Montenegro, a republic that remains affiliated with Serbia. As
Ambassador Robert Gelbard, special U.S. representative for
implementation of the peace agreement in Bosnia, put it last week:
The Clinton administration will ``remain steadfast in its support
for the democratic government of Montenegro.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On reconstructing Kosovo:
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the AID relief specialist, said that once the allies
deal with the immediate needs of the refugees, they will focus on
the long-term recovery of the province that forms the southern part
of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
</P>
<P>
   An international donors' conference on reconstruction will be
convened as soon as the fighting ends, Williams said. He added that
it's too early to know the extent of damage to Kosovo, pounded by
NATO bombs and Yugoslav forces that have burned whole villages.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who supervised initial recovery operations in Bosnia,
says the allied security force will undertake some initial
reconstruction projects. Allied forces in Bosnia rebuilt more than
60 bridges, laid dozens of miles of road and reconstructed four
airports in Bosnia, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military will automatically do a lot _ some of it out of
military necessity, some of it just because we're nice guys,'' he
said.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A winter storm warning was issued Friday for the north-central
mountains of Colorado as another in a series of powerful Pacific
disturbances approached from the Great Basin. On Saturday, the
formidable system will inflict stormy weather on parts of the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate to heavy rains will douse the region from the central
Plains to the southwest Great Lakes region as the system lifts
moist air streaming north from the Gulf of Mexico. Rainfalls in
excess of an inch are possible across eastern Nebraska, South
Dakota, Iowa, southern Minnesota and southern Wisconsin by Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms will erupt across a region bounded by the middle
Mississippi, lower Ohio and Tennessee Valley as humid air from the
Gulf is vigorously lifted by a cold front associated with the
system. Some of the thunderstorms will reach severe levels,
spawning large hail, damaging straight-line winds and tornadoes. As
with most stormy outbreaks, severe weather will affect only a very
small percentage of the region at risk.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the system, winds gusting to 60 mph or more will
buffet the foothills and high plains east of the Front Range of the
central Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, moderate to locally heavy rains will develop from
southwest Oregon to northern and central California as yet another
Pacific disturbance drops southeastward along the coast. The
heaviest rains will likely fall along the Coastal Range.
</P>
<P>
   After a cloudy start, the sky over the Northeast Seaboard will
brighten with the onset on dry, cool breezes from the northwest. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: April in the Tropics
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Tropical Storm Jacob been christened by the Joint
Typhoon Warning Center in Guam on Thursday, the system was
downgraded to a depression as it suddenly lost power over the
western Pacific. The system lasted six hours as a tropical storm.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical storms are not unusual in April in the western Pacific,
given the year-long warmth of tropical seas. In contrast, April is
the only month of the year that a tropical storm has never been
observed over the Atlantic. Sea-surface temperatures reach a nadir
in April, while fast, high-altitude winds from the west are very
disruptive.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Hadfield still winces when he recalls the 1990 merger of
Deloitte, Haskins &AMP; Sells and Coopers &AMP; Lybrand. ``We figured
they're both accounting firms, they trade in the same markets, so
of course their cultures would be the same,'' said Hadfield, who
was a consultant with Deloitte at the time. ``We couldn't have been
more wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Deloitte, he explained, was far more free-spirited than the
control-minded Coopers. And it took three years of employee
defections and financial bleeding _and finally a new management
team _ to get the firm past its culture clashes.
</P>
<P>
   So last year, when Coopers and Price Waterhouse merged to form
the $15.3 billion megafirm PricewaterhouseCoopers, they took steps
to avoid the same nightmare. Ten months before the deal was
completed, each firm assigned four executives to a merger
integration team, which in turn named Hadfield as its global
transition director.
</P>
<P>
   ``If no one has full-time responsibility for making a merger
work,'' he explained, ``you'll mess up what could have been a
perfectly good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing new about the idea that a merger or acquisition
can give rise to cultural conflicts, to quarrels over incompatible
pay systems, to information systems that don't communicate with
each other and to various other problems. Indeed, researchers
routinely say that anywhere from one-half to three-quarters of
mergers never provide the low costs, added market share or other
benefits that management promised shareholders _ or that they take
much longer than expected to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But until recently, corporations acted as if the only way to
better those odds was to look more closely at whether a potential
partner's markets and products really meshed with their own, and
then to negotiate harder if the deal still made sense.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, they are also training their magnifying glasses on
all the possible glitches that could come after the deal is done _
and seeking ways to prevent them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've walked away from companies with autocratic leaders
because their employees wouldn't fit in with our team culture,''
said Ammar Hanafi, director of business development for Cisco
Systems, a maker of computer networking equipment. ``We even walked
away from one that had fancy artwork on its walls, because we
doubted it would fit into our culture of frugality.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco, based in San Jose, Calif., has acquired 32 companies
since its founding 13 years ago _ two of them just last week. It
has 15 full-time people dedicated not only to making mergers work,
but also to steering management away from marriages that might be
undermined by issues of company culture.
</P>
<P>
   As deal-making continues its rampant transformation of Corporate
America, the concept of in-house merger managers keeps gaining
converts.
</P>
<P>
   Allied Signal, General Electric and Lucent Technologies all now
have specialists dedicated to integration of merged companies. In
February, AT&AMP;T _ busy digesting Tele-Communications Inc. and
setting up joint ventures with British Telecom and Time Warner _
promoted Harold Burlingame, its executive vice president of human
resources, to the new position of executive vice president of
merger and joint venture integration.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's changed is that companies are paying as much formal
attention to post-deal integration as they pay to the pre-deal part
of mergers,'' said Bruce Pasternack, a senior vice president at
Booz, Allen &AMP; Hamilton, the consulting firm,
</P>
<P>
   Consultants say the list of such companies grows daily. ``Lack
of attention to cultures and systems has caused a tremendous number
of deals to blow up, and that's shown companies that slapping
functions together is not the same as integrating them,'' said Mark
Clemente, president of Clemente Greenspan &AMP; Co., a management
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Recent history has been rife with learning opportunities.
Accounting irregularities take only part of the blame, for example,
for the implosion of Cendant Corp., the $14 billion company created
when HFS and CUC International joined forces in late 1997. Most
business experts also implicate the mismatch in styles between the
controlling and numbers-oriented Henry Silverman, HFS's chief, and
the strategy-minded, people-oriented Walter Forbes, the head of
CUC.
</P>
<P>
   At AT&AMP;T, a good part of Burlingame's new job is to ensure that
the company does not repeat with TCI the mistakes it made when it
acquired NCR Corp. in 1991 and McCaw Cellular in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In both of those cases, AT&AMP;T let efforts to coordinate sales
pitches, product development and client contacts simmer on a back
burner. AT&AMP;T never made money on NCR, which it eventually spun off
to shareholders. And while AT&AMP;T's cellular business eventually
prospered after the acquisition of McCaw, Burlingame believes the
company took far too long to absorb its purchase. ``We lost a
chance to blow the competition out of the water,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons that merger integration has emerged as a
discipline, with its own dedicated personnel. Corporations have
whittled away at headquarters staffs, and the support people who
survived _ and might be logical candidates for merger duties _
rarely have much slack in their schedules. Moreover, top executives
recognize that unless they hold individuals accountable for
shepherding an acquired company, integration issues could fall by
the wayside.
</P>
<P>
   The number of mergers and acquisitions is at a dizzying high.
Last year, Securities Data/Thomson Financial Co., a research firm,
counted more than 23,000 deals worldwide, worth $2.5 trillion; the
pace this year is even faster, with $840 billion in deals reaching
fruition worldwide in the first quarter alone.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, the big telecommunications equipment maker, has bought
18 companies in its less than three years of existence. Tyco
International, an industrial conglomerate, has bought 110 companies
since L. Dennis Kozlowski became chief executive six years ago.

   Sometimes the simplest pictures hit home the hardest. Take the

coming of age, finding one's way, surviving incest (yes, there's
that) and moving on.
</P>
<P>
   If you've followed Atlanta theater for a decade or more, those
chairs say: ``Driving Miss Daisy.'' Especially now, so soon after
the passing of Mary Nell Santacroce, who from September 1988 until
the end of 1989 sat in such a chair on that same spot, next to the
several fine actors who played chauffeur Hoke. Together these
characters from the life of playwright Alfred Uhry ``drove''
through streets that all Atlantans recognize, moving from the
alienation of racial distrust to the bond of friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, a playwright conjures a car. This time it's the
place where Lil' Bit _ a teenager of innocence and normal desires _
gets driving lessons and life lessons from her Uncle Peck _ a
40-ish man with forbidden desires but a generous heart. It's a tale
without martyrs or devils. Nothing is simple but the set. Laughter
and outrage alternate like the glass dividers of a revolving door.
</P>
<P>
   As in ``Daisy,'' the car is a metaphor for life's journey. It's
a place of intimate exchange, a kind of secular confession booth.
We audience members, sitting just a few feet away, are in that
bubble with them. Our imaginations create the look, sound, smell of
a summer night in 1969, using a rough magic (Shakespeare's phrase)
that's closer to ancient ritual than to the special effects of a
George Lucas movie. That magic is called theater.
</P>
<P>
   For all their similarities in method, the two Pulitzer
Prize-winning plays are hugely different, of course. ``Daisy''
embraces sentiment; ``Drive'' distrusts it. ``Daisy'' soothes;
``Drive'' disturbs. It's a fair bet that a play about incest is not
going to match ``Daisy's'' run of 18 months in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be a great shame if theatergoers turned away from
Vogel's play on the basis of the I-word, just as it would be a
mistake for them to go just for titillation (they won't get much,
anyway; there's no nudity or suggestive physical contact). It would
be a mistake if patrons assumed, on the basis of subject matter or
a quick synopsis, that ``Drive'' is ``not for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The American theater is at a crossroads, and if it is to thrive
it will need audiences who are willing to take a leap of faith on
plays and players that may not seem as comfortably familiar as
before. In coming years there are going to be more skilled actors
in Atlanta but fewer well-known stars such as the late, great
Santacroce, because the stories of our age do not lend themselves
to the traditional, bravura (and let's face it, sentimental) roles
from which stardom was spun. In coming years there will be fewer
plays that you've heard of. That doesn't mean they're not
entertaining, it only means that television and most magazines
ignore them because they don't have enough mass appeal to help with
ratings and subscription numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In coming years, sex _ as a universal concern _ will demand due
attention. The future is here. This weekend Horizon Theatre, a hip
but hardly randy troupe, opened ``Quills,'' a play about the
Marquis de Sade that includes nudity and you name it.
</P>
<P>
   In coming years it's going to be clearer that the demographic
profile of mainstream theatergoers (average age 46, according to a
new Broadway survey) is different on many levels from that of
theater artists, who tend to ``skew young'' in the jargon of such
studies. It's no secret that gays and lesbians play a more
prominent role in theater than society at large.
</P>
<P>
   The artists' challenge of the new millennium will be telling
stories that connect with the people who actually come to the box
office. ``Drive'' is such a story. Just as important will be the
willingness of audiences to meet artists halfway, to project
themselves into stories that may not appear relevant to their daily
lives. Yes, we need hilarious Southern comedies, but ones in step
with reality. There are only so many times that campy cash cows
(``Steel Magnolias,'' ``Pump Boys and Dinettes,'' ``Greater Tuna,''
etc.) can be squeezed before the milk runs dry.
</P>
<P>
   Unless this common ground between artist and audience is staked
out and explored, there simply won't be enough ticket buyers or
sympathetic corporate sponsors to support big, highly professional
nonprofits such as the Alliance (which in recent seasons has rolled
up a $700,000 deficit). Don't despair _ theater is too ancient and
powerful to die, especially in a sophisticated city such as Atlanta
_ but it may only carry on in small, underfunded houses even less
visible to the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   In his book of theater theory, ``Three Uses of the Knife,''
David Mamet writes: ``Just as TV reduces us to the status of
consumer slaves, so dramatic art can raise the creators and the
viewers to the status of communicants. We who made it, formed it,
saw it, went through something together, now we are veterans. Now
we are friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Think of that passage when you're watching Lil' Bit and Uncle
Peck in their ``car'' of straight-back chairs. Look to your left
and your right in the audience and you will see your fellow
travelers, fellow communicants around the ancient fire. Perhaps
you'll find that, subject matter aside, ``How I Learned to Drive''
is more like ``Driving Miss Daisy'' than you ever knew.

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: New daily contact lenses convenient, low in
price
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you wear contact lenses, other people don't notice
them. Neither should you, says the maker of a new, ultra-thin daily
disposable lens.
</P>
<P>
   This week CIBA Vision, a contact lens manufacturer based in
Duluth, Ga., began widespread distribution of its new Focus Dailies
lenses. The lenses are notable for their convenience and low cost,
but especially for their reputed comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very comfortable, very convenient,'' said Dr. Brenda
Weirich, an Alpharetta (Ga.) optometrist who wears Focus Dailies.
``My husband also wears them _ I converted him.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret behind the new lenses' comfort is their extreme
thinness, partly because of the introduction of nelfilcon, a
polymer material never before used in contact lenses. CIBA also
developed a new manufacturing process that contributes to the
lenses' thinness and ultimately results in lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of Focus Dailies can be made in just two minutes, thanks
to a fully automated system that relies on robotics for speed,
precision and consistency. Conventional contact lenses generally
take two to three days to make and require some manual steps. The
lens is formed between two molds, which are pinched together to
form the lens edge.
</P>
<P>
   CIBA also uses molds to produce the new lenses, but the molds
never touch. A drop of liquid nelfilcon is placed on the concave,
or ``female,'' side, and the convex, ``male'' mold presses the
liquid into the proper shape, while remaining microns apart from
the other mold.
</P>
<P>
   A beam of ultraviolet light passes through the molds, which are
made of glass and quartz, and essentially cooks the liquid into a
gel in seconds. The mold is designed so that the ultraviolet light
passes through only a certain area, creating a perfectly round
shape with a precise, thin edge. No further cutting or trimming is
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can make these things so efficiently, we can offer them at
a pretty nice price,'' said Michael Sinclair, CIBA's brand manager
for Focus Dailies.
</P>
<P>
   At about $1 per pair, the retail price of the new lenses is
roughly half that of the only other daily disposable lenses on the
market, Johnson &AMP; Johnson's Acuvue. Still, Focus Dailies' annual
cost is higher than that of other soft contacts, especially those
intended to be replaced yearly. But people are paying for the
convenience of wearing lenses for a single day and then throwing
them out.
</P>
<P>
   As Sinclair pointed out, however, wearers of daily disposable
lenses will save the money otherwise spent on contact solutions and
products. Also, replacing a lost or torn lens will cost only 50
cents, compared with $20 to $80 for a conventional lens.
</P>
<P>
   From a health standpoint, daily disposable lenses eliminate the
problem of protein buildup on lenses, to which the eyes can react
poorly. Protein buildup is particularly troublesome during allergy
season, Weirich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have bad allergies, your eyes are very active and
produce more protein buildup on the lenses,'' she explained. ``If
you replace the lenses every day, you don't have any buildup from
one day to the next.''
</P>
<P>
   Other varieties of disposable contacts include two-week and
monthly lenses. Disposable contacts of all types account for 65
percent of the contact lens market, Sinclair said, but only 2
percent of all lens wearers use daily disposables. Cost has been
the limiting factor, but CIBA hopes its lower prices will attract a
greater share of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Focus Dailies were released on a limited basis last year, but
until recently CIBA didn't have the manufacturing capacity for
large-scale production of the lenses. The company is expanding its
facilities and eventually will have the ability to turn out
billions of lenses per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot find a healthier way to wear contact lenses,'' said
Steve Schuster, president of CIBA Vision North America. ``This is a
major lifestyle opportunity for people.''
</P>
<P>
   EYE-OPENING FACTS
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The first contact lens was created in 1887 and was made of
glass. The modern contact lens, made of plastic, was developed in
1948.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A contact lens rests on a cushion of tears on the eyeball,
directly over the pupil and iris. Contacts come in hard and soft
varieties; the latter were introduced in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  About 73 million people worldwide wear contact lenses; about
30 million of those live in the United States.

<P>
   ``For many companies, mergers have moved from occasional event
to a routine, frequent part of doing business,'' noted Jim
Fishbein, a vice president of Rath &AMP; Strong, the consulting arm of
Aon Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The deal frenzy has driven prices for acquisitions sky-high,
making shareholders unforgiving of deals that do not add to
earnings immediately. So the ability to integrate a new company
quickly _ and wring out some costs in the process _ has become a
major factor in how a merged company's stock performs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies have to come full-steam out of the gate to justify
the premiums on deals,'' said Ronald Ashkenas, managing partner of
Robert Schaffer &AMP; Associates, a consulting firm in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Hercules Inc. certainly knows that. Last July, when it announced
its purchase of BetzDearborn, another company in the specialty
chemicals business, for $2.4 billion in cash and $700 million in
assumed debt, it promised investors that by the end of 2000, it
would achieve $125 million in synergies _ merger-speak for cost
savings.
</P>
<P>
   Well before the deal was completed in October, Hercules assigned
executives from the two companies to integration teams. Vincent
Corbo, president of Hercules, presided over the teams, sending each
to a different unit to find potential cost cuts and devise
schedules for achieving them. He also set up an ``integration
program office,'' with a full-time head responsible for seeing that
the timetables were met.
</P>
<P>
   Corbo says the merged company is ahead of schedule on reducing
costs. But it is still suffering the types of culture clashes that
led to the abrupt departure of William Cook, Betz's former chief
executive, shortly after the companies merged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that at Hercules decisions are made analytically,
while Betz was managed more intuitively,'' Corbo said. ``But it
made sense to get the people in place and the cost synergies
planned for before we tried to merge the cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, companies that make frequent acquisitions have found
that, after a while, they can handle cost-cutting and personnel
issues almost by rote. Their merger integration specialists are
high on the learning curve when it comes to disposing of excess
real estate, melding pension plans, coordinating accounting systems
or handling other important but typical merger chores. Spared of
having to reinvent the wheel in those areas, they have more time to
study the cultural and market issues that make each merger unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot speedier if the same people handle the myriad
things that are similar in acquisitions and the business units
concentrate on melding products, markets and cultures,'' said
Patricia Russo, the executive vice president who oversees Lucent's
merger integration group.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Yeaw, who last year became the first director of human
resources for mergers and acquisitions at Allied Signal, the
industrial conglomerate, agreed. ``You want to customize every
integration, but you don't want to start from scratch each time,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Internet technology has made it easier to build banks of
institutional memory and advice. About two years ago, General
Electric pulled together separate teams from human resources,
finance and more than a dozen other corporate functions and set
them to interviewing GE people who had been involved in some of the
hundreds of deals that the company has done in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   A result is an elaborate site on GE's internal computer network,
sorted by subjects like culture or compensation, so that people
responsible for those issues can quickly find anecdotes gleaned
from past deals, names of GE contacts and even tips on how to
choose the right leader for an integration team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web page's contents, printed out, would fill enough file
folders to line an office wall,'' said Gary Reiner, chief
information officer for GE. ``The intranet is the first viable
medium for sharing best practices.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who have been wounded by past mergers, remembering the
worst practices is even more important.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, Burlingame of AT&AMP;T concedes that the whole notion
behind the NCR deal _ that the communications and computing worlds
were themselves merging _ was flawed. But he believes AT&AMP;T
exacerbated the problems by not coordinating goals with NCR early
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two companies retained different visions,'' Burlingame
recalled. ``AT&AMP;T figured it could build on NCR's customer base to
sell full-service networks, but NCR just wanted to use our brand
name to sell their hardware.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Burlingame is already trying to insure that cable employees
from TCI and their telephone counterparts from AT&AMP;T travel the same
road from Day One. High on his list are training programs aimed at
keeping TCI employees, who have concentrated on serving local
markets, from working at cross-purposes with AT&AMP;T employees, who
are trying to expand national markets.
</P>
<P>
   With Burlingame so new in his job, he might do well to pick up
some tips from Hadfield at PricewaterhouseCoopers. Since July,
Hadfield has designed employee-retention programs, redeployed some
partners to new posts, sent other partners for merger-related
training, dispatched people to explain the merger to clients,
streamlined purchasing and otherwise cut costs _ and made sure that
the firm's 150,000 employees are up to date on the integration
process.
</P>
<P>
   Hadfield, who expects his assignment to last through this year,
credits the integration program for the company's success in
retaining nearly all of the 9,000 partners who had been most
important to the two firms before they merged.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike PricewaterhouseCoopers, EPS Solutions Inc. _ also born of
a merger of accounting and consulting firms _ has no legacy of
failure to guard against. But its integration challenge is perhaps
the most dire around.

TEXAS RANCH MAY HOLD CLUES TO MYSTERY OF MISSING ATHEIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 11)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Two ex-convicts with violent pasts are behind
bars, a Texas ranch has been searched for the victims' remains and
the ``Today Show'' has been serving breakfast updates on the
ever-weirder case of Madalyn Murray O'Hair.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly four decades ago that O'Hair played a pivotal role
in the legal battle to ban prayer and Bible reading from public
schools. And it has been more than three years since O'Hair and her
two adult children disappeared from San Antonio with $500,000 in
gold coins.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows if they are dead or alive.
</P>
<P>
   But now, in absentia, O'Hair has recaptured the public attention
she lost years go after she reigned briefly and belligerently as
the self-pronounced ``most hated woman in America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother would have enjoyed this. It has brought her back
into the limelight, but you'll notice it has nothing to do with her
beliefs. It's all about celebrity,'' said Bill Murray, O'Hair's
surviving son, who is a fundamentalist Christian.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always thought of herself as a major historical figure,
more than she ever was. Now she's receiving more attention than she
ever did when she was alive, except for a brief period in the
1960s,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Grand Dame of Atheism is on center stage.
</P>
<P>
   And O'Hair is making her comeback as the leading lady in a soapy
saga of greed and treachery, of gold coins and metal drums, of
disbelief and dismemberment.
</P>
<P>
   Few mourned when the O'Hair family vanished from Austin in
September 1995, and for more than three years, the Austin Police
Department treated it like an overblown missing-persons case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still an open case. Nothing indicates foul play,'' Sgt.
Steve Baker said in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel they just took off. It was a planned departure,'' said
Baker, who worked the O'Hair case until late last year.
</P>
<P>
   But other agencies have come to view things differently, and in
recent weeks, the police action has been fast and furious.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the FBI questioned people in Michigan, Illinois
and Texas. Searches in Austin and Detroit allegedly turned up
illegal weapons, and two ex-convicts are now behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   On Easter weekend, more than three dozen federal agents scoured
a ranch 120 miles west of San Antonio for the buried bodies of
O'Hair, her son Jon Garth Murray and daughter Robin Murray O'Hair.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI apparently found nothing in their search south of the
community of Camp Wood.
</P>
<P>
   The two men in jail, although linked to O'Hair, face only
federal firearms charges. As former convicts who served time for
felony offenses, they are forbidden to possess guns or ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Gary P. Karr, 50, is being held in Detroit. In a hearing in
Detroit, an FBI agent testified that Karr talked for more than 13
hours and admitted involvement in four Texas homicides, including
one that involved decapitation of one victim.
</P>
<P>
   The other arrested man, David R. Waters, 52, is a former office
manager of O'Hair's. Waters, who is being held in Texas, insists
he's innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has no clue what they are talking about,'' said Austin
lawyer Patrick Ganne said of Waters. ``He's concerned that the
whole weight of the federal government is coming down on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Karr nor Waters has been charged with any crime
connected to the O'Hair case or with the slaying of a Florida man
named Danny Fry.
</P>
<P>
   Fry's nude, headless and handless body was dumped along a
riverbank near Dallas on Oct. 2, 1995, days after the O'Hair family
vanished with $500,000 in gold coins. He was not identified until
January.
</P>
<P>
   Fry family members say he went to Texas in mid-summer 1995 after
his old buddy, Waters, offered a lucrative _ if mysterious _ deal.
</P>
<P>
   Fry was last heard from Sept. 30, 1995, the day after O'Hair,
her son and daughter vanished.
</P>
<P>
   The search near Camp Wood, people close to the case believe, was
prompted by information Karr gave to the FBI. Specifically, they
were seeking metal drums containing the dismembered remains of the
three O'Hairs.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI declines even to acknowledge that the O'Hair case took
it to Camp Wood, a town of 595 people that usually stirs only
during deer season.
</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no warning. It was really exciting. Everybody
wonders why they would bring them all out here and why they would
be on that place,'' Mayor Jim Blakeney said, referring to the men
and women in blue jumpsuits reading ``FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens next may depend on Karr, who, according to the FBI
testimony, has already implicated himself as an accessory in four
murders.
</P>
<P>
   If this is true, the only bargaining chip Karr may have left
would be to show the FBI exactly where the bodies were concealed.
</P>
<P>
   But there no signs that Karr will be returning soon to Texas. He
first faces a firearms charge in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   He also is charged in Texas with a count of transporting stolen
property across state lines. The item in question is believed to be
personal jewelry that belonged to one of the O'Hairs.
</P>
<P>
   Karr's lawyer, Richard Helfrick, a public defender in Detroit,
said so far no one from Texas has approached him to discuss any
possible deals with his client.
</P>
<P>
   Helfrick said Karr's circumstances may become more clear in the
next few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't anticipate anything happening until Monday when the
prosecutor returns from vacation. At least then we'll get to
talk,'' he said of Assistant U.S. Attorney Ken Chadwell.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair's son doubts that the bodies of his family are still on
the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the delay in investigating this thing, I'm
wondering if some individual had time on his hands to go back there
and remove them,'' Bill Murray said by telephone from his home in
Fredericksburg, Va.

   MTV's Tom Green has become a hit with under-30 viewers by going
where few TV hosts have gone before. We Caught up with him recently
in his New York office. Off the air, the 27-Year-old Canadian is as
thoughtful and subdued as he is manic and outrageous on it. Q: Why
do Canadian comedians seem so over-represented in the U.S.?
</P>
<P>
   A: We're this little insecure nation stuck beside this huge
country. We're kind of like: ``Look at me! I'm over here!''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who's watching you?
</P>
<P>
   A: They're young, hanging out in malls, riding skateboards,
getting kicked out of places and told you can't do that _ they like
watching me do that. Sixteen-year-olds love the show.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who were your influences?
</P>
<P>
   A: A lot of it was growing up as a skateboarder _ it's a
subculture, getting kicked off buses, out of places for being a
bratty skate punk. Growing up I was also always watching (David)
Letterman. When I was 14, I broke my toe and couldn't skate, so I
sat in bed every night watching him. Back then he was doing a lot
of things in the street with video, and I would watch and say,
``That's what I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Anything else?
</P>
<P>
   A: I grew up as an Army brat, and my first seven years we were
moving every six months. I'd walk into school the last week of
class, this skinny kid, and the only way to exist without being an
outcast was to make everyone laugh. Those are my earliest memories
of school _ the point of going to school was to have an audience.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You put your parents through a lot. You get along with them?
</P>
<P>
   A: I like them; we talk four or five times a week. They don't
really like this stuff happening to them, but there's not much I
can do about that. They're supportive of me going out and having a
career. There has always been pressure on me to go out and work, so
I don't think they took my comedy seriously until three years ago
when I was actually getting paid to do it. There's a funny irony to
that: They kind of never took me seriously, and now that it's
working out, part of that is getting paid to throw a dead cow's
head in their bed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the angriest they ever got?
</P>
<P>
   A: When I painted their house plaid while they were on a canoe
trip. They got really mad and took my car away. They wouldn't give
it back until I painted the house back the way it was.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there such a thing as a bad idea for your show?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are plenty. It's all about getting a genuine reaction
from people, so if somebody understands the joke, starts playing to
the camera, then it's bad.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what's a good idea?
</P>
<P>
   A: Whatever makes what's going on so dominate the scene they
forget they're being filmed. It's not as funny to see me out there
acting silly; somebody watching me act silly is a big part of the
joke. I've interviewed enough that I can get people to interact in
a real way, whether it's confused, surprised, angry.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Like the old guy who grabbed your mike and threatened you
with it?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's where we yell, ``Gold!''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a line you won't cross?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are plenty. I don't want anyone to get hurt; I don't
want to be mean-spirited toward anybody. I've been doing this long
enough to know when to run away.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have to get in character for this?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've adapted the way I live to be able to do it on a constant
basis. When I'm not taping, I'm not funny anymore. I used to be a
constant goofball. Now I'm in recharge battery mode. Anybody only
has a certain amount of funny in them per week. If we're shooting
four or five days a week, I believe in just kind of being quiet and
recharging my funny battery.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are Glenn (Humplik) and Phil (Giroux) on the show?
</P>
<P>
   A: I met Glenn while I was doing college radio, eight to 10
years ago. Phil I met skateboarding when I was 14, and Derek
(Harvie, the show's head writer) I met when I was 8 in elementary
school. So it just grew into this thing where Glenn would sit
beside me, I'd put him on the spot, and Phil would laugh. They make
it feel less like a TV show and more like three guys hanging out
making a TV show.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You worry about always having to up the bar for what
outrageous thing you're going to do next?
</P>
<P>
   A: We're always trying to top the last thing we did in our
``insanity bits.'' I am a little worried how in two years we're
going to end up _ throwing babies off the Empire State Building?
</P>
<P>
   Q: I thought the line you wouldn't cross is anybody getting
hurt?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's our line at the moment.

 &HT;    Outrageousness earns Tom Green cult status on MTV
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April, 11.
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   He has suckled milk from a cow, airbrushed a lesbian love scene
on the hood of his parents' car and scuba-dived for small change in
a mall fountain (when evicted by security, he bagged the money and
donated it to the rich at a nearby bank).
</P>
<P>
   He's also put a dead cow's head in his parents' bed (``This is a
message from Don Corleone!''), pretended to have sex with a dead
moose beside a Canadian highway and served chest-hair sandwiches to
vacationers on an ocean cruise.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences? Tom Green has been threatened with arrest,
threatened with violence _ and given his own show on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has incredible relevance to our audience, doing things I
know they all wish they could do,'' says John Miller, the MTV
executive who brought ``The Tom Green Show'' from Canada to his
network, where it has become a gross-out smash.
</P>
<P>
   Relevance? It's juvenile _ unless you're juvenile. Then it's
cutting edge, a hybrid that crosses irony with tastelessness to
produce its own out-there genre: the New Annoyance. It's stupid
simple: a half-hour of Green in a New York studio, flanked by a
couple of old friends, chatting up an audience and introducing his
unholy videos.
</P>
<P>
   You can hardly walk through a college campus without running
into fans _ Green's show is MTV's highest rated regular program
among 18- to 34-year-olds, and was the third-highest rated show on
cable, behind wrestling on USA and TNT, in its old Monday time
slot. (It now airs at 10:30 p.m. Thursdays, with 13 new episodes
beginning April 22.) Its audience is about 60 percent male.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sick,'' ``shameless'' and ``random'' are compliments one hears
walking through the Georgia State University campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes a complete fool out of himself. That's what's so
funny _ he does what no one else does,'' says Lindsay Galloway, a
GSU freshman education major. ``It's a young people thing. Old
people probably wouldn't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He relates to things that we would do, or friends would do,
and he gets paid for it,'' says Noel Stieglitz, a fellow GSU
freshman and a computer information systems major.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Green is a storky 27-year-old Canadian who has pranked and
bad-tasted his way to youth cult status, mainstream division. He
was featured in Pepsi commercials roaming campuses during the
recent NCAA tournament. (He shouted through a bullhorn inside a
library, made a student drink soda out of his mitten). He had to
cancel a comedy segment he tried to tape at the St. Patrick's Day
Parade in New York when too many young people mobbed him. He
recently completed a movie that stars ``Saturday Night Live''
regular Will Farrell.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his life outside the show, Green sighs, ``These days
there really isn't one.''
</P>
<P>
   Green has been doing what he does for about 10 years in Canada.
He began his show on radio, then moved it to an Ottawa public
access channel in 1994. Four years later it was picked up by
Canada's Comedy Network, where it became a hit.
</P>
<P>
   The MTV version is essentially what the show has looked like all
along. Beyond the taped man-on-the-street inanity, Green looks for
laughs while seated in a studio with old friends Glenn Humplik
(think a doughier Andy Richter of ``Late Night With Conan
O'Brien'') and Phil Giroux (who sits behind a fake window, drinking
coffee and laughing continuously). Its look is somewhere between
slick and schlocky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more watchable now. There are more people working on it,
more thought goes into each minute,'' Green says. ``In Canada,
there were like three people working on the show.''

 UNDATED: dire around.   &HT;    The company, based in Costa Mesa, Calif., was formed Dec. 14
from the merger of 36 smaller firms. Overnight, 35 former
entrepreneurs were playing second or third fiddle to one large
organization. And 1,344 employees who had worked for tiny companies
were working for a middle-sized one that now plans to go public.
 &HT;    Long before the December D-Day, Christopher Massey, the prime
mover behind the new company and now its chief executive, met with
the other business heads to form integration teams that, as soon as
the deal was final, would visit every office to answer questions.
They charged one person with integrating all the computer systems.
They hammered out a stock option and benefits plan.
 &HT;    When the deal was done, the executives were ready with a 30-page
booklet that detailed compensation plans and career opportunities.
It addressed frankly the culture shocks that might be ahead but
also devoted considerable ink to the benefits of combining client
bases and cash flows.
 &HT;    ``We wanted employees, from Day One, to be able to go home and
prove to their spouses that there was a lot of security,'' Massey
said. ``And we needed to prove to ourselves that we really could
turn all those different firms into a single company with a single
culture.''
 &HT;    He had better prove it fast. EPS closed six more acquisitions
last month.

 PRACTICING THE STEPS EVEN BEFORE THE DANCE  
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no cookie-cutter approach to merging two companies
successfully into one.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that buy other businesses only once in a while usually
create a full-time but temporary integration team for any new
purchase; the team is disbanded once the acquired company is
sufficiently acclimated. Companies like the specialty chemicals
maker Hercules Inc., which buy and merge at a steady but not heady
pace, often assign a high-level executive to oversee the
integration of a new company, giving him or her access to staff
support. And corporations like Lucent Technologies or Cisco
Systems, which make acquisitions often, tend to have permanent
teams whose sole job is to integrate the new companies into their
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have the same people doing it, then every deal
acts as a shock to your whole system,'' said Ammar Hanafi, Cisco's
director of business development, who coordinates integration
efforts both before and after acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Differences aside, more and more companies are planning for
integration even as they research deals. Well before an acquisition
is closed, both companies are deciding whose compensation programs
will survive, which offices or plants will close, which executives
will run the combined business units or be primary contacts for
customers, and how the integration process will be communicated to
employees. They are ferreting out potential culture clashes and
designing training programs to combat them.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, they are creating detailed implementation plans,
complete with milestones, for making the merger work _ and fast.
``Having a permanent integration team shaves months off the
integration process,'' said Patricia Russo, the executive vice
president who oversees Lucent's merger integration group.

 &HT;    GOP TARGETS TEXANS AS HOUSE CAMPAIGN STARTS EARLY
 &HT;    520&AMP;add. With CONSERVATIVES-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and
(p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the smallest House majority in 44 years, the
Republican Party is gearing up for the next election early by
targeting Democrats in districts friendly to the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   The voting may be more than 18 months away, but the National
Republican Congressional Committee has begun sending out press
releases attacking the voting records of conservative and moderate
House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely are keeping a close eye on key Democrats who we
think are vulnerable in 2000,'' said Jill Schroeder, spokesperson
for the NRCC.
</P>
<P>
   One focus of the campaign is Texas, where the hit list includes
Chet Edwards of Waco, Max Sandlin of Marshall and Jim Turner of
Crockett.
</P>
<P>
   The three are on a ``a big list'' of House seats that the NRCC
considers as possible GOP gains next year, Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the House race has already started, Schroeder answered:
``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent press release criticized Edwards and Sandlin for voting
against the GOP budget blueprint for next year, saying they were
trying to block billions of dollars for schools and tax relief for
middle-class families.
</P>
<P>
   Another NRCC press release accused Sandlin of putting ``foreign
interests ahead of aid to Texas families'' by rejecting ``$153
million in much-needed assistance for farmers.'' It referred to a
$1.2 billion supplemental spending bill passed by the House last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder said other Texas Democrats, including Turner, can
expect more NRCC press releases about their votes throughout the
election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   She said the press releases are not meant to attack lawmakers,
but to inform voters. ``This is certainly an effort on our behalf
to let people back home know what their members are doing,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sandlin said the attacks will not resonate with voters, who are
tired of partisan bickering.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Republicans spent as much time working on policy as
they do sending out bogus press releases, maybe we could get
something done in the country,'' he said. ``I guess it shows what
their mind set really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandlin was one of 211 House members who opposed the spending
bill. He said its provisions could hurt foreign markets for U.S.
agriculture. ``The very last thing that Texas farmers need is to
have another financial crisis abroad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' spokesperson, Vance Gore, said Edwards voted against
the GOP budget plan because it is ``nothing short of pie in the
sky,'' and that Edwards ``wants to see money put into Social
Security and Medicare and paying down the national debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Walter, who follows the House for the Cook Political Report,
said the Republicans' key to keeping control of the chamber, where
they now have a 10-seat majority, is finding strong challengers for
incumbent Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sending out a press release and dogging them for their votes
is one thing. Getting a really strong candidate in against them is
the real test,'' she said. ``You can have everything going for you
on paper but if you don't have a good candidate, none of that is
going to help you.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the GOP focus on Texas, some strategists say, is
that a presidential candidacy by popular Gov. George W. Bush could
translate into Republican gains in congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, however, Bush's re-election coattails extended only
to statewide races as every Democratic House incumbent from Texas
headed back to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason was that some Texas Democrats have their own
conservative credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Turner and Sandlin voted with Republicans for a tax cut last
year, and they voted in favor of a constitutional amendment to
allow school prayer that fell short of the two-thirds majority
needed for passage.
</P>
<P>
   Turner was among only 31 Democrats in the House to vote for the
GOP's open-ended impeachment inquiry of President Clinton's
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of key votes in the previous Congress showed that
Turner voted against his own party's majority 41 percent of the
time. Edwards voted against the Democrats only 16 percent of the
time, the analysis showed, leading many strategists to conclude
that the GOP missed a golden opportunity last year by not running a
Republican candidate against him.
</P>
<P>
   All three of the Texans' districts are considered conservative.
The Republican presidential candidate, Bob Dole, outpolled
President Clinton in Edwards' and Sandlin's districts in 1996 and
ran even with him in Turner's.

PRINCETON APPOINTMENT CREATES AN UPROAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SYLVIA NASAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not since 1940, when City College of New York tried to hire an
atheist and advocate of free love, Bertrand Russell, has the
appointment of an academic philosopher by an American university
created such an uproar. The choice of Peter Singer, a world
renowned animal rights advocate, for a chair in bioethics at
Princeton University's Center for Human Values, has jolted this
genteel college town as well as the field of bioethics.
</P>
<P>
   Editorialists have compared Singer's hiring to that of a Nazi. A
writer in The Wall Street Journal accused Princeton of
``jettisoning ... the understanding of man's dignity that has
defined Western civilization for two millennia.''
</P>
<P>
   What has prompted such comparisons is Singer's defense, in
certain circumstances, of euthanasia not only for terminally ill
adults but also for severely disabled infants. Rejecting
traditional moral absolutes on which American law and the
Judeo-Christian tradition are based, Singer argues that ``no
conclusions about what we ought to do can validly be drawn from a
description of what most people in our society think we ought to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the controversy over this 52-year-old professor is
not just about a single university appointment; it also reflects
deep divisions and even deeper anxieties over ethical decisions
being made every day in clinics and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his obviously inflammatory ideas, Singer is not easily
categorized. ``The most dangerous man in the world today,'' as he
was labeled by one disabled-rights activist, has an Oxford degree,
a prodigious record of scholarly and popular publications, and a
list of good works that includes founding the International
Association of Bioethics, leading the great ape project to protect
chimps and gorillas, and annually giving one-fifth his income to
famine relief agencies. Not scheduled to begin teaching ethics at
Princeton until the fall, Singer, the father of three children, is
in Australia campaigning against the sale of eggs laid by cooped-up
(as opposed to free-range) chickens and writing a biography of one
of his three Viennese grandparents who perished in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Princeton chose Singer after a yearlong search that involved
three committees of scholars from disciplines as disparate as
molecular biology, Slavic studies, religion and economics, as well
as 19 outside experts from around the world. ``The letters said
there was nobody better in the world than Singer,'' said Amy
Gutmann, a committee member who is a former dean of faculty and
head of the Center for Human Values. At every level, there was
unanimous approval.
</P>
<P>
   Even Singer's harshest critics, who range from foes of abortion
to activists for the disabled, agree that his academic credentials
are solid gold. If anything, it is his accessible eminence that
worries them. David Oderberg, a philosopher at Reading University
in England and a former Singer disciple turned critic, says his
main concern is that ``he's one of the most popular, charismatic,
influential and accessible thinkers'' in the field of bioethics.
</P>
<P>
   Singer has championed a view that until recently was regarded as
quaintly old-fashioned among most philosophers: that philosophy
ought to be concerned primarily with what it means to live a good
life. And unlike the abstract and often impenetrable language of
the dominant analytic school, he speaks in clear, easily
understandable prose.
</P>
<P>
   He makes a point, for instance, of avoiding euphemisms like
``death with dignity'' or ``helping to die.'' Helga Kuhse, his
co-author on several books on life-and-death issues, says,
``Peter's greatest `offense,' and mine, is that we do not beautify
or desensitize issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer is a follower of utilitarianism, which was inspired by
the 19th-century philosopher Jeremy Bentham. For utilitarians, the
morality of an action depends chiefly on its consequences rather
than on its intrinsic rightness. ``He's committed to these
philosophical principles of achieving the greatest good for the
greatest number,'' says Christina Hawke Smith, a conservative
philosopher at the American Enterprise Institute who once studied
under Singer. ``He goes where that leads him, and it leads him to
some unusual places.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the things Singer talks about sound like applications
of the Golden Rule. He insists that people are duty bound to
relieve suffering with no regard to race, sex, nationality or even
species. That means one shouldn't eat animals or experiment on them
and that people should give a significant slice of their income to
relieve poverty around the world.
</P>
<P>
   His views do not in themselves inspire vehement reactions. Where
Singer has drawn fire, though, is when he has applied this
reasoning to the beginning and end of life, to severely disabled
newborns and terminally ill patients. His ethics are concerned with
the quality of life, which he believes is based on rationality,
self-awareness and empathy; not the sanctity of life, as many
religions teach.
</P>
<P>
   Thus he would allow parents and doctors to kill newborns with
drastic disabilities (like the absence of higher brain function, an
incompletely formed spine called spina bifida or even hemophilia)
instead of just letting ``nature take its course'' and allowing the
infants to die. To Singer, a newborn has no greater right to life
than any other being of comparable rationality and capacity for
emotion, including pigs, cows and dogs. ``Infants are sentient
beings who are neither rational nor self-conscious. So if we turn
to consider the infants in themselves, independently of the
attitudes of their parents, since their species is not relevant to
their moral status, the principles that govern the wrongness of
killing nonhuman animals who are sentient but not rational or
self-conscious must apply here, too,'' he has written.
</P>
<P>
   There are qualifications. Despite charges from critics that he
would have approved the killing of a Helen Keller or a Franklin D.
Roosevelt, Singer makes clear, for instance, that killing a
disabled person who wants to live is never justified and that in
the case of infants or others who can't make their will known, such
choices are for parents and doctors to make, not the state.
</P>
<P>
   Singer contends, with some justification, that his views are
more nuanced than some people make them out to be. To him there is
no moral distinction between allowing an infant to die _ say by
withholding a life-saving operation to a newborn with severe spina
bifida _ and killing it by legal injection. Indeed, in that
instance, he says, killing may be more moral.
</P>
<P>
   His critics see it differently. ``Singer's views virtually
amount to an incitement to murder,'' Oderberg, the Reading
University philosopher, says. Others warn that condoning killing of
any kind puts society on a slippery slope; by deciding that some
people's lives are simply too miserable and hopeless to live, are
we devaluing the lives of all people? ``We're all damaged in one
way or another,'' said John Dolan, a bioethicist at the University
of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   And to many people, the notion of equating babies with chimps or
dogs is just plain loony.
</P>
<P>
   Singer has won few converts on these issues, particularly in
respect to infants. Nonetheless, even those skeptical of his
theories give him credit for clarifying issues that have often been
handled sloppily. Ms. Hoff-Summers at the American Enterprise
Institute said: ``He's not a firebrand. He's very thoughtful and
careful.'' George Kateb, a political scientist at Princeton, puts
it more broadly: ``Moral philosophy is nothing but a tangle of
troubles. We must praise anyone who can make arguments that are
rigorous, principled, clear and are open to rebuttal.''

</P>
<P>
   The son of Viennese Jews who escaped to Australia in 1938,
shortly after Hitler's invasion, Singer grew up in the meat-eating,
God-fearing, Union Jack waving Australia of the 1950s. At Melbourne
University he first studied law but got bored and switched to
philosophy. He credits his wife, a wide-ranging reader and lively
conversationalist, with waking him up to the pleasures of
philosophy, ``considering issues for the sake of the issues
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   At Melbourne he led an antidraft organization and wrote his
thesis on civil disobedience. In 1971 he went to Oxford to study
philosophy and decided that to be taken seriously, philosophical
conclusions had to be reflected in action.
</P>
<P>
   ``From when I first saw pictures in newspapers of people
starving, from when people asked you to donate some of your pocket
money for collections at school,'' he said. ``I always thought,
`Why that much, why not more?'''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, he wrote an essay, ``Animal Liberation,'' which
later grew into a book of the same title. It sold hundreds of
thousands of copies. In the essay he argued that specie-ism _ that
is, assuming that human beings are superior to other species _ was
as outdated as racism, that raising animals for food or
experimentation was as bad as slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations with fellow students at Oxford who were moral
vegetarians led him to those ideas. One day, someone asked him,
``Why do you think it's terribly wrong to treat humans in certain
ways and not to take account of animals in your moral
calculations?'' he recalled. ``It wasn't flaky. I had no good
answer about why not being a member of our species left them out of
our moral calculations.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembers taking long walks with his father along a riverbank
on weekends. Ernst Singer, who had asthma, used to point to the
fishermen sitting on the banks and the fish gasping next to them.
``He used to say how cruel that was,'' Singer said. ``He didn't
understand how people could think it was fun. That made me aware,
though I never drew logical consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're dealing with individuals, should we give great
weight to the species that the individual belongs to, or should we
give weight to the characteristics of that being, characteristics
like rationality, self-awareness, the ability to think morally or
to respond emphatically?'' he asks. ``Thinking about the fact that
we would never do to infants what we routinely do to animals made
me realize that there is a prejudice going on here.''
</P>
<P>
   While his views have enraged many people, they have also helped
create the animal rights movement and persuaded hundreds of
thousands to become vegetarians. With his Oxford credentials,
Singer helped legitimize concerns about the treatment of animals as
a philosophical issue.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the 1970s, he got involved in medical ethics. At
the time, Ms. Kuhse said, philosophers were debating whether there
was a meaningful distinction between killing and letting people
die, particularly when people are in great pain and dying takes a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Nazism and eugenics movements have cast a long shadow
on today's debates on genetic engineering, abortion and the like.
So far the most ferocious opposition to Singer has been in
German-speaking countries where advocates for the disabled have
labeled his views ``fascist and murderous.'' Meanwhile, some
English academics have argued that academic freedom doesn't protect
patently false beliefs and approve of protesters who would prevent
him from lecturing. Jenny Teichman, a philosopher at Cambridge, for
example, argues that ``false philosophy can be dangerous and ... if
circumstances prevent its being refuted in print, it is probably
all right, in extreme cases, to silence it in other ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the response in the United States has been more muted.
There have been no serious calls for Princeton to cancel the
appointment, although antiabortion activists have promised to
picket his classes.
</P>
<P>
   Singer, whose course will be called questions of life and death,
says he is looking forward to being where the action is and says he
will engage anyone who wants to argue with him. Anthony Grafton, a
historian of debates in academe, says that's the right attitude:
``If you take positions on animals or human embryos, you'd better
be willing to accept a fair amount of heat.''

 &HT;    GOP TARGETS TEXANS AS HOUSE CAMPAIGN STARTS EARLY
 &HT;    520&AMP;add. With CONSERVATIVES-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and
(p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the smallest House majority in 44 years, the
Republican Party is gearing up for the next election early by
targeting Democrats in districts friendly to the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   The voting may be more than 18 months away, but the National
Republican Congressional Committee has begun sending out press
releases attacking the voting records of conservative and moderate
House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely are keeping a close eye on key Democrats who we
think are vulnerable in 2000,'' said Jill Schroeder, spokesperson
for the NRCC.
</P>
<P>
   One focus of the campaign is Texas, where the hit list includes
Chet Edwards of Waco, Max Sandlin of Marshall and Jim Turner of
Crockett.
</P>
<P>
   The three are on a ``a big list'' of House seats that the NRCC
considers as possible GOP gains next year, Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the House race has already started, Schroeder answered:
``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent press release criticized Edwards and Sandlin for voting
against the GOP budget blueprint for next year, saying they were
trying to block billions of dollars for schools and tax relief for
middle-class families.
</P>
<P>
   Another NRCC press release accused Sandlin of putting ``foreign
interests ahead of aid to Texas families'' by rejecting ``$153
million in much-needed assistance for farmers.'' It referred to a
$1.2 billion supplemental spending bill passed by the House last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder said other Texas Democrats, including Turner, can
expect more NRCC press releases about their votes throughout the
election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   She said the press releases are not meant to attack lawmakers,
but to inform voters. ``This is certainly an effort on our behalf
to let people back home know what their members are doing,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sandlin said the attacks will not resonate with voters, who are
tired of partisan bickering.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Republicans spent as much time working on policy as
they do sending out bogus press releases, maybe we could get
something done in the country,'' he said. ``I guess it shows what
their mind set really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandlin was one of 211 House members who opposed the spending
bill. He said its provisions could hurt foreign markets for U.S.
agriculture. ``The very last thing that Texas farmers need is to
have another financial crisis abroad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' spokesperson, Vance Gore, said Edwards voted against
the GOP budget plan because it is ``nothing short of pie in the
sky,'' and that Edwards ``wants to see money put into Social
Security and Medicare and paying down the national debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Walter, who follows the House for the Cook Political Report,
said the Republicans' key to keeping control of the chamber, where
they now have a 10-seat majority, is finding strong challengers for
incumbent Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sending out a press release and dogging them for their votes
is one thing. Getting a really strong candidate in against them is
the real test,'' she said. ``You can have everything going for you
on paper but if you don't have a good candidate, none of that is
going to help you.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the GOP focus on Texas, some strategists say, is
that a presidential candidacy by popular Gov. George W. Bush could
translate into Republican gains in congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, however, Bush's re-election coattails extended only
to statewide races as every Democratic House incumbent from Texas
headed back to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason was that some Texas Democrats have their own
conservative credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Turner and Sandlin voted with Republicans for a tax cut last
year, and they voted in favor of a constitutional amendment to
allow school prayer that fell short of the two-thirds majority
needed for passage.
</P>
<P>
   Turner was among only 31 Democrats in the House to vote for the
GOP's open-ended impeachment inquiry of President Clinton's
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of key votes in the previous Congress showed that
Turner voted against his own party's majority 41 percent of the
time. Edwards voted against the Democrats only 16 percent of the
time, the analysis showed, leading many strategists to conclude
that the GOP missed a golden opportunity last year by not running a
Republican candidate against him.
</P>
<P>
   All three of the Texans' districts are considered conservative.
The Republican presidential candidate, Bob Dole, outpolled
President Clinton in Edwards' and Sandlin's districts in 1996 and
ran even with him in Turner's.

WALTER CRONKITE HONORS COURAGE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Ala., La.)  By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A couple of years ago, the Interfaith Alliance, a
relatively small organization with the big-time goal of countering
the political activities of religious conservative groups, sent out
a fund-raising letter that turned out to be a news-maker.
</P>
<P>
   It contained a message from Walter Cronkite, former anchorman of
the ``CBS Evening News,'' whom polls once showed to be among the
most trusted figures in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a decade,'' he wrote, ``I have watched with growing
apprehension the rise to political influence in our country of a
genuinely radical movement known as the religious right wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then the alliance _ whose directors come from across the
spectrum of major religions, Western and Eastern _ has seen its
membership nearly double to more than 80,000, said its executive
director, the Rev. C. Welton Gaddy, a Baptist minister from Monroe,
La.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alliance would not be as strong as it is today, if it were
not for the endorsement of Cronkite,'' Gaddy said.
</P>
<P>
   He was sitting next to the man he had praised, in Cronkite's
Manhattan apartment on Thursday. The next day, the organization
presented a new award, the Walter Cronkite Faith and Freedom Award,
intended to honor people who work for religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Cronkite said he had lent his name to the organization ``because
of my exceedingly deep concern that there are people who were
usurping the Christian doctrine to pursue a political agenda.'' He
said that the message of those people was that anyone who did not
agree with them was not a good Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Cronkite specifically criticized the Christian Coalition, the
organization founded by the religious broadcaster Pat Robertson,
and its widely distributed voter guides, which the coalition says
compare the positions of candidates seeking public office.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has the right to tell me if I'm a good Christian,''
Cronkite said. ``That's in my heart and in my soul. It's
particularly no one's business if it's a political objective.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he retired as CBS anchorman in March 1981, Cronkite, 82,
has kept a busy giving speeches, writing his autobiography and
making television documentaries. It was while working on a
documentary a few years ago that he encountered the alliance and
also grew concerned about the political influence of religious
conservative groups.
</P>
<P>
   Cronkite said he was later asked by Terry Anderson, the former
Associated Press reporter who spent five years as a hostage in
Lebanon, if he would help the alliance, which also describes its
mission as attempting to inject ``civility and compassion into
civil affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My conscience could not permit me to turn it down,'' Cronkite
said, adding that he felt free to help because he no longer worked
for a news organization and did not have to ``run from taking a
position on things.''
</P>
<P>
   Cronkite said he felt an affinity with the Interfaith Alliance,
a five-year-old group based in Washington. ``One of the misfortunes
is, we didn't organize earlier,'' he said. ``It gave the demagogues
of the extreme right a headstart.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it has more than 100 chapters nationwide, the
Interfaith Alliance seems dwarfed compared with the Christian
Coalition. The alliance, together with its own nonprofit
foundation, has a budget of $2.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, the coalition's budget this year will total $15
million to $20 million, said its executive director, Randy Tate. It
also has a list of 2.1 million people who contribute either money
or time to its work.
</P>
<P>
   As for Cronkite's criticism, Tate responded generally: ``Our
belief is that all Americans, including religious conservatives,
have every right to be involved in the political process,'' he
said. ``Unfortunately, some on the religious left, including the
Interfaith Alliance, would attempt to stifle the debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Cronkite asked not to have a hand in selecting recipients of the
award that bears his name. That was done by a six-person committee,
one of whose members, former President Gerald Ford, suggested the
award go to people not already well known, Gaddy said.
</P>
<P>
   At a ceremony in Manhattan Saturday, awards were given to the
Rev. Chriss H. Doss, director of the Center for the Study of Law
and the Church at Samford University in Birmingham, Ala., and to
Donna Red Wing, national field director of the Human Rights
Campaign, which supports gay and lesbian rights.
</P>
<P>
   According to the alliance, Doss encouraged public acceptance in
Alabama of a court ruling against school prayer, and Ms. Red Wing
created an interfaith worship event for supporters of gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing we want to honor here is courage,'' Cronkite
said. ``Because it takes courage to stand up in most communities in
America and enunciate what might be a minority position.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he described himself as ``a person of faith'' in the
alliance's fund-raising letter, Cronkite did not think it was
appropriate to discuss his religious beliefs in detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``No, because that is the very principle that I
am defending,'' he said. ``I want to stand on that principle. It is
nobody's business.''

</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MAIN _ WASHINGTON _ A top Yugoslav diplomat said Friday
it would be ``unnatural'' to release three U.S. soldiers while NATO
continues to bomb his country. Meanwhile, NATO pressed its air
attacks despite bad weather. In Moscow, Russian President Boris
Yeltsin warned NATO not to introduce ground forces into the
conflict. Developing. (Deans, Cox News Service).

   KOSOVO-CONGRESS _ WASHINGTON _ Congress, which left town two
weeks ago as the bombing of Yugoslavia began, returns Monday to
confront a war that is escalating daily. Lawmakers have been quiet
on the issue, but some influential members are beginning to speak
up in favor of using ground troops. 20. (Malone, Cox News Service).

<P>
   KOSOVO-ALBANIA _ KORCE, Albania _ More than 10,000 bewildered
Kosovo refugees are recovering from their second or even third
forced deportation in as many weeks, after authorities in
neighboring Macedonia tricked them onto buses and abruptly dumped
them off here in this chilly border town. (Kunstel/Albright, Cox
News Service) WITH PHOTOS.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REFUGEES _ SKOPJE, Macedonia _ U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees Sadako Ogata said Friday that Macedonia's government has
assured her that its borders will remain open and that more fleeing
ethnic Albanians will be free to seek sanctuary here. The
announcement came after Macedonia relocated refugees a few days ago
and said it would not take any more. (Holmes, Cox News Service)

   TURNER-TRIP _ WASHINGTON _ Interview with Rep. Jim Turner,
D-Texas, who returned late Thursday from a trip to NATO
headquarters and NATO's Aviano air base. About a dozen lawmakers
traveled with Defense Secretary William Cohen on the two-day trip
to examine U.S. troop safety and readiness in the Balkans. Turner
represents the 2nd Congressional District of Texas, which includes
Huntsville, the home of Spc. Steven Gonzales, one of three American
soldiers captured last week by Serbian forces. (Cox News Service).

   TORNADO _ CINCINNATI _ An early morning tornado three to five
miles long ripped through the suburb of Blue Ash and the
surrounding area and left at least seven dead, a dozen injured,
200,000 without power. This was an F1 or F2 storm, which means
winds of up to 160 miles per hour. (Dayton Daily News, Cox News
Service) Eds: This national weather wrap will include material from
other states as needed. WITH PHOTOS from Dayton, which shot both on
the ground and in the air in Cincinnati.

<P>
   TORNADO-FAMILY _ CINCINNATI _ The sound of a siren through an
open bedroom woke up high school senior Julie Streck in Blue Ash
just before 5 a.m. Good thing. She quickly alerted her three
siblings and parents and together they hustled into the basement as
the tornado hit. In seconds, their kitchen was in the back yard,
the flooring over the basement where the Strecks huddled was ripped
off and a huge outdoors deck was gone. This will be an eyewitness
account. (Budd, Dayton Daily News) WITH PHOTO
</P>
<P>
   TORNADO-COACH _ CINCINNATI _ The home of Cincinnati Bengals
assistant coach Al Roberts in Blue Ash was destroyed and two
neighbors down his street were killed. Roberts was in bed at 5:30
when he heard the wind. He didn't have much time to think about it.
The wind lifted him and his wife out of his bed, tossed them aside
and the mattress landed on top of him. Roberts said he looked up at
the empty sky through his missing roof and prayed. Bricks from his
chimney smashed one of his two cars. (Ludwig, Dayton Daily News)

   TORNADO-ANNIVERSARY _ ATLANTA _ While Cincinattians awoke to
neighborhood destruction unlike anything they'd ever imagined,
Atlantans marked the one-year anniversary of a killer tornado that
spawned simillar destruction exactly one year ago. Georgia Gov. Roy
Barnes congratulated the residents of the Dunwoody section of
Atlanta on their spirit of survival, and the neighborhood
celebrated with block parties, a worship service and the giving
away of 8,000 trees to replant the Dunwoody forest. Residents also
reacted to the destruction in Ohio. (Jaskevich, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   TEST-TAMPERING _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The criminal indictments
against the Austin school district and its No. 2 administrator
demonstrate the kind of pressure to perform that the state's
accountability has fostered. What began with the discovery that
mistakes in data could have caused an Austin school to get a lower
rating than it deserved, became deliberate altering of test data to
give schools higher ratings than they deserved. We get people to
talk about the atmosphere in which the tampering occurred and
layout the chronology. (Jayson, Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   TORT-REFORM-BILL _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Tort reformers' key bill is
expected to be voted out of a legislative subcommittee on Thursday,
but it might be too late. The bill languished for at least three
weeks in a special subcommittee created by Lt. Gov. Rick Perry to
handle all tort reform legislation. The subcommittee is chaired by
Perry's boyhood friend, Troy Fraser, who has positioned himself as
the key tort reform champion this year. Yet, he was unable to
quickly get the bill out of his own committee. The bill relates to
how juries assess blame _ and monetary damages _ against employers
for civil liability. (McCarthy, Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   STOLEN-HOSTS _ PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. _ Thieves broke into St.
Ignatius Cathedral overnight, stole the tabernacle and descrated
it. The thieves took the sacred box into a nearby field, perhaps
thinking it contained money, and tore it open. They scattered the
consecrated hosts over the field. In the Catholic religion, the
consecrated hosts represent the body of Christ. This is not the
first time the cathedral, home to the bishop who presides over the
diocese of Palm Beach, has been vandalized. The clergy are in
shock, say the tabernacle and maybe even the whole cathedral will
have to reconsecrated. (Brogan, Palm Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   BLACKCOLLEGE-REUNION _ The Black College Reunion in Daytona
Beach is gathering steam with an expectedf 100,000 students
arriving from around the east coast and southeast. We look at
parallels to Atlanta _ how involved are local colleges, what is the
atittude of local police and governments, what is the acceptance of
the local residents.

   JAMAICA-BEE _ MIAMI _ For 70 straight years, a U.S. citizen won
the annual national spelling bee. But last May, Jamaica's Jody-Anne
Maxwell became the first non-citizen to triumph. This year, though,
Jamaica is out. The island traditionally picks its winner in
August. But new rules disqualify any representative who wins her
regional spell-off before February. That's got a lot of Jamaicans,
as well as African-Americans, charging that racism is at work.

   HOUSE-CONSERVATIVES _ WASHINGTON _ A powerful GOP group is
already attacking the voting records of conservative democrats in
the new Congress. Those on the hit list include Texans Chet
Edwards, of Waco; Max Sandlin, of Marshall; and Jim Turner, of
Crockett. All three represent conservative districts which could be
heavily targeted by the GOP in 2000. It looks like the battle to
control the House is underway _ a cool 18 months before the
election. And the excitement over a George W. Bush candidacy is
fueling GOP dreams of long coattails in conservative Texas
districts. (Moscoso, Cox News Service)

pace it hit during much of the 1990s. But after a lackluster
increase of 3.7 percent last year, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index seems back on track to reporting decent first-quarter gains,
according to First Call Corp. of Boston, which tracks the earnings
forecasts of Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   First Call estimates that S&AMP;P earnings from continuing
operations will jump 8 percent to 9 percent for the first quarter
versus the corresponding period last year. If the forecasts are
accurate, it would be the first time since 1997 that quarterly
results beat the index's long-term growth rate of 7 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half the first-quarter growth is expected to come from
technology companies. The analysts surveyed by First Call predicted
a 33 percent increase in quarterly profits from such concerns.
Chuck Hill, First Call's research director, says many of these
companies have easy numbers to beat from last year, when computer
makers' first-quarter results suffered as retailers reduced
inventories.
</P>
<P>
   But the predictions call for very weak results from energy,
commodity and basic materials companies. Analysts expect
first-quarter energy profits, for example, to drop 50 percent,
according to First Call.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more good news. The number of ``negative earnings
preannouncements'' _ disclosures that earnings are not going to
meet expectations _ is running far below previous tallies.
</P>
<P>
   IBES International, another earnings tracker, says just 76
percent of first-quarter preannouncements were negative _ the
smallest percentage since it started collecting the data three
years ago. (The average is 83 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 6,000 companies tracked by IBES will not report
results for a few weeks, but Joseph Abbott, an IBES equity
strategist, says the data are a good sign. ``Springtime is starting
to look sunny again, and the economy is getting warm,'' he said.

   April 15: The Deadline for Incremental Rate Applications
</P>
<P>
   With April 15 only four days away, harried investors are of
course rushing to open their ``Incremental Rate Applications'' for
1998. That is, their ``Indivisible Retirement Allowances.'' Or was
it their ``Income Ratification Arrangements?''
</P>
<P>
   If you are confused, you are not alone. According to a recent
poll by American Century Investments, 31 percent of investors could
not identify what ``IRA'' stood for in investing. When answering a
multiple-choice question, many chose from the examples listed
above, refused to answer or confessed to not knowing. (Technically,
IRA is an abbreviation for Individual Retirement Arrangement, but
pollsters also gave credit for the more common term, Individual
Retirement Account.)
</P>
<P>
   Nomenclature was not the only difficult subject for investors.
In the poll, 753 people who saved for retirement were asked 10
questions about IRAs; the average number of correct answers was 4.
And no one had a perfect score.
</P>
<P>
   A sample question: Can a person contribute to both a Roth IRA
and a traditional IRA? Answer: Yes (if the total is no more than
$2,000).

   FUNDS WATCH: DO SMALL-CAP ANALYSTS MATTER?
</P>
<P>
   Is the Wall Street analyst becoming irrelevant to the top
executives of America's smaller companies and the mutual fund
managers who own small-capitalization shares? Possibly, according
to a survey by Tempest Consultants, a London-based firm.
</P>
<P>
   The survey examined several industry issues from the perspective
of corporations with market values of $3 billion or less. It showed
a growing conflict between the priorities of analysts and the
desires of both the fund families and the companies themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The funds want the analysts to provide more basic research.
Unfortunately, the report said, roughly 500 analysts surveyed say
they would prefer to spend less time visiting small companies and
doing fundamental research and more time visiting institutional
clients, like fund managers.
</P>
<P>
   The top executives of these small companies already feel
neglected by Wall Street analysts, according to the survey. As a
result, they plan to spend more time with the funds' own analysts,
they said. ``In some cases this has marginalized the role of the
broker as the intermediary'' between small companies and the funds
that buy their shares, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
   Tempest polled more than 1,000 small companies and 54 of the 100
largest small-cap funds, in addition to Wall Street analysts.

FLEET TERMS LATEST SEVERANCE PACKAGE BEST EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Sensitive to criticism that its previous downsizing
programs were too harsh, Fleet Financial Group Inc. unveiled Friday
what it termed its best severance package ever for thousands of
staff members who will lose their jobs as a result of the company's
merger with BankBoston Corp.
</P>
<P>
   While falling slightly short of a similar plan announced last
week by BankBoston, Fleet's severance terms are ``very
comprehensive and generous,'' Fleet said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet, New England's largest bank, said it expects a reduction
of about 5,000 jobs at the combined company _ at the upper end of
the 4,000 to 5,000 range cited earlier by both banks. The trimming
will reduce the new company's 60,000-strong work force by 8.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both Fleet and BankBoston, which are merging to form the
nation's eighth-largest bank, hope actual layoffs will be lower due
to a hiring freeze and attrition. Fleet said layoff levels would
not exceed 5,000 and that actual numbers could be lower.
</P>
<P>
   A four-page Fleet memo sent to the company's 35,000 staff
members outlined the severance program and promised more details
later.
</P>
<P>
   With basic severance pay, ``enhanced'' pay, merger supplements,
extended medical and life insurance, and assistance in finding new
jobs, Fleet's program is nearly identical to BankBoston's.
</P>
<P>
   Payouts are calculated according to salary levels and years of
service. The main difference between the two companies' packages is
that laid-off Fleet workers can receive a maximum total severance
benefit equal to 60 weeks of base pay, while for BankBoston
employees the period is nearly 87 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our severance program provides a solid financial foundation
for employees to transition to new jobs,'' said Fleet spokesman
James Mahoney. ``We think it's generous by any measure.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to previous years, Fleet promised to provide
comprehensive assistance and job placement programs to help
laid-off employees find new work. Fleet had few such programs when
it cut approximately 3,000 workers after acquiring Shawmut National
Corp. in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Like BankBoston, Fleet is offering laid-off employees two weeks'
base pay for each year of service; an enhanced package ranging from
10 weeks to 30 weeks of base pay; and a supplement ranging from 4.3
to 8.7 weeks of base salary.
</P>
<P>
   Layoffs help companies that are merging achieve savings by
eliminating job overlap. Job cuts at the combined bank will not
take place until after the merger is completed later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet, which has acquired 50 companies in the past 10 years, has
let thousands go as a result of its acquisitions and cost-cutting
drives. While Fleet chief executive Terrence Murray is praised as
an efficient manager, he was criticized for an unpopular austerity
drive in 1993-1994 in which staff members who found ways to save
money lost their jobs anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, BankBoston took pains to be sensitive to employees
when it reduced its work force by 2,000 after acquiring BayBanks
Inc. in 1996. Then, the company consulted with religious and
academic figures to develop its severance program.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Fleet employees, many BankBoston workers will receive a
miniature windfall in stock options as a result of the merger. The
options, granted in recent years, can be exercised because
BankBoston is technically being acquired by Fleet.

TOBACCO BILLBOARD AD CHANGE TO IMPACT 2 BOSTON COMPANES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Tobacco ads may soon have an impact on two Boston
companies.
</P>
<P>
   While Massachusetts' largest billboard company has to wean
itself of all cigarette advertising revenues by the end of the
year, New England's largest ad agency, Arnold Communications, has a
chance to win millions of dollars in new business for devising
antismoking ads.
</P>
<P>
   Under a settlement reached last year between states and the
tobacco industry, billboard cigarette advertising will be pulled
down by the end of the month, even though tobacco companies had
already leased billboard space for all 12 months of 1999, said Liz
Palumbo, president of AK Media of Massachusetts, the state's
largest owner of billboards.
</P>
<P>
   Once the cigarette ads come down, the billboards will feature
antismoking messages from state governments, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the state's Department of Public Health has
been running antismoking ads for nearly six years, but many states
don't have similar programs.
</P>
<P>
   So the National Cancer Institute has turned to two ad agencies
to come up with a national billboard campaign that will break on
these newly opened up billboards in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   One of those ad agencies is Arnold, which already handles the
$11 million annual account for the Massachusetts Department of
Public Health's antismoking efforts.
</P>
<P>
   On behalf of the National Cancer Institute, Arnold has devised a
series of ads that could appear on billboards in about 17 states,
including Georgia, Massachusetts, and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold will receive only a small payment for these ads, but the
ads could give Arnold wide exposure at a time when a foundation set
up by the tobacco settlement is contemplating spending millions of
dollars on antismoking efforts.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gregory Connolly, director of the tobacco control
program at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, that
foundation plans to spend $1.5 billion over five years, most of it
earmarked for antismoking ads.
</P>
<P>
   Given its experience in the field, Arnold is well positioned to
win a chunk of that money, said Connolly, who may be biased as the
head of an agency that's an Arnold client.
</P>
<P>
   Of course with as much as $300 million a year at stake, many ad
agencies will be vying for the account.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold got the state's antismoking account when it acquired
Houston Herstek Favat in early 1998. The campaign has won a slew of
industry awards, and the latest series of ads, with the theme
``Where's the outrage?'' broke this week.
</P>
<P>
   Award-winning work was one reason why Arnold was selected in
1998 by the US Food and Drug Administration to devise a $10
million-a-year ad campaign aimed at discouraging store clerks from
selling cigarettes to minors, said Lisa Unsworth, an Arnold
executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold is certainly interested in bidding for the Tobacco
Control Foundation's account, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But how that will play out is anyone's guess. Not everyone
thinks antismoking ads are a good idea. Potential critics could
include Governor Paul Cellucci, who has questioned the
effectiveness of antismoking ads and has suggested that public
money would be better spent on AIDS victims and fire prevention
programs for school children.
</P>
<P>
   As Arnold considers its next move, AK Media is adjusting to life
without tobacco ads, once the lifeblood of billboard companies. A
decade ago, about 25 percent of the company's billboards were
leased by tobacco companies, Palumbo said.
</P>
<P>
   But by the beginning of 1999, tobacco ads accounted for only 6
percent of AK's roughly 2,500 billboards; the plan was to have
completely phased out cigarette ads by 2001, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for AK, new technology means that billboard images
can be of comparable quality to a photo in a glossy magazine, and
that has made billboards attractive to Hollywood studios promoting
new movies and to retailers showing off fashions.
</P>
<P>
   These new clients have picked up some of the slack left by
tobacco clients. There's also some hope that the holding companies
that own cigarette brands, which have paid for the billboard space
through the end of 1999, will continue to lease billboards next
year but use the space to advertise their food products.
</P>
<P>
   For example, instead of advertising Marlboros, Philip Morris
might run ads for Kraft Foods.
</P>
<P>
   Palumbo declined to discuss the dollar impact of these changes.
AK Media is part of the Ackerley Group of Seattle, and the group
does not break out revenues by divisions, she said.

POLICE CHIEF MEET, DISCUSS RACE RELATIONS WITH CRITICS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Police chiefs meeting here to examine how their
officers could earn more public trust said Friday that complaints
about police misconduct are often valid and that departments have
far to go to meet demands for more accountability, respect and
courtesy.
</P>
<P>
   The daylong conference, which was held in private on Thursday,
was convened in response to the public outcry over the fatal
shooting of an unarmed West African immigrant by four white New
York City police officers and by questionable police behavior in
other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the chiefs described the hastily arranged meeting as
highly unusual for its urgency and candor, much of which focused on
race relations. Each of the 19 chiefs was asked to bring along a
local community leader, someone who was not necessarily a strong
supporter of the chief's department or its policies.
</P>
<P>
   The first two hours of the conference were set aside for the
community leaders to raise issues of concern to them, with the
chiefs required to listen in silence. The chiefs had their turn to
respond later, and for the most part, several said, they agreed
with the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are collectively committed to doing all we can to
strengthen community partnerships and take a hard look at our
recruitment, hiring, training and oversight practices,'' said
Thomas C. Frazier, the Baltimore police commissioner and president
of the organization that arranged the meeting, the Police Executive
Research Forum, a nonprofit group that studies police issues.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Yesterday's meeting should be considered the
beginning of a continuing dialogue. This process is clearly a
journey, not a destination.''
</P>
<P>
   The chiefs who attended represented large cities, including New
York, Philadelphia and Minneapolis, as well as smaller ones, like
Arlington, Va., and Stamford, Conn. The only specific policy
initiative they announced was a pledge to develop new standards for
traffic stops that include a higher degree of courtesy than many
officers typically display now, often when minority drivers are
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Such new procedures, the chiefs acknowledged, could include
something as simple as an apology to drivers who were found not to
have committed any crime.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at her weekly news conference on Thursday before
joining the chiefs' conference for about an hour, Attorney General
Janet Reno described traffic stops as an issue that is particularly
sensitive to blacks and other minorities, who are often pulled over
at a higher rate than whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so very important that we address the feelings of
Americans who feel that police officers are stopping them because
of race,'' she said, adding that if the police were unfairly
targeting minorities, ``Let's do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights division of the Justice Department is
investigating complaints about police behavior in a variety of
contexts in a number of places, including New York; Los Angeles;
Buffalo, N.Y., and the Washington suburb of Montgomery County, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Safir, the New York City police commissioner, said the
chiefs discussed creating a national standard for how officers
should conduct such stops. In New York, he said he would speed
plans for putting video cameras in patrol cars, with a pilot
program in the highway division to start as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said officials were analyzing the costs of such equipment
and seeking federal money to put the cameras in place, but were not
sure how long it might take to get a pilot program operating.
</P>
<P>
   Besides studying traffic-stop procedures, the chiefs said they
would work with leading civil rights organizations to amend
policing policies, and they vowed to seek more input from leaders
in their own communities, particularly on matters of race
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing views expressed by other chiefs, John Timoney, the
Philadelphia police commissioner, said: ``Frankly, there is a
problem with race in policing. To solve it, we have to deal openly
with it. If we don't stipulate that race is an issue, everything
flows from that and then it's just an academic exercise.''

</P>
<P>
   No recent episode demonstrated the problems more vividly than
the shooting death of Amadou Diallo, the West African immigrant who
was standing, unarmed, in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment
building on Feb. 4 when police fired 41 shots at him, hitting him
19 times. Four officers have pleaded not guilty to charges of
second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   To police critics in New York and elsewhere, the shooting
clearly demonstrated why average citizens, especially in minority
neighborhoods, have grown distrustful and afraid of people who are
paid to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Wexler, executive director of the research forum, which
represents chiefs in 300 cities of 50,000 people or more, said
several chiefs had called him in recent weeks to talk about how
they might stop the erosion of trust now that crime was falling in
most big cities, with chiefs getting much of the credit.
</P>
<P>
   Many, like Safir, find themselves on the defensive from people
who fear the police as much as criminals.
</P>
<P>
   To measure the extent of the problem, the research forum sent
out questionnaires, asking the chiefs and the community leaders
they designated, to assess race relations with the police. Wexler
said the responses from both sides reflected a surprising level of
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things this conference did was make it clear to me
that the perception is nationwide,'' Safir said. ``The complaints I
heard here were not unlike those I've heard from from 50 groups
I've spoken to since Feb. 4. Most complaints are not about force.
They're about respect. They're related to how people are treated.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir's guest at the conference was Richard E. Green, chief
executive of the Crown Heights Youth Collective, a neighborhood
outreach program in Brooklyn. Like other community leaders who
attended, he said he walked into the room on Thursday skeptical
that any meaningful progress might be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   He said he left feeling hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very productive, very frank discussion,'' he said.
``I heard things that gave me greater assurance things might
change. Was it nirvana? No. But they got the ball to the 20-yard
line. We have to work to get it into the end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the police chiefs said the conference turned their
initial wariness into optimism. Edward Davis, superintendent of
police in Lowell, Mass., said he ``expected trouble'' when the
discussions began.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there wasn't trouble,'' he said. ``We have an opportunity
to really change and make a difference. If we're honest about the
problems we all face and make a commitment, both sides can
succeed.''

 &HT;    PENTAGON ORDERS 1.1 MILLION MORE RATIONS FOR REFUGEES
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-MAIN.
 &HT;    By DAVID McNAUGHTON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Defense Department has put in a rush order
for more humanitarian daily rations, the meal packages being
airlifted to help feed Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Three companies _ in Cincinnati, McAllen, Texas, and Mullins,
S.C. _ will share the contract for about 1.1 million more packs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've asked those three manufacturers to accelerate
deliveries,'' Frank Johnson, spokesman for the Defense Supply
Center in Philadelphia, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Doing so will mean some overtime for workers over the next
couple weeks, according to one of the suppliers, SOPAKCO (CQ)
Packaging, in Mullins, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which also prepares Meals Ready-to-Eat food packs
for U.S. soldiers, is to produce about 370,000 of the humanitarian
versions. The humanitarian food packs have about 2,200 calories
each, are designed to provide a full day's nutrition, and do not
contain meat. They cost the U.S. government $3.93 each, Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The other two companies with orders are Wornick Co., McAllen,
Texas, and Ameriqual (CQ), in Cincinnati. Neither could be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Half a million humanitarian daily rations were flown from the
United States last week, and another 600,000 are being shipped this
week, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the additional 1.1 million rations will be used to
restock military depots, while part of the order will likely go to
the Balkans, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``There probably will be additional orders coming,'' he said.
``Things are changing all the time.''

CLINTON SEEKS SUPPORT FOR `PATIENT'S BILL OF RIGHTS'

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ With Congress reconvening next week, President
Clinton flew here Friday to try to whip up public enthusiasm for
the Democratic proposal to establish a ``patient's bill of
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told a group of about 400 union workers and health-care
providers that he had advocated the patients program until he was
``blue in the face,'' but he wanted the public to express its
support by signing a petition on the Internet to counter the
opposition of large health-maintenance organizations and insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there is a clear, unambiguous signal from the people of
the United States _ not just that we want this, not just that we
need this, not just that we believe in this _ the organized forces
of the status quo will do nothing,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   He said opponents were counting on the fact that Friday's public
relations campaign, coordinated with 100 Democrats in Congress
across the country, would not be able to ``break through on the
evening news tonight because of Kosovo,'' and so the
Republican-controlled Congress would not feel any pressure to pass
the legislation, which is one of the Democrats' top priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic proposal for new regulations on HMOs died last
year with the 105th Congress. So far this year, a Senate committee
has approved a Republican bill of rights, which Democrats say is
not strong enough. Republicans say the Democratic plan is too
expensive and overly restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Clinton imposed some aspects of the Democratic bill,
such as access to specialists and emergency treatment, on the 285
private insurance companies that provide coverage for the nation's
9 million federal employees and their families. On Friday he
announced he was requiring the plans to come into full compliance
with the bill, meaning they must add two more provisions: Give
patients more information about their plan and their doctor's fees,
and guarantee them continuity of care if they are in the middle of
a treatment or pregnancy and are forced to change health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said a yearlong study of the bill showed that its
provisions would cost patients less than $10 a year on top of what
they pay now, which varies from patient to patient. He does not
have the authority to extend to patients what could be the most
expensive element of the Democratic proposal _ the right to sue
health plans and collect damages.

   Now that has changed _ to ``maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Western leaders have asked Russia to mediate with
its ally Yugoslavia on ways to end the crisis, Moscow Friday
drastically raised the ante. In a day of nuclear saber-rattling,
contradictory statements and subsequent denials, the clearest
message coming from the Kremlin was this:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have already told NATO, Americans and Germans: Don't force
us to take military action, since that will certainly lead to a
European war or even a world war, which is inadmissible,'' Yeltsin
said in televised remarks during his meeting with the Communist
speaker of the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, Gennady
Seleznyov.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia will not get involved in the armed conflict in
Yugoslavia unless the Americans force us into it,'' Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin is under pressure from lawmakers and senior military
officers who interpret NATO's airstrikes against Yugoslavia as an
imperialist plot against Russia. Friday, the Russian leader
considered a proposal to unite Moscow and Belgrade politically, and
discussed reaiming Russia's nuclear weapons on NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
   Seleznyov caused world markets and Western diplomats to shudder
when he said after the meeting that Yeltsin had already given the
command to retarget the missiles ``against those countries which
are carrying out military action against Yugoslavia,'' according to
the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Seleznyov later backed away from his remarks, saying he had only
discussed the possibility of reaiming the weapons, and the Kremlin
and military commanders denied Yeltsin had given the order.
</P>
<P>
   Defense analysts say it is a quick and easy task for Russia to
redirect its nuclear missiles, currently aimed at nothing, on their
Cold War-era targets: the United States and its Western allies.
</P>
<P>
   But what would be a few seconds' work for programmers at
Russia's Strategic Rocket Forces would also represent a major break
in Moscow's post-Soviet relationship with the West, and a serious
escalation of Russia's oppostion to NATO's airtstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has made wild statements about nuclear weapons before,
once last year referring to Japan's nuclear arsenal (it does not
have one) and in 1997 announcing Russia had decided to remove the
warheads from its nuclear arsenal (it had not.) On those occasions,
Yeltsin's words were widely taken as a sign of his poor grasp of
events, due to illness, or rumored drinking.
</P>
<P>
   The latest remarks come in the context of Russia's harsh
reaction to the NATO attacks, which Yeltsin and his ministers have
called ``barbaric'' and an ``aggression'' against the Serbs, who
are Orthodox Christian Slavs like many Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin and his powerful prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, have
carefully avoided doing anything that would cause a clean break
with the West, and have pointedly rejected calls to send troops and
arms to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin has been under pressure to respond to the growing
anti-American mood among Russians, and calls for action in the
State Duma, where he faces an impeachment vote next week. And
Russia's military leaders have sounded increasingly hawkish, and
independent, in their saber-rattling over Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin Friday acccused the Duma of trying to blackmail him into
going to war by threatening him with an impeachment vote. Yeltsin's
chief of staff, Alexander Voloshin, threatenend military officers
with immediate dismissal is they made ``militant'' remarks.
Interfax mentioned Anatoly Kvashnin, who has made vague threats
about Russia's ability to use its nuclear weapons if threatened.
Another senior commander, Gen. Viktor Chechevatov, has publicly
called for Moscow to send troops to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Kremlin responded to the hawks, Yeltsin raised the
temperature of his own rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to go on to ground assault, to simply grab
Yugoslavia, make it their protectorate,'' said Yeltsin, speaking in
a hoarse voice a day after undergoing what the Kremlin called a
``check-up.'' ``We will not allow that. (NATO leaders) have to
understand, that Russia is next door...and we, of course, cannot
give up Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's spokesman said the president was seriously considering
Milosevic's request for Yugoslavia to join a political union
between Russia and its former Soviet neighbor, Belarus. Seleznyov
said he thought Yeltsin would make an announcement on the new union
``in a matter of days.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussing what that would mean, Seleznyov again contradicted
himself, first saying he thought Russia would then send troops and
its navy to the Balkans, but later saying in an interview on NTV
television that the purpose of the alliance would be to preempt
further NATO attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think NATO will start bombing our ally with whom we
form a united federation,'' Seleznyov said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's change of course comes after the United States and
other countries quietly appealed to Primakov to help get Milosevic
to agree to Western conditions for ending the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Halting the war would be a huge victory for Primakov, who has
sought to raise Russia's profile in the international arena despite
its weakened economic and political status. But a union with
Yugoslavia may weaken Moscow's already thin credibility in the
West.
</P>
<P>
   ``A union with Yugoslavia reduces Russia's room for manuver,''
said Moscow political analyst Andrei Piontowski. ``This is a really
big chance for Russia, and this is a foolish way to blow it.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said he would meet with Secretary
of State Madeleine K. Albright next week. Ivanov, who called
Albright to assure her that Russia had not retargeted its weapons,
also repeated Moscow's misigivings on Kosovo, saying he did not
believe NATO when the alliance denied any plans for a ground
invasion.

COUNTRY MUSIC AFICIONADO RELEASES DEFINITIVE CD-ROM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Barry McCloud started doing impressions on stage
at the age of 4, got into a rock and rockabilly band at 13 and was
a folk-music impresario for much of the 1960s in London.
</P>
<P>
   So how did this old-school Brit with roots in seemingly every
other kind of tunes not only get into country music, but actually
get into it enough to create a just-released CD-ROM called
Country.Com's Century of Country Music?
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I got into this was I've just really enjoyed
country music for over 30 years,'' said McCloud, a jovial,
self-deprecating fellow with a ready laugh.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, he was managing a bluegrass band whose music first
piqued his interest in country, an interest further raised when he
heard a few albums of classic stuff. That got him started.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, he was writing album liner notes for country
artists, but often had a difficult time finding reliable historical
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to a dozen different (reference) books and not
really finding what was needed,'' McCloud said. ``That was
precomputer. Then, when (personal computers) came along, it was
like manna from heaven. I started doing interviews, started coming
to Nashville about four times a year.''
</P>
<P>
   He got sidetracked into a recording and performing career, and
working with the trade journal Music City News, but eventually put
out ``Definitive Country: The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Country
Music.''
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to write a follow-up, however, publishers
wanted to do more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `What for? It's been done,' '' McCloud said. Then
StarWorks, an interactive publisher, contacted him about making a
CD-ROM version of his book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Well, I'm home,' '' said McCloud, who loves the
electronic format because ``you're not tied to a number of pages;
you can almost go out and indulge your whim. If it was technically
feasible, we could go out and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The disc is packed with stuff: biographies on 1,300 artists,
audio clips of interviews with 45 of them, a sophisticated search
engine that can find things like all songs with the word
``Memphis'' in the title, lengthy discographies on major artists,
an industry address book, fan-club listings, album recommendations
and a calendar of notable events in country history.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest joy, of course, was having an excuse to talk to
all-time greats such as the late, much loved bluegrass pioneer Bill
Monroe, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I interviewed Waylon (Jennings) and Johnny Cash together,''
McCloud said. ``That had to be the biggest hoot other than
interviewing Hoyt Axton. He was just hysterical. He said, `I've had
a 13-month career that's lasted 30 years.' ''

   KORCE, Albania More than 11,000 bewildered Kosovo refugees are
reeling from their second or even third forced deportation in as
many weeks, after police in neighboring Macedonia tricked them onto
buses and abruptly dumped them off here across the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were deceived,'' said Stephen Galegor, (cq) 30, an
evangelical missionary from Fort Collins, Colo., who organized the
initial relief aid when at least 80 busloads of refugees suddenly
showed up at dawn on Wednesday in this mountain town.
</P>
<P>
   He said refugees were told that if they boarded buses in
Macedonia, they could choose their destination, including Britain
or Canada. Instead, they were taken here.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest installment of a sad odyssey for these
resigned, ragged people who tell of beatings, robbery and other
abuses en route from their homes in Serb-controlled Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   By now they speak dispassionately, until some nerve is sprung
and the tears quietly roll.
</P>
<P>
   Hava Kelani is a striking 22-year-old who reluctantly told how
members of a Serb militia stripped her naked.
</P>
<P>
   The women and elders of her family say they left their village
when Serb forces began threatening. They stayed with her uncle in
Pristina six miles away until the Serb police arrived there, too,
and ordered everyone to leave, she said.
</P>
<P>
   As Kelani walked out of the house, she said, five police singled
her out and told her to come back inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put a knife to my throat. They undressed me completely,''
she said. Kelani, who is unmarried, said the men did not rape her,
but took all her valuables, including identity papers and 500
German marks, and slashed most of her clothing with their knives.
Then they told her to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no thoughts of getting out alive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Only her underwear and a pair of leggings were intact, but she
struggled into them and the rest of her shredded clothes while
fleeing the house, she recounted. Kelani caught up with her family,
and they headed for the trains that deposited them in a Macedonian
limbo between borders where they were held for nearly a week.
</P>
<P>
   Kelani had no tears until talking later about her brother who
has gone missing.
</P>
<P>
   Raif Syla, a creased 80-year-old settled on blankets on a
gymnasium floor here close to his wife and relatives and another
700 or so refugees, also described a painful flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I had was burned, even the cows,'' said Syla.
</P>
<P>
   He said Serb police or paramilitary forces kicked his family out
of their Kosovo village five days before NATO started bombing
Serbia on March 24 . As they began the 10-mile walk to the Kosovo
capital of Pristina, Syla said he watched the Serbs douse his house
with petrol and set it afire. His cattle were killed, his car and
tractor destroyed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After about ten days in Pristina, Serb forces made their way to
the neighborhood where Syla's family had taken refuge. They were
given two hours to clear out, he said, so they went to the trains
as directed, and on to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere on the journey he lost track of two sons and their
families.
</P>
<P>
   He mentions them first, then bemoans the fact that in all this
time there has been no chance to wash his aging body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, I don't believe too much that I will come back to
my village,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Syla and his fellow Kosovar Albanians are stuck here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they were brought here was absolutely inhumane,'' said
the American missionary Galegor, who has worked here in
southeastern Albania for more than three years.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday and Thursday Macedonian authorities shipped out an
estimated 55,000 refugees, whom they had kept penned up between the
Macedonian and Kosovo borders for as long as a week. Macedonia,
with a majority of restive Serbs, feared upending its own delicate
balance of ethnic peoples and refused entry to the ethnic Albanian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Under increasing international pressure to release the embattled
Kosovar Albanians from the border no-man's land, Macedonia acted.
Around 30,000 were taken to tent camps NATO built further inside
Macedonia, while others were dispersed as far as Turkey. Up to
10,000 still are not accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Galegor said some refugees sent here were told they could choose
their destination including Canada or Britain but then were shoved
onto buses and driven all night until they reached Korce, where
they were disgorged into the soccer stadium and gymnasium. Some
families were split up and sent to different destinations when
Macedonian police loaded them into buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police told us they were sending us to some other country,
like Germany. They said, 'You will go abroad,''' said Melihate
Rrmoku, 47, who sat Friday eating uncooked hot dogs with her
teenaged son and daughter on the section of hard gymnasium
bleachers they have staked out as home. There they sleep and eat
and simply sit all day along with hundreds of others.
</P>
<P>
   They may not be abroad, but they are out of the rain. More than
1,000 refugees live in the gym, while others of the Korce
contingent have been taken by buses to stay in surrounding villages
or have been taken in by local families.

L.A. INDIE FESTIVAL MAKES ROOM FOR CUTTING EDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While the spring edition of Internet World
besieges the Los Angeles Convention Center this coming week with a
dizzying array of Net-minded sessions and exhibitions, another
interesting tech-minded gathering _ the Los Angeles Independent
Film Festival _ is also getting under way.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-year-old festival runs for a week beginning with an
independent music festival Wednesday night at the Troubadour in
West Hollywood, followed by 70 films, documentaries, shorts and
music videos.
</P>
<P>
   Of most interest to the technology-minded, however, are a
new-media center at the festival headquarters and two panel
discussions on April 17 regarding the implications of digital
filmmaking and distribution, trends that are just beginning to
reshape the movie biz (see Sunday's L.A. Life for a fuller
exploration of the issue).
</P>
<P>
   But why, one asks, does a festival focused on independent films
include all this other stuff, from new media to offbeat bands?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's such a blend these days,'' said festival
founder and director Robert Faust.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's only going to get better'' because of the digital
revolution, Faust said. ``I think more people are going to be
running around making films.''
</P>
<P>
   At the 1:30 session, one of last year's stars of the digital
video circuit, ``The Cruise'' director Bennett Miller, is part of a
panel talking about making digital feature films.
</P>
<P>
   The panel will be moderated by Jonathan Wells, the editor of Res
magazine, which focuses on digital filmmaking and sponsors its own
digital-only traveling film festival.
</P>
<P>
   The second panel, beginning at 4 p.m., will look at how digital
alternatives will ease the huge distribution and marketing
challenges facing independent filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second panel is about the Internet being a way to break
down the barriers to viewing these things,'' Faust said.
</P>
<P>
   The panels will be held at the Laugh Factory, across the street
from the festival's headquarters at the Directors Guild of America,
7920 Sunset Blvd.
</P>
<P>
   The new media center will be set up at the DGA for most of the
festival's run, showing off some of the latest digital products.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsor DVD EXPRESS has erected a Web site at
 &UR; !bold! &LR; www.dvdexpress.com &UR; !off! &LR;  devoted to the festival, with
short clips of participating movies. Fans will be able to vote for
their favorites at the site, as well. Click on an icon labeled
``backstage pass'' to get to the viewing site.
</P>
<P>
   The Thursday night opening film is Phil Joanou's latest,
``Entropy,'' while the closing night film is ``The Big Brass
Ring,'' directed by George Hickenlooper and based on a never-shot
Orson Welles script.
</P>
<P>
   All the films will be shown either at the DGA headquarters or
two nearby theater complexes on Sunset Boulevard. Tickets can be
purchased over the phone for all events at (888) 386-8497. &QL;

DOLE SOFTENS HER POSITION ON ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After weeks of contemplating and refining her position on
abortion, Elizabeth Dole Friday said Republicans must recognize
``that good and honorable people disagree'' about the issue and
that the battle to repeal the constitutional right to abortion is
all but a lost cause.
</P>
<P>
   Dole's comments continue a trend by some leading Republican
candidates for president to downplay the role of the abortion issue
_ long one of the most powerful and divisive in American politics _
in the national 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Arizona Senator John McCain and now
Dole have all pledged to stick by their anti-abortion principles
while recognizing that an inflexible stance is unlikely to help to
win back the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential field has essentially split into two
camps now, with one side calling for tolerance toward people who
support the right to an abortion and the other side calling the
abolition of abortion a moral imperative.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to a supporter in Phoenix, Dole described herself as
``pro-life, with exceptions in cases of rape or incest, or to save
the life of the mother.'' The one-page thank-you note to Sandy
Cowen-Miller, released by the Dole campaign Friday, is the most
extensive discussion of Dole's views on abortion since she formed
her presidential exploratory committee one month ago.
</P>
<P>
   In it, she said she would support the idea of a constitutional
amendment to ban abortions -- if it were possible. ``But of course,
it's not,'' Dole wrote. ``It's not going to happen because the
American people do not support it.''
</P>
<P>
   Continued discussion and questions about an amendment is
``irrelevant and highly divisive.'' Dole said Republican women can
set the example, refusing ``to be drawn into dead-end debates.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole said that, instead, she can concentrate on stopping
so-called partial-birth abortions, enacting parental notification
requirements, continuing the ban on government funding of abortion
and doing everything possible to place unwanted babies with
adoptive parents.
</P>
<P>
   Dole received criticism from both the sides of the abortion
debate Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That position means she is willing to accept the status quo
and cannot be counted on to do anything,'' new, said Phyllis
Schlafly, president of the Eagle Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Michelman, the president of the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League, said Dole, like Bush and McCain,
is trying to have it both ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has declared herself in opposition to a woman's right to
choose,'' said Michelman, whose group has aired television
commercials in Iowa, New Hampshire and California reminding voters
that Dole and Bush oppose abortion. ``At the same time, she is
trying to reassure the majority of Americans. . .that she won't
pursue an anti-choice amendment if she were in the White House.
That won't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Dole, said the former Red Cross
director issued the letter because she wanted to address the
subject of abortion in a thoughtful manner, rather than in a
television soundbite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heart of this is that Elizabeth Dole intends to run a
campaign that's an inclusive campaign that brings people
together,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   As Dole, Bush and McCain have tried to soft-pedal their
opposition to abortion, four other GOP hopefuls _ publisher Steve
Forbes, former TV commentator Patrick Buchanan, Gary Bauer, and New
Hampshire Senator Bob Smith _ have put opposition to abortion at
the center of their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   That split was evident Friday as a spokesman for Steve Forbes,
who has embraced the anti-abortion community, blasted Dole and
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds to me like she and Governor Bush are kind of taking
the same position and it basically is to suggest `We're pro-life
but there's not much we can do about this issue so let's put it by
the wayside,' '' said Greg Mueller. ``I don't think that sells to
the pro-life community. They want a candidate who has a clear
agenda to get us to the human life amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   James M. Farrell, a communication professor at the University of
New Hampshire, said it's not difficult to see what Dole, Bush and
McCain are doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to find the position that offends the fewest
number of people,'' Farrell said.
</P>
<P>
   And that may play well in the Granite State, which holds the
first presidential primary in the nation and plays a decisive role
in selecting the nominees. New Hampshire has traditionally taken a
libertarian stance when it comes to abortion, preferring to leave
the subject alone. The Legislature tilts to the abortion rights
side of the debate, and the governor, Democrat Jeanne Shaheen,
favors the right to an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that an anti-abortion stance by the
Republican nominee in 1992 and 1996 hurt the candidate more than it
helped among general election voters. The result in 2000 may be a
more pragmatic acknowledgement that the topic is unhealthy for the
politically ambitious.

 &HT;    CONGRESS RETURNS TO BIGGER CONFLICT, CALLS FOR GROUND TROOPS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (I) international categories
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bipartisan congressional delegation returned from
Europe Friday and issued a strongly worded letter urging President
Clinton to plan for the possible use of ground troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and eight other lawmakers informed
the president that in their view, the air war alone will never
achieve his goal of pushing Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's
forces out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even assuming the success of the air campaign to significantly
degrade Milosevic's military,'' the letter said, there is ``less
certainty'' that bombing will clear the way for the return of
refugees under international protection.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers, who had accompanied Defense Secretary William
Cohen to Europe, told Clinton that ``we believe it prudent for the
U.S. to urge NATO to plan for additional military missions,
including the use of ground forces, in the event that proves
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The push for ground troops came as Congress is returning from a
two-week spring break during which the crisis has exploded in the
Balkans and the world has watched nearly 1 million refugees forced
out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders from both parties plan to meet late Monday with Clinton
to discuss the conflict, which until now the lawmakers have left in
the hands of the administration. However, lawmakers are expressing
growing nervousness over how the president is commanding the
military operation.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from certain what the lawmakers will do beyond
offering recommendations. Congress took no action to limit the
scope of the military operation before the air strikes began and
has so far followed the recent pattern of ceding responsibility to
the president when it comes to deploying the armed forces. Although
the power to declare war is given to Congress by the Constitution,
the power to make war has been increasingly taken by presidents.
</P>
<P>
   The last time that Congress voted to authorize a military strike
was shortly before the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., doubtful of the
Balkan operation from the outset, has been conspicuously quiet
since the bombing campaign began.
</P>
<P>
   That would change if the president opens up the option of ground
troops, said Lott spokesman John Czwartacki (cq). ``If our strategy
and tactics change dramatically, I would expect Congress would
demand to be heard with a full debate and a vote,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the ground troops option on the table remains highly
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people talking about ground troops like a secret
formula that can make the situation end in a hurry,'' Sen. Paul
Coverdell, R-Ga., said this week. He called such a plan dangerous
because ``the population that would be confronted would be very
hostile.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's premature to talk about ground troops,'' Sen. Kay
Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   She led a failed attempt to cut off funding for the military
action, at the time insisting Clinton outline his goals and exit
strategy beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've met with many Texans who share my concerns about the
long-term effectiveness of our policy in Yugoslavia,'' Hutchison
said. ``I raised these concerns before this began, that we needed a
plan in case the bombing didn't bring Melosevic back to the table.
Sadly, the overwhelming number of refugees out of Kosovo is vivid
proof that we had no plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about the operation also are coming from Democrats.
Sen. Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, one of Clinton's
staunchest supporters, this week blasted the handling of Kosovo.
``From the outset, this operation never had more vision than the
next day,'' he told the New York Times.

<P>
   CHICAGO _ A line of surging storms and devastating tornadoes
swept across the Midwest Thursday and Friday, killing six people,
injuring dozens others and leaving a swath of damage hundreds of
miles long.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the destruction occurred in southwestern Ohio where
officials said at least two tornadoes touched down in the
Cincinnati area shortly after 5 a.m. Friday. More than 400 homes
were damaged in the area and 20,000 households were without power
Friday afternoon. While most customers had service by evening,
officials said they did not expect to have power fully restored
until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trees have been thrown all over the place, and power lines
were snapped,'' said Jim Williams, the executive director of the
Ohio Emergency Management Agency. ``It's going to be quite a while
before things get sorted out. In terms of urban damage, it's
probably the worst storm we've seen since in 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Nation Weather Service officials assessed the wreckage to be the
result of Class 3 or Class 4 tornadoes, meaning that at times the
winds exceeded 207 miles per hour. A class five tornado is the most
severe. Smaller twisters stretching back to Iowa uprooted trees,
tossed automobiles and flattened homes throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, parts of Interstate 71 were closed temporarily when a
semi-tractor trailer was lifted off the ground and deposited on its
side, blocking all lanes of traffic, and shopping centers
throughout the area showed walls blown in and roofs torn off,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were at a house this morning where workers were picking up
a highway sign from a quarter mile away off of the front lawn,''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   He said four deaths occurred in Ohio, two when cars were picked
up and thrown by the swirling winds and the other two to a house.
Two women in Illinois were also killed when winds destroyed their
mobile homes.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Robert Taft of Ohio, who toured the area Friday, declared
three counties to be in a state of emergency, and the Red Cross
opened shelters in three local schools to house stranded victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nasty storm and it happened at the wrong time of the
day,'' said Greg Tipton, a meteorologist for the National Weather
Service in Wilmington, Ohio. He said it is rare to see severe
weather early in the morning at a time when many people were
sleeping.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The line of storms, pushed by a cold front that developed over
the Plains states, brewed up at least nine tornadoes in Iowa on
Thursday afternoon, destroying homes, and killing livestock in the
southern and central part of the state, said Ellen Gordon,
executive director of the Iowa Emergency Management Division. Mrs.
Gordon estimated the statewide damage to be $8 million, but said
nobody was killed or seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Gaining strength as it moved east, the storm brought heavy winds
and rain to Illinois late Thursday, causing more tornadoes and
spreading severe damage. A 68-year-old women was found dead in the
remains of her mobile home in Ashland, 20 miles northwest of
Springfield and a 43-year-old women was killed in Cisco, 50 miles
east of Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sucked out the door and watched two trailers right in
front of me go up in the air, Louann Judd, whose trailer in
Illinois was one of those damaged in the storm, told The Associated
Press. She said her family of six ended up in a pile on top of her
2-year-old grandson.

 &HT;    CONGRESS RETURNS TO BIGGER CONFLICT, CALLS FOR GROUND TROOPS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (I) international categories
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bipartisan congressional delegation returned from
Europe Friday and issued a strongly worded letter urging President
Clinton to plan for the possible use of ground troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and eight other lawmakers informed
the president that in their view, the air war alone will never
achieve his goal of pushing Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's
forces out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even assuming the success of the air campaign to significantly
degrade Milosevic's military,'' the letter said, there is ``less
certainty'' that bombing will clear the way for the return of
refugees under international protection.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers, who had accompanied Defense Secretary William
Cohen to Europe, told Clinton that ``we believe it prudent for the
U.S. to urge NATO to plan for additional military missions,
including the use of ground forces, in the event that proves
necessary.''
</P>

BUSINESS DIARY: DOING A DOUBLE TAKE OVER AN ANNUAL REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 11)  
 (bl)  
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One thing about Tenneco Inc.: It may not officially confirm
rumors, but it doesn't let them die down either. Nine months ago,
Tenneco first floated the idea of splitting into two companies, one
making automotive products and one making packaging. Since then,
Wall Street has waited in vain for a definitive announcement.
</P>
<P>
   But any thought that the idea has been quietly dropped will be
erased by a look at the 1998 annual report _ or, rather, two looks.
</P>
<P>
   The report, mailed last week, has been issued in two versions:
One has a stylized Hefty One-Zip bag on the cover, the other a
Monroe Sensa-Trac shock absorber. (Both versions feature a mock bar
code with the words ``strong brands'' where the UPC number usually
appears, as if the annual report were itself a product for sale.)
</P>
<P>
   Neal Geary, a Tenneco spokesman, says the company's 70,000
shareholders will receive one or the other at random. But the two
business units will each get about 5,000 copies of the one that
focuses on its product, to distribute to customers, suppliers and
analysts. ``We are very purposefully indicating the potential of
the two companies to compete separately in the future,'' Geary
said.

NO SIGNS THE PIANO MAN IS MOVING OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _Billy Joel admitted early in his sold-out show at
the Anaheim Pond Thursday night that it hasn't always been easy to
be a fan of his in Los Angeles. And, indeed, the gifted piano man,
who recently was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,
never has received much respect in the Southland, where
flavor-of-the-month artists often are embraced at the expense of
genuine, enduring talent.
</P>
<P>
   Joel had no problem winning over his fans at the Pond, though,
playing a generous 20-song set that touched all the bases of his
illustrious career. (The baseball reference is apt; Joel and his
seven-member band took the stage to the strains of Randy Newman's
theme from ``The Natural.'') Joel didn't offer any new songs; he
hasn't recorded a new album in six years. But he did play a few
interesting instrumental passages on the piano that certainly could
foreshadow the classical composing work he intends to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unofficially, this is the old (stuff tour), Joel said at one
point. Later, he told the audience that while this is his last
tour, he didn't say it was his last show. ``So, it's not a farewell
thing. I saw the Who do that 15 times and it got kinda old.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel, one month shy of his 50th birthday, is getting kinda old,
too, although age certainly wasn't an issue during the two-hour,
15-minute show. The singer-songwriter frequently left his piano
bench to run around the stage, twirl the microphone stand and play
guitar.
</P>
<P>
   To fire up the crowd for his Gilbert and Sullivan-like history
lesson, ``We Didn't Start the Fire,'' he and his band ran through a
ragged, eight-song rock 'n roll sampler that started with Frank
Sinatra (``The Lady Is a Tramp''), ended with the Police (``Every
Breath You Take'') and included Jimi Hendrix, Led Zepplin and a
good-natured stab at the Eagles' ``Hotel California.'' By the time
he got around to his own No. 1 song it was almost anti-climactic.
</P>
<P>
   That certainly could not be said for the rest of the concert,
which concluded with rip-roaring renditions of ``It's Still Rock
and Roll to Me,'' ``You May be Right,'' ``The Majestic Scenes From
an Italian Restaurant,'' a two-song encore of ``Only the Good Die
Young'' and, of course, ``Piano Man.''
</P>
<P>
   When Joel let the audience sing the final chorus of that last
song, it was the perfect cap to an enjoyable evening of songs every
one there knew by heart. &QL;

   Colombia: Peace Talks To Resume
</P>

   The government and the largest left-wing guerrilla group have
agreed to resume talks on April 20 aimed at ending a conflict that
has ravaged Colombia for more than three decades. Despite being
given control of a safe haven the size of Switzerland, the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia suspended the talks in
January, calling on the government to bring right-wing paramilitary
groups under control.

according to the Western Regional Climate Center, a research

better, as temperatures through the weekend will linger in the 60s

trio of ads (Dodge, Bud Lite and Pacific Bell) on the outfield
fence, along with one on the home-team dugout (New Era) and one in
the visitor's bullpen (MasterCard). ``On a scale of 1 to 10

L.A. INDIE FILM FESTIVAL MAKES ROOM FOR OTHER MEDIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Minor editing throughout) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While the spring edition of Internet World
besieges the Los Angeles Convention Center this coming week with a
dizzying array of Net-minded sessions and exhibitions, another
interesting tech-minded gathering _ the Los Angeles Independent
Film Festival _ is also getting under way.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-year-old festival runs for a week beginning with an
independent music festival Wednesday night at the Troubadour in
West Hollywood, followed by 70 films, documentaries, shorts and
music videos.
</P>
<P>
   Of most interest to the technology-minded, however, are a
new-media center at the festival headquarters and two panel
discussions on April 17 regarding the implications of digital
filmmaking and distribution, trends that are just beginning to
reshape the movie biz.
</P>
<P>
   But why, one asks, does a festival focused on independent films
include all this other stuff, from new media to offbeat bands?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's such a blend these days,'' said festival
founder and director Robert Faust.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's only going to get better'' because of the digital
revolution, Faust said. ``I think more people are going to be
running around making films.''
</P>
<P>
   At the 1:30 session, one of last year's stars of the digital
video circuit, ``The Cruise'' director Bennett Miller, is part of a
panel talking about making digital feature films.
</P>
<P>
   The panel will be moderated by Jonathan Wells, the editor of Res
magazine, which focuses on digital filmmaking and sponsors its own
digital-only traveling film festival.
</P>
<P>
   The second panel, beginning at 4 p.m., will look at how digital
alternatives will ease the huge distribution and marketing
challenges facing independent filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second panel is about the Internet being a way to break
down the barriers to viewing these things,'' Faust said.
</P>
<P>
   The panels will be held at the Laugh Factory, across the street
from the festival's headquarters at the Directors Guild of America,
7920 Sunset Blvd.
</P>
<P>
   The new media center will be set up at the DGA for most of the
festival's run, showing off some of the latest digital products.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsor DVD EXPRESS has erected a Web site at
 &UR; !bold! &LR; www.dvdexpress.com &UR; !off! &LR;  devoted to the festival, with
short clips of participating movies. Fans will be able to vote for
their favorites at the site, as well. Click on an icon labeled
``backstage pass'' to get to the viewing site.
</P>
<P>
   The Thursday night opening film is Phil Joanou's latest,
``Entropy,'' while the closing night film is ``The Big Brass
Ring,'' directed by George Hickenlooper and based on a never-shot
Orson Welles script.
</P>
<P>
   All the films will be shown either at the DGA headquarters or
two nearby theater complexes on Sunset Boulevard. Tickets can be
purchased over the phone for all events at (888) 386-8497. &QL;

`CINDERELLA' REBORN AS WARTIME VALENTINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The ominous drone of a Messerschmitt airplane
sweeps overhead. An air raid siren wails in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little alarming to step into the eerily realistic aural
environment Matthew Bourne has cooked up at the Ahmanson Theatre
for his daring new production of ``Cinderella.'' Not that we've
come to expect pixie dust and sugar plum fairies from the leader of
Britain's racy Adventures in Motion Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   As his dance company's name implies, Bourne is a child of
American pop culture, who grew up watching Fred Astaire and John
Wayne movies, not ``Giselle.'' His hip, fluidly cinematic
sensibility was the driving force behind AMP's virtuosic,
gender-switching ``Swan Lake,'' which had its North American
premiere at the Ahmanson two years ago and introduced L.A.
audiences to the erotic magnetism of dancer Adam Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bourne, Cooper and AMP have returned with a reworking of
``Cinderella'' that's even more like a Broadway blockbuster than a
traditional ballet. Viewed not as pure dance but as musical
pantomime, or as a kind of colorized, live-action silent film,
``Cinderella'' sparkles with the same clever pop-art visuals, wry
cultural observations and propulsive narrative drive that made
``Swan Lake'' such an unstuffy, high-concept pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   What keeps ``Cinderella'' from attaining the level of a classic,
apart from its tangled psychological-metaphysical conceits, is the
dancing itself. Or rather, the absence of footwork sublime enough
to match Bourne's truly inspired storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   Using Prokofiev's astringent 1940s score, nimbly performed by a
28-piece orchestra under conductor Daryl Griffith, Bourne has
transported the fable of the glass-slippered heroine to London
during the Blitz, when Nazi bombers rained terror on the city's
resilient populace for 10 ghastly months.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Ballet dancer Sarah Wildor plays Cinderella as a frumpy
homebody, who belongs to a monochromatic brood that would make the
Addams Family look like the Cleavers. While father dozes in a
wheelchair, Cinderella's drunken and possibly murderous stepmother
(an amusingly over-the-top Isabel Mortimer) presides not only over
jealous stepsisters but an incestuous stepbrother or two.
</P>
<P>
   When a battered, disoriented Royal Air Force pilot (Cooper)
stumbles in on a family gathering, Cinderella cleaves to him as a
Hollywood hero incarnate, ready to fulfill her MGM fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a guardian angel (Will Kemp) who looks like a
peroxided Noel Coward and moves with the cool angularity of an
animated hieroglyphic, Cinderella and the Pilot (or perhaps her
idealized version of him) slip off on a nightborne adventure. En
route they pass through shell-shocked streets, to a bombed-out
ballroom where macabre dancers are magically restored to life, to
an Underground stop, a hospital mental ward and, finally, a train
station platform where all will end a bit too sweetly and
unambiguously, given the dark tone of Prokofiev's music, Bourne's
scathingly comic vision of domestic life, and Lez Brotherston's
sets, which have a skewed, expressionist look that briefly suggests
the entire ballet could be occurring inside a mad girl's head.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, the two leads are top-notch. Wildor has a magical
moment dancing with a tailor's dummy, and Cooper, reversing his
``Swan Lake'' persona of sexual predator, evokes true pathos as the
crippled pilot.
</P>
<P>
   But while there's no doubting the erotic affinity between these
real-life lovers, Bourne hasn't come up with a choreographic syntax
that fully conveys their rapport, particularly in the bedroom duet.
The limits of his modernist lexicon are more obvious here than they
were in ``Swan Lake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cinderella'' is a valentine not only to the power of love
under duress but to the transformative power of movies, and it
buzzes with both sly and overt references to transcendent wartime
fare like ``A Matter of Life and Death,'' ``Waterloo Bridge,''
``Brief Encounter'' and ``On the Town.'' When the jewelled and
gowned Wildor makes her nightclub entrance, it's as if Lillian Gish
in ``Way Down East'' had been reborn as Ginger Rogers in ``Top
Hat.''
</P>
<P>
   That's almost as startling a makeover as the one Bourne has
wrought with this high-flying, if not quite heavenly,
``Cinderella.''

MEXICAN COMPOSERS, ORCHESTRA IN THE SPOTLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(``Tonight'' refers to Saturday, April 10) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What a difference a year or two has made for
Silvestre Revueltas. While the work of the Mexican composer
(1899-1940) has been known in Los Angeles for decades, recent
months have ushered in a kind of Revueltas renaissance that will
continue here tonight with a concert of all-Mexican modern
classical music at UCLA's Royce Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The program, performed by Mexico's national symphony, Orquesta
Sinfonica Nacional de Mexico, under the direction of Enrique Arturo
Diemecke, will include Revueltas' ``La Coronela'' and the world
premiere of ``Danza Silvestre'' by Arturo Marquez. Revueltas'
daughter, Eugenia, who lectures extensively on her father's work,
is accompanying the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Philharmonic just released a new recording of
several key Revueltas works, coinciding with this year's centennial
of his birth. The Sony Classical disc features his thunderous film
score for ``La Noche de los Mayas'' and ``Ocho por Radio'' (``8 x
radio''), a sardonically humorous short piece that one critic has
likened to ``a cubist Mariachi band.'' Tonight's other selections
will be Blas Galindo's ``Sones de Mariachi'' and Sinfonica No. 2,
``India,'' by Carlos Chavez, a kind of Mexican Aaron Copland to
Revueltas' Charles Ives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revueltas, Chavez and Galindo ... are in the nationalistic
movement of Mexico, which began in the late '20s and went all the
way to the '50s, trying to compose with the idea of getting the
sounds and the melodies and the rhythms from the period influences
that Mexican culture has had throughout its history,'' conductor
Diemecke explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in Sinfonica `India' by Chavez, these are somewhat the
reflections of pre-Hispanic music, not in its totality but in some
of its ideas _ and the idea of bringing out the rhythm and some of
the colors, especially in the percussion instruments.'' &UR;

UNTANGLING ECONOMIC COMPLEXITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 11, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What to make of the current vogue of ``complexity studies'' in
finance and economics?
</P>
<P>
   There's no missing the boomlet. It is rendered visible by a
picketline of popular books. In ``The New Pioneers,'' for example,
Wall Street Journal columnist Thomas Petzinger argues that a new
age of complexity has dawned in business. Suzanne Kelly of Citibank
and consultant Mary Ann Allison promise a ``Complexity Advantage''
if you follow the lessons of the new science of complexity in their
book And shareholder-rights activist Robert A.G. Monks concludes
his highly personal ``The Emperor's Nightingale'' with a
``complexity bibliography,'' a glossary and a Who's Who of the
complexity movement.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent they aren't drawn from two earlier popularizations
of science _ ``Chaos'' by James Gleick in 1988, and ``Complexity''
by M. Mitchell Waldrop in 1992 _ these books rest on a deeper
foundation of scholarly work, much of it coming from New Mexico's
Santa Fe Insitute, although at least two other centers of
complexity thought _ Stuttgart and Brussels _ have been identified.
</P>
<P>
   Overviews of the relevance of the new work to economics include
an article in the current issue of Science magazine by Brian Arthur
of the Santa Fe Institute, and the entry by William Brock of the
University of Wisconsin on ``complexity and chaos'' in the New
Palgrave Dictionary of Money and Finance. A conference volume from
a meeting on complexity last year at Middlebury College is in
preparation, edited by Brock and Middlebury professor David
Colander.
</P>
<P>
   What are the objectives of the new work? In his Palgrave's
article, Brock lists four. There's the hope that technical or
chartist analysis, the search for patterns in price movements that
long has been the province of market practitioners, may yet turn
out to have a deep intellectual basis.
</P>
<P>
   There's an attack on the statistical tests which have been used
by proponents of the efficient markets hypothesis to argue that
there are no hidden patterns in markets, so don't even bother to
look.
</P>
<P>
   There's the possibility that abrupt and seemingly inexplicable
movements in stock prices may be explained in new and unexpected
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, says Brock, there is the hope that work on complexity
and chaos may serve eventually as an underpinning for a rebirth of
Keynesian economics ``and a strengthening of arguments for an
activist, interventionist stabilization policy.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's where Peter Albin comes in.
</P>
<P>
   Albin, professor of economics emeritus at the City University of
New York, was a complexity pioneer. ``The Analysis of Complex
Socioeconomic Systems'' was published in 1975; ``Progress Without
Poverty: Socially Responsible Economic Growth'' appeared in 1978.
Albin's powers and reputation crested just as the wider interest in
complexity awakened. Then a cruel stroke delayed his progress.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's back with a collection of his path-breaking papers,
``Barriers and Bounds to Rationality: Essays on Economic Complexity
and Dynamics in interactive Systems.'' Duncan S. Foley of the New
School for Social Research, who edited the volume, contributes a
lengthy technical introduction.
</P>
<P>
   In his preface, Albin writes, ``In the social sciences,
generally, and in the literature of economics, particularily,
`structure` and `complexity` are poorly defined concepts which are
invested with weight, depth and magical significance and presumed
to be well understood by the reader.''
</P>
<P>
   They are not, he says: complexity can be used any number of
ways: to signify a high degree of specialization and/or strategic
interaction (the linotype is a complex machine;) of unfathomability
or uncontrolability (or controlability through intricate maneuver
(the world is a complex place;) of obstruction by detail or
organization (the problem is complex _ but soluble.)
</P>
<P>
   So it is that complexity can have precise meaning, Albin says.
In fact it already does, within the cognitive and informational
sciences. Languages, computer architectures, problems in
computation _ the complexity of each can be described, using a
variety of measuring devices: directed graphs, cellular automata
theory, mathematical tools of various sorts. The application of
these techniques to the problems of economics is the task of the
next generation.
</P>
<P>
   He continues, ``I have taken it as an obligation to do more than
just identifiy a gap in our knowledge. The essays reprintered here
provide tools with which an economist can take apart an
informational system'' -- whether a firm, an industry or an entire
economy.
</P>
<P>
   There may be nothing in the book that wasn't glimpsed _ and put
more directly _ when Albin wrote ``Progress Without Poverty'' in
1978. Then, he spelled out numerous practical applications of his
research program.
</P>
<P>
   Take industrialization, for example: why was it that
``urbanization'' could lead equally to upscale Zurich or New York's
Bedford Stuyvesant slum? Why was it ``factory organization'' could
translate equally as a worker's cooperative or the hierarchy of
General Motors' infamous Lordstown plant?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern then will be with the perverse patterns and
sydromes in the growth process that can swamp the primary positive
effects of industrialization and expanding output.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to quarrel with a program whose ultimate goal is to
alert us to the human traps and ecological disasters that may
accompany the pursuit of growth. A more wide-ranging and up-to-date
survey of how the new work on complexity may fit into economics as
it is understood in the present day can be found in ``New Keynesian
Economics/Post Keynesian Perspectives,'' a conference volume edited
by Roy Rotheim of Skidmore College. The original title of the
meeting ``On Butterflies' Wings and Haurricaines,'' reflects its
roots in the new mathematics of chaos an complexity.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of difficulties here. One is that the gurus
of complexity _ Albin, Arthur, Brock, Colander and Foley _ are
mostly men in their 50s. New breakthroughs that powerfully affect
science traditionally come from the young.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, those with long memories will remember the previous
promises in the 1970s of catastrophe theory to yield great new
insights into economic dynamics _ and the subsequent disappointment
when it didn't.
</P>
<P>
   There undoubtedly will be new ways of untangling economic
complexity. The ecologists, who were perhaps the first to take the
analytic category seriously, seem to have made a good start. In
economics, however, you get the feeling that this particular school
still has a long way to go.

   A year after the Austrian government agreed to return about $40
million worth of art and objects that the Nazis confiscated from
the Austrian branch of the Rothschild family, members of the
256-year-old banking dynasty have decided to sell the collection.

   For sale at Christie's in London on July 8 will be an

Vienna museums are likely to leave Austria altogether. The
government returned the works to the Rothschilds last year after
more than a half-century of refusing to consider restitution. In
doing so, Elisabeth Gehrer, the Austrian minister of culture, said
she wanted to correct what she called immoral decisions at the end
of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The contentious issue of who should own art seized by the Nazis
was raised early last year by the disputed ownership of two Egon
Schiele paintings lent by an Austrian foundation for a show at the
Museum of Modern Art in New York. The works are still in New York
awaiting resolution of the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It breaks my heart to see these things being sold; they are
the last of my childhood,'' said Baroness Bettina der Rothschild,
who along with her two children, a niece and a nephew, have decided
to part with their family heirlooms. ``But it just doesn't make
sense to keep them. We all live very differently today than my
parents did. Not only are the security questions terrifying and the
insurance costs prohibitive, but this type of 18th-century French
furniture needs a butler and two housemaids constantly polishing
it. That's just not the way we live.''
</P>
<P>
   The 75-year-old baroness, who lives in a country house southwest
of Vienna, fled into exile as a young girl days before the Germans
marched into Austria. She later married an American diplomat,
Matthew Loorman.
</P>
<P>
   The art was seized from the family palaces in 1938, and when
they tried to get it back in the late 1940s, government officials
forced them to leave it in Austria. Two months ago, however, the
Austrian government lifted a 54-year-old ban on the collection's
export and sale abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Both the baroness' grandfather, Albert von Rothschild, and her
great-uncle, Nathaniel von Rothschild, were great connoisseurs and
passionate collectors who spent their lives filling their
19th-century Viennese palaces with the finest paintings, French
furniture, silver, porcelains and other objects. They also
collected scientific instruments even though neither was a
scientist or a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, anything scientific was in,'' the baroness
recalled in a telephone interview. ``It was Nathaniel who
especially loved buying scientific instruments. Who could ever
think that microscopes were beautiful, but these were.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men's houses were so jammed with art and objects, the
baroness said, that when her father and uncle inherited them,
neither man continued to collect. ``Don't forget, the Austrians
lost the First World War and then there was a terrific depression
and the banks crashed,'' she said. ``We really had quite enough to
live with.''
</P>
<P>
   While her family is to sell nearly all of its art and objects
(she said she was keeping only a few minor knickknacks), it has
decided to give Austria a painting by Rigaud, a portrait of an
Austrian marshal who had received the Order of the Golden Fleece.
``The museums here don't have many French works,'' the baroness
said. ``Our family owes the Austrian government gratitude for the
gutsy act of giving these things back to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The return of the Rothschild collection stripped Vienna's
leading museums of many of the artworks they have had on display
since World War II. The Austrian Gallery, more popularly known as
the Belvedere, had 12 Rothschild artworks, mostly Baroque and
19th-century Austrian paintings. The Kunsthistorische had many of
the best paintings, including three extraordinary works by Hals,
one by Teniers and another by Wynants.
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Gluck, a spokeswoman for the culture minister said Ms.
Gehrer had just heard the news of the sale and declined to comment,
other than to say that the government ``has done what we thought
was necessary,'' adding, ``Our responsibility is over, and now it
is up to the family to decide what happens next.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether either Christie's or the Rothschilds had
considered offering museums the chance to pre-empt any works in the
sale, a practice that is common in European auctions but not in the
United States, Lord Hindlip, chairman of Christie's, said they had
considered it but decided not to.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a different position than the English or the French
Rothschilds,'' the baroness said. ``We do not have any significant
amounts of money and have not been able to keep our family
houses.''
</P>
<P>
   For Christie's the sale will be a landmark event, perhaps the
largest single-owner sale in its 233-year history. ``It's the most
exciting collection I've seen in my 36 years at Christie's,''
Hindlip said, ``because it's the most varied and the most
captivatingly unusual.''

   He said he had known the baroness and her husband for many years
and had been approached by the family about the possibility of
selling the collection just before Christmas. ``I went to see her
in Vienna on Jan. 3,'' Hindlip said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Rothschilds had decided to sell, Christie's recommended
that the sale take place in London rather than in New York because
some of the works, like four outstanding Persian carpets and
objects laden with ivory, cannot be brought into the United States.
``We also felt the Rothschild name meant more in Europe,'' Hindlip
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights of the sale will be one of Hals' most
famous portraits, that of the Amsterdam merchant Tielmann
Roostermann, which is expected to sell for $4 million to $5.6
million. There are also two other portraits by Hals, a
three-quarter-length one of a woman in a black dress with white
collar and cuffs, expected to bring $1.2 million to $1.9 million,
and a three-quarter-length one of a gentleman in a black coat and
cape with a black hat and gloves in his left hand, expected to
bring $1.9 million to $2.8 million. Other Old Master paintings
include Teniers' portrait of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in his
picture gallery, which is priced between $960,000 and $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   A medieval manuscript known as the Rothschild Prayer Book is
also being sold. A Book of Hours in Latin, it has illuminated
manuscripts and 67 full-page miniatures and dates from 1510-15. It
is expected to sell for $2.4 million to $3.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Rothschild family was famous for its fine French furniture,
and these pieces, too, will be on the auction block. A royal
marquetry commode, ordered on Aug. 31, 1776, and delivered to King
Louis XVI for Fontainebleau in October 1778 was made by Riesener,
the finest cabinet maker to work for Louis XVI. The commode, which
is expected to sell for $2.4 million to $4 million, was removed
from Fontainebleau in 1787, researchers at Christie's discovered,
and sent by the king to his library at Versailles. Other furniture
for sale includes a black lacquer commode by Bernard II van
Risenburgh, a desk by Leleu and three long-case clocks.
</P>
<P>
   Highlights from the sale will be on view in New York beginning
April 24, when Christie's officially opens its new American
headquarters in Rockefeller Center.

PEPPERDINE STARTS PRELIMINARY INTERVIEWS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Pepperdine athletic director John Watson has begun
preliminary interviews for the school's vacant head men's
basketball coach position.
</P>
<P>
   Watson has been out of the office this week, presumably
traveling to meet with out-of-town applicants for the job. Sources
indicate Don Meyer, the head coach at Lipscomb University in
Nashville, is a serious candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Bennett, the top assistant this past season at Pepperdine
under former coach Lorenzo Romar, remains the leading contender for
the job. Other confirmed applicants are Biola head coach Dave
Holmquist, Rhode Island assistant Jim Harrick Jr., UC Santa Barbara
assistant Marty Wilson and UCLA assistants Michael Holton and Jim
Saia.
</P>
<P>
   Holmquist, 48, has coached at Biola, an NAIA school in La
Mirada, for 21 years. Biola was 29-8 last season and played for the
NAIA championship in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard anything yet,'' Holmquist said, adding he
hasn't had a formal interview with Watson.
</P>
<P>
   Romar resigned last month after three seasons to become the head
coach at Saint Louis University.
</P>
<P>
   Also: Jelani Gardner, a two-time All-West Coast Conference
basketball selection at Pepperdine, will participate in the Desert
Classic, a pre-NBA draft camp for college seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner will be one of 36 players in Phoenix for the camp, which
will be scouted by all NBA teams in preparation for the draft,
which is June 30.

UTILITIES TEST COMMUNICATIONS WITH `Y2K BUG' IN MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Major utilities say they are on track to upgrade their computer
systems to handle the software problem known as the ``Y2K bug.''
</P>
<P>
   The utilities also declared victory in a pre-Y2K test of their
backup communications systems, held Friday, although they released
few details. Nationally, the test's coordinator found problems such
as badly placed radio antennas and staffers who needed more
training to operate their new satellite telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Broadly, utilities say they will be ready to prevent major
blackouts and brownouts come Jan. 1, 2000, when computers could
crash or fail to function if their software isn't corrected to cope
with the unfamiliar digits of the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Edison, a unit of BEC Energy, says it has finished 80
percent of the work needed to fix and test computer systems to make
sure they function on Jan. 1 of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Edison, says it plans to finish the work by June 30, as does
Northeast Utilities, which has now finished 82 percent of its
check-ups.
</P>
<P>
   New England Electric System also says it will meet the June 30
target date set by the North American Electric Reliability Council.
NEES says it has completed 97 percent of its Y2K work.
</P>
<P>
   All three companies are also working to finish contingency plans
to restore power quickly in case of an outage. Boston Edison, for
example, plans to have an extra 100 workers on duty Dec. 31, many
of whom will staff the company's 40 substations scattered around
its service territory.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of digital control systems in 1984, most of
these stations have been operated remotely from Edison's
centralized control facility on Massachusetts Avenue. But Jim
Ashkar, the company executive in charge of the Y2K program, said
the extra staffers will be able to control switches manually in
case central computers crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we're bored,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The three utilities Friday also participated in a test of their
back-up communications systems, held nationwide by the North
American Electric Reliability Council in Princeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, tests were run by the region's so-called
``Independent System Operator,'' which oversees pricing functions
as states deregulate their power supply system. Employees at two
major control centers used microwave radios to contact utility
workers at various power plants around the region, and also tried
out a new set of satellite-telephones purchased especially to
prepare for the event.
</P>
<P>
   If traditional phones go down, the back-up radios would used to
keep the electrical grid functioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can establish alternative communications, then we've got
many important things conquered that could come up as possible
contingencies,'' said NEES Executive Vice President David Holt.
</P>
<P>
   The tests were conducted from two remote operating centers_one
operated by Northeast Utilities at its headquarters in Berlin,
Conn, the second run by New England Electric in Westboro, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Utility coordinators have been advertising the tests for weeks
as a symbol of their efforts to fix the problems. But New England
Electric and Northeast declined requests to observe the procedures
at their facilities.
</P>
<P>
   In a press release after the test was conducted, the power
reliability council called the drill ``a successful exercise'' but
noted various problems. Among them, the council said, ``there were
some incorrect phone numbers identified,'' and some radio antennas
will have to be moved. Also, some personnel need more training to
operate the satellite phones.
</P>
<P>
   The press release didn't specify where the problems occurred.
Executives for the council haven't returned telephone calls seeking
comment for several days, and couldn't be reached after the test
was completed.

 &HT;    Unforgettable `flight' one coach doesn't want to repeat
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ The first thing Bengals assistant football coach Al
Roberts heard early Friday morning was the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Then he felt his bed move.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts and his wife, Arvella, lay still in their upstairs
bedroom when the wind tore apart their home in Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the bathroom at 4:23,'' Roberts said. ``I knew that
because of my digital clock. I came back and heard that shewww _
the wind and the light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said my prayer, `Our Father,' right away because I knew we
were ... lifted. We were ascending. All of a sudden we came back
down again and, bang, landed on the floor and that mattress landed
on top of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I tell you how fast the wind lifted us and threw us down?
It was fast. I never heard a siren. We were lifted. We were in
flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Some seven hours after the destruction _ he lived a half block
from Sycamore High School near the intersection of Interstate 275
and I-71 _ Roberts was at the Bengals' Spinney Field headquarters
wondering how he was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you saw the house,'' he said, ``you wouldn't know how we
got out of there. I'll tell you again: God's hand was on me. I'll
tell you that a thousand times.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts got a ride to Spinney Field because both his cars were
demolished. He wore a Bengals coaching shirt, khaki slacks and
sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wardrobe,'' he said. ``Is what you're looking at.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how wide the tornado was. I don't know how long
it was. But I felt like it set down right on top of us. The living
room, dining room, kitchen _ it's all gone and everything in it.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the other two bedrooms, hallway and bathroom
upstairs?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was blown. It was taken,'' he said. ``Nothing's left but
the brick standing on the side of the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts originally thought the time of destruction lasted 15
seconds. ``But I'm gonna say three or four,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's all over, I'm looking up at black sky. It's still
dark. My whole roof is gone, and rain is coming down on me. Now
I've got to put some clothes on. The only way I found a shirt was
because lightning struck someplace and I saw a shirt and some
pants. I picked that up, got my wife and we went downstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   To get there, Roberts said, they slid on garbage down what
remained of the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife was trying to open the front door. I said, `Sweetie,
you don't have to worry about it. We can walk out the living room
because there's no wall.'''
</P>
<P>
   He discovered that the chimney and garage door had crushed his
sport utility vehicle. As for his Chevy sedan?
</P>
<P>
   ``They can come and get that thing because it's gone,'' he said.
``The only thing left of it is the body and my golf clubs. The
glove compartment is still locked.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, Roberts helped a woman and her son.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mom was in a nightgown and the son had a T-shirt and
underwear on,'' he said. ``So we went over and gave 'em two Bengals
jackets, and one tennis shoe each.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said he met with the Red Cross about 7:30 a.m. and
discovered a neighborhood couple had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   The coach and his wife are moving into a Residence Inn hotel
with nothing but memories of a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't forget this,'' he said. ``I don't ever want to be in
another one.''

   ``I went to the bathroom at 4:23,'' Roberts said. ``I knew that
because of my digital clock. I came back and heard that shewww _
the wind and the light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said my prayer, `Our Father,' right away because I knew we
were ... lifted. We were ascending. All of a sudden we came back
down again and, bang, landed on the floor and that mattress landed
on top of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I tell you how fast the wind lifted us and threw us down?
It was fast. I never heard a siren. We were lifted. We were in
flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Some seven hours after the destruction _ he lived a half block
from Sycamore High School near the intersection of Interstate 275
and I-71 _ Roberts was at the Bengals' Spinney Field headquarters
wondering how he was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you saw the house,'' he said, ``you wouldn't know how we
got out of there. I'll tell you again: God's hand was on me. I'll
tell you that a thousand times.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts got a ride to Spinney Field because both his cars were
demolished. He wore a Bengals coaching shirt, khaki slacks and
sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wardrobe,'' he said. ``Is what you're looking at.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how wide the tornado was. I don't know how long
it was. But I felt like it set down right on top of us. The living
room, dining room, kitchen _ it's all gone and everything in it.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the other two bedrooms, hallway and bathroom
upstairs?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was blown. It was taken,'' he said. ``Nothing's left but
the brick standing on the side of the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts originally thought the time of destruction lasted 15
seconds. ``But I'm gonna say three or four,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's all over, I'm looking up at black sky. It's still
dark. My whole roof is gone, and rain is coming down on me. Now
I've got to put some clothes on. The only way I found a shirt was
because lightning struck someplace and I saw a shirt and some
pants. I picked that up, got my wife and we went downstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   To get there, Roberts said, they slid on garbage down what
remained of the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife was trying to open the front door. I said, `Sweetie,
you don't have to worry about it. We can walk out the living room
because there's no wall.'''
</P>
<P>
   He discovered that the chimney and garage door had crushed his
sport utility vehicle. As for his Chevy sedan?
</P>
<P>
   ``They can come and get that thing because it's gone,'' he said.
``The only thing left of it is the body and my golf clubs. The
glove compartment is still locked.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, Roberts helped a woman and her son.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mom was in a nightgown and the son had a T-shirt and
underwear on,'' he said. ``So we went over and gave 'em two Bengals
jackets, and one tennis shoe each.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said he met with the Red Cross about 7:30 a.m. and
discovered a neighborhood couple had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   The coach and his wife are moving into a Residence Inn hotel
with nothing but memories of a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't forget this,'' he said. ``I don't ever want to be in
another one.''

PLENTY OF FANS WATCHING WRESTLING ON TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about perplexing choices. It's almost impossible to say
which is more amusing: pro wrestling, or the people who see it as a
neon sign of the apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, let's go with wrestling, if only because the
people who worry themselves silly over it have already had their
say in every publication on the planet, except maybe Food &AMP; Wine.
And you can bet Food &AMP; Wine is hanging fire for the day when some
rassler named The Great Gewurztraminer threatens to decant his
opponents with the flying corkscrew of death. As soon as it
happens, those wacky oenophiles will be on it like spandex on a
Nitro Girl.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling, the faux kind, has been around since the beginning of
time, which occurred around the late 1940s. Some years later, after
evolution and the invention of the remote-control device, a female
comedian observed that the only reason men like to channel-surf is
to increase their odds of finding a station that shows naked women
wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution is still under way, so we don't yet have the Bare
Bimbos Brawling Network. But we're close. USA Network, home of
Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation, has been known to
include a medley of popular thongs in its World Wrestling
Federation telecasts. Such cheekiness is one of the things that
sets the WWF apart from World Championship Wrestling, the tamer
entry in the grappling galaxy. WCW is a Ted Turner enterprise (seen
on both TNT and TBS), and while Ted seems to like his cheesecake as
much as the next mouth-breathing couch potato, he does have
standards. WCW's answer to the WWF's nearly bare babes are the less
revealing but no less buxom Nitro Girls.
</P>
<P>
   Now, suggesting that pro wrestling has standards is like arguing
that the Mariners have the pitching to go all the way. After all,
it's an enterprise built on violence, sex, violence, bad acting and
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone needing confirmation just has to watch the tube. On
Monday nights alone, there are five hours of flying knee drops,
reverse eye gouges and belly-to-belly suplexes filling the screen.
Never mind that it seems inadvisable to have a belly-to-belly
suplex done on an outpatient basis. This is not Ozzie Nelson coming
into your living room. More like his odd cousin, Full, and Full's
half-brother, Half.
</P>
<P>
   For those requiring proof in the flesh, both the WWF and WCW
road shows arrive in the Northwest in the next week. WCW visits
Tacoma on Sunday and Yakima on Monday; the WWF stops in Seattle
Thursday and Vancouver, B.C., next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stone Cold Steve Austin and Sable, two of the WWF's
leading lights, won't make the trip here (Austin is slated to be in
Vancouver), connoisseurs of the movement _ we can't really call it
a sport, can we? _ aren't likely to be disappointed. Sunday's WCW
event at the Tacoma Dome will include Hollywood ``Hulk'' Hogan, Ric
Flair, Diamond Dallas Page and Goldberg, who looks a lot like the
governor of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Among the combatants promised for the Austin-less WWF melee next
Thursday at Seattle's KeyArena are The Rock, Kane, Ken Shamrock,
Val Venis and The Acolytes.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of acolytes, anyone with a pulse knows the resurgence
of pro wrestling is one of the biggest pop-culture stories of the
'90s. The merchandising of manufactured celebrities like Austin,
whose falling out with WCW helped ``legitimize'' the WWF, has
created an enormous following among the masses, which in turn has
made the wrestling industry hotter than any high-flying stock that
has dot-com after its name.
</P>
<P>
   With other-worldly characters who satisfy America's insatiable
appetite for low-brow entertainment, the two organizations have
created programs that share the highest ratings on cable-TV.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a parent who thinks it's OK for a young child to wear
a Steve Austin T-shirt with profanity splashed on its back deserves
a couple of vertical splashes from one of Austin's WWF colleagues,
a 400-pound piece of human furniture named Sexual Chocolate. Still,
it's a free country, where stupid parents can sit next to smart
ones and enjoy the cathartic release that audiences for millennia
have enjoyed wherever savvy promoters could provide a steady diet
of conflict, resolution, conflict, resolution, and maybe a little
sex.
</P>
<P>
   Is it the end of our society, as the doomsayers fear?
</P>
<P>
   Not likely. But if it were, it would probably sell out in a
minute. And be available on pay-per-view.

 &HT;    REFUGEE CRISIS IN MACEDONIA STABLE, SAYS UN CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    EDS: Optional trim at 400 
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia Amid intense criticism that her agency has
bungled Europe's worst humanitarian disaster since World War II,
the head of the United Nations agency for refugees said Friday that
efforts would be made to keep Kosovo refugees in countries
bordering Yugoslavia and ultimately seek their return to their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Sadako Ogata, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
said she received assurances from the government of Macedonia that
it would keep its borders open to refugees fleeing from Kosovo and
keep offering them asylum.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 ethnic Albanian refugees went missing Wednesday
after a hasty and disorganized overnight exodus of an estimated
55,000 refugees by the Macedonian government, which deposited them
on the border with neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Many refugees reportedly were ousted from the camp against their
will and were not told their destinations. Aid workers said
hundreds of families were separated in the confusion at the
makeshift camp near the Blace border crossing to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Those refugees had been located in camps in Macedonia and
neighboring Albania, the U.N. refugee agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   However, the uprooting of the refugees from a camp on
Macedonia's northern border caught the U.N. and other aid agencies
unaware. Macedonia, a small republic formerly part of Yugoslavia,
has struggled to cope with the influx of more than 100,000 refugees
and failed to inform international humanitarian agencies of its
nighttime operation earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of NATO, which is providing the bulk of relief
operations in Macedonia, have privately criticized UNHCR for
failing to anticipate the refugee crisis and being slow to respond
to the mass exodus from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ogata said she was most concerned about tens of thousands of
unsettled Kosovars who were waiting to enter Macedonia and who
suddenly disappeared overnight earlier this week, apparently forced
back inside the Kosovo province by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia halted the exodus of refugees from Kosovo by closing
its borders Wednesday night, saying peace had been restored and
that ``a process of return of displaced persons ... has been
initiated.''
</P>
<P>
   Ogata told a news conference in the Macedonian capital, Skopje,
that her agency was ``helpless'' to assist them because aid workers
cannot safely travel through Serb-held territory for fears for
their safety.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting the Brazda refugee camp in northern Albania, a small
boy told Ogata that he wanted to return to his home. She replied:
``We can go back when we can go there safely.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NATO continued its aid distribution program in Macedonia,
airlifting more nearly 3,000 tons of food and supplies this week.
NATO operates three refugee camps in Macedonia and a fourth is
administered by the Macedonian government. Plans exist to build
another four camps.
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian aid officials said they were satisfied that the
needs of the refugees in Macedonia would be met. A plan for U.S.
Marines to erect a tent city to house refugees was scrubbed Friday
after NATO officials said the need was greater in neighboring
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   According to UNHCR, Macedonia now has 105,000 refugees, with
44,500 staying in camps and the rest being put up by local ethnic
Albanian families. Albania is hosting the bulk of refugees from
Kosovo, some 320,000.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and nearly a dozen other countries offered to
accept refugees when Macedonia asked for emergency assistance last
week. But Ogata said her agency and NATO had determined that it
would logical to house the refugees in neighboring countries to
Yugoslavia to hasten their return home if and when a settlement
allows.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia, with a population of some 2.5 million, has an ethnic
Albanian minority of about 20 percent. Macedonian leaders fear the
massive flow of refugees will unsettle its sensitive ethnic balance
and strain its shaky economy.

 &HT;    `Weekend of Champions' ministry brings inmates together with pro
athletes, Christian counselors
 &HT;    By David Kepple
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Dayton will become the focal point for a major
prison ministry effort this summer billed as the ``Weekend of
Champions.''
</P>
<P>
   The evangelical Christian program, set for July 9-11, will offer
the Gospel to about 8,500 inmates in five Ohio prisons, including
Dayton Correctional Institution and also the Lebanon, Warren,
London and Madison correctional facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton will serve as headquarters for the entire five-prison
project, which is expected to draw nearly 400 volunteer Christian
counselors from across the country to work on the program.
</P>
<P>
   The event is sponsored by Bill Glass Ministries _ a Cedar Hill,
Texas-based group, led by Glass, who starred in professional
football for the Cleveland Browns in the 1960s. Since Glass
launched the Weekend of Champions Prison Ministry in 1972, it has
become the nation's largest evangelical ministry to inmates, with
51 such weekend programs scheduled around the country this year.
</P>
<P>
   Glass will be the keynote speaker Thursday when Far Hills
Baptist Church in Kettering hosts an aptly named Kickoff Banquet to
recruit support for the July event, including additional volunteer
counselors and church sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   A Centerville resident and member of Far Hills Baptist, banquet
chairperson Sue Shay said the lifeblood of the Weekend of Champions
ministry flows from the hundreds of volunteer counselors who will
pay their own way to Dayton and ``share Christ'' with inmates for
two days.
</P>
<P>
   Shay herself has served as a volunteer counselor on weekends
elsewhere in Ohio and in Chicago. She said Montgomery County
Sheriff Gary Haines is sending representatives to the banquet and
considering whether to open the women's unit of the county jail to
the ministry in July.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Jackson, Midwest regional director for Bill Glass
Ministries, said the Weekend of Champions has been held in Ohio
every two years this decade, but this will be the first time Dayton
has served as a base.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is new territory, so we're excited about that,'' said
Jackson. He said it will be Glass' first time working in the
Dayton, Lebanon and Warren prisons, in particular.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry uses pro athletes, entertainers and ex-convicts to
grab the attention of inmates, who are then given an opportunity to
meet one-on-one with volunteer counselors.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said it's too early to say which athletes or
entertainers will be involved in the July initiative.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 alone, Jackson said, the Weekend of Champions ministry
involved 7,500 volunteer counselors and visited about 200,000
inmates in 315 prison units.

UCLA'S CHIEF PRIORITY: FORWARD WALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Aside from finding a quarterback, UCLA's primary
offensive goal in spring practice is to develop its young offensive
line _ a unit made younger by attrition, injuries and position
changes.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are without three starters (Kris Farris, Andy Meyers
and Shawn Stuart) from last year's earth-moving unit. In addition,
they've lost reserve Dave Wilford to grade problems _ he's been
dismissed from school _ and reserve Micah Webb is out until August
with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Of the heralded 1998 recruiting class, only Jim Ghezzi, Mike
Saffer and Blake Worley remain. Steve Morgan has switched to
defensive tackle, and Jeff Wright and Scott Wiegand have quit
because of concussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question we're not very deep, but we've never been
very deep,'' line coach Mark Weber said. ``Our goal this month is
to find the starters and the six-through-10 guys, and we need to
recruit some players next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Only three members of Weber's 10-man rotation played extensively
last season: Ghezzi, right tackle Brian Polak and left guard Oscar
Cabrera.
</P>
<P>
   That means Worley, Saffer, center Troy Danoff, left tackle Josh
Webb (a converted defensive lineman) and reserve guard Matt Phelan
must be ready to play Sept. 4 against Boise State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look very athletic,'' Weber said. ``We run well and we move
well. We're further along, assignment-wise, than I thought we'd
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Position changes: Several Bruins will experiment with new
positions this month, with Morgan's shift from guard to defensive
tackle having perhaps the greatest impact.
</P>
<P>
   At 295 pounds, Morgan was immovable in blocking drills last
season. He joins Anthony Fletcher, Ken Kocher and Sean Phillips to
give UCLA a massive _ and unprecedented _ defensive-tackle
rotation. Just two seasons ago, the Bruins were using converted
linebackers on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Also, tight end Saia Makakaufaki has moved to defensive end and
defensive tackle Micah Webb (injured) has joined his brother Josh
on the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback trio: No change in the depth chart at tailback, at
least for now. Jermaine Lewis was listed as the starter when spring
drills began, with Keith Brown No. 2 and DeShaun Foster No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to compete,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said.
``There's not any need to make a decision now, but from spring to
fall it could change.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Lewis had 130 carries, Foster 126 and Brown 99.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: The list is long and varied. Divided into three
categories, here's an overview.
</P>
<P>
   Serious: Linebacker Michael Wiley (back) has retired, defensive
end Doug Whiting (stress fracture/spine) will miss the 1999 season
and fullback Mark Verti might not play again because of a neck
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate: Cornerback Jason Bell (bone spur/heel), linebacker
Ramogi Huma (hip) and Micah Webb (knee) will not participate in
spring drills but are expected for training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Minor: Receiver Freddie Mitchell (broken leg), receiver Brian
Poli-Dixon (wrist) and safety Lovell Houston (shoulders) will
practice on a limited basis.

COMMENTARY: ENDS AND MEANS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ NATO now has three irreducible war aims: the removal of
all Serbian military, paramilitary and police forces from Kosovo;
the return of all the ethnic Albanian refugees, and their care and
protection by an international force.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, as in the United States, Serbian atrocities have
brought public opinion solidly behind those objectives. But the
leaders of NATO are not so clear in stating them.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and NATO spokesmen, for example, keep saying
that Slobodan Milosevic must accept the plan he rejected at
Rambouillet, France. But that proposal called for him to keep 5,000
Serbian troops in Kosovo and control its borders _ an unthinkable
outcome after the Serbian terror campaign. Could ethnic Albanian
families be expected to live in confidence if at the end of the
block there was a Serbian unit that had killed their husbands and
fathers?
</P>
<P>
   Even less clear is whether we are committed to the means
necessary to achieve those objectives. That is the crucial question
and a painful one, given the shameful miscalculation by the Clinton
administration when it gave the go-ahead for the air campaign
against Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The president and his advisers evidently believed that after a
whiff of gunsmoke _ a few bombs _ Milosevic would say yes to
Rambouillet. They were totally unprepared for his murderous attack
on Kosovo civilians. They had no plan to house and feed refugees.
NATO air attacks over the first 10 days were pinpricks. Worst of
all, no tactical aircraft were used against the Serbian forces in
Kosovo to slow the killing and ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   It was two weeks after the start of the air campaign when the
bombing got serious. Milosevic countered with his call for a
cease-fire. His strategy now seems to be: I'll keep the remaining
ethnic Albanians in their shattered land, under Serbian control,
and let some refugees return if you stop the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a thinly disguised Milosevic victory, indeed
hardly disguised at all. It would abandon the Kosovar Albanians to
their fate, and it would destroy NATO's credibility. So Clinton and
others were right to brush the first Milosevic gambit off.
</P>
<P>
   But more peace proposals will surely follow, and it will not be
right to dismiss them out of hand. If the refugees are our prime
concern, as they should be, we must be willing to explore any
serious diplomatic effort to end their misery quickly and get them
home in safety. A willingness to talk will also serve to maintain
NATO unity.
</P>
<P>
   Some thoughtful people believe Milosevic will give enough ground
under the pressure of intensifying air attack to make possible an
honorable end. I do not. His record of murder and lies over the
last decade argues that, if it is necessary to talk, one can have
no confidence in doing business with Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   So we must carry the air war much further, especially against
his armed thugs on the ground in Kosovo. They should be harried,
trapped, deprived of heavy weapons, fuel and communications: driven
out by force. After cutting off the refugee flow, Milosevic
stationed tanks on Kosovo's borders.
</P>
<P>
   Second, NATO must now begin to assemble ground troops, ready to
enter Kosovo as a fighting force if necessary or to be a protection
force for returning refugees if and when the Serbian forces are
gone. Ruling out ground forces at the start was a grievous
political mistake, convincing Milosevic that we were not serious. A
majority of Americans, and a larger majority of Britons, now favor
the use of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Third, NATO must move more energetically to assemble evidence of
war crimes by Milosevic and his agents. The State Department took
an important step the other day when it announced that nine Serbian
military commanders may face prosecution before the International
War Crimes Tribunal. But the immunity of Milosevic should end.
</P>
<P>
   We have to face a hard fact: The United States and its allies
must be in this for the long haul. Reconstructing Kosovo after the
Serbian savagery will not be easy. Then we must work with
surrounding countries to confine the Serbian ultra-nationalism that
Milosevic has aroused. It is a heavy obligation, but the
alternatives are worse. James Hooper of the Balkan Action Council
is right when he says, ``The Balkans are the new Berlin: the test
of Western will.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ No, President Boris Yeltsin did not order Russian
nuclear missiles to be retargeted at NATO countries taking part in
the bombing of Yugoslavia. Nor did he formally endorse the joining
together of Russia, Belarus and Yugoslavia in a geographically
awkward Slavic union.
</P>
<P>
   But at a meeting Friday with Gennadi Seleznyov, the Communist
who is speaker of the Russian Parliament's lower house, he
unmistakably warned the West not to push Russia into another war in
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told NATO, the Americans, the Germans, don't push us toward
military action,'' he said, speaking before television cameras.
``Otherwise there will be a European war for sure, and possibly a
world war. We are against this.''
</P>
<P>
   It took the Kremlin the better part of the day Friday to clarify
just exactly what Yeltsin said and did not say in his Seleznyov
meeting. As he emerged from the session with Yeltsin Friday
morning, the speaker sent out the alarming report that Russia would
be targeting NATO states with nuclear warheads, touching off an
intense flurry of diplomatic activity in Western capitals.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, top Russian officials were issuing denials.
``As far as we know in the Foreign Ministry, no orders concerning
missiles have been issued.'' said Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   Seleznyov also appears to have overstated the president's
support for a union among Russia, Belarus and Yugoslavia, an idea
pushed by the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, as a way of
shoring up Moscow's support for Belgrade. According to remarks
televised Friday night, Yeltsin told Seleznyov that the proposal
should be studied.
</P>
<P>
   A union between Russian and Belarus is already under
negotiation, but as the proposal now stands, its main purpose is to
standardize economic relations between the two neighboring
countries, without any provision for military or security
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   As Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Yakushkin noted, including
Yugoslavia in such a union would involve several ``extremely
complicated and delicate'' questions that would take months to
resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has repeatedly pledged to keep Russia out of any
military involvement in Yugoslavia, a promise that the United
States and its NATO allies said Friday had been reaffirmed through
diplomatic contacts.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia's harsh denunciations of the NATO campaign against
Yugoslavia, and vague threats to adjust its military doctrine, have
raised enough concern to prompt a meeting next week in Oslo between
Ivanov and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   In other remarks Friday, Yeltsin set down further markers on
future NATO policy in the Balkans. ``They want to use ground
troops, take over Yugoslavia, make it their protectorate,'' he
said. ``We cannot allow this. Russia and the access to the
Mediterranean Sea are nearby, so we can by no means give Yugoslavia
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia last week sent a reconnaissance ship from its Black Sea
fleet towards the Adriatic Sea to monitor NATO's activities off the
coast of Yugoslavia. The Turkish Foreign Ministry said Russia had
notified Turkey that as many as eight more ships might pass through
the Bosporus, with sailing dates staggered between April 12 and 16.
But so far, Moscow has not publicly announced a decision to send
any of those additional vessels.
</P>
<P>
   The Yeltsin administration, with its tough Cold War-style
oratory, has so far managed to stay abreast of the wave of
anti-American feeling that has swept Russia. But as the NATO
bombing continues, limiting Russia's opposition to just words may
prove increasingly difficult.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 279 to 30, the Communist-led lower house of
Parliament demanded last Wednesday that the government send
military aid and advisers to Yugoslavia, in violation of U.N.
sanctions against Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Yugoslavia has added new tensions to Russia's already
overheated domestic political struggle. Yeltsin's Communist
opponents, emboldened by the anti-Western mood, have been pressing
an impeachment vote against the president, now scheduled for debate
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The political atmosphere has been further sullied by an
unresolved clash over the future of Russia's chief prosecutor, Yuri
I. Skuratov, whose dismissal by Yeltsin, for a second time, has
opened up a Pandora's box of charges and countercharges of
corruption and misconduct that have threatened to taint members of
the president's inner circle.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a week marked by alarmist reports that the Kremlin is setting
the stage for a dramatic showdown with Parliament, Yelstin Friday
said publicly that he had no plans to dismiss Prime Minister
Yevgeni M. Primakov or to ban the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, he told a meeting of regional governors, will he support
any plans _ like one proposed recently by Primakov _ to eliminate
the direct elections of Russia's regional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin gave only lukewarm support to Primakov and dropped
strong hints that a Cabinet shuffle might be in the works. ``At
this stage, Yevgeni Primakov is useful to us,'' he told the
governors. ``Later we will see. On the other hand, the Cabinet does
need reinforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Several prominent members of the Communist Party are ministers
in the Primakov government, and in a recent interview, the prime
minister confirmed reports that he had given his communist allies a
pledge that he would resign before agreeing to dismiss any of their
top ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who met this week
with Yeltsin, said in an interview published in Friday night's
edition of Izvestia that he would support changes in the Cabinet.
``I wonder why reaction to all this has become so painful,'' he
said. ``I changed three cabinets, and no one reacted so painfully
to that.''

 &HT;    Families feel lucky after surviving tornado
 &HT;    By Lawrence Budd
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Julie Streck awoke Friday morning to the sound of
sirens outside her home minutes before a tornado tore apart her
family's small neighborhood, just east of Interstate 71 in Sycamore
Twp. in Hamilton County.
</P>
<P>
   The high school senior and her sister Jan, 21, ran for their
parents, who gathered up siblings Allen, 9, Jill, 6, and Hunter,
the family's golden retriever.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, the family huddled hand-in-hand in the basement
at about 5:10 a.m. as a tornado unleashed its lethal power.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Streck's basement adjoins the rest of house,
so the basement roof _ made of wood and shingles _ was fully
exposed to the storm's force.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could actually feel it pulling,'' Streck said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, everything died down. We came upstairs, no
more house,'' she said, standing in front of her yard, surveying
what remained of the neighborhood, which backs onto Johnson Nature
Preserve, about six miles south of Warren County.
</P>
<P>
   The tall trees making up the preserve's forest had been blown
down or bent to extreme angles. Tree tops had been torn off.
</P>
<P>
   Large trees in the yards nearby also were knocked down, an array
of clothes, paper and other debris wrapped in their broken limbs.
Whole sheets of bricks from houses hung precariously and pieces of
wood framing lay everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   A couple walked through the second floor of the home next door
to Streck's, as people watched from the street. The front walls and
roof were missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The woods are gone. Houses are gone,'' Streck said. ``Luckily,
we made it through.''
</P>
<P>
   Her family's garage roof lay against the basement foundation.
Much of the back of the house and part of the roof, along with a
backyard deck built off the back of the Streck's two-story brick
house, were gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kitchen's in the back yard. We can't find the dining room.
We had a huge deck. We don't even know where the deck is,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents were rooting through the rubble, trying to locate
their belongings.
</P>
<P>
   Still the Strecks faired better than some of their neighbors.
Three died when the twister hit and others were rushed to hospitals
with ``everything from minor injuries to a woman with an amputated
leg,'' said Montgomery Police Chief Donald McGlothlin.
</P>
<P>
   To the east, in the Montgomery Town condominiums, the Schwarber
family awoke to the sounds of the approaching storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you could see was a dustball,'' Beverly Schwarber said.
``I thought a plane had landed in our yard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband said, `Grab the baby,' We didn't even make it
downstairs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Because her father suffers from Alzheimer's disease, he and her
mother had chosen to sleep in the basement, rather than a
second-floor bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother had heard a loud thud.
</P>
<P>
   ``She thought it an animal or something had fallen through the
fireplace. In fact, it was a tree,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Schwarber, an interior decorator, had finished their
bedroom in three shades of coral. Tasteful waterfront paintings and
a floral arrangement completed the Florida Room effect. Everything
seemed to be in its proper place, except for the tree limb
protruding from the ceiling directly over the bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have impaled one of the in-laws,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ten feet away, 15-month old Adam was sleeping in his room.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this happened there ... that's the scary thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the limb through the ceiling, the condominium
remained intact. The family planned on spending the night in their
home, regardless of whether electrical power had been restored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very lucky, compared to everybody else,'' Beverly
Schwarber said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The aerial bombardment of Serbia has been going on for more than
two weeks, but so far, Wall Street has been unmoved by the barking
dogs of war.
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons for this, of course. But some analysts and
money managers are of the opinion that military-sector stocks
represent a pocket of value that for more than a year has been
largely ignored by investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not Internet stocks, and you have to be patient,''
said Pierre Chao, senior aerospace-defense analyst at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. ``But for real investors these stocks are
selling at levels where you want to start building positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Wars don't always light a fire under military stocks, but they
usually don't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The Persian Gulf war, a far bigger military operation than the
attack NATO has waged thus far against Yugoslavia, generated
interest in military stocks in 1990 and 1991, and the group
outperformed the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, said Cai von
Rumohr, an analyst at S.G. Cowen &AMP; Company in Boston. By contrast,
they barely budged during the military operations in Somalia and
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   In an April 7 report, Byron Callan, an analyst at Merrill Lynch,
estimated that a three- to six-week air war would result in no more
than $200 million to $300 million in supplemental spending by the
Defense Department to replace munitions and electronics consumed in
the operation.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of money is not going to make much of a difference to
the six giant companies _ Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Boeing,
Northrop Grumman, Litton Industries and General Dynamics _ that
survived the brutal consolidation that transformed the industry
earlier this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The important numbers, according to those who follow and invest
in these stocks, are the Defense Department outlays requested by
the Clinton Administration for the coming fiscal year through 2005.
The numbers project the first major increases in military spending
since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Events like Iraq and Kosovo are important to the extent that
they draw attention to the sad fact that peace on earth is not
here,'' Chao said. ``But they won't drive earnings or the stocks.
Increasing defense budgets will.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the proposed increase would go to raising military
salaries and pensions and for operations and maintenance. But the
administration also wants steady increases in outlays for weapons
procurement, from $53 billion in fiscal 2000 to $75.1 billion in
fiscal 2005. Key areas earmarked for additional money are fighter
aircraft and air transports, surface ships and submarines and
ballistic-missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   In a report compiled in late March, Michael Bunyaner, an analyst
at CIBC Oppenheimer, said companies that should benefit from the
additional spending include Lockheed Martin (fighter aircraft),
Boeing (air transports and missile defense), General Dynamics
(submarines) and Raytheon (missiles). ``Raytheon and General
Dynamics are our top two picks, but we are bullish on the entire
group,'' Bunyaner said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guarantee, of course, that the Clinton
administration will get what it is asking for. Congress has its own
ideas about where and how to spend money allotted for the Pentagon.
And it will be some time before any budget increases begin to raise
revenues at these companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will have to muddle through the next four to six quarters
before these increases in procurement spending show up,'' said
Peter Aseritis, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, however, it is difficult to imagine that the
prices of these stocks could go much lower.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P Aerospace/Defense Index is 31.8 percent below its
52-week high, which was last April. Northrop Grumman closed Friday
at $58, just 9.5 times consensus estimates of its 1999 earnings.
And Lockheed Martin and Litton closed at 10.9 and 13 times their
1999 earnings estimates, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Chao, the Morgan Stanley analyst, said that since the 1950s,
military stocks have traded in a range of 40 to 100 percent of the
S&AMP;P 500's price-earnings multiple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, you get to the lower end at the end of major
conflicts, and at the top at the beginning of major ramp-ups'' in
spending, he said. ``Right now, the group on average is trading at
55 percent of the market multiple, which doesn't make sense because
you are at the beginning of a ramp-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Some value investors are taking note. ``We think Lockheed Martin
and Northrop Grumman are very cheap stocks,'' said Larry Sondike,
co-portfolio manager of Mutual Shares and Mutual Beacon Funds.
``The environment is improving, but to date the market has not
cared. That is the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Sanborn, manager of the $6 billion Oakmark fund, has
owned Lockheed Martin for a number of years and now controls a
stake of nearly 2 percent in the company. ``At this point, it's
probably my favorite stock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Callen of Merrill said that while the long-term outlook was
improving, he wasn't pounding the table for any stocks in the
group. ``Still, based on the calls I get from our retail brokers,''
he acknowledged, ``it seems there is a real interest out there.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors worried about rising interest rates were calmed
recently by news of a decline in manufacturing jobs in March and a
slowdown in the rise of average hourly earnings, a key measure of
inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in manufacturing jobs offset the ``bad news'' of the
strong rebound in the level of manufacturing, as measured by the
National Association of Purchasing Management. In March, its
manufacturing index jumped to 54.30, its highest level since
November 1997. Initially, the surge was taken as a sign of a
rebound in American manufacturing, which would make it less likely
that the economy could slow to the sustainable pace sought by the
Federal Reserve without an increase in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The slowdown in the pace of wage increases helped relieve
another fear, that pressure here would become too much for the
Federal Reserve, even though there are few signs now that companies
can pass along the cost of these increases as higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   That relief, coming on two fronts, helped set off a nice rally
in the bond market, bringing the yield on the 30-year bond down to
5.46 percent Friday from 5.67 percent on April 1, the day before
the March jobs data were released. And that rally helped lift the
stock market, with the three major gauges _ the Dow Jones
industrial average, the S&AMP;P 500 and the Nasdaq composite _
repeatedly reaching new highs last week.
</P>
<P>
   But investors may be taking more comfort from this new data than
they should.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, there has been a pretty good correlation
between the movement of the purchasing management manufacturing
index and long-term interest rates adjusted for inflation. Right
now, that index is pointing to a sharp rise in long-term rates _
into 6 percent territory _ according to Robert Barbera, the chief
economist at Hoenig &AMP; Co. in Rye Brook, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Barbera agreed that the decline in manufacturing jobs and the
continued weakness in industrial production may mean that that the
purchasing management index is sending a false signal. But he said
weekly jobless claims, which have remained below 300,000 for 10
weeks, are a signal of strength.
</P>
<P>
   And he argues that if the global economy, especially Asia's,
begins to rebound, a recovery in U.S. manufacturing is even more
certain. The cut in official interest rates on Thursday by the Bank
of England and the new European Central Bank just add to the
likelihood that a rebound in global economic growth will give
another boost to the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hard part is guessing what will happen to global
momentum,'' Barbera said. But if it is picking up, then the past
correlation between the purchasing management index and interest
rates is far more worrisome for American investors.
</P>
<P>
   Barbera also has a doubt about the deceleration in average
hourly earnings. He agrees that the pace of growth has declined, to
3.6 percent last month from 4.4 percent in April 1998. But he says
the underlying data show that the rise of earnings in the service
sector is actually accelerating. What has slowed the overall pace
is a sharp decline in the growth rate for manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   But, again, if the purchasing management index is right _ and
the bet on a global turnaround is correct _ that trend will also
reverse, adding to the pressure on wages.
</P>
<P>
   All these trends will be watched closely by Fed policy-makers,
who next meet in May. If Barbera is right in his bets, the Fed
could be in a tight spot.
</P>
<P>
   Going into this year, policy makers were betting on a growth
slowdown to bring the pace of the economy to a sustainable rate
that would not add to inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   But even the Fed is acknowledging that the economy will be much
stronger than it expected. In the minutes of the February meeting
of the Federal Open Market Committee, released a week ago, Fed
governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents said it was now
possible that the economy, even after slowing from the breakneck
annual growth rate of 6 percent in the fourth quarter, could still
be running ahead of the central bank's sustainable pace of around
2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Fed will be more likely to lean toward higher
interest rates _ and Barbera's interest rate indicator, which is
clearly pointing higher, will be right.

   It wasn't so long ago that experts figured Europe was picking up
enough economic momentum that the world would scarcely notice if
American consumers could no longer prime the world economy with
their free-spending ways.
</P>
<P>
   But Europe's economic growth is lagging. And for American
investors, the Bloomberg European 500 Index has furnished a return
of just 1.7 percent for the year to date.
</P>
<P>
   Now the conflict in Kosovo raises further questions about
Europe's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Offering a trans-Atlantic slant on current developments, Andreas
Utermann, a holder of German, British and Belgian passports and the
portfolio manager of the Mercury Pan-European Growth fund, managed
by Merrill Lynch, took time last week to talk about the European
market's travails. The fund, which has attracted $600 million since
it started last October, is fully invested in Western European
equities.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are the hostilities in Yugoslavia an economic concern?
</P>
<P>
   A. One needs to put the crisis into perspective. The Balkans
have actually been in crisis since 1990, when the Iron Curtain was
dissolving. And they have had quite a limited impact on real
economic activity in Europe. Trade and investment by Western
companies are negligible. There are virtually no loans outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, it's a psychological impact. You can clearly see
that the markets that are closest to that region, like Greece, have
taken the biggest hits. And this should be reversed once the crisis
dies down.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What will be the effect of rebuilding?
</P>
<P>
   A. The impact is not going to be huge. The first impact is
likely to be quite positive on economic growth because the
companies benefiting are probably those closest to the region _
European companies financed by Western money.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have prospects begun to improve for growth in Europe and for
its stock markets?
</P>
<P>
   A. Underlying economic activity does not necessarily impact,
either positively or negatively, the stock markets, particularly in
a world where disinflation continues to be a feature. Companies are
not counting on top-line growth and, therefore, not counting on
economic growth to propel their sales. They're focusing on reducing
costs.
</P>
<P>
   And European growth is very differentiated. The Iberian
Peninsula, Ireland, the Netherlands are growing very fast: 3
percent plus. France is surprising on the upside. You have other
regions where growth is slowing, such as the U.K., or where growth
is disappointing, such as Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, it's not speeding up, but it's not slowing down to the
extent that there's risk of recession.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you think the political situation has improved with the
departure of Germany's finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, and
members of the European Commission?
</P>
<P>
   A. The resignation of Lafontaine, who has very publicly been
calling for interest rate cuts, will help the central bank, because
it does not need to be seen to be tough relative to political
pressure. He was the figurehead of the sort of old-style
government-intervention politics. As for the Community, it was
having credibility problems and harming the image of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why has the euro started out so surprisingly weak?
</P>
<P>
   A. The euro is clearly a very important swing factor. European
stock markets are up this year in local currency terms by 5 to 10
percent, but because the euro has depreciated 7 or 8 percent, that
has depressed U.S. returns on the European markets.
</P>
<P>
   But compared with where it was six months or so ago, the euro is
at the same level relative to the dollar as it was then. So over
the longer term you can't say the euro has been dramatically weak.
In fact, given the knocks that Europe has taken since the beginning
of the year _ nonresolution of the Russian situation, Kosovo,
resignations of the Community, slowing down of the German economy _
the euro has been pretty resilient. There is no reason to
anticipate a further significant weakening.
</P>
<P>
   Rate cuts like those announced Thursday can be seen as a signal
of future strengthening of economic growth and will probably prop
up the euro over the next three to six months.
</P>
<P>
   Q. We hear about European companies getting investor-friendly.
Is that significant?
</P>
<P>
   A. Absolutely. There are two key elements to European stock
markets, which make it a very attractive buying opportunity. First,
people are investing more and more in equities, which has been a
neglected asset class.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the introduction of a common currency and completion of
the single market, along with globalization of world economies,
have led European companies to finally understand that many of them
are minnows on the global stage and need economies of scale. This
means there is enormous merger and acquisition activity. European
companies also realize they're competing for capital globally.

FRENCH COURT BLOCKS SALE OF ORANGINA TO COCA-COLA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Georgia, Australia, Mexico, Germany, Spain)  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Co.'s plans to buy Orangina faded Friday when France's
highest administrative court refused to overturn a government
ruling that had blocked the sale.
</P>
<P>
   The French government had been concerned that the sale would
give Coca-Cola control of too much of the soft-drink market in
France. The ruling by the Council of State in Paris means the
company can continue to negotiate a compromise with the government.
However, industry experts said the ruling, which came shortly after
10 p.m. Paris time and just after markets had closed in the United
States, does not help Coca-Cola's case.
</P>
<P>
   While Coca-Cola officials sought to put a positive spin on the
decision, it was clearly a setback for the company, which sees
global expansion as critical to earnings growth. It was the second
ruling against Coke's strategy of buying popular international
brands in two days.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Australian regulators rejected the company's plan
to buy brands now owned by Cadbury Schweppes PLC, although
negotiations are continuing on another proposal put forth by
Coca-Cola and Cadbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we are disappointed with the decision, we remain
satisfied that our legal position was heard and taken seriously,''
said Mark Preisinger, a Coca-Cola spokesman. ``We will continue our
discussions with the French authorities and remain hopeful that the
deal will be approved.''
</P>
<P>
   The setbacks are particularly disappointing for Coca-Cola
shareholders. Many analysts have said the company's acquisition of
brands like Orangina and the Cadbury Schweppes line would boost
sales volume by about 600 million cases a year, and with sales of
Coke products falling off or flattening in many countries around
the world, the company needs that kind of help to improve its
bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly not good news for Coke,'' said Jennifer
Solomon, a beverage analyst for Salomon Smith Barney. But she added
that she did not think the ruling would hurt the company's stock
price.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, Coca-Cola announced that it would buy
Orangina, a highly popular orange-flavored drink owned by Pernod
Ricard SA, for $844 million. The move was the first major
acquisition by the company after its chairman and chief executive,
M. Douglas Ivester, took over the top job following Roberto C.
Goizueta's death two months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But France's competition council rejected the deal in September,
saying that it would give Coca-Cola too much of the soft-drink
market, particularly in what is known as on-premise sales, or sales
in restaurants and cafes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a shame,'' Ms. Solomon said of Friday's ruling.
``It's a great product, and it needs a better distributor. Coke
could do a lot with that brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Solomon suggested that French distrust of American influence
may have contributed to the decision. ``The French have very mixed
feelings about the influx of Americana,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In December, Coca-Cola announced that it would buy nearly all
the international brands owned by Cadbury Schweppes, including Dr
Pepper, Schweppes and Canada Dry. The $1.85 billion deal was
expected to face regulatory scrutiny, but the decision by
Australian trade officials is considered another disappointment for
Coca-Cola. In addition, reports have been circulating that
officials in Mexico, Germany and Spain are questioning the deal. In
all those countries, Preisinger said, rulings that reject the deal
would probably be ``negotiable and appealable.''
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Goldman, a global consumer products analyst for Merrill
Lynch, suggested that Pernod Ricard might next offer Orangina to
Pepsico, Coke's biggest rival. ``Were Pepsi to acquire Orangina,
this would double Pepsi's market share in France,'' Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   Pernod Ricard, whose holdings include wine, liqueurs, whisky and
fruit products, wants to sell Orangina in order to concentrate on
its other businesses.

<P>
   Can Great White really do for printer paper what Frank Perdue
did for chicken? Can Xerox persuade consumers that a paper by any
other name would not print as sweet? Does the public believe that
one company's sheet of white stuff is all that different from
another's?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the answers are yes, yes and yes. ``Consumers are
not as sophisticated as corporations when it comes to paper, and
branding is what they rely on most,'' said David Rocheleau, a
director of the Supplies Advisory Service at Lyra Research, a
market analysis firm in Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the consumer paper market, once a quiet backwater,
is now burning with high-wattage advertising and branding
campaigns. Forest products companies long accustomed to
business-to-business marketing have had to learn all about in-store
promotions, flashy package design, even the economics of national
television campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in this industry's history, you're seeing
office papers on TV,'' said Michael Winters, a national sales
manager for Georgia-Pacific Corp., which will be eclipsed as the
country's largest cut-paper producer at the end of this month when
International Paper and Union Camp complete their merger.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see the retail market's allure. These days, even
the cheapest new printers can produce attractive greeting cards,
brochures, presentations and photographs _ but not on
plain-vanilla, penny-a-sheet paper. The fancy coated papers that
give the best results can retail for as much as $1.50 a sheet;
paper makers' margins on such sheets are a guarded industry secret,
but they are certainly higher than those on the copier paper that
corporations buy by the palletful. High margins and quality
distinctions are the classic recipe for a market ripe for building
brand names, even on commodity products.
</P>
<P>
   The prices for the high-end papers are not scaring consumers.
According to Lyra Research, the overall market for cut paper is
growing at an annual rate of only 3.8 percent. But sales are
climbing 11.1 percent a year in the SOHO market _ the initials
stand for small office-home office, but marketers often use the
term for all sales to consumers and small businesses. And branded
papers are selling best.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the retail arena, brand identity is what separates the
survivors from the losers,'' said Jack Plomgren, president of Union
Camp Corp.'s Great White Consumer Products Group, which makes Great
White papers.
</P>
<P>
   The printer companies, engaged in fierce competition themselves,
have also caught on to the trend. Companies like Xerox and
Hewlett-Packard welcome any chance to plunk their names in a
consumer's sight line _ particularly if they can profit along the
way. So they, too, are peppering the shelves at Office Depot,
Staples and other stores with branded specialty papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Xerox-branded paper enhances awareness of our overall brand,''
said James Lesco, president of Xerox's supplies group. He said
Xerox's paper sales to the SOHO market grew 35 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   The printer companies haven't bought or built paper mills; the
paper they sell is made for them by the same paper companies whose
branded products compete with theirs in the stores. But the printer
companies say their offerings still have an advantage: Because
their hardware, ink, toner and paper specialists are on the same
product development teams, they say, paper manufactured to their
specifications, and bearing their name, will give the best results
on their printers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other companies can only guess at what our ink formulation is
going to be,'' said Susan Schindelar, marketing manager for
Hewlett-Packard's Inkjet Media division, who added that paper ``is
definitely growing in importance to our top and bottom lines.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also growing more visible in stores, where competition has
transformed the once-staid printer-paper aisles. Gone are the days
when white paper came wrapped in white paper; most companies now
use splashy colors to catch the eye. And several pack their
highest-quality paper in clear shrink wrap to show off its
brightness.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the packaging choices are haphazard. Georgia-Pacific's
new line of Microprint photographic-quality printer paper comes in
a bright yellow package because ``packaging consultants said bright
yellow would be associated with Kodak yellow, and that would give
us great brand awareness,'' Winters said.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, research showed that men bought most home-office
supplies, so Great White tried to appeal to its customers' macho
side with a package that bore a shark baring a mouthful of sharp
teeth. But now that women are buying close to half of all office
supplies, Great White has made its shark much less ferocious.
``We've softened the teeth, and we're focusing on the fin,''
Plomgren said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the brand names chosen willy-nilly. Indeed, many
companies shove aside corporate egos and venerable trademarks when
they believe a fresh new name would do better with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific, which until recently put its corporate name on
all of its consumer papers, chose the name Microprint for its most
expensive coated papers ``because we wanted a brand name with a
high-tech sound to it,'' Winters said.
</P>
<P>
   Great White, itself a nom de papier for a company few consumers
know, decided that even detoothed sharks might not appeal to
children, so it licensed the Crayola name for new, brightly colored
papers for party banners, stickers and T-shirt transfers.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard has made perhaps the ultimate ego sacrifice:
it's sharing the logo glory with others. Its photo-quality paper
packaging trumpets that it is made for Hewlett by Eastman Kodak,
and its new line of restickable paper shares branding with Post-It
notes. ``In photography, we knew that Kodak's name would enhance
the appeal, and most everyone knows what a Post-It note is,'' Ms.
Schindelar said.
</P>
<P>
   International Paper, meanwhile, is ruefully recognizing that its
Hammermill brand, long associated with classy writing paper, is not
sending the right message for more fanciful uses. So, while it
still markets printer paper as Hammermill, that name does not
appear on Jetprint Photo papers, Invent-It greeting-card paper, or
other products meant more for fun than work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to appeal directly to the consumer's playful side,''
said Kenneth Krieg, the company's business manager for office
papers, ``but we don't want to water down the Hammermill name.''

VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT IS TRANSFORMING HIS COUNTRY'S POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ To the adoring, impoverished masses who
catapulted him to power, Hugo Chavez Frias is El Comandante, their
protector and benefactor, the bold leader who will wipe out 40
years of inequality and corruption and redirect this country's
enormous oil wealth to better their lives.
</P>
<P>
   To his opponents, the 44-year-old former army paratrooper who is
Venezuela's new president represents something unsettling, even
dangerous. With his talk of ``revolution,'' his contempt for
institutions he calls decadent and his violent coup attempt seven
years ago, he strikes many of them as an autocrat in the making.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is still out on Chavez, who took office on Feb. 2 while
riding a wave of popular disgust with a political system seen as
venal and unresponsive. But whether he turns out to be democrat or
dictator, his charisma and his vows to overturn the prevailing
order have already transformed politics in this country of 23
million people.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to divine Chavez's ultimate intentions from a flood of
contradictory public pronouncements has become a popular pastime
here, leading to the publication of several new books with titles
like ``Chavez the Wizard of Emotions: Psychosocial Analysis of a
Political Phenomenon.'' But ask Chavez, and he classifies himself
as a postmodernist politician, bound by none of the ``Cartesian''
limitations of established ideologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you try to assess me by traditional canons of analysis,
you'll never emerge from confusion,'' he said in an interview in
his office at the same presidential palace he attacked in 1992.
``If you are attempting to determine whether Chavez is of the left,
right or center, if he is a socialist, communist or capitalist,
well, I am none of those, but I have a bit of all of those.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's minister of finance, Maritza Izaguirre Porras,
describes the president, who has never held public office before,
as a pragmatist going through ``a process of apprenticeship.''
Dealing with the budget, for instance, he was eager to learn even
the most arcane details of state spending, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's critics argue that Venezuela, the largest
supplier of crude oil to the United States in recent years, is
mired in a crisis so severe that it cannot afford the luxury of
giving him on-the-job training. Inflation and unemployment are near
all-time highs, oil prices slumped to their lowest level in years
just as Chavez was taking office, and the Venezuelan economy is
expected to contract this year for the second year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with the situation, Chavez demanded from Congress, and
received late in March, the power to rule by decree for the next
six months. But the main, and most controversial, plank of his
campaign platform was a pledge to convene a constituent assembly to
do away with the country's ``moribund'' constitution and draw up a
new one. A referendum on that proposal is scheduled for April 25.
</P>
<P>
   (On April 8, Chavez rejected the ``enabling law'' that Congress
had approved, saying it did not go far enough. He threatened to
impose a state of national emergency, which would allow him to
suspend constitutional guarantees and to rule by decree.)
</P>
<P>
   As envisioned by Chavez and his Fifth Republic Movement, the new
constitution would grant him expanded powers and allow him to run
for a second consecutive term, instead of waiting 10 years as
currently required. That has led his critics to charge that he
plans to make himself a caudillo, or classic Latin American
military strongman in the mold of Juan Peron, Fidel Castro or Omar
Torrijos, an accusation that Chavez ridicules.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were going to be a tyrant, I would already have carried
out a coup d'etat,'' he said dismissively. ``How am I going to be a
caudillo when I am subject to the rules of a system?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet fears that Chavez plans to ignore the restraints of
traditional politics were fanned in mid-March, after he said that
he and his supporters would ``take to the streets'' if the Supreme
Court did not allow him to organize the constituent assembly as he
wanted. But when the court ruled against him, Chavez accepted the
decision and is now trying to make his decree conform to the court
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger is that Chavez could come to believe himself that
his relation with the people is like that of a strongman with the
masses, like that of Il Duce, Der Fuhrer, El Comandante or the
secretary-general of the party,'' said Teodoro Petkoff, a former
guerrilla leader and a former minister of planning. ``This kind of
primitive conception, which disdains and demonizes political
parties or any other intermediary between the population and those
in power, could develop from this singular relationship he has
created with a good part of the poor population of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, though, ``Chavez has acted as a restraining wall to
those around him who have authoritarian impulses, whether they are
military men or from the old left,'' Petkoff continued. ``I think
he is finding he has the temperament and a taste for the political
game and that he is learning it quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's hand has clearly been strengthened by the disrepute
that clings to the political parties that have governed Venezuela
since the collapse of a military dictatorship in 1958. As ordinary
Venezuelans see it, poll after poll has indicated, the country's
political elite has either squandered or pocketed billions of
dollars of oil revenues that should have been used to make the
country and its people rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chavez's origins are those of the avenger, the instrument the
Venezuelan people use to debit the account of the political class
that has dominated this country for 40 years,'' said Alcibiades
Castro, leader of the congressional delegation of Copei, the more
conservative of the country's two traditional parties.
``Notwithstanding the election, not everyone in the parties is
fully aware of this, and so our very identities and viability are
at stake here.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Traditional politicians may wince at the frankness of some of
Chavez's more colorful or incendiary observations, but most people
appear to like what they hear. He was elected with 57 percent of
the vote, but recent polls indicate that his support has soared
since taking office.
</P>
<P>
   Several gestures intended to demonstrate that the country is in
crisis have been particularly well received: Chavez has refused to
accept his $1,200 a month official salary, donating it to a
scholarship fund and saying he can live well enough on his military
pension, and he has also dispensed with use of a limousine and
other traditional perquisites of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chavez is of the people, with humble origins,'' said Eduardo
Beltran, 29, a security guard at a downtown building. ``When have
you ever seen a president of this country stop his limousine to get
out and talk to the poor? He is a second Bolivar, just the
president Venezuela needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Chavez's humble start as the child of two schoolteachers
is one of his strongest selling points. Eustoquio Duque Castro, a
retired military officer, was stationed in Chavez's hometown,
Sabaneta, when the president was a boy, and remembered him selling
fruit and ices outside the barracks after school every afternoon
before running off to baseball practice.
</P>
<P>
   A left-handed pitcher, Chavez ``could do it all, hit, field, run
and pitch, but couldn't afford the equipment he needed,'' Duque
remembered. As a teen-ager, Chavez was such a standout that the
army recruited him for its team. But an arm injury sidelined him
and ended his dreams of a big-league career. It also, as he
recalled in an autobiography published after the 1992 coup attempt,
led to an intense period of reading and study of political
doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought he could be president, but I voted for him,
and I don't regret it,'' Duque, 66, said. ``I have faith in him.
With a young president who wants to work hard, the country is
already more animated and disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   After a rocky start caused by his populist declarations and
flirtation with Fidel Castro, his relations with Washington also
have improved. Chavez was for many years denied a visa to the
United States because of the 1992 coup attempt, but that ban was
lifted after his resounding election victory. He has already
visited Washington twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are behind him so long as he remains within constitutional
parameters for reforming the country,'' Peter Romero, the assistant
secretary of state for inter-American affairs, said on a recent
visit here.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said he was acutely aware that his every word and action
was being dissected here and in the rest of Latin America, where he
is seen as an alarming throwback to the age of the strongman. But
he said he welcomed the scrutiny, and invited skeptics to ``analyze
with objectivity the truth of what is taking place here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to know where we are going, then let them watch
us, with satellites or lenses, from near or from far, and observe
our tracks,'' he said. ``We are heading toward the light, toward
the open horizon, gradually building a true democracy, and not
towards the darkness of the jungle.''

NEW MEDICINE (Tucson, Ariz.) - A historic debate on new medicine
versus old medicine is being debated Friday night at the University
of Arizona medical school. Dr. Andrew Weil, who is on the cutting
edge of what is new in alternative medicine, is debating Dr. Arnold
Relman, editor and chief emeritus of the New England School of
Medicine who is squarely from the old school of medicine. Relman
recently wrote a scathing article criticizing Weil. This debate may
be repeated at Stanford University at a later date. By MAUREEN
WEST. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
GARNISH-FOOD (Phoenix) - How to dress up everyd ay meals and plates
as well as special occasion dinners. Story includes step-by-step
instructions for eight garnish concepts. With PHOTOS moved Thursday
and GARNISHTOOLS-FOOD and GARNISHBOOKS-FOOD. By ANITA MABANTE
LEACH. Stories moved in the ``D'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CRYSTALGAYLE-MUSIC (Phoenix) - If you're over the age of 25, there
are some things you probably know about Crystal Gayle: She's got a
ton of country hits, a beautiful voice, a famous sister (Loretta
Lynn) and some absurdly long hair that she could sweep the floor
with if she wished. But who knew she hated Velcro? By RANDY
CORDOVA. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BOCELLI-MUSIC Andrea Bocelli is blessed with a very distinctive
form of popularity. That is, people either seem to fall at his feet
in worship or hate the ground he walks on. For example, the
40-year-old tenor so far has sold more than 14 million albums. His
fourth disc, a collection of Italian pop epics dubbed ``Sogno,''
was released last week. He has almost sold out America West Arena
for his first Phoenix appearance; even a $500 ticket price didn't
seem to deter hungry fans. His accessible style has brought people
to opera who normally would shy away from the mere concept. By
RANDY CORDOVA and KENNETH LAFAVE. Story moved in the ``E''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BILLYJOEL-MUSIC (Phoenix) - Billy Joel has had so many hits over
such a long period of time, it's difficult to imagine the pop-music
landscape without him. Yet that's exactly what may happen after his
current ``Greatest Hits'' tour wraps up. ``I'm not going to say
this is the end of something,'' Joel said last year in an interview
with CNN. ``But I don't think I'm going to do any more long tours
after this tour.'' By RANDY CORDOVA. Story moved in the ``E''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
AUTO-REVIEW (Pheonxi) - Chevy's full-size, two-door sport-utility
vehicle, beloved for three decades by hunters, campers and cruising
teenagers, goes the way of the dodo after this year.
</P>
<P>
   The two-door Chevy Tahoe, formerly called the Chevy Blazer
before that name was downsized to a compact, is a big, brawny
heavyweight based on the Chevy half-ton pickup with a shortened
wheelbase, two rows of seats and a utility body. Its compromises as
a large, somewhat ungainly two-door utility truck made it a niche
vehicle, overshadowed in recent years by the four-door sport utes
that are popping up everywhere. By BOB GOLFEN. Story moved in the

DONALD SAVAGE, PALEONTOLOGIST WHO TRACKED EVOLUTION OF APES, DIES
AT 81  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Texas, Iowa, Okla., Ore.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Donald Elvin Savage, a paleontologist who tracked the
evolution of the earliest anthropoid apes, died Monday at a hospice
in Rossmoor, Calif. He was 81 and had recently moved there from his
home in nearby Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his work focused on linking mammalian fossils to
specific geologic formations, a field known as biostratigraphy.
</P>
<P>
   Correlating a find at a dig with fossils from other areas
accurately dated by geologists was the principal way of
establishing the age of fossils before radioisotope dating became
more available and reliable. But even now the correlation method is
the most reliable way of dating fossils under certain
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Savage spent much of his career as a professor of paleontology
at the University of California at Berkeley, becoming a full
professor in 1962. He was department chairman from 1966 until 1975
and was in charge of the campus' Museum of Paleontology from 1967
to 1971.
</P>
<P>
   He traveled the world looking for mammalian fossils,
concentrating at various times on horses, rhinoceroses and early
apes. The result was a compendium of mammals through the ages,
``Mammalian Paleofaunas of the World'' (Addison-Wesley, 1983).
</P>
<P>
   The book, written with Donald E. Russell, remains in print. At
the time of his death, Savage was completing a second volume on
paleofaunas in collaboration with J. Howard Hutchison, another
retired Berkeley paleontologist.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Dr. Russell Ciochon and a team of Burmese
scientists in 1978, Savage found a primate jaw in Burma that is
still one of the oldest known fossils of higher primates. It was
dated at 40 million to 44 million years old, from the Eocene.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fossil was the earliest step toward humans,'' said
Ciochon, now chairman of anthropology at the University of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Elvin Savage was born in Floydada, Texas, and graduated
from West Texas State College in 1937. He earned a masters degree
at the University of Oklahoma in 1939 and then spent six years in
the Army Air Forces, rising to the rank of major.
</P>
<P>
   He came to Berkeley as a graduate student and instructor in
paleontology in 1946 and received his doctorate three years later,
when he joined the faculty. He formally retired in 1987 but
continued to work in his laboratory as a professor emeritus for 10
more years.
</P>
<P>
   As acting director and director of the Museum of Paleontology,
he oversaw the expansion of its collections and helped make it one
of the largest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Savage is survived by his wife, Than Myint Savage; five
children from an earlier marriage, Suzanne Savage of Oakland,
Calif., Sheryl Long of Gainesville, Fla., Brandon, of San Luis
Obispo, Calif., Michael, of Santa Monica, Calif., and Stephanie
Edsell of Eugene, Ore.; and 23 grandchildren.

DIGITAL CAMERAS, EQUIPMENT ARE CHANGING FILMMAKING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use Sunday, April 11 by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Whether dodging Chinese security agents in Tibet,
following a hyperkinetic New York tour guide or catching San
Francisco junkies shooting up, inexpensive and unobtrusive digital
video cameras are changing the way documentarians and independent
filmmakers are doing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   And soon enough, the burgeoning digital revolution will
transform everything else in the moviemaking business, whether it's
the shooting of the second ``Star Wars'' prequel, editing virtually
any film, tweaking it in post-production, even distributing it to
audiences and projecting it in a theater.
</P>
<P>
   But where this revolution's first shots are being heard is in
the low end, where relatively cheap cameras and computer-based
editing systems are giving no- and low-budget filmmakers powerful
new tools to create their projects with verve and imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some people, it allows them to control every aspect of
their film,'' said Jonathan Wells, editor of Res magazine, which
focuses on the digital filmmaking explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Take Bennett Miller, who followed the offbeat tour guide Timothy
``Speed'' Levitch around New York in ``The Cruise.'' Using a tiny
digital video camera, he said he could get up close with Levitch in
ways never possible with the large crew needed to support a
film-based camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good DV (digital video) subject,'' Miller said.
``Because to do an intimate portrait where you want to peel back
the layers and get to the bottom of them, it's a lot more effective
to do that without the spectacle of a film crew. I would say
digital video was perfect for me, and perfect for that film.''
</P>
<P>
   The decent-quality pictures that Paul Wagner could get even from
a low-end digital camera made it possible for him to fool watchful
Chinese security agents while shooting exterior scenes in Lhasa,
Tibet's central square for the fictional film ``Windhorse.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite tight Chinese control over the subjugated country,
Wagner said the small digital camera he used ``allowed us to pose
as tourists (while shooting scenes). It is a tourist camera, but
it's of sufficient quality that it could (create footage good
enough to) be blown up to 35mm film.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Steve Okazaki, who spent more than two years
following young heroin addicts around the streets and flops of San
Francisco for ``Black Tar Heroin: The Dark End of the Street,''
which airs this week on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after he began following the junkies, Okazaki switched from
a traditional film camera and five-person crew to a small digital
camera handled by one other person.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just changes the whole way of doing documentaries,'' said
Okazaki, whose ``Days of Waiting'' won a 1991 Academy Award. ``I'd
guess we'd have a third or half the access we had if we had used
standard equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   And unlike traditional film cameras and editing systems, these
are cheap enough that people can own their own systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the cost of having a car _ not even that expensive a car,
for around $12,000 _ an independent filmmaker can purchase a
camera, get a computer with Firewire (high-speed connectors) and
buy the software to make their own movies,'' said Maija Beeton, the
advanced technology program director at the American Film
Institute. ``That's why this whole thing has been described as a
revolution, because of the ability to do it all in one place.''
</P>
<P>
   The digital revolution is hitting biggest right now in film
festivals such as Sundance, where Thomas Vinterberg's digitally
shot and edited feature ``The Celebration'' and Miller's ``The
Cruise'' were the talk of the show, said Robert Faust, director of
the Los Angeles Independent Film Festival, which starts this week.
</P>
<P>
   The L.A. festival is holding panels on digital filmmaking next
Sunday that will feature Wells, Miller and others, Faust said. In
the future, he also anticipates his festival will be showing plenty
of digital-only movies, using digital projectors in converted
theaters, because the economics and flexibility are so compelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were making $50,000 features,'' Faust said. ``Now
people can run into the Good Guys, (buy a $4,000 camera) and return
it in 20 days and pay only a restocking charge. On the one hand,
it's great and people can experiment without spending $200,000.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it also means anyone can make a movie, even
people who probably shouldn't, Faust said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be difficult for festivals because everyone will
be running around thinking they're a filmmaker,'' Faust said.
``Once that floodgate opens up, people are going to be shooting
their mother going about her day and trying to create a narrative
from that and submitting it to festivals.''
</P>
<P>
   The digital revolution has been a long time in coming. The first
digital tweaking of a film frame happened two decades ago, Beeton
said. It's just that now, virtually anyone can do it for a
relatively small investment.
</P>
<P>
   And you can do it extraordinarily well if you start using some
of the more expensive high-end digital systems, using formats such
as DVCAM, Digital Betacam or even high-definition video.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, high-end digital's advantages are substantial enough
that George Lucas said he will shoot the successor to ``Star Wars:
Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace'' entirely in digital. As it is, he
said, 95 percent of Episode 1 was digitally shot, processed and
tweaked before being converted to film.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Trumbull, best-known for his groundbreaking
special-effects work on ``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' has spent the
past two years creating new digital tools so he can inexpensively
make sophisticated special-effects movies literally in his own
Massachusetts backyard studio.
</P>
<P>
   If his system proves successful, filmmakers will be able to drop
live actors into digitally created backdrops in so-called real time
_ as filming is happening, instead of weeks later during a
laborious post-production process, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm trying to do now is take a look at whether it's
feasible to change the process of making low-budget films in my own
studio and still not compromise my work,'' said Trumbull, who
directed ``Brainstorm'' and ``Silent Running.''
</P>
<P>
   Other filmmakers continue to look down on digital video as
inferior to film. That's not surprising, said John Colette, head of
technology at the Australian Film, TV and Radio School in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've had a history of prejudice against digital video
because of the association with television,'' said Colette, in town
this weekend for a UCLA conference on digital tech's implications
for teaching film students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the last media type (to face the digital revolution),
because it's so data intensive,'' Colette said. ``But you got the
same arguments all along the way: `Why do you need the word
processor?' `Oh, compact discs will never sound as good as vinyl.'
''
</P>
<P>
   The prejudices will ease, Colette said, as the technology
improves. Right now, however, digital still has some downsides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The highest resolution and most sustainable high-res format is
still film,'' Beeton said. ``As far as capturing data, DV still not
at the level of 35mm film. There's a lot of hype around that, and
that should be pointed out.''
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake, digital video is getting very good.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's High Definition Data Center in Culver City, where digital
edits are converted into 35mm film on multimillion-dollar
electron-beam recorders, makes visitors try to figure out which of
two strips of film was shot digitally and converted, and which was
originally shot on film. It's virtually indistinguishable.
</P>
<P>
   Converting a digital video product to 35mm film soon won't even
be necessary, as several digital-only distribution alternatives are
nearly viable.
</P>
<P>
   The cheapest option for filmmakers will be distributing through
the Internet, where people such as digital filmmaker Dan Clark of
Hollywood believe dozens of sites will offer niche programming
featuring very specialized kinds of films. First, however, more
homes need high-speed connections to new digital TVs.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is DVD _ players are already connected to
millions of American TVs and computers.
</P>
<P>
   And in the next couple of years, theaters will start using
digital projectors, such as those by CineComm Digital Cinema.
</P>
<P>
   CineComm's system beams a digital film by satellite to a
specially converted theater, which stores the movie's information
on its computer hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   With a few clicks, the movie then plays on a digital projector,
looking just as the movie's creator saw it while taping and editing
it. Just as important, it doesn't undergo the physical wear and
tear that quickly degrades the quality of traditional film prints,
said CineComm Chairman and CEO Michael B. Targoff at a recent
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to show this is not hype,'' Targoff said. ``The
image you see is every bit as good as the first week of a clean
print.''
</P>
<P>
   And other than some slightly lower contrast in one side-by-side
comparison, he was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a filmhead and care about cinema, we are all sitting
at the edge of another revolution,'' said Clark, whose digital film
``The Item'' will be screened April 19 at UCLA. ``It's like being
in film when talkies kicked in. It's exciting across the board,
because the playing field has changed radically.'' &QL;

MICHAEL MOORE PICKS UP WHERE HE LEFT OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At his best, Michael Moore is Everyman.
</P>
<P>
   The unkempt, chubby, baseball cap-wearing gadfly who shot to
fame with ``Roger &AMP; Me'' has a remarkable gift for articulating the
greatest frustration of average Joes who lack connections and
resources: just getting their voices heard.
</P>
<P>
   It is only when he strays outside this role that he stumbles.
His fictional film ``Canadian Bacon,'' for example, was a one-note
disappointment, coming after the brilliant ``Roger.'' It's no
different with Moore's new half-hour TV series, ``The Awful
Truth,'' premiering Sunday on cable's Bravo network.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's last TV series, ``TV Nation,'' was similarly uneven. The
show was canceled after bouncing from NBC to Fox several years ago.
It would be nice to see Moore find his niche at the lower-rated but
perhaps more laissez-faire Bravo, which is trying to launch an
identity through original programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truth'' is split into two segments, which Moore introduces
from a stage in front of an enthusiastic audience. The first of
Sunday's segments is a silly and dated political prank titled ``A
Cheaper Way to Conduct a Witch Hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   As a protest against Kenneth Starr's investigation of President
Clinton, Moore leads a group of actors dressed as ``Puritans'' in
an assault on Washington. Moore collars a few Republicans,
including Asa Hutchinson, to harangue about Starr's ``witch hunt,''
while the actors flail around and cry out things like ``Shame!''
</P>
<P>
   The segment falls flat because it is dated and ham-handed. It's
obvious where Moore's sympathies lie, and equally obvious that he's
preaching to the converted. In introducing the piece, Moore gloats,
``We got to watch the Republican Party go down in flames.'' His
acolytes in the audience greet the statement with wild applause.
When he tacks on, ``I hope some of the Democrats aren't far
behind,'' the audience barely responds.
</P>
<P>
   The show's second segment, though, is classic Moore. He seeks _
and ultimately appears to get _ justice for a 34-year-old diabetic
man named Chris who's been denied a pancreas transplant by his HMO.
Chris' doctor has told him that, without the operation, he will
soon die.
</P>
<P>
   Moore accompanies Chris on a very dark journey, watching him
dictate his own obituary to a newspaper and accompanying him as he
shops for caskets. Then, as he did in ``Roger,'' Moore takes the
issue to the top: He gets a meeting for himself and Chris with a
vice president of the HMO, Humana.
</P>
<P>
   As they wait in a meeting room, Moore and Chris are approached
by Humana's head of public relations. The flak tells them the veep
has been ``delayed,'' and won't be able to meet with them today.
</P>
<P>
   The PR man squirms as Moore tries to corner him on the facts of
Chris' case and goad him by asking his opinion of which casket
Chris should buy. The PR man finally gets the two to leave the
building, though not before Chris removes his T-shirt _ which reads
``I signed with Humana and all I got was this lousy T-shirt ... but
no pancreas'' _ and gives it to the hapless company tool.
</P>
<P>
   After all this, plus staging a mock funeral later in front of
Humana's offices, we're told in Moore's epilogue that Humana agreed
shortly thereafter to cover Chris' pancreas transplant. When Chris,
in the audience and looking much healthier, stands up, pumps his
fists and throws a big kiss to Moore, it's a genuinely triumphant
moment. If Moore can come up with more moments like these, he and
Bravo will have a hit.

 &HT;    Airlines hike fares, cite high demand
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Big airlines moved Friday to raise fares for the third
time this year, emboldened by sky-high demand for seats and fearing
a rebound in fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   The move boosted airline stocks, even though the increase could
crumble this weekend if all major carriers don't go along.
</P>
<P>
   Continental initiated the hike, which raises advance-purchase
fares 3 percent and unrestricted fares 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Delta, United and America West matched Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision is based on the enormous demand we have seen for
our product,'' Delta spokesman John Kennedy said. Industrywide,
traffic rose 4.9 percent in March against a 3.6 percent gain in
seat capacity.
</P>
<P>
   It probably won't be clear until Monday whether all major
carriers go along with the fare increase. If they don't, the
increase will likely be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Rising crude oil prices could bring an end to low fuel costs
that boosted airline profits in 1998. It remains to be seen,
however, how high prices will rise, and big airlines have long-term
buying programs that cushion any immediate impact.
</P>
<P>
   The previous two fare hikes of 1999 raised business-type fares 3
percent, and leisure-type fares 7 percent. The increases came after
18 months of fare stability from mid-1997 through 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest and US Airways did not immediately raise fares.
Northwest's reluctance to raise fares last year thwarted attempts
to implement increases in 1998, but the Minneapolis-based airline
has participated in the two fare hikes so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a weekly fare newsletter, BT Alex Brown Inc. said the average
business fare this week was up 6 percent over the same period last
year.

ECONOMIC VIEW: A DOCTORATE TOO DRY FOR ITS OWN GOOD? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 11)  
 (bl)  
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Depression inspired thousands of young people to become
economists. The War on Poverty and the Great Society in the 1960s
were similarly inspiring, and the upheavals today should be, too.
What more noble work, after all, than coming to understand, and
perhaps alleviate, the wage stagnation, the global pressures, the
layoffs, the job insecurities and the long working days that weigh
on so many people.
</P>
<P>
   But, in fact, fewer and fewer Americans are entering graduate
programs and seeking careers in economics.
</P>
<P>
   The Depression made a hero of John Maynard Keynes, the British
economist whose prescriptions for reviving the economy _ and
softening capitalism _ seemed so promising and insightful, even
romantic. And out of the crowded graduate schools of that era came
future giants like Paul Samuelson, Milton Friedman, James Tobin and
John Kenneth Galbraith. They are all in their 80s and 90s now, and
no longer the role models they were in their heyday.
</P>
<P>
   Who are today's heroes? Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve
chairman so often given credit for the current prosperity, is one.
So are Lawrence H. Summers, the combative deputy Treasury secretary
and former Harvard whiz, and Paul Krugman, the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology professor whose fame comes as much from his
vivid, prolific writing in newspapers and magazines as it does from
his economics. But somehow, they aren't Pied Pipers.
</P>
<P>
   Is it them or the times? Could Keynes do any better if he were
resurrected today? Or Adam Smith, who was a popular lecturer and
teacher with a wide following? Probably not. The profession is so
changed.
</P>
<P>
   The Ph.D. program in economics today, combining a master's
degree and a doctorate, calls for five to seven years of hard,
technical work, harder perhaps than medical school. For bright
young people, higher wages with much less study can be had in
management, or consulting, or law, or on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a son who went to work right out of Harvard as a
currency trader,'' said Angus S. Deaton, a Princeton economist and
a mentor in his profession.
</P>
<P>
   High wages, of course, would not divert a young idealist seeking
to help the world through economics. But the graduate school
training in economics, with its heavy emphasis on mathematics and
mathematical modeling of abstract situations, does not relate
easily to the issues of the day. The idealist, in sum, is too often
put off.
</P>
<P>
   A commission of august economists recognized this shortcoming in
a 1991 report. It recommended more attention to ``real-world
linkages'' _ a bit of advice that graduate schools have so far
largely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something about the nature of economics training that
is driving off the student,'' said economics historian Mark Blaug
in a recent interview. ``The training is technically demanding but
does not seem to be related to anything out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The shortage of trained economists is still unfolding. More than
1,000 Ph.D.'s in economics are now granted annually in the United
States, a 17 percent increase from 1986. But that is because, until
recently, foreign students enrolled in large-enough numbers to more
than offset the American decline. No longer: The number of new
doctorates will begin to slip next year or the year after, because
new enrollment in graduate programs has been falling since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   And this despite the fact that economists are well paid in their
first posts relative to other Ph.D's. The median starting salary
was close to $75,000 for economics Ph.D.'s who took private-sector
jobs last year, here and abroad, and roughly $50,000 for those who
took academic posts, mainly as assistant professors. Only engineers
are in the same ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   These findings are laid out in a soon-to-be published article in
the Journal of Economic Perspectives. The authors, John J.
Siegfried of Vanderbilt University and Wendy Stock of Kansas State
University, surveyed new Ph.D.'s at 91 universities.
</P>
<P>
   But for economists who take private-sector jobs, money isn't
everything. The typical graduate, 32 and married, spent 6.8 years
in graduate school, only to land in a job that often underutilizes
those hard-won skills. ``They get paid a lot more than in academia,
but they are grumpy,'' Siegfried said.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, who now make up less than 45 percent of each year's
graduating class, find the going tougher than foreign students do.
The latter often have better preparation in the all-important math,
and the prestige of an American doctorate opens all sorts of doors
for them back home. The Americans find their training useful mainly
in teaching and research, and academia has cut the number of these
jobs that lead to tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who 20 years ago might have chosen economics are now
choosing law,'' said George Akerlof, an academic economist and a
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ``One reason they are
doing this: Economics has become a lot harder.''
</P>
<P>
   But in that direction might lie a solution, or a partial one.
Economics, practical, nonmathematical economics, is increasingly
practiced by lawyers and by people trained at graduate business
schools or at public policy institutes _ training that belongs in
the graduate schools that ``license'' economists.

 &HT;    BellSouth saying `aloha' to wireless unit in Hawaii
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth is selling its wireless operations in
Honolulu to AT&AMP;T, the companies announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side would say how much the deal is worth. Bloomberg
News, citing a source familiar with the transaction, said AT&AMP;T
spent about $160 million for Honolulu Cellular.
</P>
<P>
   The number of subscribers for the Honolulu service was not
disclosed. Honolulu Cellular Telephone sells wireless services in a
market with a population of about 900,000.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth acquired Honolulu Cellular in 1986. It became a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Atlanta-based company in 1996. The
transaction is expected to close in the second half this year. The
deal is subject to regulatory and government approval.
</P>
<P>
   The sale is not that unusual, said Jeff Battcher, a BellSouth
spokesman. BellSouth swapped wireless properties in Wisconsin and
Indiana for U.S. Cellular properties in Mississippi and Alabama in
1997. In June, BellSouth traded a wireless property in Bakersfield,
Calif., for AT&AMP;T's College Station, Texas, coverage area.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth now offers wireless service in 13 states, mostly in
the South. Its coverage area also includes Indiana, Northern
Virginia and parts of East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Battcher said BellSouth's goal is to focus on geographic areas
where it can provide a wide range of telecommunications products
billed on one statement, including wireless digital television,
pagers, wireless phones, traditional phone service and Internet
access. BellSouth offers those services in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   New York-based AT&AMP;T wants to provide national wireless coverage.
Shares of BellSouth were down 62 1/2 cents, closing at $43.75.
AT&AMP;T's stock was up $1.62 1/2. It closed at $85.50.

 &HT;    Coca-Cola loses round in French court battle
 &HT;    EDs: This replaces MEXICO-COKE.
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co. suffered its second international
setback in two days Friday when France's high court backed a
government decision blocking the company's purchase of the Orangina
drink from Pernod Ricard SA.
</P>
<P>
   The $822 million deal now hinges on whether the Atlanta-based
beverage company can satisfy the French government's antitrust
concerns, which it has not yet been able to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue our discussion with the French authorities
and remain hopeful the deal will be approved,'' said Coca-Cola
spokesman Mark Preisinger.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the court's decision could increase the
government's leverage in obtaining concessions from Coca-Cola
before approving a deal, which the government initially rejected
last September.
</P>
<P>
   But time may be running out.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ricard, chairman of Pernod, has said that he has set
anunspecified date for the sale to go through or he will seek
alternatives to the Coca-Cola deal.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Australian antitrust regulators rejected
Coca-Cola's purchase of the Cadbury Schweppes beverages in that
country. The companies hope that a revised deal, which is now being
discussed, will win regulatory approval there.
</P>
<P>
   In both countries, Coca-Cola's huge market share is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   In France, Pepsi complained immediately to the government after
Coca-Cola and Pernod Ricard announced the deal in December 1997.
Pepsi argued that it would essentially be shut out of the country
because Orangina bottles and distributes Pepsi brands sold at
cafes, hotels and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased with the court's decision to allow healthy
competition in this industry in France,'' Pepsi spokesman Dave
DeCecco said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola hopes to sell the orange-flavored drink in France and
other European markets, as well as in the United States. It also
hopes to use the Orangina distribution system to sell its other
brands.
</P>
<P>
   In Australia, antitrust regulators ruled that Coca-Cola's
purchase of Cadbury Schweppes brands would substantially reduce
competition there, pushing the company's share of the market to 75
percent, from 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, which plans to spend $1.85 billion to purchase
Cadbury brands in 120 countries, excluding the United States, South
Africa and France, also faces potential regulatory hurdles in about
10 nations, including Mexico and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock fell 12 1/2 cents Friday, closing at $60.75.
The decision by the French court was made public after the New York
market closed.

 &HT;    AT&AMP;T, Cox rework At Home deal
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cox Communications confirmed Friday it has
renegotiated a contract that could give the Atlanta-based cable
operator greater control of the high-speed Internet provider At
Home Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the new one-year contract, AT&AMP;T would grant Cox
Communications more stock in At Home if the telecommunications
giant failed to sign up a certain number of its cable TV
subscribers to the Silicon Valley startup's service. Neither AT&AMP;T
or Cox Communications would disclose that number.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the stock clause, it's not greater control of At Home
that Cox Communications is after. What it wants is to spur AT&AMP;T,
which owns a controlling stake in At Home, to sharply increase its
At Home subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want AT&AMP;T to pay us a penalty,'' says David Woodrow,
Cox Communications' senior vice president for broadband services.
``The value of At Home's stock is in the level of its
distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the greater the number of At Home's subscribers,
the higher its stock will go.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications presently owns 12.3 percent of At Home. AT&AMP;T
owns 71 percent and Comcast owns another 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications is the largest single distributor of At
Home's service. More than 67,000 of its 3.8 million subscribers use
it.
</P>
<P>
   At Home provides Internet access through a device called a cable
modem. It connects to the Internet at speeds up to 100 times faster
than traditional telephone lines. At Home also provides Internet
content to its subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   At Home requires a two-way digital cable network, which is
unavailable in most of the country. One reason Cox Communications
has been able to sell so many At Home subscriptions is most of its
system have been rebuilt to offer digital services such as
high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Not so for AT&AMP;T, which acquired its controlling stake in At Home
with the purchase earlier this year of cable TV operator
Tele-Communications Inc (TCI). TCI has been a laggard in rebuilding
its systems as a digital network.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications executives are betting the new contract will
be an incentive for AT&AMP;T to expedite the rebuilding of its cable TV
systems for digital traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications is controlled by Cox Enterprises, which also
owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

 &HT;    Brawny Blazer has golden touch
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Finally for 1999, Chevrolet has given its Blazer just
what every buyer has whined about needing ever since the popular
sport-utility was introduced in '83: gold-painted aluminum wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Who, after all, wants to go beating around the bush with plain
old wheels?
</P>
<P>
   To get the gold-trim wheels, though, it's necessary to opt for
the new-for-'99 TrailBlazer package. It also includes two-tone
embossed leather seats, monochromatic paint and _ this is
significant _ a touring suspension that really smooths out the ride
of the 3,700-pound sport-utility.
</P>
<P>
   The TrailBlazer carries a base price of $30,470 (plus $525
destination charge) for the four-door, two-wheel-drive version. The
base price for the not-TrailBlazer version two-door is $18,470;
buyers who want four-wheel drive can expect to add about $2,000 to
the cost on a four-door and about $3,000 on a two-door.
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be about two years before the Blazer gets a major
reworking, so the TrailBlazer package is Chevy's interim step at
catching up in the high-end of the sport-ute market, now featuring
entries from virtually all the upscale manufacturers. As Russ
Clark, Blazer brand manager says, ``Today's sport-utility owners
are not only buying the performance ... they're buying image.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance is there in the Blazer, thanks to the venerable
4.3-liter V-6 engine, which has the power for expressway travel and
enough grunt to go off-road or for towing. With 190 horsepower and
250 pounds-feet of torque, the test TrailBlazer moved out smartly
and never seemed underpowered or particularly slow to respond in
ordinary driving conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a better ride, the TrailBlazer has improved
brakes, a comforting factor in sprint-and-stop traffic. Its height
(64.3 inches) makes for nice forward and side visibility, but the
rear view is less than ideal because of limited visibility in the
inside mirror and the scope of the outside power mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   Partial atonement comes in the comfort department, with the
TrailBlazer sporting good front bucket seats, plenty of headroom
(39.6 inches up front) and a good supply of drink holders, power
outlets and storage spaces. The rear seating is adequate, although
it requires knees-up posture, and some occupants may be irked by
rear speakers mounted hip-high on the doors.
</P>
<P>
   Cargo space is good (about 37 cubic feet with the seats up,
about 74 with the rear folded). Access is easy through the side
doors and the rear hatch, which has an integral liftglass and a
glass-ajar warning light on the dash. Other niceties include the
automatic climate control, power equipment, an optional sunroof and
the simplicity of the instrumentation and controls.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy remains poor (16 and 21 mpg), but that's a given
with big-engined sport-utilities. But, as with others in its class,
the Blazer's evolution to carlike characteristics brings better
comfort and driveability despite trucklike handling. The
TrailBlazer package, gold wheels and all, is a solid step up for
Blazer in style and image, but, otherwise, the '99 isn't all that
different from its predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 1999 Chevrolet TrailBlazer four-door,
two-wheel-drive sport-utility vehicle
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $31,198 (includes discount not always
available; base price: $30,470)
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 4.3-liter V-6 engine (190 horsepower), four-speed
automatic overdrive transmission

   Ponder a perverse question: What public policies would pummel
the poor? Here is one answer: Impose a levy that falls more heavily
on them than on the rich, singling out a staple in the diet of poor
families and driving up its price.

   No one would seriously entertain such an idea _ no one, that is,

   Federal milk-pricing rules dating from the 1930s drive up the
price that consumers pay for milk, in effect taking money from
urban parents, among others, and handing it over to rural dairy
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say the rules stabilize milk prices, thereby assuring
reliable supplies across the country. But opponents say the system
is archaic, byzantine and unnecessary _ a giveaway to the dairy
farm lobby. And it's regressive: poor families spend about twice as
much of their income on milk as do other families, on average.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates took heart three years ago when Congress told
the Agriculture Department to improve the program. But their hopes
were dashed recently when the department released its proposals,
scheduled to go into effect Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules, the department said, would be ``simpler, more
market-oriented.'' But rather than taking a mallet to the program,
the department wielded a toothpick. John Schnittker, an economist
at Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, a nonprofit research
group in Washington that plans to merge with the Consumer
Federation of America, estimates that the current program raises
the cost of milk an average of 18 cents a gallon. The department
says its plan will cut prices by about 2 cents _ a trim Schnittker
calls ``almost an insult.''
</P>
<P>
   The current rules impose a complex set of minimum prices that
processors are required to pay farmers in each of the 31 marketing
regions.
</P>
<P>
   The department starts by setting a base price for milk used in
the manufacture of products like cheese from a survey of prices in
Minnesota and Wisconsin. Then it tacks on additional charges,
mostly reflecting location, to set the minimum price for so-called
fluid milk.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Clayton, deputy administrator of the agency that runs
the system, says the controls stop milk prices from gyrating wildly
and make sure that milk flows from areas where there are surplus
supplies, like upstate New York and Wisconsin, to areas where there
is scarcity, like Boston and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But he concedes that those flows would occur without government
guidance. What the rules do, he says, is ``divide up the pie _
insuring that diary farmers capture more of the dollar that
consumers pay to processors.'' Another set of complex rules
dictates how the processors' payments are divided among farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists challenge Clayton's benign interpretation.
Processors operate in reasonably competitive markets, the
economists say, so if they are forced to pay more for milk, they
have little choice but to pass on the added cost to customers.
Schnittker points to studies that show consumer prices rising along
with government-imposed charges on processors.
</P>
<P>
   He also challenges another rationale for the milk-pricing rules:
preservation of the family farmer. ``Two-thirds of milk production
comes from only about a quarter of the nation's dairy farmers,'' he
said. ``The milk-pricing rules overwhelmingly line the pockets of
mega dairy farms.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's overhaul would simplify things by collapsing
the 31 regions into 11. But it would also make the system more
complicated, by setting the base price for milk used in
manufactured products according to surveys around the country,
rather than just the Midwest, and by adjusting the price to take
into account the milk's protein content and other qualities using
complex mathematical formulas.
</P>
<P>
   Add charges to take account of location and some transition
rules, and out come 600-plus pages of regulations. Some economists
suggest that the rule-making would fit comfortably in the playbook
of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   And though the proposal would bring down average milk prices a
small amount, it would leave most of the high prices intact.
Indeed, the proposal would actually raise the minimum price in some
places, like Chicago, a decision more political than economic.
</P>
<P>
   Critics point out that this is not the first time the
Agriculture Department has sided with dairy farmers over consumers.
It also approved the creation of a dairy cartel among farmers in
the Northeast that blocks low-price imports. Milk prices in New
England rose about 20 cents a gallon after the compact went into
effect in July 1997. The New York Legislature, yielding to pressure
from upstate dairy farmers, has applied to Congress to join the
cartel.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Tipton, a senior official at the International Dairy
Foods Association, a group of dairy processors, says the government
should have rethought the entire system. ``Sixty years ago, it
might have been hard for milk to flow from rural farms to heavily
populated cities,'' she said. ``Price spikes and supply shortages
were potential threats. But modern transportation and refrigeration
have wiped out that threat.''

MCDOUGAL TRIAL COMES CLOSE TO MISTRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ The trial of Susan McDougal on charges of
criminal contempt and obstruction for refusing to testify before a
Whitewater grand jury about the Arkansas financial dealings of
President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, briefly teetered on the
verge of a mistrial Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As the jury deliberated for a second day, the proceeding was
thrown into disarray when a bailiff spotted one juror with a law
book on the duties of jurors in Arkansas state trials. The book was
quickly seized by court officials, and the judge and lawyers for
both sides immediately began pondering whether the jury's
deliberations had been tainted by the presence of the law book.
</P>
<P>
   But after interviewing the juror, the trial judge, George Howard
Jr., ruled that his use of the law book had had little effect, that
he could remain on the panel and that the trial could go on. The
jury was then sent home for the weekend to resume deliberations at
U.S. District Court here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It is a fairly basic principle of American jurisprudence that
juries are obliged to consider only the law and the facts as given
to them in the course of a trial and may not do their own legal
research or seek advice outside the confines of the court
proceeding. Juries are always instructed explicitly in those rules,
as was this jury by Howard before it began its deliberations on
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of the law book in the jury room took up most of the
day. ``I don't see how we can avoid a mistrial at this point,''
Mark Geragos, Ms. McDougal's defense lawyer, told reporters outside
the courthouse before the judge's ruling. The law book contained
business cards from a well-known local lawyer, John Purtle, a
former justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, Howard ordered federal marshals to summon
Purtle from his home in Toadsuck, Ark., to answer questions about
how his book got into the hands of the juror, Michael Nance.
Purtle, appearing stunned and abashed in the judge's chambers, said
that he had sold his house to Nance in 1997 and probably left some
law books behind.
</P>
<P>
   After interviewing Nance, Howard said the juror had confirmed
that he found the book in an old study that had belonged to Purtle
and brought it to court to help him understand some legal terms.
</P>
<P>
   Purtle's background starkly demonstrates how intertwined are
many issues and personalities in Arkansas. He was originally named
to the state Supreme Court by Clinton when Clinton was governor.
While on the court, Purtle ruled in favor of Ms. McDougal and her
husband at the time, James McDougal, in a matter involving a
savings bank they owned which is at the heart of the current trial.
Ms. McDougal is charged with two counts of criminal contempt and
one of obstruction of justice in connection with her refusal to
answer questions before a grand jury investigating the financial
dealings of the Clintons. She had already served 18 months in jail
at the order of a federal judge for civil contempt for her refusal.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, then chose to
charge her with criminal contempt, a felony that requires a jury
trial. If convicted on all three counts, she faces a maximum
sentence of about seven years under complicated sentencing
guidelines.

 &HT;    Anniversary of Atlanta tornado marked
 &HT;    By Marianne Jaskevich
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Providing residents with early warning against
tornadoes has been a priority of the state since last April's storm
ripped through four suburban counties, killing one and causing
millions in damage, officials said at a ceremony Friday to mark the
one-year anniversary of Atlanta's most devastating twister.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes and U.S. Sen. Max Cleland were among the
dignitaries who gathered at Brook Run in DeKalb County to talk
about tornado safety initiatives and to honor state and local
workers who helped many families in Cobb, Gwinnett, Fulton and
DeKalb counties recover in the storm's aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also paid tribute to John Janisch, who was the only
fatality during the twister.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year ago today ... while local residents slept, thousands
of homes and acres of property were being destroyed,'' Barnes said.
``We are here today to remember that loss of property and the one
life lost. ... The storm displaced thousands and injured so many.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the storm knocked out communications towers, the state
purchased a $650,000 transmitter so that various agencies can
communicate more effectively following storms. Detection devices
such as sirens and storm-tracking radar technology are being
upgraded to better predict a storm's arrival, officials said. For
example, Georgia Tech's Tornado Research Center's $1.5 million
Warning and Detection project aims to increase tornado warning time
from eight to 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Other efforts include research to develop structures capable of
withstanding a tornado's fierce winds, and the addition of 13 new
weather towers, officials noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to know how to better protect themselves by
building stronger walls, ceilings, and roofs that don't blow off,''
said Mary Hudak, a Federal Emergency Management Agency spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   While officials praised the state and local workers, volunteers
distributed young trees and seedlings to a stream of tornado
victims. Dunwoody alone lost more than 100,000 trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Springtime is a time of new beginnings,'' said DeKalb CEO
Liane Levetan, noting how the communities have worked to rebuild.

STORE OR .COM? SEATTLE'S LITERARY HEART IS TORN

 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seattle has long prided itself on being an unusually
literary city, where writers congregate and the drizzly climate
begs a resident to curl up in a chair and read. At its bookish
heart, most Seattleites would agree, is the Elliott Bay Book
Company, where customers can browse amid the cedar shelves or
listen to some of the 500 or more annual programs that make up its
esteemed series of author readings.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle also views itself as one of the world's most
technologically precocious cities, a natural place for a young man
named Jeffrey P. Bezos to launch his Internet company, Amazon.com,
which pioneered the concept of selling books through the World Wide
Web.
</P>
<P>
   But as the rising fortunes of Amazon.com threaten Elliott Bay,
these two visions are in conflict. While the clash is a familiar
one across the country, no where is it more sharply drawn than here
in Seattle, where many people's loyalties are keenly divided
between the progress of electronic commerce and the tradition
embodied in a great independent bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, there was some tension recently, when Bezos, who was being
profiled by the ``NewsHour With Jim Lehrer,'' suggested that the
television crew accompany him to Elliott Bay, which he describes as
his favorite bookstore in the world, to show him buying books there
_ off line.
</P>
<P>
   If it was a gesture of support for the 26-year-old store, which
has been reeling financially, it seemed to have been lost on
Elliott Bay employees. They say people sometimes spend an afternoon
browsing and coffee-sipping in the store, then go home to save
money by ordering books they discovered on the shelves from
Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand his intentions were to plug us,'' said Tracy
Taylor, the store manager, of Bezos. ``How do I describe what I
felt when I saw him here? I'm not sure he's the right spokesperson
for independent bookstores.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other independent book stores around the nation, whose
numbers as measured by their main trade association have dwindled
from 5,200 eight years ago to 3,300 today, Elliott Bay faces
pressures from all over. Chain bookstores, which have opened at
least a dozen branches in the Seattle area, and growing traffic and
parking problems downtown have made it difficult to get to its
Pioneer Square location.
</P>
<P>
   But Walter Carr, the founder of Elliott Bay, and the owners of
several bookstores that have closed in recent months, have cited
relentless competition and price-cutting from online booksellers as
a major force in their decline. And while plenty of readers view
online dealers as the great enemy and refuse to buy from them, many
Seattle literary leaders have much more conflicted feelings here in
the city where the revolution in electronic commerce started.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to happen someplace, and if it's happening here, in
many ways that's great,'' said Sherry Prowda, who founded Seattle
Arts and Lectures, another popular author series, 12 years ago. ``I
really am glad that people view Seattle as a place to come and make
exciting and new and interesting things happen. I mean, if it
started in Philadelphia, Walter would have felt the results of it
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time though,'' she added, ``I feel that we have to
find some way for these two institutions to coexist here. Seattle
without the Elliott Bay Book Company seems unimaginable to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Elliott Bay loyalists admit to a grudging respect for
Amazon.com and its many features, such as reader reviews and
chapter excerpts, despite the company's concession that it takes
publishers' money to treat some books favorably.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Raban, a British author who lives here and who
describes the Elliott Bay staff as perhaps the most knowledgeable
of any in bookstores all across the United States and the United
Kingdom, said he has started buying books online.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first went online, which was despicably recently, and
visited the Amazon site, I was so persuaded by its bookstorelike
quality that I felt sort of embarrassed to leave the site without
buying a book,'' said Raban, author of the upcoming ``Passage to
Juneau: A Sea and its Meanings,'' a maritime history set around his
solo sailing voyage from here to Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I was buying books I didn't even want,'' he said, ``in
exactly the same way I buy books I don't even want in real
bookstores.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The decline of Elliott Bay and Carr's decision to sell it to a
local developer, Ron Sher, has been chronicled in part here as a
sort of Seattle version of ``You've Got Mail,'' the recent romantic
comedy movie, in which the bookstore gets the Meg Ryan role and
Amazon.com is the Tom Hanks megamerchant character.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos, 35, initiated meetings this year with Carr to ask what he
could do to help save the bookstore. Rumors flew for a while _ that
Bezos might buy the store, that he would buy a parking lot and
donate it to Elliott Bay.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Carr said, he was pleased to find Sher, who has
revived two shopping areas in the Seattle area.
</P>
<P>
   And, in time, it just may be that another Seattle giant,
Microsoft Corp., makes the whole notion of competition between
online sellers and old-fashioned bookstores seem quaint: Microsoft
is hoping to pioneer the concept of ``e-books,'' which would be
downloaded onto a portable electronic tablet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for now, many people resent the idea that they somehow
have to choose sides between Elliott Bay and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm torn in half,'' said Bill Radke, the host of ``Rewind,'' a
public-radio comedy show based in Seattle. ``I feel like Elliott
Bay used to be a trip to the bookstore and now it's a moral
crusade, it's a conscientious objection, which is a lot of pressure
to go through for an Al Franken book.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've turned it into good guys and bad guys,'' he said,
``but it's hard to hate Amazon.com because they're from your
hometown. My sister works there. When they started, they used old
doors as desk tops, which just doesn't say `Evil Empire' to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sher contends he can make Elliott Bay thrive again by adding
more seating, improving the food service, offering used as well as
new books and, yes, improving the store's Web site. But he also
said he expected a popular resurgence in the idea of the bookstore
as a gathering place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are getting way too alienated, especially in
the age of the Internet, and they know it,'' Sher said. ``They want
to come to connect back to places like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Many advocates of both online sellers and the big chains even
say that their presence will expand the public's appetite for
books, leading to a larger market for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers do not seem to bear out that vision: The most recent
annual survey showed that Americans were buying slightly fewer
books per capita annually, says a spokeswoman for the American
Booksellers Association. And independent bookstores' share of the
market declined to 17.2 percent in 1997, from 32.5 percent at the
beginning of the decade, the association said.
</P>
<P>
   Carr, who since opening the store in 1973 has seemed to be every
bit as much a fixture of the store as its exposed brick walls, said
that the store's sale became inevitable after single-digit
percentage decreases in sales became double digits in recent years
and his staff, once at a peak of 90, had been cut to 50. He and
other people at Elliott Bay say Amazon.com was a huge factor, in
many ways more than the chain stores like Borders or Barnes &AMP;
Noble.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one hit more like a neutron bomb,'' said Rick Simonson,
the head book buyer and developer of the author readings series,
which has been lauded &UR;  &LR; for its role in the state's literary life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain books stopped selling,'' he said. ``And you started
hearing, `What's the price on this, I could get it for less on
Amazon.com.'''
</P>
<P>
   But even Carr's feelings about Bezos, who has been a regular
store customer throughout Amazon.com's meteoric rise, are nuanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem like with all sincerity he says he loves great
bookstores, and we've been flattered to be among what he calls the
greatest,'' Carr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it's a two-edged sword,'' he added. ``Maybe it's my
troubled worldly perspective, where I have a combination of
admiration for what he's done, because he has provided this way for
people all over to access books and information about books, but at
the same time, this store's downward fate is locked into the
success of his enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Bezos declined to be interviewed about the store. ``He loves
it,'' his spokeswoman said. ``But I think we'll pass on the story
about Internet effects on bookshops, et cetera.''
</P>
<P>
   The entrepreneur's recent foray with cameras into the store drew
some derision. ``Kind of like Howard Schultz of Starbucks going
into a little mom-and-pop espresso place and saying, `This is what
I had in mind, this is what I really love about Seattle,''' said
David Brewster, the founder of Sasquatch Books in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many here continue to hope the two institutions can
somehow thrive together, and that the Internet company might
contribute to the literary scene here _ ``if, and when,'' Ms.
Prowda drily notes, ``Amazon starts to make some money.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are signs that Elliott Bay could be helped by the big
competitor _ after all, say store employees, sometimes people come
in with printouts of research they have done on the Amazon site and
say these are the books they would like to buy at Elliott Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this store, I love all its winding nooks and crannies,
I love everything about it,'' said Reagan Jackson, 19, a sophomore
at the University of Washington, browsing at the store recently.
``And besides, books have character. They have different covers.
They have different smells. I need to go through all that. It just
wouldn't be the same for me to buy books over the Web.''

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Three days after Serbian troops closed
border crossing points from Kosovo into Macedonia and Albania, NATO
reconnaissance planes have failed to locate any of the tens of
thousands of refugees who were turned back from the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ``A key question is what is happening to the people who were
trying to leave,'' the alliance's spokesman, Jamie P. Shea, said,
referring in particular to those he called the ``car people,''
whose automobiles had been lined up about 12 miles inside Kosovo
near the Albanian border before vanishing overnight Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Unpiloted American ``Predator'' and ``Hunter'' reconnaissance
drones have been flying over the province for the past several
days. But a NATO military spokesman, Air Commodore David Wilby,
said Friday that allied intelligence was concentrating mostly on
finding tanks and other armored vehicles to bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian paramilitary police and army units have been using the
tanks in attacks that have driven hundreds of thousands of
civilians out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A senior European diplomat said that NATO civilian authorities
had asked the military command on Thursday to intensify
reconnaissance over Kosovo to try to locate the missing civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Klaus Naumann, chairman of the Military Committee at the
alliance's headquarters here, has also requested surveillance
reports from individual allies' reconnaissance missions, officials
say, but so far, requests by NATO ambassadors for better
intelligence on the missing refugees have not produced any.
</P>
<P>
   Neither civilian nor military officials offered much explanation
for the failure.
</P>
<P>
   Wilby said Thursday, ``We are certainly trying to identify all
movement of people, and we are obviously very concerned about where
those people are being moved to.''
</P>
<P>
   And Shea said Friday, ``We believe there may be 150,000 to
200,000 people in Kosovo living without shelter, in the woods, in
ruined villages, and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   But the allies, like international relief officials, have been
reduced mainly to guessing at what happened after the Yugoslav
president, Slobodan Milosevic, closed the borders Tuesday night,
declared a unilateral cease-fire Wednesday and said refugees were
free to return home. NATO has rejected those claims as a
duplicitous sham.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said Friday that the
Serbian troops inside Kosovo might have forced refugees back to
make them ``human shields'' around the military targets of the
allied bombing campaign, which continued Friday despite unfavorable
weather conditions in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Particular concern has been expressed about the fate of
thousands of people who were lined up behind the border crossing on
the road from Prizren to the Albanian border town of Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have received reports from the few people who have come
through that all along the road behind the border, the cars and
wagons and tractors are just abandoned, with luggage and food left
behind and nobody visible on the road,'' Judith Kumin, a
spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva,
said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very much concerned for the fate of civilians remaining
in Kosovo,'' the high commissioner, Sadako Ogata, said Friday in
Skopje, the capital of Macedonia. Asked what her organization could
do for them, she said, ``I am helpless there.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all international organizations left Kosovo before March
24, when NATO began bombing to try to force Milosevic to accept a
peace settlement restoring autonomy to the ethnic Albanian
population of the province.
</P>

<P>
</P>
<P>
   Naumann said in an interview on German radio Friday that it
would be difficult for the West to impose peace in Kosovo without
sending in ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   He said he could not speculate whether allied governments would
think twice about their refusal to fight their way into Kosovo to
escort more than half a million refugees driven out by Serbian
forces back to their homes. ``Ultimately, a conflict is always
decided on the ground, of course,'' he said. ``Without a presence
on the ground, it's very, very difficult to achieve that.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a presence on the ground, there are also no allied
reconnaissance patrols from either Albania or Macedonia that can
fill in gaps in the allies' intelligence about the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia has allowed 12,000 allied soldiers, including British,
French and American troops, onto its territory, but Macedonia's
defense minister, Nikola Kljusev, said on a visit to the alliance's
headquarters Friday that his country still insists that none of
those troops be used for offensive action against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is agreement with the Yugoslav government for the
entry of NATO forces into Yugoslavia, then they will be allowed to
enter Yugoslavia,'' he said. ``Unless this happens, the passage of
NATO forces into Yugoslavia cannot be accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12,000 soldiers were originally sent to Macedonia as the
vanguard of the 28,000-strong peacekeeping force planned for Kosovo
as part of a negotiated settlement, but Milosevic refused even to
discuss peacekeepers. Now the troops have been put to work helping
Macedonia deal with more than 150,000 ethnic Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The Macedonians bused thousands of refugees who had been camped
at the border near Blace to Albania this week without so much as a
word to NATO troops or refugee officials.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO officials were full of praise Friday for Macedonia's
cooperation, according to the country's foreign minister,
Aleksandar Dimitrov, who met with allied ambassadors and Solana for
an hour Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Solana said later that the allies had agreed to pay for any
damage to Macedonian property caused by the presence of allied
troops, and warned that the alliance would respond to any threats
to Macedonia from Yugoslavia while they were there.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance also plans to send 8,000 troops to Albania to help
deal with the refugee crisis there. Albania has agreed to let the
United States station 24 Apache anti-tank helicopters and Army
surface-to-surface rockets on its soil, with about 2,000 American
soldiers to operate them, to improve the effectiveness of the NATO
air campaign against Serbian forces in Kosovo.

   JAZINCE, Macedonia _ Yugoslav forces are continuing to force
ethnic Albanians out of their homes in southern Kosovo, newly
arrived refugees said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The fresh accounts of Yugoslav forces ordering ethnic Albanians
to leave Kosovo and torching villages came three days after
Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, declared a unilateral
cease-fire in the province on Tuesday. But ethnic Albanians
trickling into northwestern Macedonia here told of Yugoslav forces
burning villages as recently as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Macedonian and Serbian border guards have almost
totally closed the border, only allowing the occasional carload of
refugees through. Hundreds of refugees remain massed at the Jazince
border crossing. The handful who crossed Friday said they had
waited nine days to pass through the border controls.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, fear of Serbian military and police operations continues to
drive ethnic Albanians from their homes in Kosovo even if it means
a long and dangerous journey.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Bekim, a young man from Firaj, just a mile from the border
with Macedonia, said Friday that Serbian police had given the
villagers an ultimatum last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came to the edge of the village and went to the first
families and said `You have two hours to leave the village, and
when we come back if we find you here you know what will
happen &UR; . &LR; '''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the villagers fled. The village is divided into two
parts, and Bekim _ who would not give the rest of his name _ said
the police began burning the northern part on Wednesday. He and
others left, climbing into the hills, but he returned to the
village on Thursday to look for relatives, who had not reached the
border.
</P>
<P>
   But there were only two old men in the village, who resolutely
refused to leave. Bekim said that as he climbed the hill to cross
back over the mountains at 7:30 p.m. he saw the southern part of
the village had begun to burn.
</P>
<P>
   Friday he stood alone on the road at the Jazince border
crossing, watching for a glimpse of his family, his father, mother,
brothers and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Ruzhdi Rexhepi, a 59-year-old farmer, said that after Yugolsav
soldiers burned his village, Bajnici in southern Kosovo, on
Saturday, he and his wife, their daughter-in-law, and three
grandchildren fled by horse-drawn cart to a second village, Raka.
But on Monday, he said, masked Yugoslav police and soldiers
descended on that village too, also burning houses and again
forcing Rexhepi and his family to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Their cart now carried his family and Emrane Raka, 30, and three
children. After fleeing down a main road with other civilians,
Rexhepi said he became worried when Yugoslav police ordered them to
go in the direction of a Serbian village.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing they might be killed, he drove the cart off the main
road and arrived in a deserted ethnic Albanian village, where they
spent the night in an abandoned house.
</P>
<P>
   Rexhepi's family then set out on foot and ran into a group of
roughly 100 Albanians also fleeing toward Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Hamdi Raka, a 12-year-old boy in that group, said the worst
section of the 15-hour-trek was where the path bordered on a
ravine. ``You could fall and be killed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, who navigated the path while carrying her whimpering
5-year-old son and holding her 10-year-old daughter's hand, said
her biggest fear was a gust of wind knocking a child over a
precipice. ``The children were blowing like cigarette paper,'' she
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At one point, a woman became ill and her husband stayed behind
with her on the mountain. ``I stopped and tried to help them, but I
had to take care of my own family,'' Rexhepi said. ``I don't know
if they are still up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rexhepi and the rest of the group descended into Macedonia on
Wednesday and the local police placed them with 3,000 other
refugees in a sprawling tent city built by German NATO soldiers in
Neprostino.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of expulsions of people from their homes and the
burning of villages does not seem to have slackened in the last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The Ilazi family was ordered out of their village, Strpce, four
days ago when police arrived, saying ``Leave or we will kill you,''
said Bafti Ilazi, a 70-year-old farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Lying on a cot in Neprostino camp in northern Macedonia, Ilaza
said he knew exactly where to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took three or four blankets because it is cold that way,''
he said. ``We walked through the night, through the Lybeten
mountains. It was cold, we were almost perishing from the cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Strpce backs onto Kosovo's highest mountains, near the ski
resort of Brezovica. The walk, through snow nearly 5 feet deep,
took him and his family 20 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the way. I am old and have been around a long time. I
had crossed over on that path before. I had done it eight times
since 1947 to buy wheat in Tetovo,'' he said, describing the ethnic
Albanian town in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   They were nine people in the family, including women and
children, he said. His 25-year-old son had stayed behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not want to leave the cows. I don't know if he will
survive, maybe they will kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Jazince border crossing, Ardita Dila was waving to her
father and husband, trapped behind metal barriers in the no man's
land between Kosovo and Macedonia. She had managed to get through
the border four days before with her small son, but the others had
been waiting nine days, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, an editor of an ethnic Albanian weekly magazine, had
been beaten by Serbs, she said. Yet after the grueling wait to
enter Macedonia, she had bitter words for the Macedonian
authorities, whom she saw as working together against the ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are killing them, like the Serbs, but in a different way.
This is cooperation, there is an agreement between them,'' she
said.

 &HT;    Florida's version of Freaknik underway
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The precursor to Freaknik, at least in
terms of controversy, kicked off Friday as thousands of black
college students began swarming Daytona Beach for the Black College
Reunion.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, traffic had started to pick up on the beachside's main
strip, Atlantic Avenue, as well as on the beach, where cars are
allowed. Women in bathing suits posed for pictures and guys tried
to outdo each other with the loudest sound system in perfectly
polished cars. Fully clothed women were dunked into hotel swimming
pools, while women yelled up at balconies urging men to strip.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the city's 247 police officers are working this weekend,
and temperatures, which hit 90 degrees on Friday, are expected to
break records.
</P>
<P>
   As the day wore on and the traffic got slower, some of the
people got wilder. Straddled atop the sunroof of a jeep, one
bikini-clad woman did a seductive dance as the driver slapped her
bottom, while a throng of men videotaped it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't touch her. Don't touch her,'' cautioned one of the
onlookers. ''If you don't touch her, she'll keep on doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Atlanta's Freaknik, lewd, rude and loud behavior _ while
exhibited by just a few of the participants _ is what gains most of
the attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are just trying to have fun. We aren't into that crazy,
wild stuff,'' said Jessica Pedrazza, 23, a student at Georgia State
University, who came down with seven other women.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 100,000 people expected this weekend in Daytona
Beach, the growing popularity of the weekend beach party threatens
to siphon some of the expected attendance from next weekend's
Freaknik. Some people will travel from Daytona Beach to Galveston
for the Kappa Beach Party, instead of coming to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Pedrazza, who lives in Atlanta, said she is going to Tallahassee
for the Kappa Luau instead of staying home for Freaknik.
</P>
<P>
   ''Freaknik is old,'' said Pedrazza. ''We have lived in Atlanta
all our lives and we need something new. I'm tired of it. It is
trite.''
</P>
<P>
   While some students chose not to attend Freaknik, a surprising
number of them assumed Freaknik had been canceled, therefore
eliminating that option altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Alondra Carr, a native of Stone Mountain, Ga., said she and her
friends from Tennessee State University are content with Daytona
Beach and don't plan on coming to Atlanta next weekend either.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is much better,'' said Carr, 21. ''We don't go to
Freaknik anymore because it is too restrictive.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Freaknik, BCR started off humbly enough 15 years ago as a
student party among friends at Bethune Cookman College, which is
located in Daytona Beach, and Florida A&AMP;M State University in
Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   When it started growing, fear of legal problems pushed Bethune
Cookman withdraw support.
</P>
<P>
   ''After it became community-wide, we were advised by our
insurance company not to give any support, because of the
possibility of a lawsuit,'' said Bethune Cookman President Oswald
Perry Bronson.
</P>
<P>
   Bronson, former president of the Interdenominational Theological
Center in Atlanta, said aside from the possible legal problems that
the event poses, he also has fundamental problems with the event.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are certain kinds of activities that may be done that
don't lend themselves to good behavior,'' said Bronson, who was in
Atlanta last year during Freaknik and got caught in a two-hour
traffic jam two blocks away from his hotel. ''It is an image that
we don't like for college students. Especially black college
students.''
</P>
<P>
   On an early morning flight from Chicago to Daytona Beach, Rodney
Jones, 24, was too tired to even eat his complimentary peanuts. He
is going to need his rest. He is planning on staying in Daytona
Beach until Thursday, then travel back to Atlanta for Freaknik.
</P>
<P>
   ''After last year, people started coming to Daytona, because it
keeps getting stricter in Atlanta,'' said Jones, who has been to
Freaknik twice. ''There is more to do in Daytona with the beach,
but Atlanta is going to be wild. That is why everybody goes there.
They know people are going to be acting crazy. But I'd rather
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   While Pedrazza and Carr walk the beach, politicians fight and
Jones rests for his busy week, Bronson remains on campus going over
paperwork and holding his breath. ``I'll relax when it is over,''
he said.

TAKING THE SHINE OFF LUCENT EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 11)  
 (bl)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long ago, in a galaxy far away, investors examined companies'
financial statements with a sharp pencil and a gimlet eye. The
quaint exercise assured them that corporate earnings were solid and
that no surprises were ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Back on Planet Earth, few investors sharpen pencils today. One
who does is Robert Olstein, a 30-year veteran of financial analysis
who manages the Olstein Financial Alert mutual fund. He picks
stocks with high-quality earnings, avoiding or betting against
those whose gains result more from accounting cleverness than from
actual sales. Since its inception in 1995, the fund has returned
24.5 percent annually, on average; it is up 5.3 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Lucent Technologies, a leader in communications systems,
has caught Olstein's eye. It closed on Friday at $63.625, or 54
times 1999 estimates, and is up almost 16 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucent is a great company,'' Olstein said, but not the growth
company investors think it is.
</P>
<P>
   The company's latest numbers seem to support him. In the quarter
ended Dec. 31, sales rose just 5.5 percent from the corresponding
period a year earlier. But Lucent said that lag from the 14 percent
sales growth it showed in 1998 was a result of deferred sales that
would appear in second-quarter numbers, due April 22.
</P>
<P>
   Even if that report astounds, Olstein points to other areas that
make him fret about Lucent's growth. For instance, during the past
two years, Lucent has written off $2.5 billion of research and
development that had been in the pipeline at companies it acquired.
Charging such expenses to earnings makes future income look better
than that in earlier quarters when the expenses were paid.
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt has
worried that companies may use such write-offs to manage earnings.
</P>
<P>
   James Lusk, Lucent's controller, said that the company is highly
conservative in its bookkeeping and that accounting rules required
it to take these write-downs.
</P>
<P>
   As for Lucent's $480 million revenue increase in the latest
quarter, Olstein said that about $200 million came from
reconsolidating its folded joint venture with Philips Electronics.
In his view, revenue from continuing operations showed only 3
percent growth in the quarter. Meanwhile, accounts receivable and
inventories were up 43 percent and 46 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   A Lucent share earned $1.06 in the quarter, before the effects
of an accounting change. Olstein computes this as a gain of 20
cents a share over the same period last year, after adding back
research and development write-downs to that quarter's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, Olstein reckons that 19 cents of the 20-cent increase
came from three items: another accounting change, a lower tax rate
and a smaller allowance for accounts unlikely to be paid.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Lucent's income has been helped by the roaring stock
market. Shares held for employees' pensions created a credit of
$558 million last year, fully 14.6 percent of pretax income before
the write-offs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eliminate all this stuff, and maybe you're not paying 54 times
earnings. You're paying a lot more,'' Olstein said. ``But nobody
cares about risk until they lose money.''

MILOSEVIC REJECTS CHANCE FOR GOODWILL GESTURE

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ President Slobodan Milosevic chose Friday
not to make a goodwill gesture toward the West by releasing three
captured American soldiers. Instead he used the visit of a Cypriot
politician to make another kind of propaganda point, about the
civilian damage caused by NATO's bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker of the Cypriot Parliament, Spyros Kyprianou, clearly
disappointed, said Friday evening that his mission to free the
three Americans had failed. He effectively blamed NATO itself for
the failure, saying the alliance had not only refused to halt
bombing briefly but had also intensified its attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is well known and it has always been the position of
President Milosevic that bombing should stop,'' Kyprianou said.
``From the moment I announced my initiative to undertake this
purely humanitarian mission for the release of the three Americans,
the bombings were intensified.''
</P>
<P>
   He said NATO should have shown ``at least some respect'' for his
mission, and added: ``Under the circumstances created and the fact
that the message received by the Yugoslav leadership and people is
that the relentless bombardments will continue,'' he said, those
leaders ``can't proceed with a new peace gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyprianou spoke to journalists after meeting with Milosevic.
Earlier in the day, he was taken on a tour of Aleksinac, the
southern Serbian town hit hard by NATO bombs that missed their
target, killing 12 civilians and wounding 40 others. He was also
taken to Cuprija, which was hit on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and American officials had said they would welcome any
unconditional release of the soldiers, but had been explicit in
refusing a Yugoslav request for even a 24-hour cease-fire in the
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Kyprianou said the bombing should stop, that ``Europe needs
peace'' and that even if the bombing continued ``100 days, it would
not solve the problem'' of the southern Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The three U.S. Army soldiers are Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, 24,
of Los Angeles; Staff Sgt. Christopher Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek,
Mich.; and Spc. Steven Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas. They
were captured along the Kosovo-Macedonia border on March 31.
American officials have accused the Yugoslavs of abducting the
three, but the Yugoslavs say the men were captured after entering
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   After raising hopes of Americans for a goodwill gesture on the
Orthodox Easter weekend, Milosevic will now have earned himself
even more opprobrium in Washington for toying with the hopes of the
families of the three servicemen. It now looks as if they will be
held until the end of hostilities, Greek officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Kyprianou's comments, which did not much touch on the plight of
the ethnic Albanians inside and now outside of Kosovo, were sure to
please Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   After his tour of the bomb damage, Kyprianou said the Balkan
crisis could not be solved by force. ``I am not a military expert,
but this is my own view after having heard things from people, and
after my visit to the bombed cities earlier today, where I have
seen things that shocked me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe and the world must understand that this particular
region needs peace, based on justice and morality, peace based on
freedom, respect of borders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Yugoslav officials sent mixed signals about the
three soldiers, with the relatively liberal Yugoslav information
minister, Milan Komnenic, promising ``good news.''
</P>
<P>
   But the hard-line nationalist Vojislav Seselj, the Yugoslav
deputy prime minister, said the freedom for the soldiers is ``out
of the question,'' because ``the United States is leading an
undeclared war against Yugoslavia.'' He said they should be tried
as terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Kyprianou said he would stop his efforts for now, because ``it
is impossible to achieve any results in the present climate.''
</P>
<P>
   There was more anger here Friday over NATO's bombing early
Friday morning of the Zastava car and munitions factory in
Kragujevac, in central Yugoslavia. The workers of the factory had
announced that they would form a ``human shield'' to protect the
factory in shifts and remain in the building even during the night.
</P>
<P>
   They rejected a plea from factory managers to leave, and about
124 of them were wounded, some 20 of them seriously, by the NATO
attack, Yugoslav state media said.
</P>
<P>
   About 38,000 workers depend on the Zastava plant. Its munitions
subsidiary was no secret, as is the case with other factories NATO
hit, like the Sloboda factory in Cacak, which Yugoslav officials
insist made only domestic appliances, but which other Yugoslav and
NATO sources said also made ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavs continue to form human shields at night on major
bridges in Belgrade and in Novi Sad, where only one bridge spanning
the Danube has survived allied attacks. While they wait out the
night, they listen to rock and folk songs.

AT BORDER CROSSING, SERBS CAST EYES ON REFUGEES' CARS

   SKOPJI, Macedonia _ Without explanation, Yugoslav border
officials suddenly opened a remote border crossing Friday to a
trickle of ethnic Albanians who had waited for more than a week in
a several-mile-long line trying to flee Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The fresh influx of several hundred refugees brought with them
new tales of forced evictions, burnings and terror as international
human rights monitors voiced growing concern about the fate of
those left behind in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   At the Jevince border crossing, it was a scene reminiscent of
the novel ``Catch 22`` _ except there was no humor in it. It was
coldy executed by the Serbian forces, who ordered the Kosovars to
form two lines alongside their cars on the Serbian side of the
border.
</P>
<P>
   Then they ordered one line to return to Kosovo but allowed the
other to pass through to Macedonia, separating families and loved
ones, said aid workers who were watching from the Macedonian side.
</P>
<P>
   They told those allowed to cross the border to leave their cars
behind with the keys in them, and some witnesses told aid workers
that the Serb soldiers then walked along the line of vehicles,
eyeing them and laughing as if they were shopping.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians, clutching the few belongings they could carry,
were at first turned back by the Macedonian border police, but they
relented and finally allowed them to pass through. They scurried
across and were ushered onto waiting buses that shuttled them to a
refugee camp several miles down the road. Some aid workers there
placed the number of new arrivals at about 300, others at closer to
800.
</P>
<P>
   There they confronted their new fate: canvas tents in a muddy
field ringed with barbed wire, where Macedonian troops with
shouldered rifles and cold stares patrolled outside to make sure no
one left the camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their faces were unforgettable. They saw what they were headed
for and the bus grew silent. You could see the men just staring.
The women were crying,'' said Dr. Sheri Fink of the Boston-based
group Physicians for Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of other ethnic Albanians are believed to be
still hiding in the woods on the Kosovo side, hoping for a chance
to get across a border that remained mostly sealed, and in some
places sewn with land mines.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, an exchange of gunfire crackled along the
Macedonia-Kosovo border in the ``no man's land'' of Blace.
Macedonian government officials said that a band of armed men had
approached the Macedonian border guards and fired a shot. The
Macedonians returned fire, they said. Sometime later, a single shot
rang out and killed a Macedonian soldier.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO source said that the armed men were probably Kosovo
Liberation Army fighers taking revenge on the Macedonian troops for
their sometimes brutal treatment of ethnic Albanians allowed to
cross the border.
</P>
<P>
   In the camps there were reports of beatings of refugees by the
police, and some ethnic Albanian who live in Macedonia were turned
away from the camps by armed Macedonian police when they tried to
visit family members inside, who could only clutch the barbed wire
fences and tearfully wave to loved ones on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonians are resentful of the influx of ethnic Albanians,
fearing they will upset the delicate ethnic balance in the nation,
which declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said Friday that they would continue to maintain
a presence in the refugee camps, in part to protect the ethnic
Albanians from the rising violence by the Macedonian forces.
</P>
<P>
   An additonal 8,000 NATO troops were landing in neighboring
Albania on a humanitarian mission to build tent cities and
coordinate aid delivery to the roughly 300,000 refugees who've
amassed in Albania, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Sadako Ogata, head of the United Nations refugee agency, said
she feared for the fate of ethnic Albanians still in Kosovo. And
U.N. human rights chief Mary Robinson expressed concern that
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was forcibly gathering
refugees as ``human shields'' against NATO attacks. They were said
to be placing the refugees in sites where his army was hiding
military troops and hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian television in Tirana reported that tens of thousands of
ethnic Albanians were trapped by Serb forces in central Kosovo and
threatened with starvation, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   A visibly frustrated Ogata, who toured the camps in Macedonia
Friday, said her organization could do nothing for ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo except continue to bring their plight to the world's
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very much concerned for the fate of civilians remaining
in Kosovo,'' she said at a news conference in the capital city of
Skopje.
</P>
<P>
   UN refugee officials Friday also said they had solved the
mystery of the 20,000 refugees who had been unaccounted for since
Wednesday night, when Macedonian authorities suddenly bused away
about 45,000 people who had been stranded in filth and squalor in
the Blace border crossing. They said the 20,000 had been taken,
many against their will, to the Albanian border, where they
gathered in a stadiumm that had been transformed into a refugee
camp.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, the UN agency said, just under 517,000 people had
left Kosovo since fighting began there in March last year. It said
the total included 304,000 in Albania, 122,000 in Macedonia and
59,000 in Montenegro.

BAY STATE MEDICAL WATCHDOG PANEL SLIPS IN US RANKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A new national ranking of medical boards puts
Massachusetts third from the bottom for its failure to take
disciplinary actions against bad doctors. It is the fourth year in
a row the state has slipped in the ranking.
</P>
<P>
   With only 55 disciplinary actions taken by the medical board in
a state with more than 26,000 licensed physicians, Massachusetts
appears as one of the worst states, according to the annual ranking
released Friday by Public Citizen's Health Research Group, founded
by Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   In a note of sarcasm, Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Health
Research Group, said, ``Massachusetts has once again done a great
job.'' This latest ranking is the worst since 1991, when
Massachusetts was 48th in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The organization makes its rankings based on the number of
serious disciplinary actions taken for every 1,000 licensed
physicians. Although the report recommends no magic number, The
national average was 3.76, while the No. 1 state, Alaska, had 15.4
such actions in 1998. Massachusetts was near the bottom with just
2.06 actions per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   While Massachusetts officials have in the past said fewer
actions reflect better-quality physicians here, recent events
suggest otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Given the recent controversy over the medical board's handling
of three doctors facing criminal charges and missing criminal
convictions from its on-line physician profile system, ``it's not
surprising'' to find the board near the bottom again, said Linda
DeBenedictis of the New England Patients' Rights Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board is not doing its job,'' said DeBenedictis, who
founded the patient advocacy group. She said board members should
ask themselves, ``Are we really protecting the public and are we
addressing complaints honestly and fairly to improve care?''
</P>
<P>
   Penelope Wells, acting executive director for the board,
disagreed with the ranking by the Health Research Group, saying
``it's not accurate'' because it compares a state like
Massachusetts, with more than 26,000 physicians, to a state like
Montana, which has fewer than 2,000 doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But, Wells added, she agrees that Massachusetts has slipped
compared to itself, based on statistics just released by the
Federation of State Medical Boards. She attributed part of the
problem to the Legislature's decision to no longer appropriate
$247,000 for the on-line physician profile system, forcing the
board to absorb that out of its regular budget.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the board has had to reduce its complement of four
investigators to the current 2.5 full-time equivalents, she said.
At one point last year, the board had only one investigator, Wells
said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Grabauskas, director of the state Office of Consumer
Affairs and Business Regulation, which oversees the board, said the
slippage is ``probably confirming many of the concerns that I know
the Governor and I have had.''
</P>
<P>
   In his proposed fiscal 2000 budget, Governor Paul Cellucci asked
the Legislature for about $450,000 more for the Board of
Registration in Medicine, to bring the total up to more than $3.8
million, including physician licensing fees, according to
Grabauskas.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts board had been slowly improving in the early
1990s, rising from 48th in 1991 to 37th by 1994. Then the board
began a decline, first to 40, then to 43, then to 45, and finally
to 47 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Research Group does its annual ranking using
statistics compiled by the Federation of State Medical Boards,
which just sent out its data, in advance of its annual meeting
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   But while the federation refrains from ranking the boards, the
Health Research Group takes the information and compares the states
based on the number of serious disciplinary actions taken for every
1,000 licensed physicians. Serious disciplinary actions are defined
as revocation, surrender or suspension of license, and probation or
restrictions on practice.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the ranking by state, however, the federation
figures show that Massachusetts has slipped compared to itself over
the last two years, based on a complicated composite index,
according to Wells. Given the resource cutbacks, ``It's not really
a surprise to us,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Federal judge Friday night ordered the government
to pay nearly $909 million to a California savings association that
nearly went bankrupt after Congress and the Bush administration
imposed tougher accounting changes on the industry a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, awarded to Glendale Federal Bank by Chief Judge
Loren A. Smith of the U.S. Court of Claims, is one of the largest
judgments ever assessed against the federal government. But it is
more significant for the legal precedent it may set for the more
than 120 other similar cases filed by existing and moribund savings
associations and their shareholders, as well as other industries
that have also filed large claims against the government in last
year after regulations were changed that cost them money.
</P>
<P>
   If the reasoning of Smith is upheld on appeal, experts say it
could, in effect, reopen the huge bailout of the savings and loan
industry, adding another $30 billion to $50 billion to the costs of
the most expensive financial debacle in American history. It has
already cost taxpayers $165 billion and administration officials
estimate that every $1 billion in judgments will cost each American
household $10.
</P>
<P>
   The winners who stand to profit the most from the precedent set
by Friday's decision are other prominent businessmen who hold big
stakes in savings associations that have filed simlar claims. They
include Robert M. Bass, the Texas financier; the Pritzker family of
Chicago; New York investor Lewis Ranieri, and Ronald O. Perelman of
the Revlon Group.
</P>
<P>
   Perelman is a controlling shareholder in Golden State Bancorp,
which owns both Glendale and California Federal, which has recently
concluded its trial seeking more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While thousands of other smaller investors stand to gain from
the decision, it could also help the claims of some of the more
notorious figures in the savings and loan debacle. One of the most
corrupt savings operators, David L. Paul, has filed a claim similar
to Glendale's from a prison camp in South Carolina. Paul, the
former chairman of Florida's Centrust Savings, is serving an
11-year sentence for racketeering and fraud. Centrust's gold-plated
toilet pipes and $29 million art collection were ultimately
financed by taxpayers in a $1.7 billion bailout.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall Congress and the Clinton administration quietly took
steps that assured that the tab from the savings and loan cases
would be picked up by taxpayers. With no hearings or open debate,
congressional lawmakers tucked into appropriations legislation a
two-paragraph provision supported by the Clinton Administration and
urged by industry lobbyists. The provision requires taxpayers to
pay such sums as necessary to satisfy all final court judgments.
The lobbyists had feared that either the Treasury would not pay or
that the industry might end up being saddled with the costs through
a special assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three years ago, a highly splintered Supreme Court ruled
that the 1989 savings and loan bailout law that toughened the
accounting rules breached the contracts that regulators had made
with investors who had come to rescue many institutions. But the
High Court never addressed the issue of how to calculate the
industry's damages, and the Glendale lawsuit presented the first
test case of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers from the Justice Department have maintained in the
lawsuits that have begun to be tried that the savings associations
are entitled to little or nothing because the government's action
was not the major cause of any injury and, in fact, the regulators
had actually helped the industry by changing the rules. In the
Glendale case, for instance, the Justice Department maintained
that, at most the company was entitled to about $28 million, the
costs it incurred when it was forced to restructure following the
1989 law.
</P>
<P>
   But the savings association asserted that it was entitled to
recover what profits it may have earned had the government not
intervened, or at the very least, restitution of about $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Friday that Glendale's calculation of its lost
profits was ``too remote and speculative to be granted.'' But he
also took a thinly veiled slap at the Justice Department, saying
that he ``understands the frustration of the plaintiff, who fought
for six years on the question of liability against the government,
only to have the government tell it, at the end of this laborious
process, that Glendale had suffered no damages.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge said that he recognized the difficulty of calculating
damages involving a savings association that entered into a 40-year
contract 18 years ago that was then breached nearly 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this should not, and cannot defeat plaintiff's claim for
damages,'' he said. ``Put simply, the government should not be
immunized from paying contract damages because the extent of both
the contract and breach, and the time that has elapsed between the
breach and today, makes it more difficult to calculate or
conceptualize damages.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department Friday night issued a statement saying
that it was reviewing the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remain confident in our position and look forward to a fair
and expedious final resolution'' of the savings and loan cases, the
statement said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even before Friday's ruling, Justice Department officials, who
had come under strong criticism from Smith for not moving quickly
to settle the cases, said that they would likely appeal his award
in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen J. Trafton, executive vice president of Golden State
Bancorp and the former chief executive of Glendale, said the
decision was ``an important victory in a long and arduous battle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruling underscores the fact the the federal government
must respect the sanctity of a contract,'' Trafton said. ``People
must honor their agreements. The government, far from being an
exception to this rule, should champion it, since our country's
prosperity is founded on the idea of enforceable contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Glendale case had its origins in a 1981 deal in which the
company took over a failing Florida savings association in exchange
for an easing of the amount of capital it was required to maintain.
The regulators permitted Glendale up to 40 years to write off the
$734 million in losses of the failed institution, First Federal
Savings and Loan Association of Broward County.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1989, when Congress approved the Financial Institutions
Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, it eliminated the accounting
concession, known as ``supervisory goodwill.'' Glendale quickly
fell out of capital compliance. The thrift came within days of
being seized by regulators, avoiding being taken over only after
completing a huge restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   The judge calculated that the value of the benefit conferred on
Glendale by the government was $798.291 million. He subtracted
$288.37 million for the benefits conferred on the government by
Glendale and then added an additional $399.027 million in other
damages and costs.

EX-BAY STATE RESIDENTS OFFER HAVEN DURING CRISIS

<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ In a country with only one highway, only one
commercial airstrip and only one partially developed movie theater,
it seems fitting that there is just one set of Massachusetts
license plates.
</P>
<P>
   Less expected are its owners. Chris Dakas, once a police officer
in Worcester, Mass., came here with his wife Laura seven years ago
on a calling to help Europe's poorest _ and once most xenophobic _
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as the crumbling country exploded with hundreds of
thousands of Kosovar refugees, the Dakas' found themselves on the
front lines of the worst humanitarian crisis in the continent in
more than a half-century.
</P>
<P>
   Their downtown apartment became a clearinghouse for refugee
workers. Their red Cherokee became an aid transport vehicle. And
their Mexican restaurant _ the only non-smoking restaurant in
Albania _ became a hub of information for a flood of humanitarian
workers on their way north.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there have ever been this many foreigners in
Albania at once,'' Laura, 49, said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there were few when the couple arrived in Tirana
shortly after the fall of Communism and well before the few signs
of modernization now sprinkled throughout the capital.
</P>
<P>
   They said they came on a calling from God _ and on Chris'
retirement plan from the Worcester police department _ and have
since tried to carve a ``safe haven'' out of an otherwise violent
region.
</P>
<P>
   There is still virtually no infrastructure in the country, save
the 700,000-odd concrete bunkers along the gravel roadways or
beaches, where soldiers once hid awaiting an attack from the
``capitalist running dogs'' from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The country is still desperately poor, in part thanks to pyramid
schemes, sanctioned by the previous government, that collapsed in
1997. It is still extremely dangerous, thanks to the military
weapons looted by civilians during the violent uprising then.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first got here, Josif gave me a warning,'' said Chris,
51, referring to the native Albanian who has been his closest aide
for seven years. ``He said, `If you are going to survive in
Albania, you need to know one thing _ don't trust anyone. Not even
me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And he was right. You can't be a liberal in Albania and last
more than three or four days.''
</P>
<P>
   It is into this environment that hundreds of thousands of
Kosovars have fled, many of them leaving quiet villages and routine
jobs, many driving decent cars and wearing nice, middle-class
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   They are, in many ways, as unprepared for the Albanian way of
life as any American might be _ speaking a different dialect,
bearing a different set of values, the couple said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Southerners and the Northerners,'' Laura said,
with a native New Englander's drop of the r.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Dakas' have begun to build a bridge between Albanian
and ethnic Albanian, driving from refugee camp to refugee camp with
supplies and volunteers. They've gathered enough foreign donations
to support six refugee centers in the port city of Durres, and
they've organized local volunteers in Tirana to entertain children
in the camps with puppet shows.
</P>
<P>
   They've made the eight-hour drive to the border town of Kukes,
where thousands of refugees first arrived. Friday, Chris drove to a
mattress factory outside Tirana, carrying $2,700 in US bills to pay
for 300 foam mattresses and ensure they were being made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live by faith,'' he said, watching men in masks pour hot
foam into metal boxes to form the rudimentary beds. ``We spend the
money we've got and we hope the donations will follow.''
</P>
<P>
   In Durres, where several hundred Kosovars have recently arrived
into makeshift shelters, Chris was greeted by the mayor _ a robust
man who smiled and pumped Chris' hand up and down in gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Arqile Gorea had agreed to give the Dakas' control of
several municipal buildings. They, in turn, are managing nearly
1,000 of the 30,000 refugees in the port town, shipping tons of
flour and food into the 170,000-person community, trying to prevent
the instability that many outsiders fear will take over the region
as a result of the influx of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Gorea said it was a ``big, big thing for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple do not presume they will help more than a fraction of
the refugees. Laura has informally adopted 28 Kosovars _ ``I am
like their mother'' _ bringing them kitchenware and cash. But she
has declared that her cutoff point for personally caring for
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, they are ad hoc parents to scores of
Americans as well _ relief workers, diplomats, journalists. The
Dakas' have opened the doors of their mission, Qendra Stefan, to
explain the quirks of the nation that many until recently could not
find on a map.
</P>
<P>
   Chris, who became a Christian at age 32, and Laura, say a prayer
before each supper, asking for guidance for the refugees.
Afterward, they retire to bed, locking the giant door to their
mission, which Josif described as ``safer than Fort Knox.'''
</P>
<P>
   But they say they never think of getting out.

   Some Profitable Broadening For the Boss' Portfolio  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How do you send a chief executive's compensation soaring if his
own company's shares are merely doing well? In the case of SBC
Communications, one of the Baby Bells, the board's answer seems to
have been to sweeten the pay of its top executive, Edward Whitacre,
with shares in a hot telecommunications software company he doesn't
even run.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a 1998 pay package worth $15 million, including
SBC stock options, Whitacre received a ``special retention award''
of $12.5 million worth of units, at the initial offering price,
representing stock in Amdocs Ltd., in which SBC has a 23 percent
interest.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that Amdocs has been the better performer,
with a return of 60.7 percent, compared with 29.2 percent for SBC,
since Amdocs went public on June 19.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear why so much of Whitacre's pay should be tied
to the returns of a company that has only a slight impact on SBC's
overall performance, said Graef Crystal, editor of
crystalreport.com an Internet newsletter on executive compensation.
Amdocs has about $400 million in annual sales, less than 2 percent
of SBC's $28.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Paying an executive in another company's stock ``is a pretty
rare practice,'' Crystal said.
</P>
<P>
   If SBC's goal was to reward Whitacre with a hot stock, as
Crystal speculates, he wonders why the board did not simply give
him shares in Amazon.com, an even hotter performer. Though SBC has
no stake in it, Amazon.com, ``has about as much relationship to SBC
as a whole as does Amdocs itself,'' Crystal said.
</P>
<P>
   SBC explained in its proxy statement that it paid this bonus to
ward off ``inquiries and offers from competitors'' for Whitacre's
services and that it chose Amdocs units because the Amdocs
investment, which was made under Whitacre's management, had been so
good for SBC and its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The Amdocs public stock offering coincided with the decision to
award Whitacre the shares, according to SBC general counsel James
Ellis. ``There was no expectation that Amdocs would grow faster
than SBC,'' he said. ``It was more or less a timing issue.''

   When Jack Rudin, the New York real estate executive, and his
wife, Susan, wanted some help with the yard work, they called on
Bette Midler. It helps that the yard is Central Park and that Ms.
Midler has an apartment facing it. At a party last week honoring
contributors to the Central Park Conservancy's Perimeter
Association, for which Mrs. Rudin is co-chairwoman, Ms. Midler
provided the star power.

   Biting Hands Before They Feed Him
</P>
<P>
   For a man in search of a foreign partner to contribute capital
and skill to his struggling bank, Masao Nishimura, the president of
the Industrial Bank of Japan, is a surprisingly vocal critic of
Western companies and their financial advisers.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday, he accused Jurgen Schrempp, the
head of DaimlerChrysler, of violating the terms of a contract with
Nissan Motor Co., one of IBJ's biggest and most troubled clients,
and otherwise excoriated the business tactics of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   In March, DaimlerChrysler walked away from a deal with Nissan,
which then concluded a pact with Renault. Nishimura said the timing
of an announcement by Schrempp had conflicted with the terms of a
contract with Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   IBJ spokesman Hidehiko Ogawa said Friday that Nishimura was
raising questions about Schrempp's disclosure of a meeting with
Yoshikazu Hanawa, the president of Nissan, as a possible violation
of the usual secrecy of merger talks. (Never mind that the original
leaks about the talks emerged from a Nissan plant in Britain.)
</P>
<P>
   There was no conflict between Nishimura's comments and the
bank's search for foreign capital, Ogawa said.
</P>
<P>
   Nishimura also took to task Goldman Sachs, DaimlerChrysler's
adviser during the Nissan talks, suggesting that it might have had
a hidden agreement with another American investment bank, J.P.
Morgan, which was advising Nissan. ``I think it is possible the
foreign firms together made a secret deal behind the scenes,''
Nishimura said. He did not elaborate, but Goldman and J.P. Morgan,
both of which had no comment, could have been expected to make a
good deal more money had the deal gone through.
</P>
<P>
   Nishimura's mention of Goldman was particularly surprising since
he had been saying that Goldman would participate in a joint
venture with IBJ and Nomura Securities in pension fund management.
Goldman is only one of the foreign financial companies that IBJ has
approached for new money to replace the capital being eaten away by
its bad debts.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Nishimura described foreign financiers as a rather
rapacious lot. ``Foreign firms simply overcharge you,'' he said,
adding that they ``come here to take a shot at a corporate deal and
make quick profits, but they do not care about what may happen to
the companies involved after the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   He offered the example of an insurance company seeking to
demutualize, saying that a foreign adviser would charge fees of
about 3 million yen, or $25 million at current exchange rates,
while IBJ would do the job for a third of that price.

`I DIDN'T HAVE A GRAND PLAN,' BUSH SAYS OF HIS YOUTH IN HOUSTON (2
TAKES) 
 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, April 11) 
 
By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ President Clinton cherishes his Arkansas town called
Hope. President Reagan was misty-eyed about life in little Dixon,
Ill., and President Carter spun stories about his farm in Plains,
Ga.
</P>
<P>
   When Texas Gov. George W. Bush tells his story as a candidate
for president, though, it will include a central chapter on a place
that is anything but romanticized small-town America.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, with a family pedigree and a Yale University
undergraduate diploma that might have opened doors anywhere in the
privileged world, Bush flew home to the nest in Houston with no
long-term goals under his wings.
</P>
<P>
   Houston was his off-and-on hometown for 15 years that included
the social and political spasms of the 1960s _ an era that Bush
says has soiled the moral fabric of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Houston was where he bounced restlessly from a downtown
corporate job to social work in black neighborhoods, from flying
military jets over southeast Texas during the Vietnam War to
working in political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Now he prides himself on reaching out politically to minorities,
and he faces questions about what his military policies would be as
he takes his campaign experience nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Houston was where he raised a little hell on the party circuit,
became engaged and broke it off, faced the expectations of an
accomplished and wealthy family, used family connections to land a
variety of jobs and, in a cock-sure way, avoided designing a
strategy for his life.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as a leading contender for the White House, he faces a
thorough examination of his personal behaviors and ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a grand plan,'' Bush said about his Houston
years in an interview last week. But, he added, ``I don't think the
plan will ever be clear. I didn't sit down dreaming about running
for president. I have been a bit more spontaneous in my
decision-making.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said famously that he was ``young and irresponsible''
in his youth. He has refused to answer questions about whether he
used marijuana or cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   But friends and acquaintances from the time say that in Houston,
Bush sat out much of the wild personal experiments of the 1960s.
They say he was responsible to the extreme in his hometown, that he
was steeped in the formality of a well-off life and that he cut
loose only in the context of a single man who drank and liked
single women.
</P>
<P>
   There is one suggestion that Bush shared in his generation's
rebelliousness, chafing against the politics of his father, former
President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Houston art supply dealer Benton Russell said that George W.
Bush, a Republican who calls himself a compassionate conservative,
dabbled in left-wing causes and campaigns in Houston while his
father served in the U.S. House.
</P>
<P>
   As the liberal Peace and Freedom Party candidate in the 1970
U.S. Senate race, Russell pushed for women's rights and minority
rights and thought marijuana should be legalized. His opponents
were Bush's Republican father and Democrat Lloyd Bensten Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaigned vigorously for his father. But Russell said Bush
at the same time helped organize voters for the Peace and Freedom
Party and for the cause of electing progressives to the Houston
school board.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just liked our issues better than his father's,'' Russell
said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he has no recollection of that ever happening,
and that he would have done nothing to undermine the candidacy of
his father, for whom he has shown vigilant love and respect.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not wax nostalgic on how Houston shaped him as he grew
from a young teen-ager to a college graduate and a white-collar
worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard,'' Bush said. ``I'll leave how I was formed to the
psychoanalysts. Obviously Houston had an impact on me because I
lived there for a period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was born in 1946 in New Haven, Conn., home of Yale
University, where his father earned a degree.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after his birth, his father moved their family to Midland,
Texas, to start an oil business. Bush says he picked up a sense of
pioneer optimism in the remote Midland-Odessa area of Texas near
New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Moving again for business opportunities, the family arrived in
Houston in 1959, the year Bush turned 13. He had attended public
schools in Midland. But in Houston, his parents enrolled him for
two years in the prestigious, private Kinkaid School. Following his
father's path, he later attended high school at Phillips Academy in
Andover, Mass., and college at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Houston for most of the summers, working during
his college years as a sporting goods salesman at the Sears Roebuck
and Co. store on Main Street, as a clerk at a downtown brokerage
firm and as an oil field roughneck in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967 _ the year Dustin Hoffman starred in a ground-breaking
film, ``The Graduate,'' about an upper-income college man straining
against his family's expectations _ Bush became engaged to Cathryn
Wolfman of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   She grew up, like Bush, in the upper-crust Tanglewood area of
west Houston. She attended Smith College in Northampton, Mass.,
like Bush's mother. After being injured in a sledding accident at
Smith, Wolfman transferred to Rice University in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Within six months of the engagement announcement, however, ``we
just grew apart,'' Bush said. ``I was crazy about her, but we
decided not to get married in between my junior and senior year in
college.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years after the breakup, Wolfman got married in Houston. She
did not return recent calls from the Chronicle to her home in Palo
Alto, Calif. In an interview with The Dallas Morning News, she was
no more specific than Bush about the reasons for their break-up.
</P>
<P>
   Bush finished work toward a history degree at Yale in May 1968 _
one month after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and
three months after Yale student body leaders signed an Ivy League
manifesto saying they were ``seriously considering or have already
decided to leave the country or go to jail rather than serve in
(the war in) Vietnam.'' Bush was not among the signers.
</P>
<P>
   With no chosen career and no plans to attend graduate school,
Bush _ the son of a World War II Navy pilot who became a
congressman _ no longer had a student exemption from the Vietnam
War draft. He faced a choice of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your options either were to avoid the draft or sign up, and I
signed up,'' Bush said.

TROOPS MADE THE DIFFERENCE IN US EFFORT IN BOSNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton was deciding whether US
warplanes should lead a NATO bombing effort to resolve the Kosovo
crisis, his advisers predicted that it could be just as effective
as the airstrikes that helped end the Bosnian conflict in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, the bombing pushed the Serbs to sign a peace
agreement. But now, the airstrikes have hardened Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's resolve and resulted in a mass expulsion of
ethnic Albanians from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Why hasn't the bombing halted the conflict in Kosovo as it did
in Bosnia? There are a number of reasons, but foreign policy
experts say the biggest difference comes down to a key issue facing
Clinton: ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bosnian war, the Bosnian Muslims and the Croatians had a
formidable, well-equipped, well-trained army that was in the
process of pounding the Bosnian Serbs into making a peace
agreement. The NATO bombing then helped persuade the Serbs to seal
such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``In Bosnia, yes, we bombed for 20 days,'' Brent Scowcroft,
national security adviser to former President George Bush, said in
an interview. ``What no one remembers is the bombing was
accompanied by a massive offensive by the Croatian army.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air power played a role that it normally does,'' Scowcroft
said. ``The number of times that air power alone has made people
change their minds _ I can't think of any.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, where NATO bombing entered its 17th day Friday, there
has been nothing like the Croatian army on the ground. Instead, a
poorly equipped group of rebels loosely gathered as the Kosovo
Liberation Army already was in retreat before the advancing Serbs.
By the time the NATO bombing began, the KLA was in disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference is that the smaller Bosnian Serb army fought
for Milosevic in Bosnia, while the larger and better-equipped
Yugoslav army is carrying the battle in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is extremely different,'' said Kurt Bassuener, associate
director of the Washington-based Balkan Action Council, which
advocates using ground troops in the current conflict. ``In Kosovo,
you don't have forces comparable on the ground as a counterweight.
You are trying to completely counter Serbian forces on the ground
with air power.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials publicly said they knew all
along that the situations in Bosnia and Kosovo were different.
Clinton has said that he had no choice but to act for humanitarian
reasons, and that he doesn't want to send ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president was getting advice that Milosevic would back
down in the face of airstrikes as he had done in Bosnia,'' said
Michael Hammer, a spokesman for the National Security Council at
the White House. ``But there was also a very clear-eyed view that
if he did not back down quickly, we would be prepared to follow
through until he did.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration continues to hope that relentless bombing,
including the battering of Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital,
eventually will persuade Milosevic to back down. While Milosevic
has declared a cease-fire, administration officials said the offer
is meaningless unless the refugees, along with international
peacekeepers, can return to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is different from Bosnia for other reasons. Unlike
Bosnia, which was divided among several ethnic groups, Kosovo had
an overwhelming ethnic Albanian majority, at least before the
refugee exodus. Before the war, as few as 7 percent of the
residents of the province were Serbs, according to some estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanians indicated in a 1992 vote that they wanted
Kosovo to merge with Albania. At that time, Milosevic was
proceeding with ``ethnic cleansing'' in Bosnia, expelling many
non-Serbs in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the overwhelming Albanian majority in Kosovo, Milosevic
has said he views the province as the ``heart of Serbia,'' a claim
he did not make about Bosnia. The Serbs lost a 14th century battle
in Kosovo to the Turks, an epic defeat that today is glorified by
many Serbs. Kosovo also has five historic monasteries considered
important to Orthodox Christian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the point of view of Serbian nationalist philosophy,
Kosovo is where Serbia became a nation, so Serbs say that Kosovo is
to them as Jerusalem is to the Jews,'' said Barnett Rubin, senior
fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ``Some mordant or
sardonic Serbs say they will do anything for Kosovo but live there.
Albanians have lived there for hundreds of years.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Bosnia, Rubin said, it doesn't have the same symbolic
importance. ``It is a place where Serbs live, but it is not the
cradle of their nation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer, the White House official, said Clinton's advisers were
well-aware of the meaning of Kosovo to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an understanding that Kosovo is more dear and near
to Milosevic's heart than Bosnia,'' he said. ``Clearly, these are
different situations. All these things were being factored into the
decision to use military strikes.''

 &HT;    Artists, designers create artful thrones for charity
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Enough about Y2K. Samuel Battle is ready to put all
technological year-end angst behind him.
</P>
<P>
   So the architect has designed one burned-out, slightly frazzled
chair for ``Chairish the Future,'' the sixth annual gala and
auction benefiting the Metro Atlanta Furniture Bank on April 25.
</P>
<P>
   The chair is festooned with computer parts, from cables and
disks to keyboard and mouse, and sprayed with chrome paint to give
it a 21st-century techie look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing that everybody's scrambling to address the problem, I
wanted to build something that empathizes with the complexity of it
all,'' said Battle of Ai Group Architects. ``The computer, as you
know, has evolved over the past 15 years, but the basic form, size
and shape of the chair is still the same and has not evolved like
the rear ends of many of my fellow Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The piece, with ``Y2K'' emblazoned like red graffiti across its
dome back, is among 120 chairs designed by Atlanta-area interior
designers and artists, professionals and students, to be auctioned
at Lenox Square. Last year's event raised more than $37,000 for the
nonprofit furniture bank, which distributes furniture to the needy.
This year's goal is $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got some really professional-looking chairs, in
terms of the depth of detail and quality,'' said Thomas Burr, event
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the event, sponsored by the Georgia chapter of
the American Society of Interior Designers, start with a blank
canvas, many of them unfinished chair frames donated by Shelby
Williams Industries. From there, they are limited only by their
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Robbie Barber, a student at the Atlanta College of Art, spent 26
hours gluing Lego blocks onto the seat and legs of a chair to
create the Lego Candy Machine Chair. The back has been replaced
with a contraption through which M&AMP;Ms can be deposited; the candy
then trickles onto the seat. ``Since I have seven grandchildren, I
have much experience with Legos and candy,'' her artist's statement
reads.
</P>
<P>
   There are also:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Paul Domini's hand-painted A Place for Cleopatra's Asp, a
replica of the famed imaginary chair made for the queen's snake.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Alisa Lewis' Tourister Chair containing old decoupaged
postcards, white feathered wings and a 1960s American Tourister
suitcase _ the inspiration for the piece.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tinka Green's The Key to the Mystery, a wooden chair with the
Greek key design, autographed phrases containing the word ``key''
(Key West, key hole, Francis Scott Key, skate key, Key lime pie)
and a collection of brass and metal keys dangling from hooks.
</P>
<P>
   Minimum bids range from less than $100 to more than $6,000. And
to sweeten the pot, a dozen national furniture manufacturers,
including Knoll, Bernhardt and PierceMartin, have donated chairs _
the totally functional kind, said J.Ed. Marston, the furniture
bank's assistant director.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because furniture, as a whole, is part of the art
community.''
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   ``Chairish the Future'' gala and auction
</P>
<P>
   Where: Lenox Square, Neiman Marcus wing, Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   When: 8 p.m. April 25. The chairs will be on display for silent
bidding from April 19 to the day of the gala, when the most
sought-after entries will be sold during a live auction.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets: $70, or $60 in advance; includes an open bar and food.
</P>
<P>
   Information: 404-355-8530, Ext. 223.

   SEATTLE _ Anybody who loves the marine environments and maritime
communities of the Pacific Coast should, albeit with a bit of pain,
read John Keeble's ``Out of the Channel: The Exxon-Valdez Oil Spill
in Prince William Sound.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is an investigative work, as well as a personal memoir,
of the greatest environmental disaster to hit the United States,
and of its yet-to-end aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Originally issued after the spill, ``Out of the Channel'' has
been updated to show how the spill set off a succession of
discouraging events. They include the high death rates in a killer
whale pod that resides in the pristine environment fouled by the
spill, the destructive clearcutting of forests by cash-strapped
native corporations, and a back-door deal between Exxon and a group
of seven Seattle-based seafood processors.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon quietly paid out a $70 million settlement for fishing
losses to the ``Seattle Seven.'' Secretly, however, the processors
agreed to apply for their share of any punitive damages awarded to
fishermen suing the oil giant. They would then hand the money back
to Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   A writing professor at Eastern Washington University, Keeble has
an eye for characters. Several are from the village of Cordova,
Alaska, whose fishermen fought against construction of the
Trans-Alaska Pipeline and warned that the Alyeska Pipeline Co. was
not prepared to deal with a spill.
</P>
<P>
   He relates a memorable prediction, delivered by phone to a
meeting in Valdez just six hours before the Exxon-Valdez went
aground on Bligh Reef. It came from Dr. Riki Ott, a marine
biologist and Cordova-based gillnetter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the high frequency of tankers into Port Valdez, the
increasing age and size of the tanker fleet, and the inability to
quickly contain and clean up an oil spill in the open water of
Alaska, fishermen feel that we are playing a game of Russian
roulette,'' Ott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When, not if, The Big One does occur and much or all of the
income from a fishing season is lost, compensation for processors,
support industries and local communities will be difficult if not
impossible to obtain,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The prediction has proven remarkably accurate. Exxon has used a
multiplicity of appeals to avoid paying a $5.3 billion civil
judgment awarded in 1994 by an Anchorage jury. In Cordova, the
largest cannery has closed. The value of a fishing license is
perhaps one-tenth of what it was before the spill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of the Channel'' is not a book of stereotypes. Keeble is
sympathetic to Capt. Joe Hazelwood, depicted as a drunken
ne'er-do-well even though he wasn't on the bridge at the time of
the accident. Keeble is scathing toward the U.S. Coast Guard for
its haphazard tracking of tankers and can't-happen-here attitude.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, Exxon has cleverly cut its losses from the '89
disaster. Its scientists claim that Prince William Sound has
completely recovered. Oil company apologists in the media have
taken to beating up Cordova, claiming the fishing village is
inhabited by people with nothing to do in the winter but watch
television and endlessly complain.
</P>
<P>
   Keeble presents a far truer picture. His Cordova is a town that
refuses to let Prince William Sound become the petroleum industry's
Potemkin Village, and dares to assert that a multinational company
must pay for the damage it did to a once-vibrant economy.

   TIRANA, Albania _ Fighting broke out along the border of Albania
and Kosovo early Friday and lasted throughout the day as Serbian
forces and Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas exchanged machine gun
fire and mortar shells.
</P>
<P>
   Several mortar shells landed in Albanian territory early in the
morning, and four loud explosions were heard late afternoon in the
most serious frontier skirmish since NATO bombing of Yugoslavia
began, said Andrea Angeli of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe. Friday night Yugoslavia briefly opened the
border _ to expel about 2,000 ethnic Albanians who had been forced
from their homes in the wartorn Kosovo province, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   The shifting border situation reflected a day of escalating
military action and diplomatic tensions, a day that also saw the
collapse of a Cypriot attempt to free three American soldiers held
captive by Yugoslavia since March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Among Friday's developments:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Pentagon said it had ``a reliable report'' that young
Kosovar women had been herded into a military training camp at
Dakovica, in southwest Kosovo, and systematically raped by Yugoslav
soldiers. As many as 20 women may have been killed, a Pentagon
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Kremlin denied reports that President Boris Yeltsin had
ordered Russian strategic missiles be targeted at NATO countries
taking part in the air war against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   _ NATO officials confirmed that one of its bombs aimed at a
telephone center in Pristina, Kosovo, accidentally fell on a
residential neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   _ Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican, said the Senate
will debate the issue of ground troops next week and ``talk about
what it takes for us to win this conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, Cyprus' acting president, Spyros Kyprianou, met for
90 minutes Friday with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic but
said he came away ``disappointed,'' believing the severe NATO air
campaign had hurt his chances for obtaining the US soldiers'
release. ``The intensified heavy bombing of the last couple of days
made my humanitarian mission more difficult,'' said Kyprianou,
Cypress's acting president.
</P>
<P>
   But US officials insisted there would be no negotiation to free
the soldiers, and President Clinton said Milosevic's promise of a
cease-fire over the Orthodox Easter weekend was a ``half-measure''
that NATO had to reject. ``What we have from Mr. Milosevic today is
not even partial compliance but the illusion of partial
compliance'' with conditions for an end to the NATO bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Milosevic still thinks he can manipulate the situation by
cynically using innocent people,'' Clinton said at the White House.
``He hopes that we will accept as permanent the results of his
ethnic cleansing. We will not.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said, ``Milosevic's actions have strengthened the
unity and resolve of the allies.'' But it was clear the White House
was disturbed by reports that Yeltsin, a harsh critic of the
bombing campaign, had discussed targeting nuclear weapons at NATO
allies and was threatening military action in support of the Serbs
if NATO deployed ground troops in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright got assurances Friday
from Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov that Moscow did not intend to get
involved militarily in Yugoslavia, said State Department spokesman
James P. Rubin. Neverthless, Rubin said Albright would meet with
Ivanov Tuesday in Oslo to discuss the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials dismissed Belgrade's claims that it was
observing a cease-fire, and for the first time US officials charged
Serb forces with a specific atrocity: the systematic rapes of
ethnic Albanian women in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very eerie and disturbing echo of documented
instances of rape and killing of women in Bosnia during the Bosnian
war, and it is obviously outrageous,'' said Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth H. Bacon, noting that US officials would attempt to confirm
the story, which was based on a single, ``reliable'' report.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon also announced the deployment of six more F-15C fighters
and an extension of the USS Inchon's tour in the Eastern
Mediterranean to support the NATO force.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the weather deteriorated Friday, NATO pressed its
relentless air attack on military-industrial plants, fuel depots,
and communiciations centers around Belgrade and on Serbian forces
in Kosovo. On Thursday night a storage depot at Smederevo, 18 miles
from Belgrade, was hit, as was a factory at Kragujevac, which NATO
said produces military materiel as well as the Yugo automobile.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman David Wilby, air commodore of the British Royal
Air Force, said the military campaign inside Kosovo was ``moving in
the right direction'' but is difficult and far from finished.
``This is not an easy operation,'' Wilby said. ``We're up against a
wily enemy. He's beginning to dig in....It is quite difficult to
spot him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilby said one NATO bomb dropped Wednesday ``was seduced off the
target'' _ Pristina's main telephone exchange building _ and landed
in a small civilian neighborhood nearby. On Thursday, Wilby denied
Serb reports that NATO bombing had destroyed civilian sites and
killed 10 people in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Wilby said NATO intelligence noted a buildup of Serbian forces
north of Kosovo, but he could not confirm reports of fighting
between Yugoslav forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian forces have exchanged fire with local Albanians along
the border in the past, but Friday's skirmish was ``different
because of the context,'' Angeli said. ``There has been fighting
before, but a full day like this we haven't seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Angeli could not confirm official Albanian reports that four KLA
members were killed near Tropoje, just south of the Kosovo border.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav army accused Albania of ``aggression'' and said KLA
supporters would ``have to bear the consequences for the eventual
flare-up of the war in the Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees report that the KLA, which has set up training camps in
Albania's mountains, recently recruited hundreds of new members as
refugees crossed the border from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials expressed fears about the fate of the ``car
people'' _ Kosovars in a 12-mile line of autos along the border who
abandoned their cars when the frontier was sealed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know where the people are,'' said Jamie Shea, a NATO
spokesman. ``Perhaps they have crossed over into Albania on foot,
perhaps they have been turned back inside Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO estimates as many as 200,000 Kosovars are homeless inside
their land, living in the woods and the mountains. Red Cross and UN
relief workers have not been allowed access to them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Kosovo, the refugee situation is slowly improving, Shea
said, as more camps have been set up or are being planned in
Albania and Macedonia, and large supplies of food, water, and
medical supplies are reaching the refugee centers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several hundred refugees from the region were
airlifted to Germany, Turkey, Norway, Switzerland, and Bulgaria.
More than 400,000 refugees have fled Kosovo since the NATO bombing
began March 24.

 &HT;    My garden on the go thrives in state of flux
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Whenever I point out to visitors the various plants
that have been shifted here and there in my garden, I always note
that they get moved so much they ought to be on wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Their growing too large for the space, my miscalculation of the
light, and just plain poor design _ the wrong place for the plant _
are among the reasons for these rough moves.
</P>
<P>
   I say rough because I long ago stopped moving plants gently; as
many times as I have to do this, I look for expediency, which means
digging just enough around an established tree or shrub to pry it
out of the ground without losing too much of its root support.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I know such moves may make the transition more difficult,
but I also have learned that plants are a lot tougher than I once
thought.
</P>
<P>
   That fine reality shows itself graphically in the Japanese black
pine that I moved a couple of years ago. After several years on the
sunny side of the house, the tree outgrew the space, threatening to
branch out into the driveway. I had thought a while about moving it
but didn't get seriously motivated until I was about to leave home
for a party one Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Hastily and with care not to trash my party clothes, I ripped
the unsuspecting tree from its longtime home and thrust it into a
new hole. Watering it in, I lamented the 90-degree day and my
inability to wait for cooler weather, but sometimes a change just
comes over you. I hoped I hadn't made my move too soon. So far the
pine stands as a poster plant for surviving against the odds.
</P>
<P>
   I've moved several plants in search of some way to make them
bloom. A rose with no name seemed to be getting enough sun, but
still it seemed stifled by surrounding plants, including juniper,
pine, blue balloon flower. Last year I moved it a few feet, to a
more open spot, and now I see buds.
</P>
<P>
   Lilac took a much longer trip _ to McCaysville (Ga.), a hundred
miles away. But not before it had gotten moved a couple of times in
my Atlanta garden.
</P>
<P>
   Many gardeners from up North tell me that lilac is the plant
they miss most when they move down South _ despite the wealth of
scented plants thriving in this region. Lilac just won't bloom
here, they say.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen successful lilac plantings around Atlanta, but not in
my garden. I lost a couple despite coddling them mightily, adding
lime to their soil; they declined mysteriously.
</P>
<P>
   Then, I decided to move one from sun to light shade. After a
couple of springs it was still alive but showed no signs of
blooming. So, I moved it to another, cooler section, on the north
side of the house. Still nothing. Last fall, I moved it to
McCaysville, having heard that the North Georgia mountain climate
is more New Jersey than Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   To my surprise and delight this week, I noticed little bud
clusters, looking like green caviar.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know whether the lilac was fooled into thinking it was
north of the Mason-Dixon line or whether it just got tired of
getting moved. Whatever, this long-sought success is enough to keep
my garden on the go.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of gardening moves, I can't contemplate any without
thinking of how, after years in Saturday's paper (and Friday's
before that), this column is heading for Thursdays. See you then.

BUSH-YOUTH-2ND TAKE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (UNDATED: Bush said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But Bush did not directly sign up for combat in Vietnam. Before
leaving Yale, Bush signed papers for entrance into the Texas Air
National Guard unit at Houston's Ellington Air Force Base. While on
call for possible participation in the war, the unit flew fighter
planes over southeast Texas, said former commander and retired Gen.
Walter Staudt, now of New Braunfels, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush earned certification as a pilot and was never called to
war.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he joined the unit, rather than volunteer for Army
combat duty, because he wanted to learn how to fly jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was going into the military and would have liked to
come out with a skill,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Staudt said he had met Bush's congressman father while serving
as a member of a Houston Chamber of Commerce aviation committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Staudt, like the governor, said no one exerted influence to
get Bush into the unit _ and that none was needed. Few applicants
offered the time commitment and the intelligence required for
admission into pilot training, Staudt said, so Bush was a
more-than-qualified candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Staudt said he never questioned the motives of prominent young
men who enlisted in the Guard rather than ask to be sent to
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the stuff hit the fan (in Vietnam), the whole unit would
have gone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush trained at bases in San Antonio, Texas, and Valdosta, Ga.,
while the Woodstock music festival in upstate New York captured the
``free love'' spirit of his generation. Bush returned to Houston in
1969 as the flier of single-seat F-102 planes, made in 1953, and
flew routine, local missions for the unit through mid-1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got behind it in the cockpit, you realized how serious it
was,'' Bush said. ``It required obviously a certain amount of
skill, and a lot of focus and attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's routine release from full-time Guard service allowed him
to dive into his father's 1970 Senate campaign. He traveled the
state giving speeches on his father's behalf, helped coordinate
college interns for the campaign and, on one occasion, strolled
shirtless behind his father on a charity walk, smirking in the
Houston heat.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was supremely confident, according to New Mexico
businessman Dan Gillcrist, who was the 1970 campaign's scheduler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where you get that (confidence), but I see it in
others,'' Gillcrist said. ``I had brothers who were fighter pilots.
They just know when they get up there, they are going to kick ass.
And that's one of the characteristics I would chisel in stone for
(Bush). Some people see that as cockiness, but it's in the eye of
the beholder. I just think he knows what he can do, and he has no
reservations about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush lived then at Chateaux Dijon, an apartment complex near
Houston's upscale Galleria shopping area. The complex was known for
its singles scene, which included water volleyball games in its
swimming pools. Gillcrist said he saw Bush take a hearty approach
to his social life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you want a president who was some kind of person who
never left his room? He had fun and partied and raised a little
hell like the rest of us,'' Gillcrist said. He added that Bush was
``a normal young man'' who didn't pass up the opportunity to flirt
with any attractive single woman he met at a party.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush enjoyed single life, he hurt deeply for his father
when he lost the 1970 Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   But seeing his father absorb the defeat and move on with his
career helped him take the plunge as a first-time candidate eight
years later, the governor said. Bush lost a U.S. House race in west
Texas in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   After his father's 1970 campaign, Bush moved to a garage
apartment on tree-lined North Boulevard near Rice University.
Sampling the coat-and-tie corporate world that fit many Yale
graduates of the time, he went to work for Stratford of Houston, an
agricultural company owned by Robert Gow, who had attended Yale and
roomed with a Bush relative.
</P>
<P>
   Four years before hiring Bush at Stratford, Gow was an executive
at the Houston oil company run by Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   Gow, still a Houston entrepreneur, said he hired Bush because
the young man was qualified for management training.
</P>
<P>
   ``His father had been good to me in the sense that he had hired
me,'' Gow said, ``but there was no sense that I owed them
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was dispatched alone to Ohio, Pennsylvania and other states
to size up plant nurseries Gow wanted to acquire. Gow said Bush was
a highly responsible worker, ``a buttoned-down Brooks Brothers
type.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush was restless. Gow said the two talked repeatedly about
how Bush could make a contribution to society in ``a nonbusiness
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Ensenat, who roomed with Bush at Yale and on Houston's
North Boulevard in 1971, said Bush was a high-energy, outgoing,
``never boring'' young man who was secure in the fact that he would
eventually find inspiration for his life's work.
</P>
<P>
   Ensenat said that although he and Bush probably were
conservative for their age group, illegal drugs were available in
their social circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was there if you wanted to do it, but he didn't, as far as
I know,'' said Ensenat, now a New Orleans lawyer who has remained
close to the governor.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1973, former Houston Oilers football player John White
hired Bush to help run the Professional United Leadership League,
which turned athletes into mentors for poor African-American boys.
A press release from the time indicates PULL got off the ground in
1970 with financial grants from ``a few benevolent supporters'' _
especially Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong sports fan in search of a personal mission, Bush
forged a special bond with boys whose Houston upbringing in no way
resembled his own, said Ernie Ladd, a retired Houston Oiler who was
on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the first real white boy that all of the kids really
loved,'' said Ladd, now of Franklin, La.
</P>
<P>
   But in less than a year, Bush packed his bags again, giving up a
Houston address for the last time. He was accepted into Harvard
Business School, and White, the PULL founder who has since died,
urged him to go, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said White told him, ```Look, if you are really
interested in helping people, the best thing to do is to go to
Harvard Business School, and make some money, and come back and
help people.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bush graduated from Harvard in 1975 with a master's degree in
business administration. Retracing his family's steps, he moved to
Midland. He got into the oil business and married.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he moved to Dallas, becoming general managing partner
of the Texas Rangers baseball team. He won the governor's race in
1994 and 1998. By June, he is expected to hit the presidential
campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Bush tells voters that it's time for a ``responsibility era''
that holds individuals accountable for their actions and rejects
the 1960s-style blame-society approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really believes there was a cultural change in the '60s,
and he sincerely believes we can have that change back,'' former
Bush aide Dan Shelley told the Chronicle last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's thinking as a presidential candidate, therefore, will
hinge largely on the time he spent in Houston.

SPECIAL EFFORT MADE TO REUNITE CHILDREN, PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So many ethnic Albanian children have become separated from
their parents that human rights groups have set up emergency
stations in Macedonia's refugee camps to reunite them, according to
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unbelievable and terrible situation,'' said Randy
Ackley, an American Red Cross worker based in Macedonia. ``Matching
these unaccompanied children with their parents is our top
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers also are using computer databases, radio broadcasts,
and Polaroid cameras to trace separated family members. ``There
isn't anything more imperative than rejoining the children with
their parents,'' said Stephen Lewis, deputy director of the United
Nations Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Officials don't know how many children have been separated from
their parents but believe the numbers could run into the thousands.
Human rights workers have fanned out into the camps, handing out
leaflets and announcing on megaphones that parents who can't find
their children should register at the tracking tents.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two days, 450 parents have registered at the
stations. Some parents stop in with few, if any, documents
identifying their children. So they describe their children's
clothes or birth marks _ anything to help workers find them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are registering all types of details of the child _ their
age, maybe even a behavioral problem,'' Lewis said. ``When you set
up a tracking tent, it's like a magnet.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Fullemann, a spokesman for the International Committee of
the Red Cross, estimated that 100 people a day are reporting a
missing relative. ``But the focus right now is trying to find the
parents of the unaccompanied children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many families were separated when waves of ethnic Albanians fled
Kosovo, rights workers said. Other children were lost this week
when thousands of refugees abruptly were herded onto buses and
taken to neighboring Albania. Some were torn from their families
when assigned to other camps or were lost inside their own
encampments, Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Sadako Ogata, the UN high commissioner for refugees,
gently turned back an ethnic Albanian boy who ran up to her in the
Brazda camp, the first to set up a tracking station. The boy wanted
to know when he could go back to Kosovo. ``I would like to go there
too,'' Ogata told the boy, the Associated Press reported. ``We can
go back when we could go there safely.''
</P>
<P>
   Children woh remain in Kosovo apparently are trying to get out,
UNICEF said in Geneva. About 50 children already had come through
the border on the Albanian side on bicycles, using trails,
spokeswoman Marie Heuze said. ``It's very worrying because the
children are in a state of shock and can't tell us what has
happened to their families,'' she told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Many children are being cared for by other refugee families or
have been taken in by native Macedonians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a suspended nightmare for the children,'' Lewis said.
``It's very sad and traumatic and intensely important to get these
children reunified right away.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem, he said, is that Macedonia has made it difficult
for refugees to travel between camps, preventing some family
members from finding one another. But UNICEF has been using a
children's rights treaty, signed by the Balkan nations, to gain
more access to camps.

CAB DRIVER DENIES HE HOLDS $197 MILLION LOTTERY TICKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   BOSTON -- Patrick Okusanya, the Nigerian cab driver who has been
hiding since speculation spread three days ago that he won the $197
million Big Game lottery, hired a lawyer Friday to tell the world
he did not win.
</P>
<P>
   Okusanya walked into the Mattapan office of attorney Dane M.
Shulman at about 3 p.m. and pleaded with attorney John M. Ricci to
help him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He described it as the horror of his life,'' Ricci said.
``People don't believe him when he says he didn't win. He's getting
phone calls from his family in Nigeria. He's being hounded by
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricci and Okusanya talked for an hour in the lawyer's office,
and afterward Okusanya went to work _ but not at Town Taxi, the
garage that dispatches his cab. Ricci said it's unclear where
Okusanya was working, and that the two never talked about why
Okusanya hadn't returned the taxi _ and why he didn't speak up
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery of who won the lottery now grows, with some people
wondering if Okusanya is just trying to deflect attention by hiring
an attorney, and others wondering if the real winner is someone
else.
</P>
<P>
   The speculation about Okusanya being the winner started after
lottery officials announced Wednesday that the winning ticket in
the six-state Big Game was purchased at the Star Market in the
Fenway. The Town Taxi garage is about three blocks from the
supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the taxi firm's vice president John Ford was
telling reporters that he had heard that Okusanya had won from two
cab drivers who told him they had seen the winning ticket outside
Logan International Airport. That story seemed to grow as the hours
passed and Okusanya did not return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the lottery should give him some money for the
aggravation he's gone through, or somebody should,'' Shulman said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At a house Friday, where a man named Patrick Okusanya allegedly
lives, a woman who identified herself as his girlfriend yelled from
a window, ``He's not the winner. He's not the winner. He's going to
make a statement.''
</P>
<P>
   And earlier in the day, a man who identified himself only as
Patrick, left a message on a Globe reporter's voice mail saying:
``My name is Patrick. You have been going around telling people I
won the lottery. Please, I want you to stop it. For my security
reason. Stop going around telling people. For my security reason,
please. Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   A dispatcher at Town Taxi said Friday that Okusanya still hadn't
returned the taxi.
</P>
<P>
   As the speculation about Patrick Okusanya spread this week, so
did variations about his family. Many people who worked with him
said he was married and had several children and lived in Chelsea,
a Boston neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Shulman, the owner of the law practice, which specializes in
personal injury cases, said Okusanya came to his office because the
firm had represented him in the past. He declined to say on what
kind of case.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if perhaps Okusanya could be lying to keep his winnings
private, Ricci said he doubts Okusanya would do such a thing. Why
did the cabbie disappear for a time? Ricci says he just got scared
when the speculation began.
</P>
<P>
   Ricci said it wasn't until Okusanya's full name appeared in the
Boston Herald on Thursday that he decided to come forward to dispel
the speculation. Ricci said Okusanya never even had a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is really going through hell,'' Ricci said. ``He is
being paraded around the news as being the winner of the ticket.
People are hounding him and making his life impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, lottery spokeswoman Susan Frigoletto said Friday that
the agency has not commented on the speculation about Okusanya
because ``until somebody shows up with the ticket in their hand,
you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever has won the jackpot has a year from the Tuesday drawing
to claim the prize.

 &HT;    PENTAGON BEGINS MAJOR ESCALATION OF MASSIVE BOMBING CAMPAIGN
 &HT;    EDS: Optional trim at 800
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD and BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon, beginning a major escalation in the
massive bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, ordered six F-15C jet
fighters to Europe on Friday and made preparations to send some 50
additional warplanes to join the NATO air armada, a sign that the
allies are planning a protracted air war.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, hopes evaporated Friday for the early release of
three U.S. soldiers captured by Serb forces along the Macedonian
border. Spyros Kyprianou, the acting president of Cyprus who had
hoped to negotiate their release in the Yugoslav capital of
Belgrade, blamed the failure of his mission on continued NATO
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's call for more warplanes came amid confusing but
nonetheless eyebrow-raising warnings from Russian President Boris
Tylosin of ``a European war or even a world war'' if NATO ground
forces are sent into Yugoslavia. Hours later, the State Department
said it had received Kremlin assurances that Russia will not get
involved militarily in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   It also came as a barrage of allied air strikes on Orthodox Good
Friday targeted Yugoslavia's military-industrial complex as well as
supply and communication lines to the Serbian police and military
units _ the forces allegedly responsible for atrocities against
ethnic Albanians driven from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But after four relatively clear nights that created near ideal
conditions for NATO bombing, heavy clouds and fog impeded air
strikes as the conflict entered its 18th day on Saturday. Even so,
Gen. Sir Charles Garthis, the British chief of defense staff,
declared that the Serbian forces in Kosovo are ``on a slippery
slope'' as they are increasingly targeted by NATO planes.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials made new allegations of atrocities Friday, citing
``disturbing reports'' that young Kosovar Albanian women had been
raped and up to 20 killed at a Serb army training camp near
Dakovica in southwest Kosovo, a province in Serbia, Yugoslavia's
dominant republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very eerie and disturbing echo of documented
instances of rape and killing of women in Bosnia during the Bosnian
War,'' Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters. ``And it is
obviously outrageous that this is occurring.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bacon said the rape allegations came from credible
sources, there was no immediate independent confirmation. In
neighboring Bosnia, Serbs frequently used rape as a tool of terror
against Muslim women during three and a half years of fighting
there.
</P>
<P>
   In another troubling mystery, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea told
reporters in Brussels that the alliance had verified a line of
abandoned cars some 12 miles long inside Kosovo near the Albanian
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know where the people are,'' said Shea.
</P>
<P>
   Serb troops sealed the Albanian border early Wednesday, turning
back another group of thousands of ethnic Albanians who were
fleeing Kosovo and were forced to return to the embattled province.
Serb troops spent much of Thursday sowing land mines near the
border town of Morina.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has estimated that more than 600,000 ethnic
Albanians have fled Kosovo to take refuge in the neighboring
republics of Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we believe that there may be about 150,000 to 200,000
people in Kosovo currently living without shelter in the woods and
on the mountain slopes,'' said Shea.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the F-15C's dispatched to NATO on Friday are in
addition to dozens of other fresh warplanes already requested by
U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO commander. They would be
added to the 600 NATO aircraft waging ``Operation Allied Force.''
</P>
<P>
   The F-15C's, scheduled to deploy from Elmendorf Air Force Base
in Alaska, perform air-to-air combat missions to protect bombers
during air raids.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said Defense Secretary William Cohen is expected soon to
approve the additional planes, some 50 in all, including bombers,
jet fighters, radar-jammers and refueling tankers.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's reinforcement of Clark's air armada came as
President Clinton, accusing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
of presenting an ``illusion of partial compliance'' with NATO
demands, insisted on the ``unconditional return'' of the hundreds
of thousands of ethnic Albanians driven from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said NATO is determined to ``persist and prevail'' with
air strikes despite Milosevic's unilateral cease-fire and closure
of borders to prevent refugees from fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Milosevic still thinks he can manipulate the situation by
cynically using innocent people,'' Clinton said in brief remarks at
the White House. ``He hopes that we will accept as permanent the
results of his ethnic cleansing. We will not.''

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's hard line and the barrage of NATO air strikes across
Yugoslovia on Friday were blamed by Kyprianou for his failure to
gain the release of three U.S. soldiers held by Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia ``cannot resort to any peaceful gestures'' regarding
the American prisoners of war, Kyprianou said after a meeting with
Milosevic. ``It is impossible to achieve any results in the present
climate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, which has demanded the unconditional release of
the soldiers, was not surprised by the results of Kyprianou's
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic atmosphere was muddied even more by Yeltsin's
televised remarks during his meeting with the Communist speaker of
the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, Gennady Seleznyov.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have already told NATO, Americans and Germans: Don't force
us to take military action, since that will certainly lead to a
European war or even a world war, which is inadmissible,'' Yeltsin
said. ``Russia will not get involved in the armed conflict in
Yugoslavia unless the Americans force us into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Seleznyov also caused a diplomatic stir when he said after the
meeting that Yeltsin had given the command to re-target the nuclear
missiles ``against those countries which are carrying out military
action against Yugoslavia.'' Seleznyov later backed away from his
remarks, saying he had only discussed the possibility of re-aiming
the weapons, and the Kremlin and military commanders denied Yeltsin
had given the order.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unilateral truce declared by Milosevic, there were
reports that machine gun exchanges between Serb forces and Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA) guerrillas on the Albania-Kosovo border
escalated Friday into artillery shelling that killed four
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no indication whatsoever that the Serbs have ceased
fire,'' on the ground in Kosovo, said U.S. Air Force Gen. Charles
Wald, vice director for strategic plans for the U.S. Joint Chiefs
of Staff. ``They don't seem to be stopping their movement on the
Kosovo Albanians in Kosovo. And there are actually some reports of
atrocities.''
</P>
<P>
   The clash of Serbs and remnants of the KLA rebel force occurred
some 185 miles north of the Albanian capital of Tirana. It was the
first on the border for almost two weeks and erupted as the United
States prepared to fly in Apache anti-tank helicopters to Albania
to beef up NATO's air campaign against the Serbian soldiers
scattered in small units across Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia, which also borders Kosovo, reported Friday that its
forces had fired into Yugoslavia after a Macedonian soldier was
shot to death on the border with Kosovo a day earlier.

JAPANESE FEEL THE PINCH OF FALLING PRICES IN PET BEETLES

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Yumiko Tanuma held the 3\-inch-long beetle in her hand,
tried not to think of it as an overgrown cockroach and stroked it
gently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of cute,'' she pronounced, smiling tenderly as it
waved its pincers.
</P>
<P>
   It should be cute, considering its price. The beetle sells for
the equivalent of about $300 at the Tobu Department Store where
Miss Tanuma works.
</P>
<P>
   The sad thing for Japan's many beetle owners, though, is that
five or 10 years ago it might have sold for $6,000 or more. The
plunge in beetle prices has been catastrophic; it has wiped out the
value of used bugs that were once worth more than used cars.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows about the tumble in value of Japanese real
estate and financial assets like stocks. But it is not just office
towers and bank shares that have lost value over the last decade.
Almost every Japanese investment seems to have dropped in price,
from antique porcelain to racehorses _ and especially ohkuwagata,
the giant stag beetles that generations of Japanese have hunted and
raised as pets.
</P>
<P>
   For many Americans, it may be hard to understand the attraction
of buying large black bugs that try to pinch their owners. The
typical impulse on seeing an ohkuwagata would be to shriek and run.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who don't know bugs might say they look like
cockroaches,'' conceded Katsutoshi Misaki, the insect salesman at
Tobu Department Store. ``But they have different personalities _
this one is shy, that one is more aggressive and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I raise it and hold it in my hand,'' Misaki added, ``I
feel real affection for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese have had a passion for insects for more than 1,000
years, collecting crickets and various kinds of beetles and going
out at night to spend hours admiring fireflies and collecting them.
Foreigners visiting rural areas in Japan are sometimes startled to
be dragged out through the fields at night by their Japanese hosts
for firefly-watching and disquisitions on the merits of various
species of fireflies and crickets.
</P>
<P>
   Young Japanese have a special fondness for collecting beetles.
The rarest kind are ohkuwagata (Japanese is a far richer language
for beetles than English), a variety of stag beetle that hides in
rotten logs in remote mountains and is extremely difficult to find.
Thus in the ``bubble economy'' of the 1980s they became a valuable
commodity, and department stores began to sell them at prices that
until the early 1990s reached $7,000 for a single insect.
</P>
<P>
   One breeder says that six years ago a huge and superb ohkuwagata
sold for the equivalent of $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the stock and property markets made people
poorer and hurt prices, but market forces were also at work to
increase supply and pop Japan's bug bubble. Most important, insect
specialists figured out how to breed ohkuwagata.
</P>
<P>
   Supply soared and prices slumped catastrophically. Many
department stores stopped selling insects, and beetles lost some of
their cachet. These days almost all ohkuwagata come from breeders,
and most specimens sell for less than $100 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increase in supply will continue, because of the
breeding,'' said Kikuo Iwaguchi, an entomologist at Tokyo
University of Agriculture and Technology. ``I think prices will go
down, down, down.''
</P>
<P>
   In 10 years, he said, small ohkuwagata might sell for less than
$5.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Another factor in depressing prices has been the gray market in
imported beetles. Ohkuwagata also live elsewhere in Asia, and when
Japanese ohkuwagata were selling at outlandish prices, travelers
began to smuggle foreign ones into Japan. One advantage of the
foreign ohkuwagata is that they stay active year-round, while
Japanese ohkuwagata hibernate for several months in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Importing foreign beetles is illegal, but selling those that are
already in Japan is of uncertain legality. In any case, the imports
began to trade hands and depressed the market just as it was
collapsing anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smugglers would put threads on their ohkuwagata and tie them
up, and then put them in with their souvenirs,'' said Daiichiro
Koseki, an ohkuwagata breeder who sells foreign varieties. ``Or
they put them inside their clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   One might suspect that Japan is using the ban on beetle imports
to protect its own bug market, just as it curtails rice imports to
protect its own rice industry. The Japanese insect industry denies
that is the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not protectionism,'' said Hiroshi Fujita, editor of
Gekkan Mushi, which translates roughly as Bugs Monthly. ``It's to
protect ecology, because the fear is that the foreign beetles would
disrupt Japan's environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujita also said that the ohkuwagata market was too small for
Japanese bureaucrats to worry about. The whole market in Japan for
insects and accessories, he said, has annual sales that run only in
the tens of millions of dollars, although some estimates run into
the billions.
</P>
<P>
   While the bug market is now severely depressed, Tobu Department
Store still has one pair of ohkuwagata priced at $12,500 for the
two. They are so expensive because they have white eyes, a rarity,
but so far there have been no takers.
</P>
<P>
   Ohkuwagata live for four or five years, so owners have some time
to enjoy their pets _ some other kinds of beetles live a year or
less _ and they do not fly much, so an investment is unlikely to
disappear out the window. But of course owners have to look where
they step.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to watch them when you take them out for a walk,''
said Misaki, the insect salesman, with a nod to his $12,500
beetles. ``Otherwise, they could run away and disappear.''

U.S. WARNS RUSSIA AGAINST GIVING MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO SERBS

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The United States has quietly warned Russia
against providing military intelligence or assistance to Belgrade,
senior Western officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The confidential warning follows bitter complaints from Moscow
about NATO's airstrikes and the Kremlin's decision to dispatch a
Russian spy ship toward the Adriatic, where the American aircraft
carrier Theodore Roosevelt and other alliance ships have been
participating in the air campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials, a senior Western official said, ``have been
told that any effort by them to intervene in a militarily
significant way could have very serious consequences.'' The allies
have not said what these consequences could be. But evidence that
Russia was helping Belgrade would undermine public support in the
West for loans to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, while critical of
NATO, has pledged to stay out of the of the conflict in Yugoslavia.
But Friday he said that he would reconsider that position if NATO
troops entered Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials said that the message from the United States _
and similar warnings by Britain and other allied nations _ were
delivered before Yeltsin assailed NATO again Friday, insisting that
it refrain from sending group troops into Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings from the West, officials said, were prompted by
demands by Russia's parliamentary deputies that it share
intelligence with Yugoslavia, provide arms, send military advisers
or even volunteers to fight.
</P>
<P>
   So far, a senior Western official said, there is no proof of any
such cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The caution comes as the already wide gap between NATO and
Russians over Yugoslavia appears to be widening.
</P>
<P>
   NATO says its airstrikes are needed to force a halt in the Serb
ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, and facilitate an agreement on autonomy
for the ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO's bombing has compounded the sense of weakness and
humiliation many Russians feel following their nation's fall from
superpower status. Many Russian nationalist and Communist
politicians have expressed support for the Serbs and have little
sympathy for the plight of the Kosovar Albanians, whom they view as
Muslim separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, for his part, has sought to soothe nationalist
sentiment regarding Yugoslavia while maintaining good relations
with the West, no small consideration given Moscow's effort to seal
a new loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's earlier appeals that NATO avoid airstrikes were
ignored. So Friday, Yeltsin sought to draw a new line in the sand,
saying that Russia would rethink its decision not to intervene in
the Yugoslav conflict if the alliance launched a ground operation
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia will not interfere in the armed conflict in Yugoslavia
if American does not push it to do that,'' Yeltsin said. ``They
want to use ground troops, take over Yugoslavia, make it their
protectorate. We cannot allow this.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Yeltsin was referring to a land invasion,
which NATO has already ruled out, or whether he intended to refer
to a different scenario in which a NATO-led force might escort
ethnic Albanians back to Kosovo. The latter approach appears to be
NATO's basic game plan for now, though Western diplomats are
reluctant to discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   While Russia's vitriolic words have far outstripped its actions,
it has taken several steps that concerned military specialists
here.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yevgeni Primakov, for example, brought two senior
intelligence officials with him when he went to Belgrade last month
for talks: Colonel General Valentin Korabelnikov, the head of
intelligence for the Russian military, and Vyacheslav Trubnikov,
the head of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, heir to the old
KGB.
</P>
<P>
   That raised the possibility that Russia might provide Belgrade
with intelligence about how to fight the West. Russia's defense
minister, Igor Sergeyev, also accompanied Primakov, who previously
served as the head of the Foreign Intelligence Service himself.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, a Russia intelligence ship, the Liman, left the
port of Sevastopol soon after Primakov's visit in a step that
Russian officials described as a response to the allied airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Built in Poland in 1972, the surveillance ship is now steaming
around the north Ionian Sea, just south of the Adriatic, NATO
military officials said. A flotilla of ships, which Russia also
talked about sending to the Adriatic, has yet to leave the Black
Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The political sensitivities surrounding the dispatch of the
Russian spy vessel may exceed its military capabilities. Even
Pentagon officials are divided over its military significance.
</P>
<P>
   One senior Pentagon official described the ship as a giant
electronic ``sponge,'' which is designed to intercept the
communication by allied warships.
</P>
<P>
   This official said it was possible the Russians dispatched the
ship to learn about Western military operations for the benefit of
their own military. He said it was not clear whether the Russians
had the capability to quickly digest the information and pass it on
the Yugoslav military.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said the ship was of concern to allied military
planners.
</P>
<P>
   Other Pentagon officials, however, offered a less worrisome
assessment, noting that the United States had grown accustomed to
operating in international waters near Russian reconnaissance ships
during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not overly concerned about it,'' Rear Adm. Thomas
Wilson, the director of intelligence for the military's Joint
Staff, said in an interview. ``We can deal with it.''

<P>
   Vice Adm. Mikhail Barskov of Russia, the deputy chief commander
of the Russian Navy, said earlier this month that the ship was sent
``just to monitor the situation.'' Russian navy officials have said
they expect NATO to use electronic jamming to try to thwart the
Liman's electronic snooping.
</P>
<P>
   Still, any indication that the Russians were using the ship to
try to help the Yugoslav military could deal a major blow to
American-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
   For all the Russian complaints, both sides still seem to be
trying to prevent an even greater deterioration in American-Russian
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Gennady Seleznyov, the Communist speaker of the parliament, who
recently returned from a trip to Belgrade, insisted Friday that
Yeltsin had decided to re-target its nuclear missiles against the
United States and its allies.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and the United States have agreed to stop aiming their
nuclear missiles at each other in a largely symbolic understanding
to help reduce tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin said nothing about such a step and later Friday Russia's
foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, said no change in targeting had been
ordered.

NEW DANGER FOR ETHNIC ALBANIANS IN KOSOVO: STARVATION

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ About 700,000 ethnic Albanians, uprooted from their
homes by the Yugoslavs and now sealed inside the borders of Kosovo,
are at increasing risk of starvation as food stocks quickly
dwindle, Clinton administration officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials considered air drops of food, but rejected the idea as
too dangerous for NATO pilots, who would have to fly at low levels
and risk being hit by the Yugoslav ground fire, an official said.
The gravity of the situation is becoming clearer as analysts study
satellite imagery and destruction of Kosovo's infrastructure, and
assess interviews with refugees who have escaped.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton spoke about Kosovo for the
fifth day in a row and continued his public attacks on Slobodan
Milosevic, accusing him of blocking the escape routes of ethnic
Albanian refugees who wanted to flee Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Milosevic still thinks he can manipulate the situation by
cynically using innocent people,'' Clinton said. ``He hopes that we
will accept as permanent the results of his ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would not accept Milosevic's latest ploy of
claiming a cease-fire while closing the borders. The president
asserted that a quarter of Kosovo's people were living in refugee
camps outside Kosovo and that ``hundreds of thousands'' more were
trapped inside, afraid to go home but unable to leave.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the NATO bombing began, the
administration released details Friday of young ethnic Albanian
women being raped by Yugoslav soldiers at an army training camp
near the town of Dakovica.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said a single, but
reliable, source had provided ``very disturbing reports'' of mass
rapes, and it was believed that as many as 20 women may have been
killed. Bacon said the report was given added credence because it
fit the pattern of mass rapes by Yugoslav soldiers during the
Bosnian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, the American ambassador at large for
war crimes, David Scheffer, gave a public briefing on interviews he
made with refugees in Macedonia last week. The refugees, he said,
described the execution of military-age ethnic Albanian men and the
burning of villages.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden rush of information from the administration Friday on
atrocities committed by Milosevic's troops appeared aimed in part
at keeping up the public support for the airstrikes. The details
released by Scheffer Friday were not new: He returned from
Macedonia last weekend and his report was posted on the Internet
midweek.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls show that the American people are in favor
of the air campaign on the grounds that it is an assault against a
brutal dictator.
</P>
<P>
   But as the administration releases details of the atrocities,
officials must carefully calibrate the timing and tenor of the
information so that it does not appear that the NATO bombing is the
major cause of the calamity inside the province.
</P>
<P>
   The flow of information on the brutalities in Kosovo contrasts
with the denials by Washington that the Yugoslavs were holding
Bosnian Muslims in concentration camps in the early stages of the
Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Milosevic, by closing the borders of Kosovo two
days ago, was using the tactic of holding hundreds of thousands of
ethnic Albanians virtually hostage inside the province.
</P>
<P>
   With diminishing supplies of food and water, the ethnic
Albanians would increasingly suffer, officials said, putting the
Western allies in the awkward position of watching the population
it was trying to help, suffer even more.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's ploy of threatening to starve the remaining
population in Kosovo was already drawing the kind of attention that
the administration, adamant about not negotiating with Milosevic,
might find difficult to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. high commissioner for refugees was considering asking
NATO and Belgrade for permission to send an assessment team to
Kosovo to look at the food situation, a European diplomat said
Friday. Such a proposal would have to be negotiated with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of starvation inside Kosovo was of mounting
concern, an administration official said, because some of the
displaced people have been outdoors since before the NATO bombing
began.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There were believed to be about 700,000 people who had been
thrown out of their homes by the Yugoslavs who had found other
accommodation or were camping in the outdoors, the official said.
He could not estimate how many of the roughly 700,000 were outdoors
or indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Those most threatened with starvation were in the Shala
Mountains, the Berisha Hills and the Cicavica Hills, where people
were camping much as they were last autumn when 250,000 ethnic
Albanians came down from the hills after a ceasefire agreement with
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials have said for nearly two weeks that they believed
the condition of the ethnic Albanians inside Kosovo was far worse
than that of those who were expelled or had escaped.
</P>
<P>
   There were probably still stocks of food in Kosovo, the
administration official who has studied the intelligence reports
said, but the food was not near the displaced people who were
camped in the hills to avoid the Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   It was known, from officials of the Kosovo Verification Mission,
who evacuated from Kosovo five days before the bombing began, that
Yugoslav soldiers had torched large amounts of the food stocks
owned by ethnic Albanians. These officials also reported that the
last harvest, because of the upsurge in fighting, was very slim.
</P>
<P>
   A European military official said air drops had been rejected by
NATO last week as too risky. If planes assigned to air drops of
food flew high enough to avoid Yugoslav ground fire, the food
packages would probably be ruined by the time they hit the ground
or could fall into the hands of Yugoslavs.
</P>
<P>
   But, the military official said, the food situation was
deteriorating so fast that the possibility of air drops should be
examined again.
</P>
<P>
   In releasing some sketchy information about the reports of mass
rapes and the murder of as many as 20 women, Bacon drew some
parallels with the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very eerie and disturbing echo of documented
instances of rape and killing of women in Bosnia during the Bosnian
war, and it is obviously outrageous that this is occurring,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a reliable report, but it is not completely
confirmed yet,'' he said. ``Two things, I think, make it reliable.
One is the source, and I can't get into details about that. But,
two, it fits a pattern that we've seen in the Balkans before.`
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the Pentagon would attempt to confirm the reports of
the rapes and murders at Dakovica over the next few days through
interviews with refugees and `other ways.'
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups have estimated that more than 30,000 women
and young girls were sexually abused by Yugoslav forces during
earlier fighting in the Balkans, especially in Bosnia. Some Bosnia
Serb rapists explicitly told their Muslim victims that their
purpose was to impregnate them with Serbian babies.

TRAVEL TO SOME PARTS OF EUROPE STARTING TO BE HURT BY KOSOVO
CONFLICT

<P>
   The Balkans conflict and refugee crisis have started to hurt
leisure and business travel well beyond the combat zone, with
increasing numbers of Americans scrapping or delaying plans to
visit Europe during what ordinarily would be one of the best times
to go.
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents and tour operators say they have received
cancellations not only to Central and Eastern Europe, which is much
closer to the conflict, but also to popular destinations like Italy
and Greece and as far as Russia and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Sobered by television coverage of the nightly NATO bombings in
Serbia, the misery of Kosovo refugee families and anti-American
demonstrations in countries that support President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia, would-be American visitors to Europe are
deciding to make other plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a sister in Bologna, Italy, and we were thinking of
visiting her this summer,'' said Juan Sabalones, the director of
animal husbandry at the Newport Aquarium in Newport, Ky. ``But as
long as there's a war going on, I've decided to keep an eye on
things, and it's possible we may not go at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Tour operators say they have already noticed a small but
unexpected increase in bookings to the Canadian Rockies, South
America, Asia and America's national parks, which they attribute to
customers deciding against traveling to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Tauck, president of Tauck Tours, a big tour operator with
headquarters in Westport, Conn., said that while people were still
traveling to popular Italian and Greek vacation spots, ``we've had
cancellations this week, and the pace of bookings is suddenly
relatively flat.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, Tauck said, there were 42 bookings this week for
the company's three tours to Italy this year, compared with about
100 bookings for Italy in a normal week this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kang, the president of Maupintour, another big tour
company, in Lawrence, Kan., said that he had seen little effect on
tours to Turkey and Greece, but that ``bookings to Italy are
unexpectedly slow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason I can think of for that is that people see
Aviano on CNN, and they know it's a staging area in Italy,'' he
said. Aviano is the site of a NATO air base used in the bombing
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Many tour operators quickly postponed tours through Yugoslavia
when the crisis began building last month and detoured trips when
NATO began bombing on March 24. But now they are canceling tours
months into the future on the assumption that the conflict will
last a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Maupintour canceled two 16-day cruises that were scheduled to go
from Bucharest, Romania, to Vienna, Austria, through Belgrade and
other points in Yugoslavia, departing May 25 and June 2. Regina
Tours, which specializes in Catholic pilgrimages, canceled its
monthly 10-day tours to Medjugorje, Bosnia, through the rest of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Even National Geographic, which specializes in relatively
adventurous tours, decided to postpone until this fall a tour to
Turkey that had been scheduled from April 26 to May 12, and to
cancel its Treasures of Russian Waterway, scheduled from May 28 to
June 10. While the Russian tour was canceled because of concern
over turmoil in the Balkans, the Turkish tour was postponed over
concern with recent terrorist bombings in the country attributed to
Kurdish terrorists, National Geographic said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday the Association of Corporate Travel Executives issued a
``cautionary travel advisory'' warning members about traveling not
only to danger zones but also to other European cities. ``The PR
campaign waged by Serbian nationalists,'' said Earl Foster,
president of the 2,500-member association, ``has led to some
violent street protests in cities far from the battle. We're
advising our members to alert their travelers to these related
situations, specifically with an eye to avoiding them.''
</P>
<P>
   While the recent travel disruptions are not at all as widespread
as those surrounding the Persian Gulf War in 1991, the travel
industry's big concern is that the Balkans conflict could drag on
toward summer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The concern comes at a time when both the American economy and
the warming weather make it a particularly good time to visit
Europe. The dollar is strong, American incomes are rising, and many
people are spending money.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the evidence of a potentially serious slowdown in
travel to Europe is largely anecdotal. There are still signs that
travel to Europe remains little affected by the Balkans conflict.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. airlines said Friday that while there had been some
cancellations to central and Eastern Europe, on routes flown by
their European partners, there had been few cancellations to
Western European cities. ``April and May bookings are good,'' said
Tim Smith, a spokesman for American Airlines, ``and bookings for
the summer indicate those months will be strong.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Joseph Buhler, the U.S. chairman of the European
Travel Commission, said its member tourist offices in several
countries in the immediate region of the hostilities had reported a
slowdown in bookings, with scattered cancellations. But overall, he
said, members reported ``relatively little adverse impact on travel
to Europe as a whole due to the fighting in Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   To forestall cancellations, the cruise industry moved quickly to
keep out of harm's way. Three Cunard Line ships and two belonging
to Seabourn Cruise Lines _ both companies are owned by Carnival
Corp. _ substituted stops at Italian ports on the west coast of the
Adriatic for the previously scheduled stops at Dubrovnik and other
Croatian ports along the eastern Adriatic. Windstar Cruises has
substituted stops in Italy for scheduled stops in Dubrovnik and
Rab. Holland America's Maasdam replaced Dubrovnik on three European
itineraries with stops in Italy and Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've only had 15 or 20 cancellations,'' said Erik Elvejord, a
Holland America spokesman, ``but we've had a couple of hundred
calls from people concerned about those itineraries.'' He added
that bookings were lagging for the 12-day Venice-to-Venice
round-trip cruise, scheduled to depart April 19.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials say the reason the current fighting has not
depressed travel as much as during the Gulf War, when bookings on
U. S. airlines decreased 44 percent on trans-Atlantic routes in
1991, is that there is little fear of terrorism in connection with
the Balkans conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But most travel officials believe that a Balkans-inspired
terrorist incident in the West would set off a wave of airline
cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this turmoil and the demonstrations continue for a long
time, Americans are going to be afraid to go anywhere in Europe,''
said Predrag Krivokapic, whose Kompas Holiday International agency
in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., specializes in travel to Central and
Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Other travel officials agree. ```Especially if it's on TV on a
daily basis,'' said Tom Souza, executive vice president of Collette
Tours in Pawtucket, R.I.

PATRIOTS ACTIVE AHEAD OF THE DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although it won't actually take place until  &UR;  &LR; April 17, the
National Football League's annual draft really begins Saturday
morning with the New England Patriots waiting anxiously to see what
is going to transpire the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to call Chris Palmer (Saturday) and see what it is
going to take to get up to the first pick to take Ricky Williams,''
said Saints general manager Bill Kuharich. ``If we can't make a
deal there, then we will call Philadelphia, Cincinnati,
Indianapolis, and Washington, all the way down the top five
picks.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer is the head coach of the Cleveland Browns, who have the
first pick. New Orleans is willing to give up its entire draft, and
either more picks or players next year, to get into position to
take Williams, the Heisman Trophy-winning running back out of the
University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots would like to move up and get into position to
select Williams, but the Saints' proposal will just about take them
out of the running. However, most teams, including the Patriots,
rate Miami's fine running back, Edgerrin James, just a shade below
Williams. The Saints want to drop their explosive package as close
to the top as they can. Cleveland isn't quite sure what it wants to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, general manager Dwight Clark wants Williams, and
Palmer prefers Oregon quarterback Akili Smith. However, the
``organization'' (as in the opinion of all scouts, assistant
coaches, etc.) likes Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch. The Browns are
supposed to be sending a contingent of 11 people to work out Couch
Sunday morning; that workout will determine which direction they
go.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, picking second, seems intent on keeping the pick
and using it on a quarterback. There is a feeling that the Eagles
like Donovan McNabb of Syracuse over either Smith or Couch.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati, picking third, wants a quarterback, and didn't send
anyone to Williams's final workout last Tuesday in San Diego.
Although scouts from other teams in attendance didn't think
Williams worked out well (slower than expected and didn't catch the
ball well), Kuharich wasn't disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just what we thought it would be,'' he said. ``He had
been on a diet losing weight (20 pounds). He weighed 224, ran in
the mid 4.5s, which is about where we expected he would be. We like
him for what he did on the football field, and that has not
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be a first, according to the NFL, for a team to give up
all of its picks on draft day. The guessing is that the three top
teams will keep their picks, but that the fourth and fifth teams,
Indianapolis and Washington, will be open to trades.
</P>
<P>
   If the Saints make the deal they want with Indianapolis, this
could open the door for the Patriots to make a trade with the
Washington Redskins. Washington traded its first and third picks
this year, and a second next year, to Minnesota for quarterback
Brad Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have extra picks in the first, third, sixth, and
seventh rounds. This extra ammunition would seem to give them
enough to make a deal to get into position to take James, and in
return, give the Redskins enough picks to allow them to have a full
draft this year. Washington will be willing to listen. Unless
something surprising happens, the top six picks, in some order,
appear to be Williams, Couch, Smith, McNabb, James, and defensive
back Champ Bailey. Bailey is the Deion Sanders of this draft. He
figures to be the first defensive player drafted.
</P>

   Harry Sinden has just about made his mind up to back away from
the day-to-day duties of general manager and turn them over to Mike
O'Connell. Sinden would keep his title as president, and be
involved on the business side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to step away and cut back on what I was doing a
couple of years ago,'' said Sinden Friday. ``But then we finished
last and that changed my mind. I gave myself a couple of years to
help get the team turned around and headed in the right direction.
I feel like that has happened. I'll meet with (owner) Jerry Jacobs
when the season is over and I'll see how he feels about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden is very concerned with the financial condition of the
league, especially the franchises in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know there is trouble when you see Montreal struggling,''
he said. ``That would be like the New York Yankees struggling down
here. They gave up two of their best players, (Vincent) Damphousse
and (Mark) Recchi, because both of them were going to be free
agents at the end of the year and they couldn't afford to sign
them. Did anyone ever think they would see the day that something
like that would happen in Montreal? The rate of the currency up
there and the lack of tax breaks that the government gives to other
businesses, has put several of those franchises in serious
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our financial picture doesn't change, you could see some of
those teams going out of business and that would have a terrible
impact on our league. It would be a disaster. But right now, there
doesn't appear to be anything going on that would stop it.''

   This memory came back with the death of Hall of Fame pitcher
Early Wynn this past week. Wynn needed one more victory to reach
the coveted 300-win plateau. Early in the season he came to Boston
and was a guest on the Dick ``Dr. Strangeglove'' Stuart show. This
was circa 1965 and Stuart had a 30-minute show Sunday nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an honor and privilege for me to be in the lineup
when you get No. 300,'' Stuart told him, to which Wynn responded
with a smile, ``I hope you are too, Stu, and that I strike you out
four times.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart was with the Red Sox and Wynn was not, so in essence, he
was saying to Wynn, ``I hope you beat us.''

   Doug Flutie was on the end of a Magic Johnson ``pass'' recently.
Johnson had been contracted to make a speaking appearance at Salem
State for $30,000. (Don't these schools have anything better to do
with their money?) However, shortly before the agreed-upon date,
the college reportedly got a call from a ``new'' agent, who said
Magic's fee was now double, $60,000. At this point, thankfully, the
school took a pass and reached out for Flutie . . . A person on the
inside of the recent Redskins ownership fiasco says Patriots owner
Bob Kraft negotiated the settlement between wannabe-owner Howard
Milstein and the NFL. The league owners were ready to vote down
Milstein again this past week and were fearful of a lawsuit. But
Kraft developed a plan whereby Milstein would get his $30 million
back from the trustees of the Redskins in return for not suing the
league and dropping out of the Washington ownership picture
completely.

   Lou Gorman told a luncheon gathering at the Bostonian Hotel the
other day that when he was the Red Sox general manager, he almost
traded Roger Clemens as part of a nine-player deal ``that would
have completely turned our franchise around.'' Gorman says the deal
fell apart when the owner of the team he was making the deal with
didn't want one of his players in the deal and pulled him out.
Gorman says he will give more details in a book he is writing and
hopes to have published in the near future.

   The University of Massachusetts is hoping that the rumor in the
western part of the state is true: that Adam Harrington would like
to come home and play basketball for the Minutemen. Harrington, who
played at tiny Pioneer Valley Regional High School in Northampton,
was the most highly recruited player in the state last year. He
signed early with North Carolina State, averaged 11 points a game
as a freshman starter, but now reportedly is pulling out of school,
and looking to play ball somewhere else. UMass would love to have
him . . . When Kenny Anderson gave Rick Pitino some lip, and the
Celtics coach didn't like it, there wasn't a lot more he could do
than sit him out for a game. You can't fine a player for mouthing
off, or loafing on defense in the NBA. It's against the collective
bargaining agreement, which has yet to be delivered in full to the
league teams. The Celtics are a long way from winning anything
because their point guards cannot defend up top, and Boston might
also have the worst defense under the basket in the league. That's
a hard combination to overcome.

   The Patriots have been talking to Scott Zolak about coming back
next year. Zo wasn't too happy when he read after the season that
the team considered Tom Tupa its backup quarterback last year . . .
Go figure: The Montreal Expos got $15 million from major league
baseball's sharing plans (big-money teams contribute to help
smaller-market teams) and spent $12 million on this year's payroll.
How do they get away with that? . . . When Williams lost 20 pounds
in six weeks, he had to give up one of his favorite foods,
doughnuts. So when his workout for the pros was over Tuesday in San
Diego, his friend arrived with a dozen, and Ricky responded. When
he had had his fill, there was one left.

   WASHINGTON _ Four days after NATO approved the deployment of two
dozen American Apache helicopter gunships to attack Yugoslav tanks,
frustrated NATO and Pentagon officials now estimate that it could
take a month before the helicopters are available to fly into
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. C-17 cargo planes carrying the first loads of equipment and
supplies to support the Apaches began arriving in Albania's
capital, Tirana, over the last two days. But officials said the
full deployment had moved sluggishly, and they cited bad weather,
slow-moving bureaucracy and an air traffic bottleneck over Albania
because of the airlift of food and relief supplies.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, has expressed
aggravation at the delays of the Apaches, which are suited to seek
out and destroy tanks and other armored vehicles involved in the
attacks on Kosovo's ethnic Albanians. A NATO official said Clark on
Friday scolded officials organizing the airlift into Albania,
ordering them to do more to speed the deployment.
</P>
<P>
   When NATO authorized the use of the Apaches on Monday, officials
said it would take only 7 to 10 days to have them ready for their
combat missions.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance has also come under criticism for not moving fast
enough to protect the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians
that it says are now living in the open in Kosovo under threat of
attack from Yugoslav forces and with little food and water.
</P>
<P>
   Although NATO has reported making progress against Yugoslavia's
military and police forces, bad weather has once again enveloped
the Balkans, limiting the alliance's attacks to cruise missiles and
high-flying warplanes, like the B-2 bombers. The Apaches can fly
effectively in any weather and, officials said, could be put to
good use against Yugoslav forces in what are now lulls in NATO's
raids.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's attacks resumed for a 17th day Friday, relying
heavily on cruise missiles, officials said. Five explosions were
reported Friday evening in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital. The
official Yugoslav news agency reported that a television
transmitter had been hit on Mount Goles near Kosovo's provincial
capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen ordered still more U.S.
troops to join in a NATO force that has already grown significantly
since the strikes began on March 24. Cohen sent six more F-15C
fighter jets now based in Alaska to the region and ordered a Navy
minesweeper, the Inchon, to stay in the Adriatic rather than leave
as scheduled for the Persian Gulf. The Inchon has helicopters
aboard that could be used in the relief operation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said Cohen now had an
official request from Clark for dozens of additional fighter and
support aircraft, including fighters like the F-16 and F-15 and the
A-10 attack plane, which is designed to fly low and attack ground
troops and armor.
</P>
<P>
   Before the rain and clouds set in again, U.S. and other NATO
warplanes had for the first time begun to strike armored forces
operating in Kosovo. And on Thursday the Pentagon said the strikes
had effectively cut the fuel and ammunition lines to the
40,000-strong Yugoslav army and to police units in the province.
</P>
<P>
   But officials concede that they have so far done little to
destroy the front-line armored forces accused of carrying out the
worst of the attacks in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clark had requested the deployment of the Apache helicopters _
along with long-range rocket batteries used to back them up _ more
than two weeks ago to accelerate that effort. But carrying out his
request initially stalled because of concerns about putting ground
forces so close to the fighting in Yugoslavia, and now because of
the sluggish deployment.

ROLLERJAM: SPORT FOR NEW MILLENNIUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To paraphrase a famous rock 'n roll writer:
</P>
<P>
   I have seen the future of sports television in America, and its
name is ... ROLLERJAM.
</P>
<P>
   Say it again in lower case. Rollerjam.
</P>
<P>
   Do not laugh. Do not bellow, chortle, snicker or guffaw.
Everything that professional sports is becoming, or has already
become, can be found in this neat little two-hour package that is
broadcast from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. every Friday on TNN.
</P>
<P>
   You want officials who look the other way, or just don't see,
when one player commits some particularly heinous atrocity against
another?
</P>
<P>
   You want highly conditioned athletes who mug for the cameras,
who taunt maniacal fans in the stands, who say they'll play
wherever they're paid (the most)?
</P>
<P>
   You want good guys vs. bad guys, babes and hunks in form-fitting
spandex uniforms, speed, violence and hyperventilating broadcasters
to describe it all?
</P>
<P>
   If so, then Rollerjam's your kind of show.
</P>
<P>
   Putting it another way: When Dennis Rodman's box-score line
reads DNP-AWOL for the last time, he'll have a future here. So
would Carmen Electra and any other wheels-off character.
</P>
<P>
   Rollerjam is Roller Derby updated for the new millennium. Which
is to say that the old Blonde Bomber herself, Joanie Weston, might
still recognize her game, but she'd be struck by all the changes
that have been made. The biggest differences are that today's
performers wear in-line skates, and that they seem to have been
chosen for their looks as much as their skating abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody would've said that of Charlie O'Connell, like Weston, a
veteran of Roller Derby during its 1950s-1960s-era TV heyday.
</P>
<P>
   You still have jammers and blockers and whip moves, though, and
10 men or women at a time flying around the oval at warp speed, all
the while dodging or banging against foe. That's more action than
you get with Clippers vs. Grizzlies, and the final score doesn't
mean much less.
</P>
<P>
   The original Roller Derby, founded by Leo Seltzer in 1935 in
Chicago, folded in 1973, although other roller derby leagues have
quietly persisted. The creator and commissioner of Rollerjam is
Leo's son, Jerry.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for a modified revival of Roller Derby came after the
death in 1997 of Weston, who skated for the famed San Francisco Bay
Area Bombers. The Bombers were, in effect, the hometown team to
millions of TV viewers who tuned in weekly to watch them battle
squads like the New York Chiefs. They also toured arenas across
America.
</P>
<P>
   Rollerjam teams such as the Texas Rustlers, the California
Quakes and the Florida Sundogs actually ``play'' on a banked track
at Universal Studios in Florida. The choice of locales is
appropriate since Rollerjam, like Roller Derby, is as much a
theatrical spectacle as a sporting one. It's a made-for-TV event
held before a studio audience.
</P>
<P>
   A sample of the theatrics from one contest:
</P>
<P>
   The Enforcers, dressed out in Al Davis black and silver, are
introduced as ``A team only a mother could love.'' Some fans love
them, too, it appears, perhaps because a number of Enforcers sport
tattoos and most of the guys look like Mr. Clean.
</P>
<P>
   Roller Derby original Richard Brown is kicked off his club, the
Sundogs, for especially vicious behavior at the rink. Brown's
``actions on the track have compromised his image as a symbol of
their team,'' Seltzer said. Throughout the next game, the ousted
Brown is shown brooding in the stands, refusing to answer an
interviewer's questions. Told you it was a lot like sports today.
</P>
<P>
   A trio of Quakes skaters are touted as the ``Bod Squad,'' for
obvious reasons. A lot is made of some snit between the girls. The
camera loves them.
</P>
<P>
   There also are plenty of villains. They do things like pick up
underfed opponents, toss them over the retainer rail and onto the
concrete floor, then pounce on them while delivering a forearm
shiver.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds suspiciously like big-time rasslin', well, you
get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rollerjam is accomplishing its mission _ to attract a
young, predominantly male viewership. They may be too young to
remember Weston, O'Connell and the Bay Area Bombers, but they're
old enough to appreciate sex, violence and soap-opera plots blended
into a sporting spectacle. \Ntagtop:David A. Markiewicz, (817)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On a bitterly cold day in Beijing in early January,
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, was given a
startling message by Zhou Rongji, the Chinese prime minister who
was remaking the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite China's economic slowdown, Zhu said, he had decided that
China was finally ready to offer huge openings of its markets _ in
telecommunications, banking, insurance and agriculture _ in return
for getting the country into the World Trade Organization. He
offered some tantalizing details, apparently hoping that Greenspan
_ whose own portfolio has nothing to do with trade _ would make
sure the right people in Washington got the message.
</P>
<P>
   They did, and over the next three months the two sides made
enormous progress, resolving 95 percent of the issues that had
divided them for years. But in the end, President Clinton, the man
who has repeatedly made commercial diplomacy the centerpiece of his
foreign policy, backed away. Distracted by Kosovo, he did not let
his trade negotiators know how badly he wanted a deal, officials
close to the talks said. Nor did he make a strong public case for
what would have been the biggest economic deal in Chinese-American
relations until Zhu's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his top foreign policy aides, led by National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger, hoped for an agreement that would bolster
Zhu, whom they see as China's leading force for openness and
reform. At a meeting last Saturday, some State Department and Trade
officials argued that China had moved as far as it could, and the
president should take the deal on the table. But one official said
that there was ``a sense it won't quite do it'' with a Congress
that is increasingly suspicious of China's intentions. Others
expressed fears that any deal involving China would further divide
Democrats, enrage labor unions and end up in a huge battle on
Capitol Hill that the president would likely lose.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some argued, the congressional battle would itself
create a rallying cry for Republicans seeking an outlet to debate
charges that China has stolen nuclear secrets and surreptitiously
donated to Democratic coffers.
</P>
<P>
   In a major speech about China delivered the morning before his
meeting with Zhu, the president declared that ``if China is willing
to play by the global rules of trade, it would be an inexplicable
mistake for the United States to say no.'' Many of Clinton's
closest aides took that as a sign that the debate was over, that
the deal was done. They proved to be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to tell what the long-term impact of Friday's
failure to reach a deal may be. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin,
who appeared in no particular hurry about striking an agreement of
this scope, insisted Friday that in the coming months a deal ``is
certainly doable.'' The U.S. trade representative, Charlene
Barshefsky, insists that ``we still want a deal, Zhu wants a deal,
and I'm sure it will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But without question, momentum has been lost. A fear now is
that, once Zhu gets back to Beijing, the deal could unravel. Trade
negotiations are like a carefully staged opera, one that can come
to a rousing conclusion only after the most careful stagecraft. In
this case the singers were playing to very different audiences, and
the last act never came off.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, worried about the effects of a defeat on the rest of
his legislative agenda, apparently decided at the last minute not
to push Zhu at that Wednesday night meeting for a last flurry of
concessions. And Zhu was clearly worried that he already had given
too much. If he agreed to strict provisions that would give the
United States unilateral rights to retaliate against import surges,
and that would offer more protection to the American textile
workers by extending for years strict quotas on the volume of
textiles China can send to the United States, he would be subject
to enormous criticism from other Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen the president back away like this,'' one
veteran of trade negotiations said Friday. ``We're all still
scratching our heads.''
</P>
<P>
   By some measures this could be a prime example of how one of
America's most critical diplomatic initiatives fell victim to the
distractions of a war in the Balkans. Clinton has long argued that
WTO membership for China is not about economics, it is about global
integration. It gets China into a legal framework, forcing it to
work under Western-style trade laws. It creates huge market
openings that will, in time, expose more Chinese for foreign ideas.
And by spreading cell phones and Internet nodes in China, the West
helps create more outlets for political expression _ outlets the
Chinese government finds it increasingly difficult to control.
</P>
<P>
   So when Greenspan returned to Washington in January with his
message, Ms. Barshefsky, leaped at the opening. She sent her top
China negotiator, Robert Cassidy, to Beijing for what turned into
weeks of negotiations. In the first week of March she traveled to
Beijing herself, and spent two and half hours with Zhu.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first hour I talked non-stop,'' she said. ``And it was
clear that great progress was being made.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time the Chinese were talking about sweeping away
many of the barriers that had long stymied American farmers _
limits on agricultural imports, and requirements that they only
distribute their goods through state-owned companies. There was
talk about letting American firms invest in the telecommunications
industry for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came in dribs and drabs,'' one person involved in the
negotiations said. ``We would push, and we were often surprised
that the Chinese came back and said, `We can do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the Zhu visit here was the deadline, and everyone knew
it. But in the interim, a lot had changed in Washington.

 WASHINGTON: a lot had changed in Washington. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suspicions that China had obtained the design of the W-88
warhead, the most miniaturized in the American nuclear fleet,
created a new atmosphere on Capitol Hill and the White House found
itself under attack.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at the negotiating table, the Chinese kept giving.
``My overall sense is that the Chinese conceded more than I thought
would be politically possible,'' said Nicholas Lardy, an expert on
the Chinese economy at the Brookings Institution. ``You have to
remember that unemployment is at a 30-year high in China, corporate
profits are falling off a cliff, and here is Zhu arguing that this
is a moment to actually allow the foreigners to offer more domestic
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger argued that this was a moment to support Zhu, making him
the man who brought China the prestige of entering the global
trading system. Clinton seemed inclined to that view, and his
speech on Wednesday was filled with a discussion of America's
interests in both an economically stronger and more secure China.
</P>
<P>
   But inside the White House, there was less talk about the
dangers of a weak China than the dangers of an agreement that labor
unions, liberal Democrats or powerful senators from textile
producing states _ like Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Ernest Hollings,
D-S.C. _ could use to rally opposition. The two men had already
introduced a bill to give Congress a clear vote on any deal.
(Indirectly, Congress has that already, because it would have to
amend the law allowing an annual review of China's trading status.)
</P>
<P>
   And there were other unhappy interest groups with strong
connections to the White House. China insisted on limits on the
import of Western films _ meaning that Hollywood might seek to kill
the deal. Nor would the Chinese allow American brokerages much
access to the rough and ready Chinese markets. That underwhelmed
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, the most important voice on any
economic matter.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments played out in regular meetings in the office of
John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, who was also
concerned about the damage that would be wrought trying to push the
deal through Congress. ``John had visions of NAFTA dancing in his
head,'' one participant in the discussions said, referring to the
North American Free Trade Agreement, which passed in 1993 only
because Clinton was able to rally Republicans to the free trade
cause. This year, though, few were expected to come to the
president's rescue.
</P>
<P>
   As the White House debate rolled on, Clinton was busy with other
things. He spoke with Ms. Barshefsky only sporadically; she made a
last-minute trip to Beijing last week without a clear sense of what
the President wanted. There were few meetings to prep the president
for a major meeting with Zhu.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could barely focus on the summit,'' one foreign policy aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   So by the time Clinton was deeply involved in the details, it
was clear that negotiators had run out of time. In fact, they had
accomplished more than Clinton discussed at a news conference with
Zhu on Thursday afternoon. The president's prepared statement, his
aides said, had been written a day before _ and he had not had time
to review it before he stood next to Zhu and announced that
progress had been made, but not enough.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most of the last ten years, Slobodan Milosevic, as the main
generator of aroused Serbian nationalism, has been trying to ignore
Ibrahim Rugova, the 53 year old literary historian who until
recently was the unquestioned leader of Kosovo's Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after the NATO attacks on Yugoslavia and the forced
flight of Albanians from Kosovo, President Milosevic has turned to
the adversary he spurned for so long, as if acknowledging him as a
suitable partner for building a peace. The tall, gangly Albanian
has been shown on television seated alongside and chatting with
Milosevic, though it remains unknown how the Albanian leader came
to Belgrade and what pressures he may be under.
</P>
<P>
   The two men have long opposed each other and each other's
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 Milosevic, then the president of Serbia, reignited the
dreams of Serbian nationalism by defending the Serbian minority in
Kosovo and stripping the Albanian-majority province of what
autonomy it had. Within months, Rugova helped to found the
Democratic League of Kosovo and became its first president.
</P>
<P>
   Under his leadership, the league quickly became something
between a political party and a mass movement, and in an interview
a few years later, Rugova claimed this strategy was inspired by the
approach taken by the Poles in creating Solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova provided a sharp contrast to Milosevic. While the Serb
looked and sounded like a pugnacious battler, snarling at opponents
and playing to the crowd, Rugova appeared like an other-worldly
intellectual, soft spoken and polite, claiming that his heroes were
Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   He had been the leader of the writers club of Kosovo before the
league was formed. When he was an infant, his father and
grandfather were killed, apparently by partisans, but he was so
committed to nonviolence that he would lecture his fellow Albanians
to avoid slurs or strong language when referring to the Serbs, to
avoid needlessly worsening the tension in the province.
</P>
<P>
   He always wore a long scarf coiled around his neck, even
indoors, and wore his hair long with ringlets over his ears. Though
his heritage, like that of most Kosovars, is Muslim, his doctoral
work had concerned the writings of a 17th-century Catholic
archbishop who preached and wrote in Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite his recondite interests, ascetic manner and the
stump personality of an aloof intellectual, he proved to be a
highly effective political figure, and on May 24, 1992, in an
officially unsanctioned ``election,'' ethnic Albanians throughout
the province overwhelmingly elected him president of the ``Kosovo
Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he was shunned in this capacity by Milosevic, he made the
most of his victory, daily attending a small office behind the
soccer stadium, where he met and discussed issues with similarly
elected parliamentarians. He welcomed foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
   More important, he established a shadow government for the
province, collecting taxes and distributing money contributed by
Kosovar Albanians working abroad. The payments were voluntary, but
taxpayers and donors generally amounted to 3 percent of their
income.
</P>
<P>
   The money was largely used to pay teachers and doctors. Albanian
teachers had been fired, either for taking part in protests or for
refusing to drop Albanian literature and history from the
curriculum. Once that happened, Rugova's ``republic'' helped set up
a network of schools in private homes that eventually were attended
by 400,000 children.
</P>
<P>
   This parallel system was extended into the spheres of culture
and sport.
</P>
<P>
   But most of Rugova's attention was concentrated on a three-part
strategy:
</P>
<P>
   _ To prevent a violent revolt against the Serbs. Not only was he
committed to non-violence on philosophical grounds, he argued that
Kosovo Albanians were ill equipped to take on Serbian or Yugoslav
forces.
</P>
<P>
   _ To draw international attention to the situation in Kosovo,
from photographs with visiting officials to contacts with
international organizations, religious groups, and non-governmental
organizations. Here he was quite successful.
</P>
<P>
   _ To do whatever could be done to deny legitimacy to Serbian
rule over the province.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with this last point, Rugova saw to it that Kosovo
Albanians boycotted elections held by Serbian or Yugoslav
authorities. That stand was opposed by some of his foreign
supporters, among them the United States. In their view, the
potential Albanian vote, when added to that of Milosevic's Serbian
opponents, would have been great enough to curb Milosevic's power
if not to end his rule.
</P>
<P>
   Hewing to these points, Rugova was able to maintain solid
support among Albanians until three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He had been urging Albanians to restrain themselves in the hope
that in the wake of the Dayton accords, which halted the war in
Bosnia, the international community would address the Kosovo issue.
When he received little more than a photo opportunity with
President Clinton, his popularity dipped.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the rise of more militant political rivals such as
Adem Demaci, who upon his release after 27 years in prison,
denounced Rugova's approach and favored a more aggressive policy.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, the separatist guerrillas, the Kosovo
Liberation Army, began emerging, obviously opposed to the
nonviolence that Rugova prized.
</P>
<P>
   By 1998, Rugova's position was no longer dominant among the
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Now it appears that Milosevic, who in the past has succeeded in
turning his Serbian rivals into allies, is trying a similar tactic
with Rugova, perhaps calculating that by at least appearing to
finally take the man seriously, he might restore his status among
the Albanians of Kosovo to the point where the two could cut a
deal.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As Bill Kennard raced through a whirlwind of
meetings in Southern California one day in March, his passions and
preoccupations as the nation's top telecommunications official
quickly became clear.
</P>
<P>
   To a small group of studio and network executives in a screening
room at the William Morris Agency, Kennard, the chairman of the
Federal Communications Commission, offered his assurances that he
had no interest in regulating the Internet, the medium on which
many people in Hollywood are staking new fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that rainy morning, over breakfast with executives of
the local chapter of the National Urban League, he pledged to fight
for more jobs for minority executives and greater investment in
minority-owned broadcasting and telecommunications companies so
that, in the words of one league official, blacks would not become
``hitchhikers on the information superhighway.''
</P>
<P>
   He also dropped by the inner-city elementary school where his
mother had once taught to celebrate its connection to the Internet.
The connection came courtesy of the e-rate program, a subsidy
financed by a new fee on telephone users that he worked to
establish with Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard, a black telecommunications lawyer raised in an
integrated Los Angeles neighborhood, was in many ways more
comfortable in these settings than he is back in Washington. That
he devoted so much time on this fairly typical trip to minority
issues _ issues that have been low priorities even within the
Democratic administration he serves _ revealed the depth of his
predicament.
</P>
<P>
   Though he runs an agency that rules on issues of central
importance to the nation's fastest-growing industries, Kennard has
found himself politically hemmed in from the start. A compromise
appointee who has had little influence at the White House, he lacks
the traditional sort of political base that would let him either
stake bold positions or achieve consensus among warring factions
with interests before the FCC: local and long-distance phone
companies, cable operators and broadcasters, small radio stations
and large media conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he has come to rely for support and advice on
Washington's black power structure _ the Congressional Black
Caucus, for example, and Vernon Jordan, the lawyer who serves on
many corporate boards when he is not advising his close friend Bill
Clinton _ and to emphasize causes that match their priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, he has struggled to write the rules that will
put in place the most contentious telecommunications legislation in
the nation's history, a three-year-old law that has largely been
tied up in court fights between the agency and the industries it
oversees.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard's supporters agree with him that telecommunications
deregulation is inextricably linked to goals like increasing
minority ownership of TV stations or getting basic phone service to
Indian reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In implementing the telecom structure for the next decade and
beyond, he's determined to retain the steady pressure for increased
diversity that he rightly believes has been one of the most
powerful forces for retaining America's lead in the world
economy,'' said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, a friend who is also the
president of the Media Access Project, a public-interest law firm
in Washington that promotes consumer rights and diversity on the
airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   But to his critics, Kennard has overstepped his bounds,
diverting the agency from its basic mission and moving too slowly
to deregulate the most dynamic sector of the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chairman Kennard has been off on these other agendas before he
has completed the work he was assigned to complete _ the
deregulation of the marketplace,'' said Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin,
R-La., who chairs the House telecommunications subcommittee. ``If I
had an employee who did that, we would have had a very, very short
conversation before that employee would be out looking for another
job.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though his detractors concede that Kennard is perhaps the most
genial official in Washington, his style has done little to blunt
the alienation of many lobbyists and lawmakers from the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   His predecessor, Reed Hundt, had notoriously bad relations with
Congress, though he had greater access to the White House, having
gone to St. Albans prep school with Al Gore and Yale Law School
with Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Under Kennard, relations with Congress have only deteriorated,
in part over policies he has advocated and in part because of early
political blunders. The FCC has few allies on its oversight
committees, even among Democrats, and a movement has gradually been
building steam to cut the agency's budget and pare its authority.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard's isolation stems from the agency's repeated decisions
to spurn applications by the Baby Bell companies to enter the
long-distance markets, on the grounds that they have failed to open
their own local markets to competition from the long-distance
carriers. The Baby Bells, which have many powerful friends in
Congress, say that they have complied with the Telecommunications
Act of 1996, which set the ground rules for competition, and that
Kennard's decisions have cost them billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes forever to get these sorts of issues out of the FCC''
said Roy Neel, a former Clinton White House official who is now
president of the U.S. Telephone Association, which represents the
Bells. ``There is a pervasive culture at the agency which has kept
a stranglehold on the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Price, president of the National Urban League, praises the
chairman for his work on issues of concern to minority groups. But
as a director of Bell Atlantic, he says the agency has moved too
cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``On some of the regulatory issues, they've got to let the
marketplace rip a little bit and let these things roll,'' Price
said. ``They have not been able to do it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, some of the Bells have adapted to Kennard's style
and agenda. When Bell Atlantic officials recently sought regulatory
relief on an obscure telephone issue, they sent an all-black
lobbying team. Kennard recalled the episode with humor, and said
the company ultimately got what it had sought _ but on the merits.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, GTE announced that it would join with Georgetown
Partners _ a private investment firm headed by a black executive,
Chester Davenport, who has had no telecommunications experience _
for a $3.3 billion purchase of about half of Ameritech's wireless
telephone business. Because Ameritech has sought the FCC's
permission to be acquired by SBC Communications, and GTE has sought
approval to be acquired by Bell Atlantic, executives close to the
wireless deal said the parties brought in Davenport's firm in part
to try to curry favor with Kennard.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters, another powerful lobby, have also found themselves
at odds with Kennard. They say he all but declared war on them a
few weeks ago by proposing a new rule that would enable thousands
of churches, schools and community groups around the nation to
operate low-power FM radio stations. The broadcasters see the new
stations as a source of signal interference. Kennard says the rule
would provide a new voice to the traditionally voiceless.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, the federal courts have ruled in Kennard's
favor on big regulatory issues _ most notably when the Supreme
Court recently affirmed the agency's authority to implement some
core provisions of the Telecommunications Act. But the courts have
also handed setbacks to Kennard and the Clinton administration on
the FCC's affirmative-action agenda. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   William E. Kennard was born 42 years ago, the third child and
only son of middle-class parents in Los Angeles. His father,
Robert, a World War II veteran, was a successful architect; his
mother, Helen, was a bilingual elementary school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   His parents, Kennard said, instilled a faith in the value of
cultural diversity. He and his sisters attended Hollywood High, at
the time one of the more integrated schools in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But the larger world was often less accommodating. The fact that
successful blacks were rarely portrayed on television made a deep
impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an event in my household when an African-American
appeared on a show,'' Kennard recalled. ``People would run out of
the bedroom in excitement at those fleeting moments of images of
black people on television. When Bank of America featured a black
teller in one of its commercials, my mother was so excited that she
changed the family bank account.''
</P>
<P>
   At Stanford University, where he studied communications, Kennard
spent many hours producing a show called ``Black Perspectives'' for
the college radio station.
</P>
<P>
   During an internship at a local NBC television affiliate _ he
wanted to become an investigative reporter _ Kennard was advised by
the station manager to go to law school. He wound up at Yale,
worked briefly after receiving his law degree at the National
Association of Broadcasters, specializing in First Amendment
issues, and then settled in as an associate at the Washington law
firm of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson &AMP; Hand, specializing
in telecommunications deals. Among his clients were NBC and a
number of minority broadcasters, including Robert L. Johnson, the
chairman and founder of Black Entertainment Television, the cable
network; Johnson remains a close friend and adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard also nurtured friendships with two of the most important
black lawyers then in Washington: Ronald Brown, whose photograph is
now on Kennard's office credenza, and Jordan, whose stepdaughter he
had befriended at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1992 campaign, Kennard was part of the network of
Yale Law graduates that helped get Clinton elected president.
Backed by Brown, the Democratic National Committee chairman who
became commerce secretary, and Jordan, the co-chairman of the
Clinton transition team, he was offered the job of general counsel
at the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, he and Hundt, then the chairman, worked well
together, though their personalities could hardly be more
different. Hundt quickly made enemies in Congress with his
confrontational style. Kennard, by contrast, was never seen
flashing a temper or raising his voice.
</P>
<P>
   As general counsel, Kennard reversed the agency's mediocre court
record, compiling an impressive victory rate of about 85 percent in
the appeals courts. Still, he has also lost some big cases: An
appeals court ruling last year, for example, threw out the
requirements that radio and TV broadcasters take special steps to
seek minority and female job applicants.
</P>
<P>
   When Hundt stepped down in 1997, Kennard was on no one's list to
succeed him. But with four of the five commission slots opening,
his allies waged an ultimately successful campaign to get him
nominated as chairman as part of a political compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, he recalled, ``would call me up, and in this low voice
he would say, `You can be chairman, but wait.''' Even before the
question could be posed, Kennard volunteered that Jordan, one of
Washington's most influential lawyer-lobbyists, ``never has asked
me for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He gives me advice because he's been a good friend and because
he wants to help me out,'' Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
   Little more than a year before Kennard's confirmation as
chairman, Congress passed the Telecommunications Act, the first
major overhaul of federal communications law since the FCC was
created in 1934. The law was hailed by both congressional leaders
and Clinton as a landmark that would deregulate the telephone and
cable industries, benefiting consumers. But it had many hidden
problems. It was poorly written, creating ambiguities that prompted
the industries that didn't get everything they wanted to file huge
lawsuits, slowing its implementation by the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the act left the most difficult rule-making decisions
_ from the possibility of relaxing television-station ownership
rules to assuring universal phone service and money for the e-rate
program _ to the five unelected commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   While the law has promoted competition and driven down some
prices _ notably for long-distance and cellular service _ it has
not achieved many other objectives, like making cable TV and local
phone services truly competitive. Some say that its main effect has
been to promote corporate consolidations.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard had barely settled into the chairmanship when he
encountered his first maelstrom. Without consulting either Congress
or his fellow commissioners, he told reporters that he thought
liquor advertising should perhaps be banned from television. A few
weeks later, again without consultation, Kennard announced that the
FCC would consider new rules requiring radio and television
stations to give free time to political candidates, a proposal the
president had made in his State of the Union Address a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting complaints from both the broadcasting industry and
many members of Congress forced him into a hasty retreat _ and
frittered away what little political capital he might have
otherwise enjoyed as a new agency leader.
</P>
<P>
   (Kennard recently said that he had learned several lessons from
those setbacks _ including to refrain from issuing proposals that
are unlikely to succeed. ``I've learned to be much more guarded,''
he said. ``Musing is not allowed.'')
</P>
<P>
   The two announcements poisoned whatever relationship Kennard
could have hoped to establish with many key lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The venom was evident in March, when Rep. John Dingell of
Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Commerce Committee,
delivered a scathing public attack. ``In terms of substance, the
current chairman may be a few affiliates short of a network,'' he
told the National Association of Broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   At an oversight hearing a few weeks later, Kennard tried, with
little success, to parry Dingell's thrusts as lobbyists watched
with the glee of ancient Romans at a gladiator match. Dingell
called Kennard ``inept'' and ``ignorant.'' Republican members of
the committee sat silently, grinning. The Democrats sat mostly
silent.
</P>
<P>
   Where were Kennard's allies? Shortly before the hearing, Kennard
had dined with Johnson of Black Entertainment Television, who had
offered to ask lawmakers to persuade Dingell to tone down his
criticisms. Clearly, the effort didn't work. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If anything could win Kennard some breathing room, it would be
the FCC's finally permitting the Bells to enter the long-distance
business. He and other commissioners have hinted that they may
relent later this year, particularly if state regulators concluded
that some local markets are becoming more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   He has also been careful not to pick new fights, moving
cautiously on the other huge issue that has confronted him this
year: whether to order the opening of the high-speed cable pipeline
being developed by AT&AMP;T to other Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline promises to revolutionize cyberspace as millions of
Americans gain access to the Internet at speeds up to 100 times
faster than ordinary telephone lines. AT&AMP;T's rivals say that if
they cannot offer services over the lines, AT&AMP;T will be able to
dominate the Internet much as it controlled telephones for nearly a
century.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard has indicated that he will not intervene in the debate
at this point _ a decision he made after AT&AMP;T chairman C. Michael
Armstrong threatened to scuttle the company's pending acquisition
of Tele-Communications Inc. TCI's cable systems not only will
provide the basis for the high-speed system but will also make it
easier for AT&AMP;T to offer local phone service _ thereby ending the
Bell monopolies and easing the way for the Bells' entry into the
long-distance business.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard is also learning to use his office as a bully pulpit
when the courts rule against him. In light of his court defeat on
affirmative action, he has persuaded the networks to voluntarily
keep minority hiring a goal of their recruitment efforts, and he
has offered to support further loosening of the limits on
broadcasters' station holdings if they help increase the number of
minority-owned stations. He has also held a series of conferences
to encourage advertisers to buy time on radio stations aimed at
minority audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure I've been frustrated, because I think in some of these
areas the progress we've made has been reversed,'' Kennard said.
But his conciliatory streak runs deep. ``You've got to move on,''
he said, ``to do the work that's necessary if you ever want to get
things done.''

 &HT;    US Airways' MetroJet to start five daily flights to Northeast
 &HT;    By Stephen Pounds
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ US Airways' discount service, MetroJet,
will begin flying five times daily between West Palm Beach and the
Northeast for less than $100 one way starting in July, with two
additional flights slated for August, the carrier said this week.
</P>
<P>
   MetroJet will fly two daily flights from Palm Beach
International Airport to Hartford, Conn. two daily flights to
Baltimore and one daily to Boston, all nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   A second and third daily flight between West Palm Beach and
Boston will be added on Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways already carries the second-largest number of
passengers monthly from PBIA, handling 19 percent of February's
traffic. Delta Air Lines carried 33 percent of PBIA passengers in
February, the latest figures available.
</P>
<P>
   Although other airlines fly to these cities, Delta is the main
competition to MetroJet on these routes because they offer some
nonstop service, US Airways spokesman David Castelveter said. Delta
flies three times daily to Boston, including one nonstop. It flies
twice to Hartford, with one of those nonstop. It does not fly to
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   MetroJet, the discount arm of US Airways, began last year as a
no-frills carrier to compete with low-fare alternatives such as
Delta Express.
</P>
<P>
   MetroJet will offer one-way fares of $97 to Boston, $87 to
Hartford and $85 to Baltimore, with tickets bought at least seven
days in advance. Steve Barofsky of Sunrise Travel in West Palm
Beach said Delta is matching MetroJet's fares.

 &HT;    Y2K drill goes well for utilities
 &HT;    By Susan Spencer-Wendel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Electric companies around the nation
actually talked to each other Friday. Only a little bit was lost in
translation.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a nationwide Y2K prep test, system operators at
utilities, including Florida Power &AMP; Light Co., picked up cellular
and satellite phones and spoke the information that is usually
transmitted by computer. The purpose was to make sure utilities can
still communicate should computers fail when the clock strikes
midnight Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from some wrong phone numbers and confusion over language,
Florida's utilities had excellent results, said Linda Brousseau of
the Florida Reliability Coordinating Council, the industry group
that oversees the state's electricity supply.
</P>
<P>
   FPL learned one important lesson: Utilities use different names
for power substations. One might refer to it by a number and the
other by a name, said FPL spokeswoman Kathy Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we do drills,'' Scott said. ``We always learn
something.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Scott said they decided to call the substations by
name.
</P>
<P>
   It's critical that power plants be able to communicate with one
another to maintain the supply on Florida's power grid.
</P>
<P>
   The industry group that monitors the nation's power supply _ the
North American Reliability Council _ ordered Friday's test and sets
Y2K guidelines for the nations' utilities to follow. It reported no
major glitches throughout the nation as of late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The true ``dress rehearsal,'' as Brousseau calls it, is planned
for Sept. 8 and 9 when utilities will test not only whether they
can communicate, but whether electricity continues to flow even if
there's a whole host of Y2K-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K bug stems from the use of just two digits to mark the
year in older computer programs and chips. When 2000 rolls around,
some programs might think it is 1900, resulting in anything from
calculation mistakes to outright failures.

 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT NEWS, Va. _ As Marvin Lowrie, a 52-year-old machinist,
walked the picket line outside the giant shipyard here, there was
pride laced with bitterness when he talked _ pride that his
shipyard produces the world's most sophisticated nuclear aircraft
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   But Lowrie, who constructs intricate piping systems for the
carriers, voiced unmistakable bitterness that after 27 years on the
job making ships essential to the nation's defense, he was still
earning less than $30,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Seething about what they called stingy wages and pensions,
Lowrie and more than 8,000 other workers at Newport News
Shipbuilding went on strike after their contract expired last
Monday in one of the largest walkouts this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people here are world-class shipbuilders, yet they get
paid peanuts,'' Lowrie said.
</P>
<P>
   To Lowrie, the dispute is not about whether workers get a 14
percent raise or a 22 percent raise, but about economic justice,
about whether workers share in the fruits of economic prosperity.
The strikers, members of the United Steelworkers of America, are
demanding that the shipyard reward them after they helped nurse it
back to financial health by agreeing to a 50-month wage freeze in
their last contract. After losing money in 1997, the company earned
$66 million in 1998 _ not enough, company officials say, to award
the large increases sought by the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the company has had a big turnaround and has a
tremendous backlog of work, we want to get our fair share of the
pie,'' Lowrie said, adding that his annual pay was proving to be a
particular hardship now that it cost $9,800 a year to send his
21-year-old son to college.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other strikes in their early days, this one does not
appear to be shadowboxing. Both sides are digging in, with neither
asking the other to return to the bargaining table for fear that it
would look as if it blinked first. The shipyard insists it has made
its final offer, while the union, steel workers Local 8888, has
begun determining who among its strikers will need the most
financial assistance to endure a long walkout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize there is every chance that this could be a lengthy
strike,'' said Alfred Little Jr., the shipyard's vice president of
human resources. ``I think it could be months, but I hope not.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the workers are in a festive mood, excited by a sense
of solidarity while not yet feeling squeezed by weeks without
paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the honeymoon phase,'' said Jan Hooks, a crane
operator for 23 years whose big complaint is that when she retires
in five years, her pension will be about $400 a month, not enough
to cover her monthly rent.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, in groups of five, 20 and 50, the workers picketed in
front of 10 gates at a shipyard that stretches for two-and-a-half
miles along the Chesapeake Bay. Beyond the gates were gigantic,
1,100-foot-long, 90,000-ton aircraft carriers under construction or
undergoing nuclear refueling.
</P>
<P>
   In front of company headquarters, an austere brick building, 20
strikers, watched by nine police officers, sang variations of a
labor anthem with verses that included, ``We build first-class
ships. We shall not be moved,'' and ``We want a contract. We shall
not be moved.''
</P>
<P>
   Shipyard officials insist they have made a generous offer that
will increase pensions by at least 10 percent and raise wages by 18
percent over 47 months for most workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new offer essentially makes our top-rated mechanics the
highest paid in the industry when you take into account regional
differences in the cost of living,'' said Jerri Fuller Dickseski,
the shipyard's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides in strikes often see differing realities, and that
is certainly the case here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their offer is insulting,'' said Randolph Deloatch, a stocky
46-year-old who installs and removes nuclear fuel from the
carriers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While company officials hail their proposed 18-percent increase
as generous for four years, union members called it ridiculous,
saying it would translate into 18 percent over 10 years _ or less
than 2 percent a year _ since the workers have not received an
across-the-board raise since December 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Meredith, 37, another nuclear fueling worker, noted that
one full-time colleague in his highly skilled department earned so
little that he qualified for a welfare program to help feed his
children. Meredith also criticized the shipyard for paying him only
$12.59 an hour, even though his job is dangerous and demanding,
while workers at a nearby Anheuser-Busch brewery earn more than $20
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad for them, but I'm not sure what they do is as
important for the national interest,'' he said. ``There's real
suffering going on here. It's tearing families apart. A lot of this
is being precipitated by a lack of money.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the proposed pension increase of more than 10 percent,
Arnold Outlaw, Local 8888's president, termed it paltry, saying it
would be an increase from a small base _ most recent retirees
receive less than $500 each month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things are, retirees can't even afford to bury
themselves after they die,'' Outlaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Little, the vice president, said management's overall pay
proposal was the most generous made by any shipyard in years. He
also said that the improvements in wages and pensions would make
the shipyard the second-best-paying in the nation, behind only
Electric Boat in Groton, Conn., where the cost of living is
significantly higher.
</P>
<P>
   Little warned that it would be unwise for the union to push for
too steep a raise. The union's proposals amounted to a 35 percent
increase, he said, and might push the shipyard into the red and
persuade the Pentagon to turn to lower-cost suppliers. He also said
the union was wrong to think the shipyard was highly profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on our way to doing better,'' Little said, ``but there's
certainly room to do better than this. We're always under a
tremendous amount of pressure from the Navy to reduce costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Outlaw, the union president, said one reason for the strike was
that far more shipyard workers belonged to the union than was the
case two years ago _ more than 80 percent of the 9,200 hourly
workers have joined, up from about 50 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at unionized companies in Virginia are not required to
join the union or pay dues. In theory, the more workers belonging
to the union, the fewer will cross the picket line, enabling the
union to put more pressure on the company. Pointing out that the
colossal cranes at the shipyard were dead still, Outlaw said the
company had largely been shut down, helped by the Teamsters'
decision to honor the picket line.
</P>
<P>
   Little voiced optimism that the shipyard could endure a long
strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work is going to continue,'' he said, ``but at a much
lower level. It will grow as time goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   But William Rollins, a striking mechanic, said, ``They're
looking to break us and have us run back into the yard. But there's
so much unity this year. We have the heart of the shipyard out in
the streets. Without the heart, they have nothing to run the yard
with.''

NINE MONTHS AND COUNTING: THE RACE FOR THE MILLENNIUM BABY BEGINS
</HEADLINE>
   (ac) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Fitzpatrick Manhattan Hotel here was bracing for
it. With night approaching, the manager was reporting a rush of
last-minute orders for bouquets and requests for dinner
reservations at the most romantic spots in town.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, WJMN radio was promoting it. The station had
sequestered four lucky couples in a hotel, all competing for the
same prize _ and a measure of celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   And in Germany, the minister of health was discouraging it. The
government even issued a statement expressing grave concern that
the country's hospitals would be overwhelmed on New Year's Day. Or
thereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   It, of course, was the act of producing the ultimate millennial
accessory: a child born on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For those who somehow missed the media hype and the water-cooler
jokes, Friday night was the night that doctors and statisticians
had calculated would be the equivalent of a rare fertility eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the actual likelihood of having a baby on a
specific day _ let alone within a few strokes of midnight _ are
about 4 or 5 percent, said Dr. Magdy Mikhail, chairman of
obstetrics and gynecology at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center. This
was no ordinary Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight's the night; I ovulate today,'' a cheerful sounding
Jacquie Crumlich, 35, of Denver, said Friday afternoon, in
anticipation of her plans to bear a fourth child. ``We're going to
have a candlelight dinner. Some jazz or blues. The kids are all
going to friends' houses. It's a nice way to bring in the new year,
if it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   If it doesn't, she added, that's fine, too. But like so many
things even remotely connected with 2000, the notion of a
millennial baby has provoked something of a marketing frenzy,
turning the most intimate of decisions _ and actions _ into a
public spectacle of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   One San Diego couple originally announced that they would fly to
the tiny island nation of Kirbati, near the international date
line, and undergo a Caesarean section at one second after midnight.
But the couple has since backed off, saying that the specter of a
media crush has been a bit overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   One web site (www.millenniumhell.com) concocted a Top Ten list
of ``Reasons To Try and Conceive the First Baby of the New
Millennium.'' No. 5 is ``It's not just sex. We're making history.''
No. 1, meanwhile, is ``Because your biological clock is not Y2K
compliant.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two months, close to 1,000 people have purchased the
$49.99 Millennium Conception Kits from a San Francisco company
called Baby Center, said Mark Selcow, the company's president. The
kits include ovulation detection tests, pregnancy tests, candles
and massage oils.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the scads of radio stations and hotels that have
been seeking to mix fun and promotion, millennial fever and
pregnancy. In Houston, for instance, KHMX, a radio station, has
already offered a cornucopia of prizes _ including a Texas college
education _ to the first local baby born on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   And in Boston, WJMN sponsored four couples, drawn from a
lottery, to spend Thursday night at a Days Inn hotel, with the
mandate to produce, produce, produce. The station promised to give
$1 million to one of those couples if they are the first in the
United States to bear the first baby next year.
</P>
<P>
   So, to soften the mood, the radio station paid for dinner at an
expensive Italian restaurant, as well as hotel rooms that lavished
roses, chocolates, champagne and _ yes _ edible underwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't the millennium baby be fantastic?'' asked Bobbi
Milso, an administrative assistant from Weymouth, Mass., who spent
Thursday night with her husband Derek, 28, at the Days Inn. ``It
would make a special event even better.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband added: ``I know some people think being part of a
contest makes the process seem trivial. We planned to have a baby
all along. It's been fun, and we got a lot of good free stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, WKTU 103.5 FM tried to do something similar. The
station had originally hoped to send several couples to a hotel,
with the proviso that the couples report on their progress. But
there were technical and logistical difficulties with broadcasting
live from the hotel's lobby, so the station decided, instead, to
distribute free gift packs from the Baby Center, said Janeen
Shaitelman, the station's sales promotion director.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted, of course, that the very idea of having the
first baby of the millennium deserves an asterisk or two. Does the
baby have to born in, say, Kirbati to qualify? Or can there be a
baby born in each time zone, or each country, or each city? And
who's checking, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   And don't even get started on the fact that the real,
scientifically approved millennium actually starts on Jan. 1, 2001.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the most part, though, it seems that many would-be parents
are taking things in stride, despite the suggestions that girls
born on Jan. 1 should be named Millie and boys Miles.
</P>
<P>
   Near Spokane, Wash., Camille Eldridge said that she and her
husband had originally hoped to have their fourth child later this
year, but decided to bump up their schedules when they learned
about the April 9 date. She figured it would be the best way to
mark the start of a new year, a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will ask you, what were you doing when JFK was shot?''
Mrs. Eldridge, 32. ``So it would be neat to remember, what did you
do to bring in the year 2000?''
</P>
<P>
   And at the Fitzpatrick Manhattan Hotel, on Lexington Avenue,
Trevor and Diana Facey, of London, said that they had planned to
have a third and final child long before they knew of any kind of
millennial connection. So, ``don't,'' Facey smiled wrly, ``ask us
how we're spending our evening.''
</P>
<P>
   They don't care, particularly, for the Year 2000 fever that has
gripped Britain. But they do have a knack, they say, for strange
twists of fate. Their 7-year-old son, Christian, was born on
Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Most remarkable, though, is the fact that the Faceys also share
the same birthday. That day was Friday.

 U.S. Loses $909 Million in Thrift Suit
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Sam Zuckerman &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
In a landmark case left over from the savings and loan bailout of
the early 1990s, a federal judge yesterday ordered the government
to pay $909 million for breaking a contract with a thrift that is
now part of San Francisco's Golden State Bancorp.
</P>
<P>
   The award is one of the largest ever against the federal
government but less than the $1.5 billion to $2 billion some
analysts had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by U.S. Claims Court Judge Loren Smith paves the way
for awards in more than 100 similar cases brought by thrifts whose
capital was slashed when the government changed accounting rules a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have estimated the government's liability at as much as
$30 billion,'' said Jefferies &AMP; Co. analyst Charlotte Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say the case is also significant because it reinforces
the principle that the government cannot use its special status to
violate its contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Stevens, lead attorney for the plaintiffs in the case,
said the ruling showed ``the government must honor its agreements
just like any private party.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern California's Glendale Federal Bank filed the suit in
1990, claiming the government had broken a promise to exempt it
from the usual capital requirements thrifts must meet. Golden
State, the parent of California Federal Bank, bought Glendale last
year, inheriting the case.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had previously ruled the government liable, a decision
approved in 1996 by the Supreme Court. The latest ruling came at
the end of a 15-month trial to determine how much the government
owed Glendale in damages.
</P>
<P>
   While Smith ruled that the government had to pay for breaking
its agreement with Glendale, he refused to accept the thrift's
requests to be compensated for profits it lost as it struggled to
raise new capital.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is reviewing the decision, a spokesman
said. Analysts said they expect the government to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   While it could be years before damages are paid, a major
beneficiary will be financier Ronald Perelman, who owns a 30
percent stake in Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State will get 15 percent of any award after legal costs
are paid. The rest will go to holders of special securities
Glendale spun off to shareholders last year. Most of those
securities have been bought by institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   The claims of Glendale and other thrifts are a legacy of the
savings-and -oan crisis of a decade ago. In the 1980s, dozens of
thrifts went bankrupt because of bad loans and high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid costs to the government, federal regulators persuaded
strong thrifts to buy up weak ones. In exchange, they promised to
let the buyers use part of the purchase price to meet regulatory
capital requirements, an accounting asset called ``supervisory
goodwill.''
</P>
<P>
   Capital is the cash and other hard assets banks and thrifts are
required to set aside as a cushion against losses.
</P>
<P>
   When the real estate market crashed in the late 1980s, some of
the buyers were themselves near failure, creating tens of billions
of dollars in potential liability for the government, which insured
deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Congress then enacted the 1989 thrift bailout law which, among
other things, set tough capital standards and outlawed using
goodwill as capital.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale nearly failed when it was no longer allowed to use
goodwill from a 1981 acquisition as capital. Other thrifts weren't
so lucky. Dozens were seized by the federal government when their
capital fell below regulatory standards.

 Fair, Isaac CEO OKs Demotion To Research
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Sam Zuckerman &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
In an unusual corporate reshuffling, Larry Rosenberger, chief
executive of Fair, Isaac, said yesterday he has agreed to take a
lower-ranking job after the maker of financial software finds a new
CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberger, 52, will stay with fast-growing San Rafael company
as research and development chief. While it's common for CEOs to be
replaced as companies grow, it's rare for the former chief to
accept a demotion.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberger said he agreed to step down because Fair, Isaac
needs a leader with experience in taking a company from small,
entrepreneurial status to a larger, more complex organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent my entire business career of 25 years here,''
Rosenberger said. ``Quite frankly, the conclusion was that we
needed someone who had led a company through a transformation of
that size. I agree with that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair, Isaac said its board has launched a search for a new chief
and that Rosenberger is a member of the search committee. He will
continue as CEO until a successor is found.
</P>
<P>
   Fair, Isaac started by selling analysis tools to lenders and the
credit card industry designed to identify which customers were most
likely to pay off loans. In recent years, the company has expanded
its products to include a wide range of software for analyzing
consumer and business financial data, including software to help
make credit decisions on small business loans.
</P>
<P>
   During the past decade, as computerized data manipulation
techniques became more sophisticated, the market for credit
analysis tools grew explosively. Since Rosenberger became CEO eight
years ago, the company's sales and stock market value have
multiplied tenfold.
</P>
<P>
   In the fiscal year ended September 30, the company earned $24.3
million on sales of $245.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Fair, Isaac approved a new strategy to sell
data analysis products to health care, telecommunications and
electronic commerce companies, as well as financial services firms.

 &HT;    Midwest hit by deadly tornado
 &HT;    By Tom Beyerlein
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Ohio's deadliest tornado since 1985 ripped
through Cincinnati's affluent northeastern suburbs just before
sunup Friday, killed four people, destroyed 200 homes and damaged
hundreds of other businesses and residences.
</P>
<P>
   Two other people were killed in Illinois as powerful storms tore
through the Midwest overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The storm killed a married couple in their Montgomery, Ohio,
home and two motorists whose cars were tossed by the violent winds.
Dozens of people were taken to area hospitals, mostly suffering
from cuts and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   In Ashland, Ill., a community of 1,200, a tornado ripped into a
trailer park and killed a 68-year-old woman. And a 43-year-old
woman was killed in a mobile home in Cisco, 65 miles to the east.
</P>
<P>
   The storms also damaged homes in Indiana. In Iowa, at least nine
suspected tornadoes destroyed homes, flattened barns and uprooted
trees.
</P>
<P>
   A tornado also ravaged a five-block area in the Nebraska town of
North Bend on Thursday afternoon, and the storm damaged buildings
and downed power lines in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   In upscale Cincinnati suburbs of Montgomery, Blue Ash and Symmes
Twp., the storms uprooted or snapped tall trees, knocked down power
lines and flattened homes and businesses, littering usually
pristine lawns with debris. Electrical power was disrupted to more
than 200,000 customers of the utility Cinergy, although service was
restored to all but about 30,000 homes by Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I have never witnessed such tragic, overwhelming
destruction of neighborhoods,'' Gov. Bob Taft said after he toured
the devastation and declared states of emergency in Hamilton,
Warren and Clinton counties. ``It has been one of the most serious
disasters we have experienced in Ohio. The force of the tornado is
something we have not seen for many, many years.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the deadliest Ohio tornado since May 31, 1985, when 10
died and 250 were injured in a Trumbull County twister, according
to the Ohio Insurance Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Taft's declaration means the three counties are eligible for
state disaster relief services. Meanwhile, Ohio's U.S. senators,
George Voinovich and Mike DeWine, wrote a joint letter to President
Clinton, urging his attention to the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado was part of a storm system that hammered several
counties in Ohio and southeastern Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The storm also flipped motor homes and campers that convert to
tents at the Dave Arbogast dealership in Tipp City, 60 miles north
of Cincinnati. ``We got about 10 tent campers in a nice, neat
pile,'' said Ron West, a manager.
</P>
<P>
   Less severe damage was reported in Wayne County, Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service issued the tornado warning for
south and central Ohio and northern Kentucky at 4:52 a.m. Friday
after a funnel cloud was sighted in the sky 17 miles west of
Cincinnati. Radar also indicated presence of a tornado,
meteorologist Brian Coniglio said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it appears it was just one tornado,'' said
meteorologist Sam McNeil of the National Weather Service. ``There
is a possibility in theory that it could have been more than one.''
The main tornado could have spawned several smaller vortices, he
said, as it did in the devastating April 3, 1974, Xenia, Ohio,
tornado that killed 33 and injured more than 1,300.
</P>
<P>
   The only touchdown confirmed Friday was in the Blue Ash area,
McNeil said. The tornado's path was from 400 feet to nearly a mile
wide and 6-7 miles long. Straight-line winds destroyed a dozen
homes in rural Clinton County near Clarksville, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary reports indicate the tornado that touched down in
Blue Ash rated F-3 on the Fujita scale with wind speeds of 158 to
205 miles per hour, McNeil said. In comparison, the tornado that
hit Xenia 25 years ago received a more serious F-5 rating. The
Fujita scale classifies tornados based on a wind speed range and
damage on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are indications the tornado in Blue Ash may have touched
down with F-4 force in isolated areas,'' McNeil said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with the number of injuries and fatalities, we're getting
reports that people heard warning sirens activated and were able to
take cover,'' McNeil said. ``We're encouraged by that.''
</P>
<P>
   But some residents said they didn't hear sirens. Montgomery
Mayor Richard Tuten heard a siren, but said its significance may
have escaped some people so early in the morning. ``If you're in
bed asleep, it's not like an alarm clock. You may hear it and not
know exactly what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Ambrose and Megan Britt said they were asleep in their
Symmes Twp. apartment when noise from the storm awakened them.
Alarmed, they decided to evacuate. ``I went into the spare bedroom
to grab my socks,'' Britt said, ``and realized the wall was
missing.''
</P>
<P>
   When they fled outside, Britt, 23, said, they saw ``mayhem'' _
dumpsters blown in the street, cars with windows shattered. One
wall of their Village Brooke Apartments building was blown away,
and couches and beds protruded from upper-story apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to return to his apartment throughout the day for a
change of clothes, Ambrose had to attend his mother's wedding
rehearsal dinner in a T-shirt and khaki pants.
</P>
<P>
   Shelters were established at Sycamore Junior High School and
Cincinnati Hills Christian Academy with food, cots and phones for
displaced people. But relief workers said it appeared most of those
affected by the storm would stay with family or friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``This area that was hit was more self-sufficient
(financially),'' said Sara Peller, chief executive of the
Cincinnati area chapter of the American Red Cross. ``We are
estimating that 95 percent have insurance, which usually doesn't
happen in a disaster area.''
</P>
<P>
   Staff writers Lawrence Budd, John Keilman, Chick Ludwig, Joann
Rouse and Joanne Huist Smith contributed to his report.

 Neighbors Wind Up on Unintended Party Line
<TEXT>
<P>

 &UR; By Deborah Solomon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
In the movie ``Pillow Talk,'' neighbors Rock Hudson and Doris Day
unwillingly share a telephone line but eventually fall in love.
</P>
<P>
   For three people sharing a phone line in Burlingame, the results
have not been as amorous.
</P>
<P>
   For almost a month, David Parkinson and David Guzman, two
roommates in Burlingame, Calif., unknowingly shared their phone
number with Michelle Karan, a neighbor down the street.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs that something was amiss _ the two men got a
lot of calls for someone named Michelle, their phone would ring
twice then suddenly stop, and friends who tried to call the
roommates said a woman often answered their phone.
</P>
<P>
   The situation also puzzled Karan, who would often pick up the
phone and hear voices.
</P>
<P>
   At first Guzman and Parkinson thought it was just crossed wires.
But they eventually discovered that Pacific Bell had assigned their
phone number to Karan, who lives a few buildings away.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend called and said `Some woman has been answering your
phone for the past week. She said she lives two buildings down from
you and has the same phone number,''' Parkinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the phone number that Parkinson and Guzman had
gotten four months earlier had been given to Karan about a month
ago, after she moved into a new apartment. Karan had asked Pac Bell
if she could keep her old Burlingame phone number, but was told no
and assigned the same number Parkinson and Guzman already had.
</P>
<P>
   After figuring out what was going on, Parkinson called Pac Bell
to see what could be done. ``They laughed at me and said that
couldn't be possible; that they couldn't assign the same number to
two people.''
</P>
<P>
   Karan had better luck. Pac Bell told her she would get her old
phone number on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell and the California Public Utilities Commission say
it is extremely rare for two customers to share a line.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell spokesman John Britton denied that the two neighbors
were assigned the same phone number, although both told The
Chronicle they had the same number.
</P>
<P>
   Britton said human error caused the same phone line to feed into
two different apartments and that the problem is being fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman said he hopes it's been resolved, since the situation has
created confusion and a little friction between the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``People call us late. She was getting our phone calls at 11
p.m. She probably didn't like that,'' Guzman said.
</P>
<P>
   Karan said she did grow weary of getting so many phone calls for
``David.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd had enough phone calls for David and finally told someone
who called, `When you get hold of David, tell him this is my
situation. I don't know what's going on, but I'm getting his phone
calls.'''
</P>
<P>
   That someone was Michael Evenson, Parkinson's friend who figured
out that the neighbors shared a phone number. He said at first he
thought Guzman and Parkinson were leading a secret life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was curious as to why a lady answered the phone,'' said
Evenson. ``My first words to her were `Who's this?' She wanted to
know who I was too.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the situation may sound amusing, Parkinson, who has
been jobhunting for several weeks, said he may have missed
opportunities because of the mix-up.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman said the two wondered why Parkinson wasn't getting any
calls from prospective employers. Several recruiters told Parkinson
they had tried to call the phone number on his resume, but were
told they had the wrong number.
</P>
<P>
   And the two are also concerned about their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman said he overheard some of Karan's conversations and is
sure she overheard some of his.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson said, ``I talked to my doctor heavily this month about
things I wouldn't want anyone to overhear.''

AID GROUP'S PARTNERSHIP WITH NATO RAISES CONCERN OVER TRADITION OF
NEUTRALITY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The new partnership between NATO and the U.N.
refugee organization is bringing supplies and shelter to hundreds
of thousands who have fled Kosovo, but some fear it is straining
the traditional neutrality of aid groups.
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops have set up refugee camps in Albania and Macedonia,
NATO airplanes are flying badly needed supplies to those camps and
NATO technicians are running all the logistics for the relief
flights, even from inside the U.N. refugee headquarters in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that by working so closely with one side's
military in an ongoing assault, the U.N. refugee organization may
have crossed the line that allows relief organizations to care for
the victims of both sides of a conflict, some governments and aid
organizations said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid that in the minds of Americans and Europeans the
military and the relief organizations are working on one side of
the war together, we're all part of the same operation, but we
can't be.'' said Joelle Tanguy, the executive director of Doctors
Without Borders. ``Independence is our main asset _ to be able to
walk into a war zone and act as independent relief workers.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary-general, defended the
relationship during a Security Council meeting, saying he
personally approved and ``gratefully accepted'' NATO's involvement
in the U.N. relief operation. At the request of the Russian
delegate to the United Nations, Annan also made public the exchange
of letters between Secretary-General Javier Solana of NATO and
Sadako Ogata, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees establishing
the partnership.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday, NATO spokesmen in Brussels were answering the
same questions, emphasizing that ``NATO will not seek to create an
independent humanitarian role for itself `` and that the military
was working under the lead of the UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously an extremely uncomfortable position for the
UNHCR,'' said Kathleen Newland, a refugee expert at the Carnegie
Endowment. ``They're trying to emphasize the civilian character of
the operation, but that protest pretty much flies in the face of
what is obvious _ that UNHCR is lining up with one side of the
conflict.``
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the concerns of relief organizations, she said that ``as
far as the NATO participation in relief operations goes, that's all
for the good, they are life savers.'' What is at issue is how to
keep that participation at an arms length and ensure neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   Neutrality is a responsibility under international law for many
refugee organizations, including the International Committee of the
Red Cross, which said this week it could not become partners with
NATO the way the UNHCR has.
</P>
<P>
   When asked for alternatives, Ms. Tanguy and other refugee
officials suggested keeping the operations entirely separate, with
individual countries making their contributions but with the United
Nations in charge of all the operations. Establishing NATO refugee
camps in Macedonia was her top example.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should be UNHCR camps from the very start,`' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of NATO troops under NATO command setting up and running
the camps, she and other officials said the Macedonian government
should have been forced to negotiate with the UNHCR, whose
officials would then have supervised the construction by soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   But other officials who have had to handle refugee crises in
this decade say that there is no getting around the fact that the
military has to be called into these operations and, inevitably,
take charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Kosovo, in great part, the military has taken over the
relief effort.'' said Morton Abramowitz, of the Council of Foreign
Relations who as U.S. ambassador to Turkey helped conceive a
ground-breaking cooperative effort by relief organizations and the
U.S. and British militaries to help Iraqi Kurds. ``The magnitude of
suffering has to be relieved as quickly as you can _ and you have
to put aside all other questions.``
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   During the 1990s, the U.S. military has taken an increasingly
active role in refugee crises. In the 1991 mission that Abramowitz
oversaw, the United States and allied forces escorted tens of
thousands of Iraqi Kurds from Turkey back to a safe haven area in
northern Iraq after the Persian Gulf War ended. To this day the
Kurds are being protected by U.S. and allied combat jets patrolling
the skies over their villages.
</P>
<P>
   That operation was followed by U.S. military involvement in
relief missions in Somalia, Rwanda and Bosnia, and in each case
``mission-creep'' brought the relief agencies closer to the
military.
</P>
<P>
   Questions were raised about military escorts for aid convoys and
whether the proximity of U.S. troops would spoil neutrality. But in
all of these cases the United States was not an active belligerent,
or it was part of a U.N. mission that provided its own mantle of
neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kosovo conflict NATO is not fighting under a U.N.
mandate, in part because Russia and China said they would veto
approval for the air attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Bosnia, when we were also working with NATO countries, our
relief operations were under the U.N. and they were well-balanced
with Russians,'' said a relief agency official who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. ``There should be some way to preserve
neutrality and still take advantage of NATO's logistics. Otherwise
humanitarian organizations should just become part of the military
operations.``

<P>
   David Hadfield still winces when he recalls the 1989 merger of
Coopers &AMP; Lybrand and some international operations of Deloitte,
Haskins &AMP; Sells.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured they're both accounting firms, they trade in the
same markets, so of course their cultures would be the same,'' said
Hadfield, who was a consultant with Deloitte at the time. ``We
couldn't have been more wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Deloitte, he explained, was far more free-spirited than the
control-minded Coopers. And it took three years of employee
defections and financial bleeding _and finally a new management
team _ to get the firm past its culture clashes.
</P>
<P>
   So last year, when Coopers and Price Waterhouse merged to form
the $15.3 billion megafirm PricewaterhouseCoopers, they took steps
to avoid the same nightmare. Ten months before the deal was
completed, each firm assigned four executives to a merger
integration team, which in turn named Hadfield as its global
transition director.
</P>
<P>
   ``If no one has full-time responsibility for making a merger
work,'' he explained, ``you'll mess up what could have been a
perfectly good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing new about the idea that a merger or acquisition
can give rise to cultural conflicts, to quarrels over incompatible
pay systems, to information systems that don't communicate with
each other and to various other problems. Indeed, researchers
routinely say that anywhere from one-half to three-quarters of
mergers never provide the low costs, added market share or other
benefits that management promised shareholders _ or that they take
much longer than expected to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But until recently, corporations acted as if the only way to
better those odds was to look more closely at whether a potential
partner's markets and products really meshed with their own, and
then to negotiate harder if the deal still made sense.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, they are also training their magnifying glasses on
all the possible glitches that could come after the deal is done _
and seeking ways to prevent them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've walked away from companies with autocratic leaders
because their employees wouldn't fit in with our team culture,''
said Ammar Hanafi, director of business development for Cisco
Systems, a maker of computer networking equipment. ``We even walked
away from one that had fancy artwork on its walls, because we
doubted it would fit into our culture of frugality.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco, based in San Jose, Calif., has acquired 32 companies
since its founding 13 years ago _ two of them just last week. It
has 15 full-time people dedicated not only to making mergers work,
but also to steering management away from marriages that might be
undermined by issues of company culture.
</P>
<P>
   As deal-making continues its rampant transformation of Corporate
America, the concept of in-house merger managers keeps gaining
converts.
</P>
<P>
   Allied Signal, General Electric and Lucent Technologies all now
have specialists dedicated to integration of merged companies. In
February, AT&AMP;T _ busy digesting Tele-Communications Inc. and
setting up joint ventures with British Telecom and Time Warner _
promoted Harold Burlingame, its executive vice president of human
resources, to the new position of executive vice president of
merger and joint venture integration.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's changed is that companies are paying as much formal
attention to post-deal integration as they pay to the pre-deal part
of mergers,'' said Bruce Pasternack, a senior vice president at
Booz, Allen &AMP; Hamilton, the consulting firm,
</P>
<P>
   Consultants say the list of such companies grows daily. ``Lack
of attention to cultures and systems has caused a tremendous number
of deals to blow up, and that's shown companies that slapping
functions together is not the same as integrating them,'' said Mark
Clemente, president of Clemente Greenspan &AMP; Co., a management
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Recent history has been rife with learning opportunities.
Accounting irregularities take only part of the blame, for example,
for the implosion of Cendant Corp., the $14 billion company created
when HFS and CUC International joined forces in late 1997. Most
business experts also implicate the mismatch in styles between the
controlling and numbers-oriented Henry Silverman, HFS's chief, and
the strategy-minded, people-oriented Walter Forbes, the head of
CUC.
</P>
<P>
   At AT&AMP;T, a good part of Burlingame's new job is to ensure that
the company does not repeat with TCI the mistakes it made when it
acquired NCR Corp. in 1991 and McCaw Cellular in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In both of those cases, AT&AMP;T let efforts to coordinate sales
pitches, product development and client contacts simmer on a back
burner. AT&AMP;T never made money on NCR, which it eventually spun off
to shareholders. And while AT&AMP;T's cellular business eventually
prospered after the acquisition of McCaw, Burlingame believes the
company took far too long to absorb its purchase. ``We lost a
chance to blow the competition out of the water,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons that merger integration has emerged as a
discipline, with its own dedicated personnel. Corporations have
whittled away at headquarters staffs, and the support people who
survived _ and might be logical candidates for merger duties _
rarely have much slack in their schedules. Moreover, top executives
recognize that unless they hold individuals accountable for
shepherding an acquired company, integration issues could fall by
the wayside.
</P>
<P>
   The number of mergers and acquisitions is at a dizzying high.
Last year, Securities Data/Thomson Financial Co., a research firm,
counted more than 23,000 deals worldwide, worth $2.5 trillion; the
pace this year is even faster, with $840 billion in deals reaching
fruition worldwide in the first quarter alone.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, the big telecommunications equipment maker, has bought
18 companies in its less than three years of existence. Tyco
International, an industrial conglomerate, has bought 110 companies
since L. Dennis Kozlowski became chief executive six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``For many companies, mergers have moved from occasional event
to a routine, frequent part of doing business,'' noted Jim
Fishbein, a vice president of Rath &AMP; Strong, the consulting arm of
Aon Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The deal frenzy has driven prices for acquisitions sky-high,
making shareholders unforgiving of deals that do not add to
earnings immediately. So the ability to integrate a new company
quickly _ and wring out some costs in the process _ has become a
major factor in how a merged company's stock performs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies have to come full-steam out of the gate to justify
the premiums on deals,'' said Ronald Ashkenas, managing partner of
Robert Schaffer &AMP; Associates, a consulting firm in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Hercules Inc. certainly knows that. Last July, when it announced
its purchase of BetzDearborn, another company in the specialty
chemicals business, for $2.4 billion in cash and $700 million in
assumed debt, it promised investors that by the end of 2000, it
would achieve $125 million in synergies _ merger-speak for cost
savings.
</P>
<P>
   Well before the deal was completed in October, Hercules assigned
executives from the two companies to integration teams. Vincent
Corbo, president of Hercules, presided over the teams, sending each
to a different unit to find potential cost cuts and devise
schedules for achieving them. He also set up an ``integration
program office,'' with a full-time head responsible for seeing that
the timetables were met.
</P>
<P>
   Corbo says the merged company is ahead of schedule on reducing
costs. But it is still suffering the types of culture clashes that
led to the abrupt departure of William Cook, Betz's former chief
executive, shortly after the companies merged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that at Hercules decisions are made analytically,
while Betz was managed more intuitively,'' Corbo said. ``But it
made sense to get the people in place and the cost synergies
planned for before we tried to merge the cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, companies that make frequent acquisitions have found
that, after a while, they can handle cost-cutting and personnel
issues almost by rote. Their merger integration specialists are
high on the learning curve when it comes to disposing of excess
real estate, melding pension plans, coordinating accounting systems
or handling other important but typical merger chores. Spared of
having to reinvent the wheel in those areas, they have more time to
study the cultural and market issues that make each merger unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot speedier if the same people handle the myriad
things that are similar in acquisitions and the business units
concentrate on melding products, markets and cultures,'' said
Patricia Russo, the executive vice president who oversees Lucent's
merger integration group.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Yeaw, who last year became the first director of human
resources for mergers and acquisitions at Allied Signal, the
industrial conglomerate, agreed. ``You want to customize every
integration, but you don't want to start from scratch each time,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Internet technology has made it easier to build banks of
institutional memory and advice. About two years ago, General
Electric pulled together separate teams from human resources,
finance and more than a dozen other corporate functions and set
them to interviewing GE people who had been involved in some of the
hundreds of deals that the company has done in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   A result is an elaborate site on GE's internal computer network,
sorted by subjects like culture or compensation, so that people
responsible for those issues can quickly find anecdotes gleaned
from past deals, names of GE contacts and even tips on how to
choose the right leader for an integration team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web page's contents, printed out, would fill enough file
folders to line an office wall,'' said Gary Reiner, chief
information officer for GE. ``The intranet is the first viable
medium for sharing best practices.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who have been wounded by past mergers, remembering the
worst practices is even more important.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, Burlingame of AT&AMP;T concedes that the whole notion
behind the NCR deal _ that the communications and computing worlds
were themselves merging _ was flawed. But he believes AT&AMP;T
exacerbated the problems by not coordinating goals with NCR early
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two companies retained different visions,'' Burlingame
recalled. ``AT&AMP;T figured it could build on NCR's customer base to
sell full-service networks, but NCR just wanted to use our brand
name to sell their hardware.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Burlingame is already trying to insure that cable employees
from TCI and their telephone counterparts from AT&AMP;T travel the same
road from Day One. High on his list are training programs aimed at
keeping TCI employees, who have concentrated on serving local
markets, from working at cross-purposes with AT&AMP;T employees, who
are trying to expand national markets.
</P>
<P>
   With Burlingame so new in his job, he might do well to pick up
some tips from Hadfield at PricewaterhouseCoopers. Since July,
Hadfield has designed employee-retention programs, redeployed some
partners to new posts, sent other partners for merger-related
training, dispatched people to explain the merger to clients,
streamlined purchasing and otherwise cut costs _ and made sure that
the firm's 150,000 employees are up to date on the integration
process.
</P>
<P>
   Hadfield, who expects his assignment to last through this year,
credits the integration program for the company's success in
retaining nearly all of the 9,000 partners who had been most
important to the two firms before they merged.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike PricewaterhouseCoopers, EPS Solutions Inc. _ also born of
a merger of accounting and consulting firms _ has no legacy of
failure to guard against. But its integration challenge is perhaps
the most dire around.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is no cookie-cutter approach to merging two companies
successfully into one.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that buy other businesses only once in a while usually
create a full-time but temporary integration team for any new
purchase; the team is disbanded once the acquired company is
sufficiently acclimated. Companies like the specialty chemicals
maker Hercules Inc., which buy and merge at a steady but not heady
pace, often assign a high-level executive to oversee the
integration of a new company, giving him or her access to staff
support. And corporations like Lucent Technologies or Cisco
Systems, which make acquisitions often, tend to have permanent
teams whose sole job is to integrate the new companies into their
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have the same people doing it, then every deal
acts as a shock to your whole system,'' said Ammar Hanafi, Cisco's
director of business development, who coordinates integration
efforts both before and after acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Differences aside, more and more companies are planning for
integration even as they research deals. Well before an acquisition
is closed, both companies are deciding whose compensation programs
will survive, which offices or plants will close, which executives
will run the combined business units or be primary contacts for
customers, and how the integration process will be communicated to
employees. They are ferreting out potential culture clashes and
designing training programs to combat them.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, they are creating detailed implementation plans,
complete with milestones, for making the merger work _ and fast.
``Having a permanent integration team shaves months off the
integration process,'' said Patricia Russo, the executive vice
president who oversees Lucent's merger integration group.

BID TO SECURE U.S. SOLDIERS' FREEDOM FAILS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Cypriot leader Spyros Kyprianou failed
Friday to win the release of three U.S. soldiers held captive by
the Serbs and blamed NATO's intensified bombing campaign in
Yugoslavia for making his mission ``more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyprianou angrily denounced the continuing allied airstrikes
shortly after he emerged from a 90-minute meeting in Belgrade with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. The Serb leader told him
that the Americans would continue to be held as prisoners of war
until the allies stop bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intensified heavy bombing of the last couple of days made
my humanitarian mission more difficult. It is well known, and it
has always been the position of President Milosevic, that bombing
should stop,'' Kyprianou told reporters after his talks.
</P>
<P>
   He complained that NATO should have shown ``some respect'' for
his mission by at least interrupting the bombing in and around the
Yugoslav capital of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of stopping, NATO intensified and expanded its
targets in Serbia and Kosovo during Kyprianou's two day visit,
attacking a large automobile plant, more fuel storage areas, and
Yugoslav troops and weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials expressed disappointment at the
failure of Kyprianou's mission, but said they were not surprised by
the outcome. They also stressed that Kyprianou was well aware when
he undertook his humanitarian effort that the release of the
soldiers would have be to unconditional.
</P>
<P>
   The three soldiers _ Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los
Angeles; Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek,
Mich. and Spc. Steven M. Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas _ were
captured by Yugoslav forces on March 31 as they were patrolling
along the Macedonia-Kosovo border as part of a NATO peacekeeping
force.
</P>
<P>
   The news that the three soldiers would not be freed came amid
new reports of atrocities being committed by Milosevic's army
troops and security police in Kosovo, where an estimated 1.2
million ethnic Albanians have been driven from their homes over the
past year and into refugee camps in Albania, Macedonia and
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting some very disturbing reports out of Kosovo ...
of young Kosovo women who are being herded into a Serb army
training camp at Dakovica in southwest Kosovo, where they are being
raped by troops. And we have reports that as many as 20 may have
been killed in the course of this,'' said Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This a very eerie and disturbing echo of documented instances
of rape and killing of women in Bosnia during the Bosnian war,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the NATO air campaign started, the allies had accused
Milosevic's forces of killing more than 2,000 ethnic Albanians in
an offensive against separatist rebels fighting for an independent
Kosovo, which is a province of Serbia. Since the NATO bombing
began, Milosevic's forces have expanded and intensified their
efforts to rid Kosovo of its predominantly ethnic Albanian
population. Refugees fleeing the country have reported mass
killings and whole villages being emptied and burned to the ground.
Allied officials fear that thousands more may have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Milosevic's forces closed the borders of
Kosovo and turned back refugees trying to leave even as the Serb
leader was announcing a unilateral cease-fire against Kosovar
rebels. But there is no evidence that his army and police units
have abided by it.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Friday that Milosevic's latest actions in
Kosovo have only ``strengthened the unity and resolve'' of NATO
allies ``to persist and prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Milosevic is hoping that the allies ``will accept
as permanent the results of his `ethnic cleansing.''' But, he
continued, ``We will not. Not when a quarter of Kosovo's people are
living in refugee camps beyond Kosovo's borders. Not when hundreds
of thousands more are trapped inside, afraid to go home but unable
to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to stop the Serb actions in Kosovo, NATO has
focused more of its bombing missions in recent days on Yugoslav
troops and equipment. But Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme NATO
commander, said it is becoming more difficult to attack Yugoslav
units from the air because many of them ``are in hiding.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he said the allies have had great success in
stopping a number of Serb operations, by cutting off food and fuel
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Clinton had insisted that NATO ground forces will not be
committed to the fight. But he came under pressure Friday from nine
U.S. lawmakers to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Clinton, Rep. Jim Turner, D-Texas, joined with
eight other members of Congress, to urge that NATO begin planning
for the commitment of ground troops ``to achieve NATO's broader
objective'' of ``reversing Milosevic's genocide actions in
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter was also signed by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a
former Vietnam POW who is considering a run for the presidency next
year. McCain said he hopes to introduce a resolution in the Senate
next week that would authorize the use of ``whatever force is
necessary'' to drive Milosevic's troops out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, however, Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., said he
intends to introduce a resolution that would deny funding for
ground troops unless approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin also issued a strong warning to
NATO, suggesting that Moscow may have no choice but to enter the
fighting if the bombing continues and NATO decides to send in
ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement in Moscow, Yeltsin said there could be a
``European war and possibly a world war.'' There were also reports
out of Russia that Yeltsin had ordered that nuclear missiles be
targeted at NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
   But State Department officials played down the Yeltsin comments,
and a spokesman at the Kremlin later denied that any missiles were
being aimed at the United States and its allies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the incident was serious enough that Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
about it and planned a meeting with him next week in Oslo, Norway,
to discuss the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO officials were planning to beef up their forces in the
Balkans, they were also increasing efforts to help with the refugee
crisis caused by the Kosovo conflict. There were signs, though,
that relief efforts were beginning to make things better for
thousands still confined to camps.
</P>
<P>
   Plans to airlift up to 20,000 Kosovar Albanians to Guantanamo
Bay naval base in Cuba were put on hold. The facilities there are
still being readied, but U.S. officials said that ``the
bottleneck'' at refugee centers had improved. Officials also
acknowledged that the refugees were reluctant to go to Guantanamo.

OLAZABAL PROVES INJURY IS IN HIS PAST BY TAKING LEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ There was a time, not so long ago, when climbing
a hill meant pure agony for Jose Maria Olazabal.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to walk for more than a year because of a unique medical
condition, scaling a leader board at a professional golf tournament
_ let alone the Masters _ seemed completely out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal prefers not to think about those dark days, an 18-month
stretch when he feared his career might be over.
</P>
<P>
   But the Spaniard, who won the 1994 Masters, could not avoid
reflecting on them yesterday after peering down from atop the
leader board at a major championship for the first time since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal fired a second-round 66 yesterday at Augusta National
Golf Club, moving to 8-under par through 36 holes, and taking a
one-stroke lead over Scott McCarron. Nobody else is closer than
three strokes back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This feels great,'' said Olazabal, 33, who missed the 1996
Masters because of his ailment. ``I try not to think too much about
what happened in the past. But it helps me to appreciate what I've
done.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Olazabal attempts to block out the memories of a
misdiagnosis that left him at home in Fuenterrabia, Spain, on his
back and listening to music, while the world watched Greg Norman
gift-wrap the 1996 Masters for Nick Faldo. Eventually, a German
doctor discovered that Olazabal suffered not from arthritis in his
feet, but from a muscle ailment in his lower back.
</P>
<P>
   Physical therapy and cortisone injections allowed Olazabal to
walk without pain. Now, he leads a major championship for the first
time since shooting an opening 66 at the 1995 Masters _ roughly
four months before the start of his medical odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal got there with the only bogey-free effort of the second
round, which moved him a stroke ahead of McCarron and three in
front of Greg Norman (5 under) and Lee Janzen (5 under). Nick Price
and Davis Love III, both at 3 under, are the only others who
survived the cut of 4-over 148 that are within five strokes of the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-six golfers will play the weekend rounds at Augusta,
including Fort Worth resident Mark Brooks (4 over), who survived
his second Masters cut in nine career attempts. David Duval, the
world's top-ranked golfer, is nine strokes off the pace, at 1 over.
Tiger Woods, the No. 2 player in the world rankings, is at
even-par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm discouraged, but I'm not down,'' said Duval, the PGA
Tour's leading money winner who is attempting to win his third
consecutive event. ``You can make up a lot of shots in two days
around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal covered significant ground yesterday by bagging six
birdies, all on putts inside 18 feet. He found 14 of 18 greens in
regulation, saved par from two sand traps and might have regained
lost confidence. Olazabal has yet to crack the top 20 in a European
Tour event this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't had a great round this season, so it's really nice to
have two good rounds in a row here to somehow make you believe more
in what you can do,'' said Olazabal, who has needed just 49 putts
through 36 holes on Augusta's undulating greens.
</P>
<P>
   Of the top six names on the leader board, all but McCarron have
won major championships. McCarron, 33, has two victories in five
seasons on the PGA Tour: the 1996 Freeport McDermott Classic and
the 1997 BellSouth Classic. But don't try to convince McCarron, who
collected six birdies and two bogeys in his second-round effort,
that he will be out of his element in trying to fend off the
weekend charges of Norman, Price, Janzen and Love.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are sometimes lesser-knowns who lead golf tournaments. I
don't consider myself a lesser-known,'' said McCarron, who holed a
55-foot putt for the day's only birdie at No. 4, a 205-yard par-3
that played to a scoring average of 3.5. ``When I'm playing with
Norman, I feel I'm as good as him. You have to believe that or you
don't belong out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal, on the other hand, is glad to prove that he belongs
again, from a physical standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always have to try to be positive in a situation like
that,'' Olazabal said of his 18 months away from competitive golf.
``When I watched the Masters in '96, I was always thinking that,
one day, I will be back there.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's all the way back. And all the way to the top of the
leader board.  &LR; tagtop:Jimmy Burch, (817) 390-7760

CLINTON PUSHES FOR PATIENTS BILL OF RIGHTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Trying to revive an issue that has been
overshadowed by impeachment and war, President Clinton on Friday
joined Democratic lawmakers in pushing for passage of legislation
regulating managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   The president urged Congress to pass the Patients Bill of
Rights, which would give consumers more rights to challenge medical
decisions by their HMOs, and give them more access to specialists
and emergency rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The president said the primary purpose of managed care plans
should not be ``to deliver cheap health care; the primary purpose
is to deliver quality health care as cheaply and inexpensively as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   With Congress scheduled to come back from a two-week recess this
week, the president scolded GOP leaders for not allowing the
Democratic health care bills to be considered despite broad public
support.
</P>
<P>
   He attributed their reluctance to pressure from the managed care
lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically the large HMOs, the insurers, have got the ear of
the congressional majority, and they have a lot of political
influence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the break from dealing with the NATO military campaign
in Yugoslavia, Clinton noted that the situation abroad had the
potential to harm his domestic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the managed care bill's opponents were probably
dismissing the health care event held with members of Congress,
based on the assumption that ``they probably can't break through
the evening news tonight because of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The managed care legislation has lost momentum before because of
other more sensational events. Last year, Congress had been
considering changes when the impeachment proceedings against
Clinton intruded and consumed most of their time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite congressional inaction, Clinton announced he would
direct that the health plans that cover federal workers comply with
two new requirements designed to protect consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The 289 health plans serving federal workers would have to pay
for or provide transitional care for certain chronically ill or
pregnant patients who are forced to change health plans or
providers.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the health plans would have to provide additional
information to consumers on customer satisfaction and clinical
quality measures.
</P>
<P>
   The president already had ordered the federal health plans to
meet a series of other requirements, including access to emergency
rooms and specialists outside the plan's network when medically
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also countered the Republicans' argument that the
managed care changes would drive up health care costs, citing a
recent study analyzing the costs of the changes in effect for
federal workers. The study by the Office of Personnel Management
estimated the additional costs as $10 a year for each of the 4.1
million enrollees in the federal system.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats hope to make health care a major issue in the current
legislative session and perhaps through the 2000 election.
Democrats and health care advocacy groups have launched a national
petition drive to pressure Republican leaders to consider the
Democratic legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, aware of public discontent with managed care, have
proposed remedies. But Democrats claim the GOP bills do not go far
enough in giving people the ability to appeal decisions and would
not cover all health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant difference between Democratic and GOP
health care bills concerns the right to sue managed care plans.
Democrats want to amend federal law to ensure that consumers can
sue their HMOs in state courts. Currently, federal laws governing
multistate employer based health care plans bans such suits.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have balked at permitting such suits, suggesting it
would be a bonanza for trial lawyers and drive up health care
costs.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how the HMO issue will play on the presidential
campaign trail. Republican presidential contender Gov. George W.
Bush has been ambivalent about the issue. He refused to sign the
1997 HMO bill, citing concerns about the increased litigation. But
he also did not veto the bill, which passed the Legislature with
bipartisan support, and therefore allowed it to become law.

INDIA'S TATTERED COALITION FRAYS A BIT MORE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI _ India is going through another paroxysm of
finger-pointing, hand-wringing, arm-twisting, head-counting and
back-stabbing as its third coalition government in three years
threatens to come apart.
</P>
<P>
   Hindu nationalists came to power a year ago on a platform of
stable, clean and effective governance. They now face the strong
possibility of losing their coalition majority in Parliament next
week because of a falling out with their largest, most tempestuous
and _ many believe _ most corrupt coalition partner, Jayalalitha
Jayaram, who leads a state party from Tamil Nadu.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday Jayalalitha, as she is known here, is to arrive in the
capital. While it is always possible she may patch up her
differences with Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and his
Bharatiya Janata Party, the expectation is otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   All week newspapers have been filled with the comings and goings
of political emissaries trying to cut deals. India has two major
national political forces _ Bharatiya Janata and the Congress
Party. With neither able to win a majority in Parliament, three
dozen smaller parties holding seats take on inflated importance.
</P>
<P>
   Jayalalitha's party, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra
Kazagham, has 18 seats. Her withdrawal from the coalition could
cause a no-confidence vote against the government some time after
Parliament reconvenes on April 15.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, as the rumor-mill produced an abundant inventory,
Jayalalitha took another step toward making her differences with
the BJP irreconcilable, quitting the coalition's coordinating
committee. Earlier in the week, two Cabinet ministers from her
party resigned from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Jayalalitha, a former leading lady in Tamil films, has had a
stormy relationship with Bharatiya Janata, repeatedly threatening
to walk off the set. Her latest complaint has been about Defense
Minister George Fernandes, who she says is corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting fieriness with fieriness, a Bharatiya Janata spokesman,
K.L. Sharma, said the government had no need of Jayalalitha's
advice on military matters.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he accused her of turning against the Hindu nationalists
because she wants state corruption cases against her to be
withdrawn and demands that the government dismiss Tamil Nadu's
elected chief minister, her political rival.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Jayalalitha's motives, she has the nation wondering
what she will do next, though in this regard she is only the
second-most watched woman in India: Complicating all this frantic
politicking is the inscrutability of Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born
heir to the Nehru-Gandhi political dynasty and a woman who has
rejuvenated the Congress Party in her year as its president. She
has given little hint of whether she wants her party to reclaim
power in what would surely be a troublesome coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not jump into anything in haste,'' Mrs. Gandhi said
this week.
</P>
<P>
   If the government loses a no-confidence vote, Mrs. Gandhi could
seek the prime minister's post for herself, or defer to a Congress
colleague, or support a third-force coalition, or call for early
elections or allow the BJP to continue as a minority government.
</P>
<P>
   She has yet to give an indication of her preference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Gandhi has not made up her mind,'' said Mani Shankar
Aiyar, a Congress Party stalwart.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the government coalition ``puts Humpty Dumpty back
together again'' and survives this latest crisis, Aiyar said, it
will probably fall within weeks or months.

CHRB SUSPENDS TRAINER WEST

<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ The California Horse Racing Board suspended
trainer Ted West 90 days Friday and fined him $12,000 as part of a
settlement reached in a a case that involved eight West horses
which tested positive for the banned substance clenbuterol.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension begins April 20 and runs through virtually the
entire Hollywood Park meet. Accusations were filed against West and
six other thoroughbred trainers last September after clenbuterol
was detected in urine samples from several horses.
</P>
<P>
   West said he agreed to the settlement because he had no other
choice. Clenbuterol is legal for horses in training, but cannot
show up in post race tests.
</P>
<P>
   West admits using the drug, but said he stopped administering it
to horses three days before a race. Post race testing can detect
the drug 14 days after its last use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fighting a battle we couldn't win,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   Three other trainers in the case have also reached settlements
with the CHRB. Three more, Paco Gonzales, Darrell Vienna and Bruce
Headley are scheduled for formal hearings in May and June.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally the Santa Anita Board of Stewards ruled that purses
given to West-trained horses in the clenbuterol case must be
redistributed.
</P>
<P>
   Those horses include: Slew O War, third on May 22, 1998 at
Hollywood Park; Slews Royal Son, second on May 25 at Hollywood
Park, Budroyale first on June 13 at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any good that comes out of this thing I would hope
that they'll find a way for us to use clenbuterol effectively,''
West said. ``Because it is an effective for medication for horses
with breathing troubles.''

NHL SUSPENDS BLAKE FOR TWO GAMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rob Blake is the Los Angeles Kings' captain and
last year's winner of the Norris Trophy as the NHL's best
defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, he received a new title: repeat offender.
</P>
<P>
   Blake was suspended two games by the NHL for cross-checking San
Jose's Alexander Korolyuk late in the Kings' 3-2 victory Thursday
night over the Sharks. He will not play Sunday in Dallas or Monday
in Nashville. Jan Nemecek or Jaroslav Modry will be recalled from
the Long Beach Ice Dogs to take Blake's place.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, barely breathing in their pursuit of a playoff berth,
are 3-15 this season in games Blake has missed.
</P>
<P>
   Blake was suspended three games in December for slashing
Vancouver's Harry York. The incident cost him an automatic $1,000
fine and three days' salary (of the 192-day NHL schedule), which
came out to $82,304.69.
</P>
<P>
   This time, under NHL rules, Blake is considered a repeat
offender, meaning he will be docked pay for two games, a
$128,475.60 hit on his $5.2675-million salary. All told, Blake has
lost $211,780.29 this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing I can do about it,'' said Blake, adding he was
surprised that his discipline ultimately exceeded the two-minute
minor penalty he received from referee Mark Faucette on Thursday.
``I've been through it before. You sit your games, then you come
back and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake and Korolyuk had battled the entire game, but Blake's
cross check caught Korolyuk on his head. The incident came to the
attention of NHL discipline czar Colin Campbell after the Sharks
requested he review videotape of the play.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro not quitting: Earlier in the year, Kings center Ray
Ferraro said this season, his 15th in the NHL, might be his last.
Friday, the 34-year-old Ferraro - who has 10 goals and 27 points in
60 games - said he wants to keep playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say I'm 99 percent sure I would like to play, and I
would like to play here,'' said Ferraro, in the final year of a
contract that paid him $1.75 million this season. ``I certainly
haven't talked to anybody. I don't know if there would be any
interest or not. I know I can still play. I wasn't sure of it
earlier in the season. Now, I'm convinced I can.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have deferred personnel decisions until after the
season.

BURIED RIFLE FOUND NEAR HOME OF SLAIN ABORTION-CLINIC DOCTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Canada)  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly six months after a Buffalo, N.Y.-area doctor who
performed abortions was shot to death at his home by a sniper,
law-enforcement authorities reported Friday that they had recently
discovered a rifle buried in the ground in woods behind the
doctor's house.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the rifle appeared to be one of the biggest
breaks in a case that has thus far produced no arrests. Although
the authorities have been seeking to question an itinerant abortion
protester named James Charles Kopp, he has not been found, and some
officials in the Justice Department fear Kopp may be hiding in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement that a rifle had been found raised questions
among friends and relatives of the slain obstetrician, Dr. Barnett
Slepian, about how thoroughly local police officers and FBI agents
searched the wooded area near Slepian's home in Amherst where the
gunman fired the fatal shot on Oct 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are wondering and are surprised it wasn't
found previously,'' said Glenn Edward Murray, who had been
Slepian's lawyer and is still the lawyer for the Slepian family.
</P>
<P>
   A terse news release jointly issued Friday by the Buffalo office
of the FBI, New York State Police and police in Amherst said the
rifle had been found one foot underground in a 4-acre, heavily
wooded area in the vicinity of the Slepian house and taken to the
FBI laboratory in Washington. The news release did not characterize
the rifle as the weapon used in the slaying, nor did it further
describe the rifle, pinpoint its proximity to the house, nor say
how and when it had been found. The news release implied, however,
that the rifle had been found recently.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law-enforcement officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the rifle had not yet been checked for fingerprints
or chemically tested, but that it roughly matched the kind of gun
that used bullets of the caliber found in Slepian's house. The
officials also said the rifle was discovered ``very close'' to the
site where other evidence _ including a cap and a hair _ were found
after the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   The police news release suggested that the weather had prevented
officers from conducting a search. ``Due to weather and ground
conditions previously in existence at the site, this search,
although planned early in the investigation, was not conducted
until this time,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   But Murray, who said he was told that the rifle was found
Thursday afternoon, recalled that the weather had been mild enough
to permit shoveling for weeks after the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   ``There weren't any severe conditions until January,'' he said.
He added that he was mystified that the rifle had not been found
earlier, because he felt that the police investigation had
otherwise been ``massive, intense, and dedicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Some federal law-enforcement officials in Washington speculated
that investigators in Buffalo never imagined that a sniper would
have taken the time to bury a rifle before fleeing the scene of a
killing.
</P>
<P>
   The rifle's discovery comes 10 days before the scheduled start
of anti-abortion protests at Slepian's former clinic in Buffalo, as
well as at other sites in Rochester and Batavia, which are being
organized by Operation Rescue, which staged sometimes unruly
rallies outside Slepian's clinic in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian, who was the mainstay of the downtown Buffalo clinic,
was slain while he was standing in the kitchen talking to his wife
and children. The sniper had fired from woods behind the large
brick house. Witnesses in the upper-middle-class neighborhood told
police that in the days before the killing they spotted Kopp
jogging near the Slepian house.
</P>
<P>
   Kopp is also being sought for questioning in the shootings in
1994, 1995 and 1997 of three doctors who performed abortions in
Canada, and in the shooting of a fourth doctor in Rochester, N.Y.,
in 1997. None of the four earlier shootings were fatal.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Kopp's black 1987 Chevrolet Cavalier was found in
the long-term parking lot at Newark, N.J., International Airport,
its key still in the ignition. In mid-January, an unidentified
Justice Department official told The Associated Press that there
was evidence Kopp had fled to Mexico. A Customs Service videotape
from a border-crossing point, the official said, showed a female
friend of Kopp's returning from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   There also have been reports that the DNA on a hair recovered
from a cap found behind Slepian's house matched that of hair taken
from Kopp's last known address, an apartment in Jersey City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   WKBW-TV in Buffalo also reported on its Web site Friday that a
bag of bullets had been found two months ago buried near Slepian's
home, and that it also contained a strand of hair.

WHERE VICTIMS TURN INTO AGGRESSORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Rebecca West was working on ``Black Lamb and Grey Falcon,''
the Serbs were the good guys. World War II began as she was writing
what she called ``A Journey Through Yugoslavia,'' which she
dedicated ``To my friends in Yugoslavia who are now all dead or
enslaved,'' and she argued that Germany was carrying on a tradition
of ``self-infatuation and a quiver of hatreds for all but the
chosen Teutonic people, the most poisonous being dedicated to the
Slav.''
</P>
<P>
   Her sympathies in this travel chronicle, political history and
examination of the psychology of nations were with a people who had
served for centuries as an object of the schemes of Turkey,
Austria, Hungary, Russia and even her own Britain. Among Serbia's
leaders, with an occasional lapse into common sense, she found
venality and betrayal, ferocity and gangsterism, incompetence and
insanity.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the chaos, however, she also found poetry, rooted in the
legends of saints and warriors of Serbia's Byzantine beginnings.
West found it significant and moving that the nation's most revered
memory should be not of victory but of Czar Lazar, the ruler who
had been defeated by the Turks at the famous battle of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   She explained to her husband, Henry Maxwell Andrews, who
accompanied her on the journey, ``That is all the remote past they
have, and they came straight out of that glory into the misery of
Turkish conquest.'' Persecuted on all sides, as she saw it, ``The
Serbians became moody, hallucinated, creative.'' Their fantasies,
she wrote, were tinged with ``a certain brooding, cryptic
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of her book's long chapter on Serbia is taken up with the
miseries inflicted by the big powers in the 19th century and
enhanced by the suicidal tendencies of the Serbs themselves. But
then came the Balkan Wars of 1912, in which West found a romance
that called forth her considerable powers of evocative description:
``The Serbians rode southwards radiant as lovers.'' It was a vision
that some criticized as more poetry than history, but many readers,
particularly in 1941 when the book was published in America, must
have been stirred by it.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote of ``these dedicated troops, wrapped in their rich and
tragic dream ... determined to offer themselves to the horrors of
war in a barren land where the climate is bearable for only four
months in the year, where there were dust storms and malaria and
men who had been turned by art to something more savage than
savagery.''
</P>
<P>
   She looked into their minds and saw there ``the splendid image
of Slav empire, potent in spite of time and defeat, like the Czar
Lazar in his coffin.'' And she reported that ``the poem had
completed itself'' when by the end of 1912, an alliance of Serbs,
Bulgarians and Greeks defeated the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   A great victory, which in accord with Serbian fate, was followed
by a shattering defeat, this time by Austria. Now the Serbs
retreated in scenes that cannot have been much different from
today's television images, except for a change in roles: ``So the
Serbian army had this time to retreat over a devastated countryside
which could give it no food and offered it much discouragement, not
diminished by the floods of civilian refugees, some Serbian, some
from the Slav parts of the Austro-Hungarian empire, all hungry and
footsore and with tales to tell of the enemy's malign brutality.''
</P>
<P>
   The battered army made its last stand on the field of Kosovo,
where they were introduced to enemy airplanes, ``evil's newest
instrument.'' On the ground, West wrote, ``many of the soldiers and
civilian refugees turned and fled back toward Serbia and were
butchered by the Muslim Albanians.'' Of a quarter of a million
Serbian soldiers, 100,000 died, she reported.
</P>
<P>
   And yet at the war's end, the Serbian armies were there,
spearheading the forces that brought the Austro-Hungarian empire to
its end. West again found poetry in the achievement, but again
victory failed to create a Serbian nation, as the Allied powers,
the new conquerors, worked their will in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   West went from Serbia to Macedonia, where she noted that after
the war, Europe's diplomats arranged that the former Turkish
administrative districts would be changed to correspond to
districts made up by ethnic group. West called it an imbecilic act
that terrified the Serbs, Greeks and Bulgars, ``who knew that there
are hardly any districts which are ethnographically pure in that
part of the world, and saw themselves handed over to whatever race
was in the majority, by however small a figure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Each group therefore attacked both the others,'' she wrote,
``and killed off as many of them as possible, with the object of
reducing them to unquestionable minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   A bloody civil war ensued, which lasted for three years. West,
that affectionate yet keen observer, discerned no poetry in this
conflict and would have had no difficulty in recognizing the spirit
behind it in the pictures of the latest refugees being hounded by
the latest purifiers.

 &HT;    Pitcher is still in picture
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The disappointment may be even bigger this time around
for Mark Wohlers, who showed major signs of progress in spring
training from his 1998 control meltdown, but then lost it with the
opening of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers, who walked six in two-thirds of an inning, was
designated for assignment Friday to Class AAA Richmond. The Braves
brought up right-hander Joe Winkelsas, a nonroster invitee to the
major league camp in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers has until Monday to refuse the assignment. Wohlers told
manager Bobby Cox Friday he planned to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sounded to me like he is dying to go down and get started
and throw to bases and do everything,'' Cox said. ``He doesn't want
any special attention. (Whenever) they need him to pitch, he
pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   With $5.2 million invested in Wohlers this season, the Braves
are going to extend every effort to get him back in form.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not be engaging in this whole process if we didn't
believe (he could come back),'' general manager John Schuerholz
said. ``He showed us in spring training there's enough there to
believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers has the option of rejecting the offer, in which case the
Braves would release him and he would still receive his salary.
</P>
<P>
   This is the final year of a three-year contract, with an option
for 2000 included. But unless Wohlers appears in 55 games this
season _ in which case the option would automatically kick in _ the
Braves can buy out the final year for $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   Given the bottom line of Wohlers' contract and the steps back
he's taken with his control problems, trading Wohlers would be
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark's attitude is still great and we've seen him pitch
good,'' Cox said. ``It's there. It just went away for a little
while for whatever reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox spoke to Wohlers about 2 p.m. Friday and left Turner Field
not long after. Wohlers was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers had poor outings to start and finish the spring but
otherwise pitched well. He had a 6.52 ERA in 10 appearances.
Without Wohlers
</P>
<P>
   The Braves bullpen is looking thin and young at the moment with
John Rocker, Rudy Seanez, Mike Cather, Kevin McGlinchy, Derrin
Ebert (replaced Mike Remlinger, on the 15-day disabled list with a
back muscle pull) and Winkelsas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our bullpen's going to be OK,'' Schuerholz said. ``I
feel fine with what we have here and what we have in our system.''
</P>
<P>
   The move to bring in Winkelsas (8.38 ERA in seven spring
appearances) is likely temporary. The Braves would have preferred
bringing up a member of the 40-man roster but under baseball rules
cannot return a player to the major leagues after he's been
designated for a minor league assignment in fewer than 10 days. The
season is only six days old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winks is OK,'' Cox said. ``He's got a great sinker. We'll
see.'' Ligtenberg back
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Ligtenberg was back in the Braves clubhouse Friday, three
days after having surgery to repair the ligament in his elbow. His
right arm was in a soft cast inside of a sling. He'll be in Atlanta
for several weeks while doctors monitor his progress before he
returns to Minnesota until midsummer. This and that
</P>
<P>
   Russ Springer threw on the side again Friday and should be ready
for his rehabilitation assignment. ``I think he's real close,''
Mazzone said. . . . Andruw Jones said he got a glove on Rico
Brogna's home run Thursday night. Jones very nearly made an
acrobatic catch.

 &HT;    Wallace sets qualifying mark to take pole
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Tenn. _ Most drivers detest Bristol Motor Speedway,
where accidents on the half-mile oval seem as common as victories
by Jeff Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   But for veteran NASCAR driver Rusty Wallace, the 38-year-old
facility always seems to offer an opportunity for recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell everybody that Bristol has always been my favorite
track,'' Wallace says. ``I like the shape of the track, and I
always seem to get around it well. It seems every time I come to
this place, if I'm behind or in trouble in the points or something,
I always feel like I can make something up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace has plenty to make up after six races. He is 11th in
standings points, 203 behind Winston Cup leader Jeff Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, 43, helped himself tremendously Friday by winning the
pole for Sunday's Food City 500. His No. 2 Ford covered the track
at an average speed of 125.142 mph, breaking Bristol's qualifying
record of 125.093 mph set by Mark Martin in August 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've gotta (turn it around) right now,'' Wallace said. ``We
couldn't afford what happened at Atlanta and Darlington,'' where he
finished 35th and 33rd, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that saved me is that both Martin and Gordon
have had two DNFs,'' he said, ``and that's helped me a ton. I'm
11th, four points out of 10th, and they're not too far away.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace won his sixth pole in 31 races at Bristol, including his
fourth in the last five events here. He was nearly two-hundredths
of a second faster than Gordon, who will start second with an
average speed of 124.979 mph. Gordon is going for his fifth
consecutive victory in the spring race at Bristol.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, fourth in points and 119 behind Burton, complained of
sore ribs after his qualifying attempt. He was 43rd at Texas on
March 28 _ the worst finish of his Cup career _ after hitting the
outside wall hard in lap 69 of the 334-lap event
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a little bit of pain,'' Gordon said. ``I was sore on
that lap. I was getting everything I could out of the car. At the
speed we're qualifying, I'm a little sore in my ribs. I still feel
like I'll be able to go the distance on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte, who broke his right shoulder blade just three
weeks ago in a wreck at Darlington, qualified third at 124.484 mph.
Rookie Tony Stewart was fourth, and veteran Ricky Rudd qualified
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it will be a little bit tough, but we had that
weekend off, and that helped,'' Labonte said. ``It's probably going
to be sore. The bone has healed up, and everything is strong. But
once we hustle around, it will get a little tender.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise on Friday was Darrell Waltrip, who had not
qualified for a race on speed this season until the Primestar 500
at Texas. Waltrip had an average speed of 123.857 mph and finished
12th.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not dead last,'' Waltrip said. ``That's really exciting.
I knew all along that if we could get some testing done we'd be OK.
I've got a great team. We've just gotta get some luck going.

 &HT;    Walker enshrined in first year of eligibility
 &HT;    By Chip Towers

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Less than a year after his retirement from
football, Herschel Walker was tabbed Friday for one of the game's
most prestigious honors.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, the former Heisman Trophy winner at Georgia, was elected
to the National Football Foundation's College Hall of Fame. The
announcement was made during ceremonies Friday afternoon in South
Bend, Ind. It was Walker's first year of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did Herschel make it in the first year, he breezed
in,'' said Georgia athletics director Vince Dooley, who is a member
of the Hall of Fame's Honors Court, which makes the final selection
of nominees. ``There wasn't much discussion, which is an indication
of the high esteem in which Herschel is held. He was the most
productive player I've ever been associated with. You can talk
about a lot of things, but the bottom line is production.''
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Johnson County High in Wrightsville, Walker won
the 1982 Heisman Trophy after finishing second in 1981 and third as
a freshman in 1980. He led Georgia to a 33-3 record in his three
seasons in Athens, including three SEC championships and a national
championship in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was a three-time All-American, broke Tony Dorsett's
freshman rushing record with 1,616 yards and finished with 5,259
yards before turning pro after his junior season.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of three Georgia residents inducted on Friday. Former
Notre Dame defensive end Ross Browner of Atlanta and former
Tennessee linebacker Steve Kiner of Carrollton also were voted in.
</P>
<P>
   Other players elected included: Chuck Dicus (Arkansas WR), John
Hannah (Alabama, OL), Billy Kilmer (UCLA, RB), Frank Loria
(Virginia Tech, DB), Joe Palumbo (Virginia, DL) and Greg Pruitt
(Oklahoma, RB). Coaches inducted were Jerry Claiborne, Don Coryell
and Jim Young.

 &HT;    Speed puts Gators' trio at top of list
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the program produced such defenders as Jack Ham,
Greg Buttle, Shane Conlan and Lance Mehl, NFL scouts tabbed Penn
State as ``Linebacker U.'' In this year's draft, however, that
title might be passed to the University of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In Jevon Kearse, Mike Peterson and Johnny Rutledge, the Gators
might provide three of the top eight linebacker selections next
weekend. Kearse is a certain top-10 choice and the other two figure
to be off the board by the end of the second round. The run on
Gators linebackers is an interesting twist at a school more
renowned for turning out offensive skill-position players.
</P>
<P>
   It is not by accident, though, that Florida suddenly has so many
standout linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure defense designed by former coordinator Bob Stoops,
now the head coach at Oklahoma, demanded versatile, athletic
linebackers, and the staff went to great lengths to fill that
profile, even if it meant converting players from other positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like Coach Stoops wanted (hybrid) players,'' Kearse
said. ``The priority was on getting people who could run and hit.
So the coaches were taking guys from all over the place and making
them linebackers.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the three Gators prospects arrived at Gainesville as
linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   Rutledge was an All-America defensive end in high school.
Peterson was recruited as a quarterback and defensive back. Kearse
began his college career as a strong safety and nickel back. It
didn't take long for Stoops to see that all three had the kind of
pursuit mentality required to play linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   In a defense predicated on the overall quickness of the unit,
all three became impact playmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't run, you can't play in that defense,'' Baltimore
personnel director Ozzie Newsome said. ``And all those guys can
run.''
</P>
<P>
   While his size limits him to playing the weak side in the NFL,
Peterson may be the best pure linebacker of the three and has been
compared to Tampa Bay standout Derrick Brooks. Rutledge will
benefit from his toughness and his ability to play inside or
outside. But the player teams covet is Kearse, nicknamed ``The
Freak'' for his combination of size (6 feet 4 7/8, 262 pounds) and
speed (sub-4.5 seconds in the 40-yard dash).
</P>
<P>
   At the combine, Kearse indicated a preference for playing
defensive end. But while the video of his on-campus workout shows
some deficiencies in his pass-drop, most teams plan to play him at
linebacker on early downs and move him to end on third down. His
large wingspan and explosiveness could make him a double-digit
sacker, if his productivity ever matches his potential.

 &HT;    Altered grip on putter leads to 66 for Langer
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Two-time Masters winner Bernhard Langer beat his
lowest round at Augusta National by two shots with a 66 Friday.
That was a whopping 10 strokes better than his first round, all
because he moved his right hand down the shaft of his putter _ the
one long enough to rest under his chin when he uses it.
</P>
<P>
   His newfound touch converted three 20-footers, one of them for
par. He canned one from 45 feet on No. 9 that Langer imagined
``moved the hole 3 feet further away.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't make a lot of bombs in 1985 and 1993, though. He had
one one-putt in 1985 and in '93 drained just about everything
within six feet. That was before he traded in the short stick _ and
before the changes to the course that, in Langer's opinion, made it
a couple of shots harder.
</P>
<P>
   Woods 8 back, but unruffled
</P>
<P>
   Two 72s seem a little tame for Tiger Woods, but he's not
counting himself out of the hunt, even eight shots back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm rolling the rock pretty well and it's a matter of giving
myself chances,'' the 1997 winner said. ``If I can get a couple of
good runs going I can do well.''
</P>
<P>
   One swing he'd like to take back came on the 12th hole Friday,
when an 8-iron he tried to punch got caught up in a gust and landed
in the middle of Rae's Creek, not even close to getting to the
other side. An uninviting par 5
</P>
<P>
   At most PGA venues, the list of easiest holes usually starts
with the par 5's, and Augusta's are especially vulnerable to long
hitters. This week, though, the 15th hole has turned into a beast.
Just ask David Duval, who made 8 there.
</P>
<P>
   There were 20 double bogeys or worse so far. The hole is only
500 yards, but a new stand of trees narrowed the landing area, and
a very hard green makes going for it in two a huge gamble. Even
lobbed wedge shots, like Jeff Sluman hit en route to an 8, spin
back into the pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the people around that green and I think, man, these
people, they must like to see us really battle here,'' said Nick
Price, who made 6 there.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar regroups
</P>
<P>
   At 6-over heading into the back nine, ailing Georgia Tech junior
Matt Kuchar looked like someone about to watch the final two rounds
on TV. But he holed out twice on the back nine _ from the sand for
eagle on 13 and the fringe on 14 for birdie _ to rally for a 71. He
made the cut, along with fellow amateurs Sergio Garcia (72-75),
Trevor Immelman (72-76) and Tom McKnight (73-74). They tie the
largest group of amateurs to make the cut since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Like father, not like son
</P>
<P>
   Sea Island native Davis Love III's opening 69 duplicated his
father's score to share the 1964 Masters lead. But history doesn't
look like it will repeat itself. Davis Love Jr. went on to shoot
75-74-76 and tie for 34th; son shot 72 Friday and is tied for
fifth.... Here's how the other Georgia players did: Stewart Cink of
Smyrna (74-70) is eight back, followed by Larry Mize of Columbus
(76-70) and Billy Andrade of Atlanta (76-72). Tommy Aaron of
Gainesville (77-82) missed the cut.
</P>
<P>
   Who's hot
</P>
<P>
   Bill Glasson fired a 32 on the back nine for 70 and is tied for
seventh. So is Colin Montgomerie (70-72), who on the par-4 third
hole cut a 90-yard sand wedge that found the hole for his first
eagle in eight trips here. ... Jay Haas made four straight birdies
in his 69, with 16-year-old son Bill on his bag. ... Phil Mickelson
birdied three of his last six for a 69.
</P>
<P>
   Who's not
</P>
<P>
   Defending champ Mark O'Meara misread the speed of the greens all
day in slumping to a 76. ... First-round co-leader Brandel Chamblee
didn't birdie until No. 9 and had a 73. ... PGA champion Vijay
Singh, at 72-76, called his putting ``very awful.'' ... Some
notables hitting the road: Tom Watson (74-77), Mark Calcavecchia
(75-77), Paul Azinger (74-78), Nick Faldo (80-73) and U.S. Amateur
champ Hank Kuehne (74-78). ... Andrew Magee, one shot off the lead
after Thursday, followed with a 77, as did Sandy Lyle. First round
(continued)
</P>
<P>
   After darkness suspended the rain-delayed first round, 12
players got to finish Friday morning. The good: Brandt Jobe, who
started 1-over on the 17th hole, finished par-birdie for a 72 and
then birdied the first three holes of his second round en route to
a 71. Jim Furyk played his last four holes 1-under for 72.
</P>
<P>
   The bad: Paul Azinger was even after 14, but finished with two
bogeys for a 74. Cink was 1-under but bogeyed 16 and shot 72, a
score that stood for a few hours until a ruling was made that added
two shots to that score. Mark Brooks bogeyed three of the last four
for 76.

 &HT;    Norman won't let weight of botched Sundays bog him down
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Close your eyes tighter than you've ever closed
them before. Put your hands over your ears. Now go to a closet and
don't come out until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why: Greg Norman's back on the leaderboard at the
Masters.
</P>
<P>
   You don't want to see or hear what comes next because it's
generally the saddest story of the sports year.
</P>
<P>
   Norman, fate's favorite whipping boy, has come back for more.
It's as if he escaped Devil's Island, got a whiff of the good life,
then swam back.
</P>
<P>
   The man has eight top-6 finishes at Augusta National Golf Club
(three seconds; two thirds; a fourth, a fifth and a sixth), but no
firsts. He knows only heartbreak and agony. He knows only
concession speeches.
</P>
<P>
   The worst was the most recent _ 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He was 41, had stacked up failures here higher than the oak tree
in back of the clubhouse, and was thus the sentimental favorite as
he strode into Sunday's round with a six-shot lead.
</P>
<P>
   Even he couldn't blow that one.
</P>
<P>
   The optimists thought.
</P>
<P>
   Wrongly.
</P>
<P>
   That day, Norman hit more crooked shots than in the 10-and-under
flight of the local city juniors tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the horror.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, after Nick Faldo had clicked off a 67 and Norman had
gunked a 78 and Faldo had won by five, Faldo did the unthinkable _
for him: He hugged Norman on the 18th green. To appreciate that,
Faldo is so cold that on his wedding day, when the minister told
him he could kiss the bride, he shook hands with her instead.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe not. But he did hug Norman and say, ``I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Norman came to the interview room and gave a State of the
Shark address, shrugging and saying things happen for the best. He
then went fishing and every day another 1,000 or so letters of
condolence piled up at his house.
</P>
<P>
   Go to your favorite local card shop because, Moody Blues fans,
we might be revisiting days of future past. Norman is tied for
third, three shots behind Jose Maria Olazabal, going into today's
round, so there's still a chance Olazabal might run away and spare
Norman another Sunday, Bloody Sunday. For those of us who don't
want to write another Norman obituary, we can only say, ``Go, Jose,
go.''
</P>
<P>
   On the outside, at least, Norman showed no fear of returning to
the fire. ``It feels great to be in this position,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, absolutely. It feels great to be hurtling down a mountain at
90 mph in a car whose steering wheel has just come off in your
hands.
</P>
<P>
   He said he got religion _ at least golf religion _ during and
after that 1996 five-star collapse. ``That's done,'' he said. ``One
thing I realize is golf is not everything. Yes, I want to win the
Masters. But it's not a priority. There are other priorities that I
enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's 43. Isn't time running out?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the point,'' he said. ``I don't have a sense of urgency
anymore. I feel like I'm more in balance.''
</P>
<P>
   How much difficulty would he have controlling that old sense of
urgency if Sunday dawns and there he is again, in the fray, the
weight of all those other Sundays dragging behind him? ``It won't
affect me at all,'' he said. ``It's like riding a bike. If you get
the chance to win, you're going after it.''
</P>
<P>
   He has ridden the bike here eight times and has fallen off eight
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody asked me if this place owes me one,'' Norman said.
``I don't believe in that. I believe you go out and play well and
get them yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   As he said this, I'm pretty sure I saw him holding the steering
wheel out the window.

 &HT;    Swing doctors: Mending an ailing game
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ They stand on the driving range or putting green,
arms crossed, dark sunglasses on, legs lock-kneed at shoulder's
width, like security guards in Panama hats. With earplugs, they
would pass for golf's version of the Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   They know something you don't: what makes the world's best
players tick. They are the golf instructors, grooming their most
famous students at the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Most easily slip into the crowds to spy on how well their
proteges are applying their teachings. Others are recognizable,
including Greg Norman's guru David Leadbetter, now starring in his
own shoe commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the top players summon their instructors here to
fine-tune swings and putting strokes, coach on-course strategy and,
not the least, stroke egos humbled by Augusta National.
</P>
<P>
   On the range, the teachers stand next to the caddies,
occasionally pointing and nodding as their students strike balls
that follow repetitious parabolas. Even though the golf swing takes
only a few seconds, the teacher's eye seizes on the tiniest lapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just more of a reaffirming in your mind that your swing
is in the right groove,'' Norman said after shooting 68 Friday,
``and if it's not in the right groove, it's very easy to sometimes
change it when he's there, because you pick up two or three things
that you're not doing right.''
</P>
<P>
   You know Ernie Els has got to feel good when probably the most
important person in his life this week, Robert Baker, proclaims:
``His whole game is perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, though, the pros share something with the common
golfer, in that they tend to do the same things wrong. Even Els.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ernie's very, very flexible, so we want to make his swing
short,'' said Baker, a fellow South African now based in Orlando,
Fla. He paid house calls to 35 tournaments last year to help
students, who this week include Tim Herron and amateur Trevor
Immelman.
</P>
<P>
   Butch Harmon is helping Tiger Woods slow his swing down, ``so
it's not out of control. We're working on the pace of his golf
swing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most relaxed I've ever seen Tiger at a major,''
Harmon said. ``He feels great about his game.''
</P>
<P>
   It is family reunion week for Harmon. He has three brothers in
the field: Craig teaches Jeff Sluman, Billy teaches Jay Haas, and
Dick teaches Steve Elkington and Craig Stadler.
</P>
<P>
   Their father, Claude, won the 1948 Masters, and 55-year-old
Butch, the oldest son, remembers his mother putting him on a leash
so he wouldn't run all over the course.
</P>
<P>
   Butch Harmon has observed the Masters' pressure from many
angles, but that doesn't make him more nervous about giving
counsel. ``It's a matter of reinforcing things and giving
support,'' he said, ``to keep their confidence and energy level
high.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Harmon's other student, Mark Calcavecchia, has been
struggling with his putting. And his swing? ``Mark's had a little
problem with his short irons lately,'' Harmon said. ``We're working
on the mechanics of his takeaway and his position at the top. ''
</P>
<P>
   Got that? A listener unfamiliar with the game easily could get
lost in the golf-speak. The instructors are like physicians who
can't help but talk in medical terms; there's a special language to
dissect the anatomy of the swing. Baker even said he's on call ``in
case there's a hiccup in the short game or a couple of bad shots.''
</P>
<P>
   And none of these docs is performing major surgery this week.
``We did most of the work two weeks ago,'' Harmon said. ``If you're
having to do that here, you're in trouble.''

 &HT;    Olazabal steps into lead
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ He once went to a doctor who treated his back and
healed his foot troubles, so it's only fitting that Jose Maria
Olazabal _ who had recent difficulties hitting fairways _ would
come to the Masters at an extended Augusta National and discover
his long game.
</P>
<P>
   This paragon and paradox used his daring and aggression on a
course that's playing more difficult than ever to ascend to the top
of a leaderboard splattered with champions. He shot a 6-under 66
Friday for a two-day total of 136, leaving him one stroke ahead of
Scott McCarron and at least two shots in front of a star-studded
group.
</P>
<P>
   And this from a guy who on Tuesday described his swing as
``so-so.'' It would seem weird if it were anyone but Olazabal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow I managed to go through two good rounds in a row,''
Olazabal said. ``When I said `so-so,' I was not ready but not too
bad. But when you score well, it makes it look better.''
</P>
<P>
   When Olazabal's feet got better, he said he saw no reason not to
return to the prominence that wrought him a green jacket in 1994.
But there was a time that he even wondered if he'd play again. In
'95, a mysterious ailment caused his feet to hurt so much that he
couldn't even walk _ and missed 18 months of playing.
</P>
<P>
   He watched the '96 Masters on television in his home in Spain
and spent much of his time with his feet propped up listening to
music and reading. He went to several doctors, none of whom could
alleviate the pain. ``I reached a time when I thought about the
possibilities of not playing again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a physician in Germany applied therapy on his back and the
pain in his feet diminished. ``My feet are not causing me any
problem right now,'' he said. ``I try not to think too much about
what happened in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   However (here comes another contradiction), he admitted that his
past performances at Augusta National have aided his handling of
the course to this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps everybody who's played here enough,'' he said. ``I
won in '94 and it makes me feel better than someone who hasn't won
before.''
</P>
<P>
   He played better than everyone Friday, perhaps because he
attacked the course instead of being tentative.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Augusta National) gives me a chance to use my imagination a
little more, especially around the greens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the par-5 15th, where most everyone laid up in front of the
water, Olazabal screamed his second shot onto and behind the green
with a 1-iron, pitched to within inches and tapped in for a birdie
to go 7 under.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he was so aggressive on a hole he called ``scary,'' he
said, jokingly: ``Because I got a 6 there (Thursday).''
</P>
<P>
   There were no 6s on Friday, no bogeys at all. And hitting 11 of
14 fairways after a period of uneasy driving speaks for how
accurate he suddenly has become off the tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't complain about my driving,'' he said. ``Today was
good, yesterday not great. At least I got them on the fairways.''

<P>
   That was not all he did. His birdies _ on Nos. 2, 6, 11, 13, 15
and 18 _ were the product of firing at the pins, deft shot-making
and quality putting. He got a break on 13 Thursday when a
line-drive 4-iron bounced over the creek and onto the green,
setting up an eagle.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes breaks are necessary, and many times, saving par is
just as critical and making birdies. And Olazabal seemed just as
proud of doing so on holes 5 and 7 Friday.

   ``I feel great, but it's a wide-open tournament,'' he said.

CHINA TO ALLOW U.N. RIGHTS INVESTIGATION

<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA, Switzerland _ A U.N. investigator said Friday that China
had agreed to allow him to examine allegations of torture in China.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator, Nigel Rodley, said China had invited him to
visit and that he planned a tour early next year. Rodley, a British
law professor, began asking China four years ago to allow a visit.
</P>
<P>
   In his annual report to the U.N. Human Rights Commission, Rodley
said dozens of people had reportedly been tortured in China.
</P>
<P>
   He cited Tibetan religious figures, including two nuns who he
said had been ``subjected to harsh interrogation and ill
treatment,'' including beatings and solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   Rodley said he would ask China to allow him to visit Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch, the advocacy and monitoring organization,
suggested that China's agreement to allow the trip was ``part of a
careful game of modulated concessions'' intended to avert censure
at the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Because of China's recent crackdown on pro-democracy advocates,
the United States plans to sponsor a resolution by the commission
criticizing China's human rights policies.

   A Cypriot envoy said he had failed to win the release of three
captured American soldiers in talks with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and blamed continued NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   DIPLOMACY
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin warned NATO not to drag Russia into the
Kosovo conflict, saying it could spark a far wider war.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov would meet in Oslo next
week to discuss the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called on Yugoslavia to stop
all action by military and paramilitary forces in Kosovo and
withdraw them from the province. The call was part of a five-point
program of commitments to be presented to Belgrade to bring an end
to the crisis.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   COMBAT
</P>
<P>
   NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia continued for a 17th day. Alliance
supreme commander Gen. Wesley Clark said the bombing would continue
``regardless of the diplomatic atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting and gunfire were reported on the Albania-Kosovo border.
The Yugoslav army accused Albania of mounting an artillery attack
against its border guards during an attempt ``by a large group of
armed terrorists'' to cross into Kosovo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   REFUGEES
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. high commissioner for refugees said more than 620,000
people have left Kosovo since conflict broke out in the province in
March 1998. The number of refugees who fled the province after NATO
airstrikes began March 24 to Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro
exceeded 487,000.
</P>
<P>
   A headquarters for the 8,000-strong force that NATO plans to
deploy in Albania to help cope with the refugee influx will be
established by April 16, a NATO spokesman Jamie P. Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS
</P>

YANKS KEEP FOCUS AND FIRE IN RAINY HOME OPENER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Ohio, Conn.)   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Footprints became man-made ponds in the Yankee
Stadium infield Friday, and there were likely to be more
groundskeepers than players on the field at any given moment. The
Yankees' home opener was all about mud stains, rakes and drying
compound.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees played as if it were a comfortable 78 degrees,
said the Detroit catcher Brad Ausmus, the pinstriped hitters
ignoring human instinct and patiently waiting in the relentless,
cold rain for a good pitch. With the same deliberate approach they
used so impressively in winning a record total of 125 games in
1998, the defending World Series champion Yankees dismantled the
Tigers, 12-3, before the umpires mercifully waved for the tarp and
ended the game with two out in the bottom of the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the Yankees' trauma and dysfunction in spring
training, they are already playing .750 ball with three victories
and one loss.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone did not allow a hit until the sixth inning Friday,
taking advantage of the aggressiveness of Detroit's hitters, and
Chili Davis had four hits, including a grand slam. Yogi Berra, who
threw out the ceremonial first pitch, was about the only person who
appeared on the field without getting drenched.
</P>
<P>
   Cone changed his undershirt six times, fielders stood with their
hands tucked inside their jerseys like so many Napoleons and gloves
and spikes and caps were soaked. All 56,583 tickets were sold, but
most fans whose seats were in unprotected areas scurried for cover,
departed or never arrived, leaving whole sections unfilled, save
for the ushers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These conditions were as bad as I've ever played in,'' said
Joe Girardi, the Yankees' catcher. ``I mean, by the fourth inning,
there was standing water all over the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Ausmus added: ``The field was soaked. These were the worst
conditions I've seen _ and I played in snow in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   A human reaction to such conditions is to seek shelter, and as
several players mentioned after the game, some hitters will attack
aggressively under such squalid conditions, hoping to determine
their fate as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   As several Tigers mentioned to one another during the game,
however, the Yankee batters never flinched, never changed their
approach in the rain against Beiker Graterol, a right-hander making
his major league debut.
</P>
<P>
   As always, Chuck Knoblauch stepped out of the box after every
pitch, methodically adjusted his gloves and touched his helmet as
sheets of rain drenched him. Paul O'Neill stepped back and
practiced his swing between offerings. Winds were blowing in
hitters' faces, rain obscured the pitcher as he delivered the ball,
thick raindrops fell from the brims of their caps, and through it
all, the Yankees waited for Graterol and his relievers to throw
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing in those elements is a question of mind over matter,''
said Willie Randolph, the Yankees' third base coach.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen of the Yankees' first 17 hitters took the first pitch in
their at-bat, and 9 of the first 17 took the first two pitches.
``They'll make you throw strikes, and then when you do, they'll
murder you if you make a mistake,'' said Doug Brocail, a Tigers
reliever.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez slugged a home run to open the second inning, and
Graterol had thrown 28 pitches by the time Scott Brosius batted one
out later; Brosius lifted a two-run home run into the left-field
stands.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, Derek Jeter walked on seven pitches,
O'Neill walked after fouling off three two-strike pitches and
Martinez was intentionally passed after a groundout advanced the
runners. Having learned all they needed to know about Graterol, the
Yankee hitters seemed locked in on his consistent use of the lower
half of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander threw a change-up to Davis, who reached down
and golfed a line drive over the wall in right field, the eighth
grand slam of his career. The Yankees had a 7-0 lead after three
innings, the rain fell steadily and there was some concern that the
umpires might stop the game before the completion of the Tiger
fifth, the point at which the game would be official.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Girardi said, he made a point of swinging at
the first pitch leading off the fourth inning, to speed the game
along.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi's teammates, however, continued with all deliberate
speed, to the point that Randolph started yelling at them from the
third base coach's box: ``C'mon, let's go, swing the bat, let's get
moving.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers (1-3) swung aggressively throughout, as they usually
do, and Cone seemed to exploit this. He walked seven batters, three
in the sixth inning before he departed, but the Tigers nonetheless
appeared to help him at times, often swinging wildly at high
fastballs or the breaking balls he spun out of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Strikes resulted from just 55 of his 104 pitches, but Cone
probably had a much lower percentage of pitches in the strike zone,
perhaps 30 percent. He pitched high and low, and the Tigers chased
high and low. The Yankees chased nothing.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees batted and went deep into ball-strike counts,
Ausmus recalled, it seemed as if the Tigers stood on the field for
30 minutes at a time, in the cold and the rain and the wind,
building ponds.

   WASHINGTON _ Four days after NATO approved the deployment of two
dozen American Apache helicopter gunships to attack Yugoslav tanks,
frustrated NATO and Pentagon officials now estimate that it could
take a month before the helicopters are available to fly into
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. C-17 cargo planes carrying the first loads of equipment and
supplies to support the Apaches began arriving in Albania's
capital, Tirana, over the last two days. But officials said the
full deployment had moved sluggishly, and they cited bad weather,
slow-moving bureaucracy and an air-traffic bottleneck over Albania
because of the airlift of food and relief supplies.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, has expressed
aggravation at the delays of the Apaches, which are suited to seek
out and destroy tanks and other armored vehicles involved in the
attacks on Kosovo's ethnic Albanians. A NATO official said Clark on
Friday scolded officials organizing the airlift into Albania,
ordering them to do more to speed the deployment.
</P>
<P>
   When NATO authorized the use of the Apaches on Monday, officials
said it would take only seven to 10 days to have them ready for
their combat missions.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance has also come under criticism for not moving fast
enough to protect the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians
that it says are now living in the open in Kosovo under threat of
attack from Yugoslav forces and with little food and water.
</P>
<P>
   Although NATO has reported making progress against Yugoslavia's
military and police forces, bad weather has once again enveloped
the Balkans, limiting the alliance's attacks to cruise missiles and
high-flying warplanes, like the B-2 bombers. The skies over
Belgrade were overcast all day, with the clouds dipping as low as
1,500 feet at times.
</P>
<P>
   The Apaches can fly effectively in any weather and, officials
said, could be put to good use against Yugoslav forces in what are
now lulls in NATO's raids.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's attacks resumed for a 17th day Friday, relying
heavily on cruise missiles, officials said. Five explosions were
reported Friday evening in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital. The
official Yugoslav news agency reported that a television
transmitter had been hit on Mount Goles near Kosovo's provincial
capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The latest attacks came hours after President Slobodan Milosevic
of Yugoslavia rejected an effort by a Cypriote official, Spyros
Kyprianou, to secure the release of three U.S. soldiers who were
captured along the Yugoslav-Macedonian border on March 31.
Kyprianou said Milosevic had ruled out ``any peaceful gestures''
because of the intensification of NATO's bombing in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen ordered still more U.S.
forces to join in a NATO force that has already grown significantly
since the strikes began on March 24. Cohen sent six more F-15C
fighter jets now based in Alaska to the region and ordered a Navy
minesweeper, the Inchon, to stay in the Adriatic rather than leave
as scheduled for the Persian Gulf. The Inchon has helicopters
aboard that could be used in the relief operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said Cohen now had an
official request from Clark for dozens of additional fighter and
support aircraft, including fighters like the F-16 and F-15 and the
A-10 attack plane, which is designed to fly low and attack ground
troops and armor, and refueling aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional pressure on the Clinton administration also
continued to grow. A bipartisan group of senators and
representatives who traveled to NATO's headquarters with Cohen this
week sent President Clinton a letter, urging him to do more to at
least plan for the use of ground forces and to prepare the American
public for a long campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even assuming the success of the air campaign to significantly
degrade Milosevic's military capability, there is less certainty
that NATO's broader objectives in Kosovo (removal of Milosevic's
troops and return of refugees with international protection) will
be achieved,'' the group of nine Republicans and Democrats wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Before the rain and clouds set in again, U.S. and other NATO
warplanes had for the first time begun to strike armored forces
operating in Kosovo. And on Thursday the Pentagon said the strikes
had effectively cut the fuel and ammunition lines to the
40,000-strong Yugoslav army and to police units in the province.
</P>
<P>
   But officials concede that they have so far done little to
destroy the front-line armored forces accused of carrying out the
worst of the attacks in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clark had requested the deployment of the Apache helicopters _
along with long-range rocket batteries used to back them up _ more
than two weeks ago to accelerate that effort. But carrying out his
request initially stalled because of concerns about putting ground
forces so close to the fighting in Yugoslavia, and now because of
the sluggish deployment.
</P>
<P>
   Officials now concede officially that the schedule of putting
Apaches in place in seven to 10 days has slipped. Maj. Gen. Charles
Wald, the deputy director of strategic plans and policy for the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Friday that it was unlikely that even
an ``initial operational capability'' would be in place before
seven days.
</P>
<P>
   A major factor in the delay has been the small and underequipped
airport outside Tirana, which has been overwhelmed by the enormous
effort to ship food and other supplies to more than 200,000 ethnic
Albanian refugees who fled Yugoslav forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has already shipped 230,000 daily rations,
100,000 gallons of water and 700 tents to Albania and has plans for
still more shipments in the days and weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   A senior defense official in Washington said NATO's focus on the
relief effort in Albania had slowed the effort to move the Apache
unit there. ``If we wanted them in quickly, it wouldn't take long
to get them in,'' the official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``It's a question of priorities.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other officials have said that even if the Apaches arrived soon,
Yugoslavia's air defense system was still formidable enough to make
flying the helicopters risky. Clark has indicated that the Apaches
would join the fight right away, but other Pentagon officials would
prefer to use the Apaches only after the air defenses are further
weakened.
</P>
<P>
   Wald said the Air Force had sent a team of experts to Tirana's
airport to install a lighting system and air-traffic control
equipment that could allow landings and takeoffs at night; they are
now limited to daylight.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time it will be easier to bring more equipment in,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the weather over the Balkans has been so bad that it has
delayed the installation and testing of that equipment, which is
not expected to be in place before the end of the weekend. The
weather has also delayed some of the cargo flights from Germany,
where the Apaches and related forces are based.
</P>
<P>
   Only four of five C-17 flights scheduled to fly to Albania on
Thursday made it through the clouds and rain, while the other had
to cancel its flight. Friday, only five of seven were able to land,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior defense official said that if the airport
operated 24 hours a day and was not hampered by the weather, the
full force could arrive within 16 days. At the current pace,
however, the estimate is that 25 more days will be needed, meaning
it will be May 2 when the full force is there.
</P>
<P>
   This official and others said another problem was the ``weight''
of the Army's force. Although the Apaches themselves are expected
to fly to Albania, the rocket batteries, armored vehicles and other
equipment to set up a secure base for 2,800 soldiers will require
some 150 cargo flights from Germany to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Army is sending the force into remote, rugged
terrain in Europe's poorest country means that the force must bring
with it everything the soldiers need to live and work. ``It's not
like taking an airplane and landing at Aviano,'' the senior defense
official said, referring to the air base in Italy that is the nexus
of NATO's attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Apaches, along with the long-range rocket batteries, will
ultimately set up a base at an airfield now being carved out of a
pasture in an undisclosed location between Tirana and Albania's
northern border with Kosovo. The helicopters are likely to operate
in smaller groups from hidden bases in the mountains and forests
close to Kosovo's border.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, in a television interview from NATO's headquarters in
Brussels, Belgium, said Friday that the Apaches would allow NATO to
``work beneath the weather'' when rain and clouds scuttle other
flights.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance confirmed Friday that one of three bombs aimed
earlier this week at the main telephone exchange in Pristina had
missed its target and slammed into a residential area, although it
was unclear if anyone had died as a result. The Yugoslav
authorities say 10 people were killed when an errant bomb hit the
city on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``One bomb appeared to be seduced off the target at the final
stages,'' said NATO's military spokesman, Air Commodore David Wilby
of Britain. ``Close inspection of imagery indicates that it landed
some 200 to 300 meters away in what seems to be a small residential
area.'' He said the telephone exchange was a ``critical target''
since it was used for communications between Belgrade and Serbian
forces in Kosovo. He said NATO regretted any possible loss of
civilian life as a result of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes Friday night hit a sprawling industrial complex in
Kragujevac that included the country's only auto plant. Pentagon
and NATO officials said the factory also made military vehicles and
was thus a legitimate military target.

Undated: his own place.

<P>
   Dan Sachs opened Spruce restaurant in Chicago three years ago to
widespread plaudits for his chef, Keith Luce. Even though Luce had
a limited partnership in the restaurant, he decided last July to
leave for the Restaurant at Little Nell, a resort in Aspen, Colo.
``Publicity definitely had a role in my decision,'' Luce explained.
``The more status you get from the media, the better the offers
that come along.''
</P>
<P>
   For many chefs, the ultimate is turning themselves into a brand,
which often leads to corporate endorsements for everything from
kitchen equipment, chefs' attire and tableware to the likes of the
National Pork Products Council, Plugra Butter, Cervena Venison, and
Foods From Spain. Airlines also hire celebrity chefs to develop
menus.
</P>
<P>
   Cervena, the American marketing arm for New Zealand venison,
took on 15 leading chefs to publicize the product nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked very well for everybody for six years,'' said Mary
Anne Harmon, the company's marketing manager until the program
ended in March. ``We had a product that nobody was doing anything
with, so we wanted to gain credibility with a core group of
influential chefs.''
</P>
<P>
   The chefs, among them Kevin Rathbun of Nava restaurant in
Atlanta, David Holben of the Riviera in Dallas, and Charlie Palmer
of Aureole in New York, were paid only a few thousand dollars a
year for public appearances. But the important currency was in
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In return for being in the program, they received a lot of
media exposure,'' Ms. Harmon said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, chefs and publicists say it is difficult to quantify
the precise effects of public relations versus advertising. Some
successful chefs and restaurants eschew publicists, saying they can
do the job better themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got into business, I believed that the surest way
to stay out of the press was to have someone sending massive
mailings of packets and letters out,'' explained Danny Meyer, an
owner-partner in four successful Manhattan restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as chefs increasingly become celebrities in their own
right, they are expecting to be treated like stars, too. ``Chefs
have egos like everybody else,'' said Margie Korshak, a Chicago
publicist. ``In their restaurants they have always courted VIPs;
now they want to be one.''

 &HT;    Strategic mistakes led to delay of key tort reform bill,
lawmakers say
 &HT;    Sen. Troy Fraser: Perry's point man for tort reform had trouble
getting bill out of his subcommittee.
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Strategic miscalculations by Lt. Gov. Rick Perry
and Sen. Troy Fraser, his point man on tort reform, left a key bill
stranded in a subcommittee for three weeks, jeopardizing its
chances of passing the Legislature this late in the session,
several key lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   Perry denied any miscues and said bringing up the bill for a
Senate vote as late as next week should not harm its chances for
final legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   But senators and lobbyists on both sides of the issue said
privately that Perry's referral of the bill directly to Fraser's
subcommittee, which is handling all tort reform legislation this
session, led to leaving the legislation in limbo for three weeks
after its hearing because the subcommittee did not have enough
votes to pass it. If Perry had referred the bill to the full
Economic Development Committee, the committee chairman _ the bill's
sponsor, Sen. David Sibley (R-Waco) _ could have brought it up to
the full committee for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser tried Tuesday to get the full Senate's permission to
refer the bill to Sibley's committee without a subcommittee vote.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser withdrew the request after senators protested that it
violated Senate procedures. The bill passed out of his subcommittee
on technology and business growth Thursday. Senators and lobbyists
advocating the tort reform effort say Houston developer Dick
Weekley, the driving force behind Texans for Tort Reform, was
``livid'' and ``went berserk'' about the delay in getting the bill
to the Senate floor. Weekley denied that and said the delay does
not mean the bill is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Tort reform is a moniker for efforts to impose limits on damages
paid by businesses in personal-injury lawsuits and to otherwise
restrict lawsuits. Some of the Legislature's most powerful lobbies,
business and trial lawyers, have battled over tort reform.

ELIZABETH DOLE IS SHUNNING `DEAD END' ABORTION FIGHT

<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ Stepping carefully into the debate on
abortion that has roiled her party for years, Elizabeth Dole said
Friday that as a possible Republican Presidential candidate, she
would not be drawn into ``dead-end debates'' over a constitutional
amendment to ban abortion, because ``it's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to a supporter and a brief exchange with reporters
after a speech here, Mrs. Dole made her most extensive comments on
the subject since she undertook her exploratory campaign last
month. In doing so, she echoed the modulated posture of her party's
other leading contender, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who opposes
abortion but refuses to say whether he would insist that a running
mate share his view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a divisive and irrelevant debate, in terms of an
amendment,'' Mrs. Dole told reporters after a speech to a
University of Southern California group, made up almost entirely of
women, that raises money for scholarship funds. During the speech
Mrs. Dole made no mention of the abortion issue, long a staple of
the Republican Party platform.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole made remarks on abortion first only in writing, in a
letter to Sandy Cowen-Miller of Phoenix, a supporter who was at a
meeting in Arizona last week in which another woman asked Mrs. Dole
how Republicans ``can preserve our ideals and our party, too.'' In
the letter, Mrs. Dole said she opposed abortion, except in cases of
rape or incest, or to save the life of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   But she also noted in the letter that Congress had not voted on
a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion in 15 years, and
added: ``Republican women can set the example. We can refuse to be
drawn into dead-end debates. We can concentrate instead on what we
agree upon most: we can stop partial-birth abortions, enact
parental notification requirements, continue the ban on government
funding and do everything possible to place unwanted babies with
adoptive parents who will love and care for them.''
</P>
<P>
   She blamed the press for placing ``such an inordinate focus on
an amendment that urgent issues such as domestic violence, child
care, sexual harassment, women's health and the financial security
of women are nearly ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the speech Mrs. Dole's aides called reporters, saying she
would release the letter and hold a rare question-and-answer
session about it. But after the speech, Mrs. Dole declined to
elaborate much, saying only that the party's platform should be
modified to ``add the fact that good and honorable people disagree
on the subject of abortion,'' and that ``we should agree to
respectfully disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has drawn fire from both supporters and opponents of
abortion for his attempt to bridge such divisions, and Mrs. Dole
drew similarly sharp responses Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's called presidential courage,'' said Kate Michelman,
head of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action
League, which has run television commercials here and in New
Hampshire and Iowa branding Mrs. Dole as ``anti-choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What she clearly is trying to do is have it both ways,'' Ms.
Michelman added. ``She clearly has reiterated her opposition to a
woman's right to choose, and at the same time, she's saying to the
American public, `But don't worry, because I won't support a
constitutional amendment.' Well, the American people don't want
that in their leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Goeglein, a spokesman for another prospective Republican
candidate, Gary Bauer, welcomed Mrs. Dole's emphasis on the ``need
to change hearts and minds in the country,'' but said that was not
enough. ``We should also be actively pursuing a legislative agenda,
and obviously the Republican Party platform reflects that, and Gary
would be categorically opposed to changing the platform.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Dole said, ``What I'm doing is really reflecting what
I'm seeing all around the country,'' in terms of uneasiness and
worry about internal divisions in the party. She added: ``For me,
there's no question in my mind that people want to see us move
forward and accomplish some good things, not just kind of endlessly
debate something that really is not going anywhere. It's not going
to happen.''

TWO ACCORDS WITH CHINA BILLED AS ICING BECOME PART OF A SIMPLER
CAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ China and the United States took steps Friday to
protect the environment and to increase airline traffic between the
two countries, but Prime Minister Zhu Rongji left little doubt that
he considered those agreements a poor substitute for the big trade
deal that he hoped to clinch as the centerpiece of his visit.
</P>
<P>
   He and other Chinese officials voiced deep disappointment at
their inability to win U.S. backing for China's application to join
the World Trade Organization. In a private meeting with members of
Congress on Friday morning at Blair House, Zhu vented his
frustration that President Clinton ``did not dare'' to complete the
trade accord, according to people who attended. The failure left
Zhu to continue on his U.S. tour without the prize he had sought.
</P>
<P>
   In a dinner address Friday night, Zhu continued voicing his
displeasure over the way the Clinton administration handled the
trade negotiations. Zhu emphasized that even Friday night,
negotiators were still deep in discussions to hammer out an interim
agreement that would allow the two sides to resume negotiations
down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely the American side realizes that the time has come to
end negotiations which have already gone on for 13 years,'' Zhu
told his audience at the Willard Hotel. ``Surely the time has come
to end these talks and move forward to open new channels of
U.S.-China trade.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Blair House meeting Friday morning, members of Congress
argued that China had regressed in its human rights performance
since Clinton's state visit there last summer and pressed the prime
minister to explain why. Some cited specific cases to illustrate
their complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements and the human rights confrontation came on the
final day of Zhu's stay in Washington. He is to leave Saturday
morning for Denver, followed by stops in Chicago, New York and
Boston. Chinese officials hope those stops on Zhu's trip will give
him a chance to interact with ordinary Americans and to escape the
charged political climate in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the deadlock over trade talks Thursday, the two
sides were able to finish several accords Friday. Foreign Minister
Tang Jiaxuan and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright signed a
pact that doubles, to 54 from 27, the number of weekly flights
between the countries. By 2001, when the increase takes effect,
each side will also have the right to add one airline company to
the three on each side that now fly the trans-Pacific route.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu and Vice President Al Gore spent much of the day presiding
over a forum on the environment. The two countries, the world's
biggest producers of greenhouse gases thought by many experts to
cause global warming, signed an accord that provides U.S. financing
for clean-air projects in China. They also witnessed the signing of
a commercial agreement to build a natural gas pipeline in southern
China.
</P>
<P>
   Though the environment is a special area of focus for Gore, it
was Zhu, at least in the public session, who appeared more eager to
discuss the details of the two countries' environmental policies.
In contrast to Gore, who read some perfunctory opening remarks from
notes, the prime minister discarded his prepared speech after a few
minutes and spoke off-the-cuff, in some detail, about the
seriousness of the country's pollution problems and his efforts to
bring them under control.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu spoke frankly of ``the devastation of Mother Nature'' in
China as a result of soil erosion, deforestation, and emissions
from factories, cars and coal-burning furnaces, the country's main
source of heat. He also called closer environmental cooperation one
of the keys to reducing what the United States estimates is a $57
billion trade deficit with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would even say that you could wipe out your large trade
deficit, or turn the trade deficit into a surplus,'' Zhu said,
citing China's big appetite for technology and expertise to clean
up air and water supplies. ``If that happens, I would be very
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Friday's agreements related to the environment will not
make much of a dent in China's huge trade surplus, though
administration officials called them useful steps toward a broader
environmental alliance that could lead to robust trade in the
future. The highlight was a $100 million deal under which the U.S.
Export-Import Bank will finance the export of U.S. clean-air
technology to China, including projects to make more efficient use
of energy and to reduce pollution from existing power sources.
</P>
<P>
   Though administration officials had hoped that several companies
that might benefit from such financing would announce commercial
agreements Friday, no contracts were made public. Officials said
they expect at least several U.S. companies to push forward with
clean-air projects in China shortly.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate commercial deal, Enron and China National
Petroleum Corporation signed a memorandum of understanding at the
environmental forum for the joint development of a natural gas
pipeline in south central China.
</P>
<P>
   China and the United States also took a first step toward
setting up a United States-style emission trading regime in China.
Polluters in America have the right to buy and sell emissions
quotas, which some environmental experts have praised as a way of
using the market to help solve pollution problems. China has so far
resisted adopting that kind of mechanism, but administration
officials said Zhu was at least prepared to experiment with the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   The breakfast meeting at Blair House, the guest house near the
White House where heads of state often stay when visiting
Washington, was attended by 15 members of the House of
Representatives and the Senate. Zhu, true to his promise early in
the week to allow critics free reign to voice their frustrations
with China, did almost no talking during the session, people who
attended it said. But in some opening remarks he expressed distress
over the failure to conclude talks over China's accession to the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of Congress said they were surprised when Zhu,
speaking through an interpreter, said he believed that Clinton
lacked the ``courage'' to try to push the agreement through
Congress now, given recent allegations of Chinese spying. The
language was unusually blunt and undiplomatic, even though Zhu has
shown several times that he will speak his mind.
</P>
<P>
   But at the conclusion of the session, Chinese officials
approached several members of Congress offering what they called a
more accurate translation. Zhu's words should have been translated
as the verb ``dare to'' not the noun ``courage,'' they said, adding
that the prime minister in no way intended to challenge Clinton
directly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Zhu's frustration was evident, some said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure he expected the climate to be as difficult as it
has been,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., who attended the session
and who supports China's entry into the trade organization. ``In
the end he made a strong pitch for us to step up to the plate and
get it done, though I am a little concerned that this will drift
now because we missed the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The members of Congress also pressed Zhu to improve China's
human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Wu, R-Ore., praised America's open political system
for giving him, an immigrant from China, the chance to serve in
Congress. He then brought to Zhu's attention the arrest of a
19-year-old high school graduate from Wu's own home province of
Jiangsu, near Shanghai. The youth was sentenced to serve 10 years
in prison for writing an essay on corruption in the Communist
Party, Wu said. Zhu did not respond to that case or defend China's
rights record in the forum.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ About 700,000 ethnic Albanians have been uprooted
from their homes by the Yugoslavs and are still in Kosovo facing
the risk of famine as food stocks quickly dwindle, administration
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have considered air drops of food but rejected the
idea as too dangerous for NATO pilots, who would have to fly at low
levels and risk being hit by Yugoslav ground fire, an official
said. The gravity of the situation is becoming clearer as analysts
study satellite imagery of the destruction in Kosovo and interview
refugees who have escaped, but few specifics have been made public.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton spoke about Kosovo for the
fifth day in a row and continued his public attacks on President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, accusing him of blocking the
escape routes of ethnic Albanians by sealing the borders.
</P>
<P>
   The border with Albania, which was closed by the Yugoslavs on
Wednesday, was reopened Friday night, at least temporarily, and
about 2,000 refugees were reported to have entered Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Only a trickle of refugees got across the border into Macedonia,
which essentially remains closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Milosevic still thinks he can manipulate the situation by
cynically using innocent people,'' Clinton said. ``He hopes that we
will accept as permanent the results of his ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would not accept Milosevic's offer of a
cease-fire, which was accompanied by the border closings, saying a
quarter of Kosovo's people are living in camps outside Kosovo while
``hundreds of thousands'' more are trapped inside, afraid to go
home but unable to leave.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the NATO bombing began, the
administration released details Friday of young ethnic Albanian
women being raped by Yugoslav soldiers at an army training camp
near the town of Dakovica.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said a single, but
reliable, source had provided ``very disturbing reports'' of mass
rapes, and it was believed that as many as 20 women may have been
killed. Bacon said the report was given added credence because it
fit the pattern of mass rapes by Yugoslav soldiers during the
Bosnian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, the American ambassador at large for
war crimes, David Scheffer, gave a public briefing on interviews he
made with refugees in Macedonia last week. The refugees, he said,
described the execution of military-age ethnic Albanian men and the
burning of villages.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden rush of information from the administration Friday on
atrocities committed by Milosevic's troops appeared aimed in part
at keeping up the public support for the airstrikes. The details
released by Scheffer Friday were not new: He returned from
Macedonia last weekend and his report was posted on the Internet
midweek.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls show that the American people are in favor
of the air campaign on the grounds that it is an assault against a
brutal dictator.
</P>
<P>
   But as the administration releases details of the atrocities,
officials must carefully calibrate the timing and tenor of the
information so that it does not appear that the NATO bombing is the
major cause of the calamity inside the province.
</P>
<P>
   The flow of information on the brutalities in Kosovo contrasts
with the denials by Washington that the Yugoslavs were holding
Bosnian Muslims in concentration camps in the early stages of the
Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Milosevic, by closing the borders of Kosovo two
days ago, was using the tactic of holding hundreds of thousands of
ethnic Albanians virtually hostage inside the province.
</P>
<P>
   With diminishing supplies of food and water, the ethnic
Albanians would increasingly suffer, officials said, putting the
Western allies in the awkward position of watching the population
it was trying to help, suffer even more.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's ploy of threatening to starve the remaining
population in Kosovo was already drawing the kind of attention that
the administration, adamant about not negotiating with Milosevic,
might find difficult to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. high commissioner for refugees was considering asking
NATO and Belgrade for permission to send an assessment team to
Kosovo to look at the food situation, a European diplomat said
Friday. Such a proposal would have to be negotiated with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of starvation inside Kosovo was of mounting
concern, an administration official said, because some of the
displaced people have been outdoors since before the NATO bombing
began.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There were believed to be about 700,000 people who had been
thrown out of their homes by the Yugoslavs who had found other
accommodation or were camping in the outdoors, the official said.
He could not estimate how many of the roughly 700,000 were outdoors
or indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Those most threatened with starvation were in the Shala
Mountains, the Berisha Hills and the Cicavica Hills, where people
were camping much as they were last autumn when 250,000 ethnic
Albanians came down from the hills after a ceasefire agreement with
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials have said for nearly two weeks that they believed
the condition of the ethnic Albanians inside Kosovo was far worse
than that of those who were expelled or had escaped.
</P>
<P>
   There were probably still stocks of food in Kosovo, the
administration official who has studied the intelligence reports
said, but the food was not near the displaced people who were
camped in the hills to avoid the Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   It was known, from officials of the Kosovo Verification Mission,
who evacuated from Kosovo five days before the bombing began, that
Yugoslav soldiers had torched large amounts of the food stocks
owned by ethnic Albanians. These officials also reported that the
last harvest, because of the upsurge in fighting, was very slim.
</P>
<P>
   A European military official said air drops had been rejected by
NATO last week as too risky. If planes assigned to air drops of
food flew high enough to avoid Yugoslav ground fire, the food
packages would probably be ruined by the time they hit the ground
or could fall into the hands of Yugoslavs.
</P>
<P>
   But, the military official said, the food situation was
deteriorating so fast that the possibility of air drops should be
examined again.
</P>
<P>
   In releasing some sketchy information about the reports of mass
rapes and the murder of as many as 20 women, Bacon drew some
parallels with the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very eerie and disturbing echo of documented
instances of rape and killing of women in Bosnia during the Bosnian
war, and it is obviously outrageous that this is occurring,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a reliable report, but it is not completely
confirmed yet,'' he said. ``Two things, I think, make it reliable.
One is the source, and I can't get into details about that. But,
two, it fits a pattern that we've seen in the Balkans before.`
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the Pentagon would attempt to confirm the reports of
the rapes and murders at Dakovica over the next few days through
interviews with refugees and `other ways.'
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups have estimated that more than 30,000 women
and young girls were sexually abused by Yugoslav forces during
earlier fighting in the Balkans, especially in Bosnia. Some Bosnia
Serb rapists explicitly told their Muslim victims that their
purpose was to impregnate them with Serbian babies.

GENENTECH DROPS NERVE DRUG FOR DIABETICS AFTER TESTS FAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Genentech Inc., one of the world's largest biotechnology
companies, said Friday that Neuleze, its highly anticipated drug to
promote nerve growth in diabetes patients, would not be sold in the
United States because late-stage clinical trials had failed to
prove the compound worked.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the setback was a significant blow to Genentech
and its majority shareholder, Roche Holding AG of Switzerland.
Since Genentech and Roche would have been the first companies to
market a drug like Neuleze, peak worldwide sales could have reached
$600 million, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to Genentech's trouble, the South San Francisco-based
company also said Friday that it was negotiating a settlement that
could cost it $50 million to resolve federal charges that it had
illegally marketed Protropin, a growth hormone, for uses that were
not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. If the settlement
is reached, it would be the first time that a pharmaceutical
company had been criminally prosecuted for the off-label use of a
drug, the Justice Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted casually to Genentech's woes, and the
company's stock dropped just 68.75 cents to close at $84.8125,
after trading as low as $83. The American depository receipts of
Roche fell $1.75, or 1.4 percent, to close at $125.25.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this news came out, we expected Genentech's stock to drop
4 percent or 5 percent,'' said Sena Lund, an analyst with Mehta
Partners. ``But that didn't happen. Investors were confident in
some of Genentech's other products, which were performing better
than expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts pointed to Genentech's strong oncology franchise. The
company received FDA approval in 1997 to sell Rituxan, for
non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and Herceptin last year, for metastatic
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, investors may have still other reasons to hold their
Genentech shares. Roche, which owns about two-thirds of Genentech's
stock, has until July 1 to decide whether it will buy the remaining
shares for about $82.50 each, analysts said. This option has given
Genentech's stock some unusual stability.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of Neuleze may alter the pharmaceutical market.
Several other companies _ notably Pfizer and Warner-Lambert _ are
developing similar compounds that now have their chances to be the
first to arrive on the market. Analysts noted that the first new
treatment for an illness typically outsells competitors' later
entries.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday, Genentech executives said that they would
continue human growth factor research similar to Neuleze, but
played down the company's troubles with the Justice Department. The
company had promoted its growth hormones for such unapproved uses
as obesity, one person at the Justice Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech said Friday that if it reached an agreement with
government attorneys in California, the $50 million fine would be
taken as a one-time charge against first-quarter earnings and would
have no lasting effect on operations.

 &HT;    Olazabal pursued by Norman and pack of champions
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ It's getting to be like old times at the 63rd
Masters. Next thing you know, there will be Nicklaus roars on Amen
Corner; Palmer will be going for the par 5s in two; and Tom Watson
will be breaking out the plaid bell-bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's pushing it, but guess what?
</P>
<P>
   Jose Maria Olazabal, the 1994 champion, is leading by a stroke
at 8-under-par 136 after a 6-under 66, and Greg Norman is three
shots back after a 68.
</P>
<P>
   You heard correctly. Greg Norman. Yes, there is life after the
train wreck of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad Seve Ballesteros' game is too far gone to join the
reunion. Too bad Jack's hip is still on the mend. The fun is just
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   That's wannabe Scott McCarron, who plays Augusta National better
than your average PGA Tour track, who shot a 68 to trail by a
stroke, but behind him there's enough major championship experience
for a series of Golf Channel specials.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring three missed cuts in a row, two-time U.S. Open champion
Lee Janzen saw the new Masters rough, imagined a USGA setup and
shot a 69 to stand three back at 139.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price, with three majors on his record, stalled slightly
with a 72 but is tied for fifth at 3-under 141. He's with
first-round co-leader Davis Love III of Sea Island, the 1997 PGA
champ, who could not break par, either.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's Bernhard Langer, a two-time Masters champion, tied
Olazabal for low round of the day with a 66 and is at 142, along
with Scotland's Colin Montgomerie (72), Bill Glasson (70),
first-round co-leader Brandel Chamblee (73), 1995 PGA champion
Steve Elkington (70) and 1997 British Open champion Justin Leonard
(72).
</P>
<P>
   Favorite David Duval, upended by a triple-bogey 8 at the 15th
hole, slipped to a 74 and is at 1-over 145. That's a stroke worse
than 1997 Masters champion Tiger Woods, who shot a second
consecutive 72.
</P>
<P>
   The cut (top 44 and ties) came at 4-over 148, eliminating such
names as two-time champion Watson, Mark Calcavecchia, Nick Faldo
(for the third time since winning in '96) and U.S. Amateur champion
Hank Kuehne.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech amateur Matt Kuchar, who chipped in twice, rallied
for a 71 to make the cut for the second consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   Norman joining the contenders was the shocker. Just when
everybody thought he might need a psychiatrist on his bag to make
another run at a green jacket after the disaster of 1996, Norman,
44, resurfaced Friday with a crowd-pleasing, nostalgic display.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like riding a bike,'' Norman said, putting more meaning
in his surgically improved shoulder than the six-stroke, 54-hole
lead he squandered in 1996. ``If you get a chance to win, you're
going after it.''
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal, 33, was a bit of a surprise himself. He has suffered
lately with a misguided driver, but this week has returned to the
form that brought him a green jacket five years ago. If his Sunday
back nine shows any resemblance to his Friday one, the Spaniard
will be tough to unseat. He walked proudly up the 18th _ three
years ago, with foot problems, a painful exercise in itself _ with
a 4-under 32.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tournament will start most probably on the back nine of
the last day,'' Olazabal said. ``We all know that. So I'll try to
keep doing a good job the next couple of days.... I think it's a
wide open golf tournament. There are a lot of players who can
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Norman, who underwent left shoulder surgery immediately
after he missed last year's cut, can do it still remains to be
seen. Coming into Augusta weakened by a virus that knocked him out
of the BellSouth Classic last week, Norman was barely mentioned in
pre-tournament speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to be in this position,'' said Norman, who held the
lead alone early in the round. ``It's great when you've worked
yourself so hard to get back into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a third consecutive victory and his first major
title, Duval could be out of it at nine shots off the lead. The
same for Woods, who is eight back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to play better,'' Duval said, ``if I want to have a
chance Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els (71) and Phil Mickelson (69) are within range at
1-under 143. Defending champion Mark O'Meara is 10 shots back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think experience is a great factor here,'' Olazabal said.
``The more you know the course, the more you know what you have to
do, where you have to hit the ball, how you have to have to play
the holes. Day after day, you have to play well.

THE SHARK IS PROWLING IN A DATE WITH DESTINY

</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Australia)   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ From the 18th fairway, Greg Norman's ball floated
onto the green Friday, skipped past the flagstick and spun to a
stop about 10 feet away. The way so many of his approach shots once
did. The Masters gallery that had waited for him clapped, the way
they once did, in a burst of appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Norman still climbing the hill to the green, the
applause began. He has heard applause at the Masters since he first
arrived here in 1981, but this applause was different.
</P>
<P>
   This applause wasn't jubilant, as it was in those years when he
nearly won. It wasn't sympathetic, as it was in 1996 when he
arrived at the 18th after losing a six-shot lead as Nick Faldo flew
past him. It wasn't sad, as it was the last two years when he
missed the 36-hole cut.
</P>
<P>
   This applause resembled a warm and firm hug to an old friend.
When it turned to cheers, it lasted so long, he had to tip his
black cap half a dozen times as he strode across the green to mark
his ball.
</P>
<P>
   But when the 44-year-old Australian stood over his putt, the
silence was such that a voice was heard to say, ``This is the
quietest it's been here all day.'' He missed his birdie, to the
gallery's groan. But when he tapped in a four-under-par 68 for 139,
the applause and the cheers resumed.
</P>
<P>
   After the second round ended hours later, Jose Maria Olazabal of
Spain was the leader at 136, but Norman, the Great White Shark, was
in the hunt at the Masters, again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to be in this position,'' Norman said. ``It's great
that I feel a little less sense of urgency when I approach things
on the golf course or approach things off the golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   But his golf guru, David Leadbetter, had mentioned how Norman
was so much more focused now, so Norman was asked to explain how he
could be so focused without a sense of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Urgency is something where you're trying to force the issue,''
he said. ``I'm not trying to force it. David's been trying to let
me know how well I'm swinging, and if you're urgent with it, then
you're trying to force the issue. And if you try to force the
issue, you don't relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Norman was thinking of the strategic way he birdied the
485-yard par-5 dogleg left 13th hole with Rae's Creek to the left
of the fairway and then in front of the green. He hit a 3-wood on
the tee, laid up with a 6-iron, then spun a sand wedge to about 6
inches as the gallery cheered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to really play it with a lot of authority because you
needed the backspin,'' he said. ``You only have about 4 yards of
green up top to play with. If you don't get much spin on it, it's
over the back of the green.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman has always had philosophical explanations whether he's
playing well or badly, whether he lost the 1987 Masters playoff
when Larry Mize chipped in on the second hole, or whether he shot
78 in his collapse against Faldo after shooting a record-tying 63
in the opening round.
</P>
<P>
   When he mentioned, ``I've always believed in destiny,'' he was
asked what he thought his destiny was for this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what my destiny is,'' he said. ``Somebody asked
me, `Does this place owe you one?' I don't believe in things
getting owed to you. I think you go out there and play well enough
to get them yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman continued: ``What is the definition of destiny? I've
played here long enough to see where things have happened for me
and against me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that really sticks in my mind is what happened to
Freddy Couples on the front of 12 when his ball hung up there,''
Norman said, referring to Couples' victory in 1992. ``No other ball
in the entire tournament hung up there. Is that destiny or a little
bit of luck?''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after missing the Masters cut last year, Norman underwent
surgery on his left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the way I came back to play in the Presidents Cup late
last year,'' he said of the December event in Melbourne, Australia,
``I felt I was back on the horse I was riding before.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the sentimental favorite, Norman has the Masters gallery
rooting for him. His wife, Laura, knew why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found that people inside are basically good, that
everyone has had a certain amount of heartache in their life, and a
lot of people have definitely seen Greg's heartache here,'' she
said of his 1996 collapse. ``But he just loves it here. Loves the
tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Norman would love it even more if he were to be wearing a
green jacket Sunday evening.

SPORTS COLUMN: MICHAEL JORDAN ADDS A YANKEE SHORTSTOP TO HIS TEAM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michael Jordan sat in a luxury suite at Yankee
Stadium Friday afternoon, watching the Yankees open the season by
annihilating Detroit in a rain-shortened game, and adding to his
growing aura of invincibility. Jordan said he was on hand as a fan,
though he admitted that it took more than his love of the game to
come out on a miserable Friday. In fact, Jordan was also on hand to
support Derek Jeter, his latest client and a player who, in many
ways, reminds Jordan of his athletic self.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Jordan announced that the Yankees' fabulous
shortstop had joined Jordan Brand, a sub-brand of Nike that was
created in 1997. The line of sports apparel has a Jumpman logo, a
silhouette of a soaring Jordan. Jordan Brand will be endorsed by a
collection of athletes, handpicked by Jordan, who he feels
exemplify the virtues of his National Basketball Association
career. In Jeter's case, Jordan sees a mirror image: a shortstop
with speed and power; great defensive range. Also a player with a
sense of fashion, style and a folk-hero appeal that goes beyond the
sports arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's legit,'' Jordan said of Jeter. ``He's versatile; you see
him on the cover of GQ, then the next week he's on the cover of
Sports Illustrated. He's focused, he works hard. He's in a major
market with a lot of pressure, but he handles the pressure. I'm
proud of him; I'm glad we're working together.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Jeter sported a pair of Air Jordan cleats and Jumpman
wristbands. ``We're still trying to develop a product for him,''
Jordan said. ``What we like is that he's a positive role model,
reflects a positive image. He's unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Jordan sat and talked with Jeter's parents, who recently
relocated to New Jersey. When Jeter reached first base in the third
and sixth innings, Jordan, ever the competitor, exhorted him to
steal second.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's partnership with Jeter and subsequent association with
the Yankees represents another variation of the corporate symmetry
of the 1990s. Jordan is one of the greatest athletes of this
century. The Yankees, who raised their 24th world championship flag
Friday, are the most storied professional sports franchise of the
century. The 24-year-old Jeter, through his glove, bat and
presence, is on the verge of establishing an individual identity in
the context of a fiercely team-oriented game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want there to be a mystique connected to being part of the
Jordan Brand,'' Jordan said. ``Not something everybody will be
involved with.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jeter was leaving the Stadium, he said the decision to go
with Jordan Brand was a no-brainer. ``It was an easy decision,'' he
said. ``Measure what he stands for on and off the court. I don't
know if there's an athlete out there who wouldn't want to be
affiliated.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, who was already a Nike athlete, joins Randy Moss, the
Minnesota Vikings' wide receiver, the boxer Roy Jones and five NBA
players who endorse Jordan Brand. Jeter is special because of his
youth, his sport, his affiliation with the Yankees and his unique
blend of talent and appeal. ``We want to expand from basketball,''
Jordan said. ``This is something that's new, something different.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are definitely part of a new modern mystique. But
unlike Jordan's NBA, or the National Football League's success,
Major League Baseball is not quite as mysterious anymore: it boils
down to which team has the most money to spend. Friday's opening
day, a lopsided victory on a rain-swept afternoon, may mark the
shape of things to come. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Bob Sheppard's golden voice floated from the
public address system over the Bronx and Harlem. Sheppard recounted
the Yankees' 1998 record: 125 victories and 50 losses. As Phil
Rizzuto and Whitey Ford raised the world championship banner,
Sheppard proudly said, ``The flag we are about to raise is a symbol
of courage, conviction and everlasting truth.''
</P>
<P>
   He forgot to mention the 1999 Yankees' $86 million payroll, the
highest in baseball. Money gives a backbone to courage, glue to
conviction and a rosy color to the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees opened the season by taking 2 of 3 from the Oakland
Athletics, a team with a $22 million payroll. Detroit has a $35
million payroll. If the corollary between money and winning holds
true, the Yankees' stiffest tests will be Baltimore ($81.4 million)
and Texas ($75 million).
</P>
<P>
   Is it all about money? Of course not: Jeter, the player Jordan
so admires, is the product of the Yankees' farm system, as are
Ricky Ledee and Andy Pettitte.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of wealth is that money can buy what the farm can't
grow. &QL;

GIANTS WANT DODGERS TO HELP OPEN STADIUM IN 2000
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the San Francisco Giants open Pacific Bell
Park next April, they want to play the Los Angeles Dodgers. Giants
general manager Brian Sabean said the club has petitioned the
National League to play the Dodgers in their home opener next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The request has been put in,'' Sabean said. ``It makes
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are playing their last season at Candlestick Park (or
3Com Park, for the non-traditionalists) after calling it home since
1960.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry between the Dodgers and Giants, dating back to the
borough battles of the New York days, is rich. When the Giants
moved from the Polo Grounds to San Francisco, they played the
Dodgers in the Seals Stadium opener. The Dodgers also played the
Giants in their Coliseum opener in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Another chapter to that story will be added at the end of the
season when the Giants and Dodgers conclude the regular season, and
perhaps Candlestick's baseball history, Sept. 28-30.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said he couldn't think of a
better way to start the 2000 season than christening Pacific Bell
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds great to me,'' Malone said. ``I'd be in favor of it.
I know the rivalry we have with them. I respect Brian Sabean and
(manager) Dusty Baker, and I think it would be fun. I think it
would be exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball will announce the 2000 schedules later in
the season, but before they are compiled, questionnaires are sent
out to each club. Organizations are asked whether they would prefer
to play at home or on the road for the season opener, the end of
the first half of the season, the start of the second half and the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Sabean said the Giants don't necessarily want the season opener
at home, but when that home opener rolls around, they want to play
the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   However, that could mean Dodgers right-hander Kevin Brown would
get the start, which wouldn't bode well for the Giants. Brown is
6-0, including a 1997 no-hitter, with a 0.58 ERA lifetime against
the Giants. He's 4-0 with a 0.25 ERA in Candlestick.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield day-to-day: Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield, who
was taken out of Thursday's game after experiencing soreness in his
right hip, said he expects to play today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little sore, but not as sore as (Thursday),'' Sheffield
said. ``It's coming around better than I expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield said he initially hurt the hip chasing a fly ball hit
by the game's first batter, Darryl Hamilton. Manager Davey Johnson
said he would pinch-hit Sheffield in the ninth inning if Sheffield
felt fine, but his first choice was to give him Friday off.
</P>
<P>
   It left the Dodgers with three outfielders _ Jacob Brumfield,
Raul Mondesi and Devon White. Johnson said infielders Tripp Cromer
or Dave Hansen or catcher Paul LoDuca could play the outfield in an
emergency. However, Johnson wouldn't rule out using Sheffield as a
pinch-hitter late in a tight game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sheff's a little tender so there's no sense pushing it,''
Johnson said. ``He's day-to-day.''
</P>
<P>
   In a pinch: Scott Livingstone had the better spring hitting the
baseball. He did so by .144 points on his batting average on
cut-down day. The Dodgers still chose Hansen to be their primary
left-handed pinch-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Through four games he was 3 for 4 with a homer. His lone out was
a line drive to second that turned into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinch-hitting, it's all adrenaline,'' Hansen said. ``It's nice
to have a little confidence, too. I learned early, you can't cram
four at-bats into one. You have to be aggressive, but you have to
be smart and be aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Utility infielder Jose Vizcaino made his
first start of the season, in place of Mark Grudzielanek at
shortstop. Johnson said it had nothing to do with Grudzielanek's
start at the plate. He's hitting .154 (2 for 13).... The Dodgers
entered Friday as the only NL team yet to commit an error.... If
the Dodgers have a good weekend at the gate, they could go over the
100 million mark in attendance since Dodger Stadium opened in 1962.
The Dodgers entered Friday 121,198 fans short of 100 million.

CHARGES DROPPED AGAINST VALENZUELA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Prosecutors dropped their robbery case
against ex-jockey Patrick Valenzuela after they determined they had
the wrong man, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela, 36, had been accused of taking $150 from a Rosemead
cab driver at gunpoint. He was arrested and charged with the crime
in February. Deputy District Attorney Tamia Hope asked Superior
Court Judge Janice Claire Croft to dismiss the case ``in the
interest of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   After a brief hearing, Croft granted that request. In the days
since his arrest, Valenzuela maintained his innocence and indicated
he had an alibi. He said he was watching the Grammy Awards on
television with a friend. Valenzuela's attorney, Donald Calabria,
did not return three phone calls seeking comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   R. Dan Murphy, the head deputy district attorney in Pasadena,
said that asking the judge to dismiss the charges against
Valenzuela was not all that unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kick cases all the time and no one ever notices,'' Murphy
said. ``Occasionally we get cases where we are convinced we have
the wrong guy and this was one of those instances.''
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela, who won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes in
1989 aboard Sunday Silence, could have been sent to prison for up
to 16 years had he been convicted.
</P>
<P>
   No one else has been arrested or charged in the Feb. 24 robbery
of Green Valley Cab driver Jose Valdez, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Valenzuela began to lose steam in mid-March,
when the ex-jockey appeared in Rio Hondo Municipal Court for a
preliminary hearing.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, cabbie Jose Valdez testified he was robbed at
gunpoint by a clean-shaven man, about 5-foot-6 or 5-7, weighing 140
to 150 pounds, clad in a dark jacket and wearing a baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela, who has a mustache and goatee, is 5-4 and weighs
about 125 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The robber took $150 in ones, fives, 10s and 20s, Valdez
testified. When Valenzuela was arrested a little more than 24 hours
later, he had no money in any of those denominations and was
unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   Valdez was unable to identify Valenzuela either by sight or by
voice during the preliminary hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just appears from everything we know about the case that
Valenzuela was close enough in appearance to the robber that at
first the cab driver thought it was him,'' Murphy said. ``But
(Valdez's) ID got very shaky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing we saw told us we had the right guy,'' Murphy said.
``We always worry about ID cases and in this case (Valdez) should
have been able to ID (Valenzuela) with much greater clarity in
court.''
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela's close-knit family stood by the ex-jockey throughout
his ordeal. His sister Christine Wing, a resident of Chino Hills,
predicted Friday's outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat didn't do this,'' she said. ``There's a lot of evidence to
show that and it will be brought out in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Known affectionately as ``P-Val'' in the horse racing community,
Valenzuela was once one of the premier jockeys in the world. But, a
string a drug-related problems, misdemeanor criminal charges and
brushes with boards of stewards at various tracks caused him to
lose his rider's license several times.
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela was suspended from racing in October 1997 after his
failure to show up for work during the Oak Tree Meet. He has not
raced since. In recent months he has promised his friends and
family that he will return to the saddle.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Ted West said he'd be happy to see the ex-jockey return.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a lot of chances and its never worked, but it's up to
him,'' West said. ``I wish him well and I would be extremely
pleased if he could put his career back together again.''

 &HT;    A. Jones' hit gives Braves 3-2 victory over Arizona
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Andruw Jones broke out of his season-opening slump in
a big way Friday night, singling in the winner in the 10th as the
Braves beat Arizona 3-2 before 34,939 at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Brian Jordan doubled down the right-field line off
John Frascatore. The Diamondbacks put Javy Lopez on with an
intentional walk. Jones, whose walk keyed a ninth-inning rally that
brought the Braves back from a 2-0 deficit, singled up the middle
for the winner.

   Tom Glavine and Randy Johnson are going to have a hard time
topping the showdown Odalis Perez and Omar Daal put on Friday
night. The left-handers pitched shutout ball through six innings,
leaving it up to the Arizona and Atlanta bullpens to decide the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were the ones flinching first as Luis Gonzalez
rocketed a pinch-hit solo homer off Rudy Seanez to start the eighth
inning. Arizona added a run in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Perez allowed only two hits through six innings to end his
major-league starting debut in style. He walked three but struck
out five.
</P>
<P>
   Perez allowed three runners in the first two innings _ a double
by Matt Williams and two walks _ but didn't let any of them hurt.
After Williams' double in the first inning, Perez struck out
cleanup hitter Travis Lee looking with a fastball.
</P>
<P>
   A double-play grounder from Tony Batista and a Dante Powell
flyout erased the two walks and Perez was still in business. Perez
set down the next eight hitters, striking out half of them.
</P>
<P>
   Daal battled him the entire way, which is what the Diamondbacks
expected from the middle reliever turned quality starter last year.
After taking over for injured Joel Adamson last season, Daal became
one of Arizona's most dependable starters. He wound up fifth in the
National League with a 2.88 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Daal, who lost a 1-0 matchup with Denny Neagle last year, foiled
the Braves again Friday night. He kept a lineup that has been
dormant since the 17-hit night Tuesday against the Phillies quiet
for the first six innings, scattering four hits and three walks.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had runners at second and third in the first but
failed to score when Lopez sent a fly ball to shallow center field
for the final out.

INJURIES START TO HIT DUCKS

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Mighty Ducks have been one of the league's
least injured teams this season. They had lost only 89 man games
due to injury coming into Friday's game with San Jose. But center
Steve Rucchin has missed eight of the last nine games with a groin
injury and defenseman Pascal Trepanier is out for the season with a
torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Neither injury was suffered in a game, Rucchin was hurt in
practice on March 20 and Trepanier was injured while playing
basketball on a off-day during the recent road trip.
</P>
<P>
   -- Rucchin was having the best season of his career before
getting hurt -- 23 goals and 61 points in 66 games. But his
comeback attempt in New Jersey on March 31 set him back and now
he's hoping to be ready for next Wednesday's game against St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I lay in bed and want to scream, said Rucchin.
``This is an especially fun time for this team and it's so
frustrating not to play.
</P>
<P>
   Teemu Selanne, who tried to rush back from a thigh injury
earlier this season, cautions that Rucchin must take his time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such important player, he can't rush, he's got to be 100
percent for the playoffs, said Selanne.
</P>
<P>
   Rucchin, who said he ``had to try to play in New Jersey, admits
the game against the Devils set him back. But he insists that ``no
question it will be 100 percent by the playoffs. When I come back
it will be a lot stronger.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   Trepanier, who was acquired in the NHL Waiver Draft just before
the season, had slowly, but surely earned more ice time in Anaheim
coach Craig Hartsburg's seven-defenseman rotation. But he will
undergo surgery next week and will be spectator once the playoffs
roll around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been better that's for sure, said Trepanier, who had two
goals and six points 45 games. ``It's not easy when the fun part
(of the season) is coming up, but it's part of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate, he was starting to be a pretty good player,
said Hartsburg. (The injury) hurts us depth wise, but we have Dan
Trebil, who we feel can play for us.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   Backup goalie Dominic Roussel had to leave the Dallas game on
Wednesday due to back spasms. According to Hartsburg, he won't be
available this weekend, but should be ready for the season's last
three games.
</P>
<P>
   To replace Roussel, the Ducks recalled Patrick Lalime from
Kansas City of the International Hockey League, where he was 36-20
with a 2.99 goals against average.
</P>
<P>
   -- When the Ducks clinched their playoff spot they did so in
their 74th game (a 4-1 victory versus the New York Rangers last
Friday). Anaheim needed 80 to clinch its first playoff spot back in
1996-97.

TOP FUEL DRIVER SETS ELAPSED-TIME MARK
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAYTOWN, Texas _ Larry Dixon says that when he ran the quickest
quarter-mile pass in drag racing history last night, he was driving
while blind.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by a wheelstand that carried the front end of his Top Fuel
dragster in the air for approximately 250 feet, Dixon became the
first driver to crack the 4.50-second barrier during qualifying for
the NHRA's O'Reilly Nationals. Dixon covered the strip at Houston
Raceway Park in 4.486 seconds and 318.54 mph.
</P>
<P>
   His elapsed time eclipsed Mike Dunn's record of 4.503 seconds
set during the National Hot Rod Association's season opener in
Pomona, Calif., in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an awesome pass,'' said Dixon, driver of the Miller
Lite Dragster owned by retired four-time Funny Car champion Don
``The Snake'' Prudhomme. ``Leaving the starting line, it had the
front end up _ higher than I feel comfortable with _ for a long
way. It was a couple of feet off the ground, to where you can't see
down the track. All you see is the car. At that point, you just
have to aim straight.''
</P>
<P>
   NHRA rules require a national record to be backed up by a run
within 1 percent of the provisional record number during the same
meet. Dixon, 32, met that requirement on his first pass at 4.516
seconds, which was a track record.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, eight-time champion John Force lowered the Funny Car
national ET record to 4.798 seconds, one-thousandth of a second
better than he clocked in Gainesville, Fla., last month. Force's ET
was accompanied by a track record speed of 321.88 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Four-time and reigning Pro Stock champion Warren Johnson tops
that qualifying ladder after two rounds at 6.898 seconds and 200.26
mph.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Allen, of Arlington, Texas, who has qualified for only one
of three events this season, is 14th at 6.992 seconds and 197.42
mph.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminations in Pro Stock Truck are scheduled to begin this
morning, with Brad Jeter of Greenville, S.C., the No. 1 qualifier
at 7.995 seconds and 177.91 mph. Both numbers are track records.

COLLINS ADJUSTS TO RASH OF INJURIES
</HEADLINE>

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Tex. _ The Anaheim Angels went into their four-game
series with division rival Texas missing three of their best
players in Mo Vaughn, Jim Edmonds and Gary DiSarcina.
</P>
<P>
   But Rangers manager Johnny Oates wasn't feeling sorry for
anybody. After a reporter mentioned that the Angels also were
banged up when the two teams met at the end of last season, Oates
shot back and reminded the reporter that the Rangers were beaten up
early last season, particularly the pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   They were so beaten up they started Todd Van Poppel and Matt
Perisho in two games against the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know it's going to happen to you at some time during the
year,'' Oates said. ``You just hope it's not severe. A hamstring,
things like that, you can get over. Ligament replacement surgery,
like what Kerry Wood had, that's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Edmonds and Vaughn in his lineup, Angels manager Terry
Collins admits he must manage the offense differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to deal with what you have,'' he said. ``If you
don't have power you make adjustments. The key is to get guys on,
otherwise you can't steal bases or hit-and-run.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of Edmonds and Vaughn also puts more focus on Troy
Glaus and Todd Greene. Glaus has gotten off to a fast start, but
Greene has struggled, so Collins flip-flopped the two in the order
Friday _ Glaus hit sixth and Greene seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had (Greene) protecting Glaus (in the batting order), but
heck, Todd's got only 100 major-league at-bats himself,'' Collins
said. ``We've got to get him to relax. He thinks he's got to
produce runs because Mo's not there.... We've got a couple young
guys in big spots.''
</P>
<P>
   The change worked Friday, as Glaus singled and Greene followed
with a home run in the second inning. Glaus also had a two-run
double.
</P>
<P>
   Abbreviated stint?: Collins said Edmonds (strained groin, cyst
in shoulder) will be ready when he is eligible to come off the
disabled list Wednesday in Oakland. That could mean a short stay
with the big club for Chris Pritchett, who joined the team here
Friday, replacing Vaughn on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   But it's something Pritchett, 29, is used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a player in my situation, especially in the American
League, goes into spring training, there's a slim chance of making
the team every year,'' he said. ``There's really only one spot
available and you really have to do well to even have a chance. So
with guys like me it really isn't a slap in the face because the
odds are stacked so high against you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahead: The Angels and Rangers continue their series tonight in
Arlington. Omar Olivares (9-9, 4.03 ERA in '98) will start for
Anaheim against Texas' Rick Helling (0-1, 15.00).

NORMAN FIGHTS FIELD AND FATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Because this is his Waterloo, Greg Norman was
asked yesterday about The Kingdom He Can't Conquer.
</P>
<P>
   Is it his destiny, someone wanted to know, for Norman to be
eternally frustrated by Augusta?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what my destiny is,'' Norman said, after his
second-round 68 had given him the early second-round lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody asked me the question, `Does this place owe you one?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't believe in things being owed to you. I think you
go out there and play well enough to get them yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the random victim philosophy. At Augusta National Golf Club,
home of the Masters, Norman could be the poster boy for random
victimization. In 18 previous trips here, though he has won 18 PGA
Tour events and won tournaments in 13 countries, Norman has yet to
claim the green jacket.
</P>
<P>
   The crying towel, yes. But other people _ people named Nick and
Larry, to name two _ keep donning Norman's jacket.
</P>
<P>
   When his name burst atop the leader board during yesterday's
second round, mostly on the strength of birdies on the first three
holes, Norman again found himself in the spotlight. The obvious
topic was the shoulder surgery that kept him out of all but three
1998 tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   But Norman also attracts a crowd at Augusta National because he
can't seem to win here. He is the eternal ambulance, waiting to be
chased.
</P>
<P>
   He has finished in the Masters' top 10 on eight occasions. He
lost in 1987 because Larry Mize sank a 140-foot chip shot.
</P>
<P>
   More infamously, he lost to Nick Faldo in 1996 after blowing a
final-day six-stroke lead.
</P>
<P>
   Destiny?
</P>
<P>
   ``Destiny and luck,'' Norman answered, ``go hand in hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Norman meltdown at the '96 Masters has been called the
``greatest Sunday collapse in the history of major championship
golf.'' Look at it another way _ Norman single-handedly changed the
Sunday viewing habits of millions of American TV watchers.
</P>
<P>
   From that 1996 day forward, who dares leave their TV when a
golfer has a mere six-stroke lead?
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the definition of destiny?'' Norman asked. ``The thing
that really sticks in my mind is what happened to Fred Couples \Rin
1992\S when a ball hung up there on the front of No. 12. No other
ball in the entire tournament hung up there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that destiny or a little bit of luck?''
</P>
<P>
   Some of us would say it was the latter. But when foul luck
happens one year, followed by another year, and followed by yet
another year, that smells like a destiny.
</P>
<P>
   In the same year as Norman's Masters meltdown, Bob Tway chipped
in from the bunker to pass Norman and win the PGA Championship.
Norman had the distinction that year of leading all four major golf
championships ... after three rounds. A ``Saturday Slam,'' the golf
literati called it.
</P>
<P>
   Norman got mail after his derailment here in '96. He said the
outpouring of sympathy and public kindness changed his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to see and appreciate other things in life more than
just golf,'' he said. ``You realize that there are other things out
there that can touch you, and '96 did that. It made me appreciate
people in a different way.''
</P>
<P>
   He has no sense of urgency, Norman said. No internal clock ticks
away on his supposedly dwindling Masters chances.
</P>
<P>
   He said he acquired the virtue of perspective during the long
rehab following his shoulder surgery. Norman reminded the media
yesterday that after a final-round 77 in 1993, he had given himself
a seven-year deadline to decide if he still enjoyed playing golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in a big hurry anymore to do too many things,'' Norman
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``Don't get me wrong. I love to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The gallery at Augusta, for what it's worth, showered Norman
with warm applause all day as he shot his 68.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sentimental favorite?'' Norman asked, repeating a question
with a laugh. ``How would you determine that? From '96, or because
I'm getting old?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, someone suggested, the galleries have simply decided that
Greg Norman, at age 44, has suffered enough. He has finished second
three times at Augusta _ with a PGA-record 27 runner-up finishes on
the tour in all.
</P>
<P>
   The Kingdom He Can't Conquer awaits to hear Greg Norman's
destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the Masters owes him all right.
</P>
<P>
   And either way _ siren or no siren _ they watch. Oh, they watch.

EDITORIAL: ACID RAIN'S NATIONAL REACH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, April 10:
</P>
<P>
   When people think of the ravages of acid rain, they tend to
think mainly of dead and dying watersheds in the Northeastern
United States, particularly those in New York's Adirondack
Mountains, where hundreds of highly acidified lakes and streams can
no longer sustain aquatic life. But an exhaustive federal study has
now concluded that acid rain has spread its poisons far and wide,
damaging sensitive watersheds in the Southeastern United States and
in ecologically significant areas of the West like the Sierra
Nevada, the Cascade Range and some parts of the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   These findings are disturbing. But they could also recruit new
allies to the unfinished struggle against acid rain. They could
broaden political support for legislation sponsored by New York's
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan that would reduce the airborne
pollutants _ sulfur and nitrogen _ that create acid rain. They
could also provide further justification for the administration's
efforts to tighten pollution controls on power plants and other
sources of nitrogen oxides.
</P>
<P>
   The study was produced by a federal panel, the National Acidic
Precipitation Assessment Program, established 20 years ago at
Moynihan's urging to study a problem about which little was known.
In 1990 Congress confronted the problem for the first time,
ordering coal-fired utilities and other industries to halve their
emissions of sulfur dioxide, the main cause of acid rain, over the
next decade. Nitrogen was regulated by the 1990 law because it
causes smog, a serious health hazard. But not until the mid-1990s
was nitrogen recognized as a significant contributor to acid rain
as well.
</P>
<P>
   The report shows that emissions of sulfur dioxide have declined
sharply and at relatively low cost, due mainly to the 1990 law and
an innovative financial system under which pollution credits are
traded on the open market. The report also suggests that the law
and subsequent regulations aimed at reducing nitrogen oxides from
power plants should have a positive effect, though the evidence so
far is sketchy.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem is far from solved, and in some areas may be
much worse than anyone thought. If present trends continue, the
report warns, about half the Adirondacks' 2,800 lakes and streams
will be too acidic to support life by the year 2040. The San
Gabriel Mountains near Los Angeles are ``saturated'' with nitrogen,
or close to it _ meaning that excess nitrogen is seeping into
nearby lakes and streams. Watersheds in other Western ecosystems
are similarly afflicted.
</P>
<P>
   The report thus provides a solid argument for Moynihan's bill,
which has two New York Republican sponsors in the House, John
Sweeney and Sherwood Boehlert, but few signatures in either the
House or Senate. The bill would provide for a further 50 percent
cut in sulfur emissions beyond those mandated by the 1990
amendments _ resulting in a 75 percent cut from 1990 levels by
2005. It would also require cuts of 70 percent in nitrogen oxides
from power plants by 2005, and establish an emissions trading
system similar to the successful sulfur dioxide scheme.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 law focused mainly on Midwestern power plants, but the
Moynihan bill would cover plants nationwide, and would therefore
not put utilities in any single region at a competitive
disadvantage. The national scope of the bill should also appeal to
Congressmen who until now had believed that acid rain was a local
problem, of interest only to Northeastern environmentalists. The
new federal report says it is nothing of the sort.

(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, April 10:
</P>
<P>
   Just about everyone on Capitol Hill professes interest in
producing legislation that protects patients from unfair health
insurance practices. But the prospect of actually passing
meaningful protections, as opposed to talking about it, is
uncertain. President Clinton tried to whip up support for
Democratic proposals Friday, but the Republicans are balking at
Democratic plans as too burdensome on the managed-care industry.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is the Democratic proposals that more fully reflect the
recommendations of a presidential advisory commission to improve
health plan quality. The Senate Republican bill, S. 326, sponsored
by James Jeffords of Vermont, is too limited to accomplish that
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which was approved by the Senate Health, Education,
Labor and Pensions Committee on a straight party-line vote of 10 to
8, contains some consumer protections. It includes provisions that
require health plans to pay for emergency-room care if a prudent
person has reason to believe an emergency exists, allow patients to
go directly to gynecologists and pediatricians, and safeguard
medical privacy. But it is unacceptable because most of its
provisions would apply only to 48 million individuals covered by
plans in which large employers act as their own insurers, leaving
110 million people in other plans unprotected.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would grant appeal rights to an additional 75 million
privately insured individuals, but those rights would be quite
restrictive. Appeals to an external reviewer would be allowed only
when an insurer refused to pay for a procedure on the grounds that
it was not medically necessary or was experimental.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say this would give health plans power to limit appeals
by simply asserting that a denial is not based on medical
necessity. It would exclude appeals where a plan unilaterally
decided that the benefit was not covered under the contract, even
if medical judgment was involved in that contract interpretation.
The external reviewer may also be bound by the plan's own
definition of medical necessity, however narrow it may be.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bill does not adequately insure access to
specialty care by allowing a patient to see an out-of-network
specialist if the plan has an insufficient number of specialists
available. Unlike the Democratic plan, it does not amend the
Federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act to give enrollees
the right to sue health plans provided through employers for
injuries caused by improper denials of care. Current law allows for
no meaningful recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Senate Democratic proposal, which has White House
support, and a bipartisan bill sponsored by Senators John Chafee,
Joseph Lieberman, Bob Graham, Arlen Specter and Max Baucus would be
substantially stronger in allowing external review of coverage
disputes, in defining ``medical necessity,'' and in giving
enrollees greater rights to take health plans to court.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance lobby is already embarked on a media blitz to
defeat any new regulations as too costly. But consumer protections
under the Democratic plan would increase health plan costs by only
a tolerable 2.8 percent, according to Congressional Budget Office
estimates made last year, or slightly more if lawsuits against
Erisa plans are permitted in state court. Health plans should be
made to deliver what they promise their enrollees, and held
accountable when they fail.

EDITORIAL: HOW THE MASTERS LOOKS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, April 10:
</P>
<P>
   In the venerable world of golf, the Masters Tournament at the
Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Ga., is a relative newcomer
among major tournaments. The first Masters was held in 1934; the
first green jacket _ awarded to the winner _ was presented in 1949,
and the first telecast of the Masters appeared in 1956. You would
never guess that from the coverage. Tradition has accrued to the
Masters at a rate that is nearly unfathomable, and nothing chokes
up a network sportscaster like tradition. The azaleas bloom, the
pine-straw in the rough enforces a deep hush, and nowhere on earth
is the subject of grass discussed so thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   As David Owen demonstrates in his insightful new book, ``The
Making of the Masters,'' the Masters tradition is not an exercise
in nostalgia. It is the result of restless, often brilliant
innovation by two men, Bobby Jones, the golf legend who died in
1971, and especially Clifford Roberts, a complex perfectionist who
was the first chairman of Augusta National Golf Club, which he and
Jones built.
</P>
<P>
   For Roberts, who died in 1977, the question was never how to
create tradition. It was how to make each year's tournament better
than the last. He and Jones had precise, inflexible ideas about the
game of golf _ but Roberts' ideas about the tournament were
anything but inflexible.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of race, for example, the club itself was
segregated until 1991, and Owen says it ``was certainly part of the
culture that for decades made golf virtually unapproachable for
black players.'' But the Masters admitted without hesitation the
first black player to qualify _ Lee Elder in 1975 _ and Elder
himself testified to the warmth of his reception.
</P>
<P>
   The innovation behind the Masters became apparent in Clifford
Roberts' negotiations with CBS. Roberts pressed for the use of more
cameras, the coverage of more holes, the introduction of color
broadcasts and many other less visible technical improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, he insisted that advertising be kept to a minimum,
and in his negotiations he always argued that the quality of golf
and of the telecast itself took precedence over money. What Roberts
clearly foresaw was the feedback loop that has come to govern
modern televised sports _ a high price for broadcast rights means
more commercials and fewer minutes of coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The Masters is still broadcast by CBS the way Roberts wanted it,
with tight restrictions on advertising and a sense of time that is
nearly as generous as Augusta's fairways. There are many reasons to
watch this tournament, but for those of us unable to join the
greenside galleries at Augusta, the best reason is to see what
televised sports should really look like, when money is not the
only object.

CALCAVECCHIA'S ALL WRONG ABOUT ARNIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ If Mark Calcavecchia weren't making
!ital!beaucoup!off! bucks as a professional golfer, we'd point him
toward Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   He'd fit in perfectly, given that he looks at the world the same
way as today's television and studio executives. You know, the ones
who regard as obsolete anybody old enough to have developed any
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   We'll leave the question of when life begins to the people on
either side of the abortion issue. As for when a person is dead, we
can answer that for Hollywood and Calcavecchia:
</P>
<P>
   Just look at the spate of movies, magazines and television shows
directed toward a teen and twentysomething audience.
</P>
<P>
   And listen to Calcavecchia, who can't figure out why it is
69-year-old Arnold Palmer is allowed to keep bringing his clubs to
the Masters. If you ask him, the king of modern golf can't read the
bottom line any better than he can all those par putts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Arnie to death,'' Calcavecchia said Thursday. ``But
it's time for him to surrender. He still loves to play golf. But
there's no point being out there if you shoot 83-84.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer did open his 45th Masters with an 11-over-par 83, that
much is fact. It's just too bad Calcavecchia's perspective is
narrower than the tightest fairway he'll ever face. Otherwise the
38-year-old surely would be able to see it's wholly immaterial that
he has a better chance of winning his first green jacket than
Palmer does his fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer didn't invent golf, he merely carved a colossal following
out of next-to-nothing. When he came along in the late 1950s,
professional golfers, far from being deified, were generally viewed
with disdain or, at best, indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Television introduced golf to the middle class and Palmer made
it look really cool. Corporate America took note and Arnie's Army
took root.
</P>
<P>
   The results were far-reaching. The British Open had been taking
place since 1860, but it had faded in popularity until Palmer
crossed the Atlantic and won back-to-back Open titles in 1961 and
1962.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, another swashbuckling American would bring the British
Open to his knees. It was the first and _ thus far _ only major
title for Calcavecchia, who has Palmer largely to thank for all
those pounds he collected along with the winner's crystal.
</P>
<P>
   Calcavecchia can't seem to make the connection. Not so the
crowds here. The spectators collaring the 18th green rose and gave
Palmer a rousing ovation Friday. Then he stepped up and drained his
birdie putt for a 78, setting off the sweetest chorus this side of
Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church choir.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can look in the gallery,'' Palmer quipped, his eyes dancing,
``and if I don't know everybody there, I'm disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer's disappointment was real when he was told of
Calcavecchia's comments. His face fell and he stammered, ``Well,
that's his opinion. He's welcome to it.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later Calcavecchia came into view and the fans at
the 18th green greeted him with polite applause. What more proof
does Calcavecchia need before he concedes the crowds aren't coming
because of him?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, sure as mis-hits happen on the golf course, good
people sometimes mis-speak off it (just ask Fuzzy Zoeller). So we
caught up with Calcavecchia after his second-round 77 to see if his
tune had changed.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it was the same, right down to the inelegant pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually you've got to kind of end it,'' he said, speaking
of one of the most storied careers in golf. ``It's just, what was
his low round on the Senior Tour last year, a 71?''
</P>
<P>
   There it is, that bottom-line myopia again. In the silence that
followed we could almost hear a Hollywood suit saying, ``It's just,
what's the average age of a moviegoer, 18?''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Calcavecchia, some golfers get it. Jay Haas, for one,
sees no reason why Palmer's status should be downgraded to a
nonparticipating invitee anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's pretty neat that Arnie's still able to
play,'' Haas said. ``I think (champions from earlier eras) are a
great addition to the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer might not be able to shoot a 32 on the front nine, as did
Haas on Friday, but he can play some. Why, his score on the front
nine _ a 1-over-par 37 _ was better than that of a lot of golfers
Friday, including two-time Masters champion Seve Ballesteros, 1995
winner Ben Crenshaw, 1979 champion Zoeller, Ernie Els.
</P>
<P>
   And oh, yeah, Calcavecchia, who shot a 39 on the front side and
finished the day with a 77.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't taken any flak yet,'' Calcavecchia said snidely. ``I
need some flak. Flak's good for me.''
</P>
<P>
   A little grace would be even better.
</P>

DUKE &AMP; CO. BROKER PLEAS GUILTY IN CASE INVOLVING NEW ISSUES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Calif., Utah, Conn., Ill.)   By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As part of an investigation into corrupt activities
in the securities industry, the Manhattan district attorney, Robert
M. Morgenthau, said Friday that a former stockbroker at Duke &AMP; Co.,
a defunct New York brokerage firm, had pleaded guilty to attempted
enterprise corruption. The broker, Pasquale D'Onofrio, who is known
as John, will be sentenced on Oct. 21 and faces up to 15 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   D'Onofrio, 25, was charged with participating in a scheme in
which Duke conspired with other brokerage firms to maintain the
price of initial public offerings at artificially high levels. The
offerings that were sold to unsuspecting customers, according to
Morgenthau, included the Renaissance Entertainment Corp., Sel-Leb
Marketing Inc., Paravant Computer Systems, Bristol Technology
Systems Inc., and IFS International Inc. The stocks eventually
collapsed when buyers for them dried up. Of the five companies,
only one has shares that still trade: Paravant Computer, which
closed Friday at $2.3125.
</P>
<P>
   Duke &AMP; Co., which went out of business in March 1998, had two
offices, one in midtown Manhattan and another on Long Island. The
brokerage firm had come under scrutiny by state securities
regulators in late 1996 when officials from 20 states _ including
Alabama, California, Utah, Connecticut and Illinois _ began a
nationwide crackdown on fraudulent brokerage firms using hard-sell
tactics to peddle obscure, over-the-counter stocks. Duke was the
subject of 26 regulatory actions before it went out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau said his office began its investigation into Duke in
the summer of 1997, and he called the guilty plea, ``a significant
step in this continuing investigation.'' He expects to get guilty
pleas from others in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   While law enforcement officials are not yet able to tally
investors' losses in the Duke failure, Morgenthau said that $171
million had been invested through the company. Two weeks ago, the
Securities Investor Protection Corp., the industry-financed agency
that insures individuals' brokerage firm accounts, appointed
Elizabeth Page Smith, a lawyer at LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene &AMP; MacRae in
New York, to oversee the liquidation of any assets that might
remain at Duke. The firm had about 34,000 customer accounts when it
closed.
</P>
<P>
   According to law enforcement officials, Duke brokers would
entice investors into stocks that the firm was underwriting,
promising them fast profits. But when customers sought to sell
their holdings, the brokers prevented them from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Duke was the creation of Victor Wang, a former broker and
executive at Stratton Oakmont, a Long Island brokerage firm that
was the subject of numerous regulatory actions before it was
expelled by the industry's own regulators in late 1996. Prosecutors
said that the firms, besides Duke, that were part of the conspiracy
to manipulate initial public offerings were First Cambridge
Securities and Bishop Allen &AMP; Co. Both are defunct.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Manhattan district attorney, Ray Newton, 48, of
Andalusia, Ala., invested $350,000 with Duke, money he had received
as a settlement from an accident in which he broke his back.
Newton's funds were put into speculative stocks by D'Onofrio even
though he had told the broker that he and his wife had a joint
income of $21,000 a year. As a result of losing his investment,
Newton lost his home and a small business he had owned.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas L. Krebs, a lawyer at Ritchie &AMP; Rediker in Birmingham,
Ala., represented Newton. Krebs, who was Securities Commissioner of
Alabama from 1975 to 1981, said: ``I've been in the securities
industry since 1973, and I've never seen anything this bad. These
guys were totally out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Beauchamp, spokesman for the North American Securities
Administrators Association Inc., said: ``This is a good example of
how state securities regulators and law enforcement agencies can
work together to prosecute fraud and protect investors. With half
of U.S. households now invested in the stock market, we need to do
more cases like this.''

HELEN A. MAYER, DUMBO'S CREATOR, DIES AT 91  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Helen Aberson Mayer, who wrote the children's story
that inspired the 1941 Walt Disney cartoon, ``Dumbo,'' died last
Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Aberson, as she was known when she wrote the tale, was
born in Syracuse and received a bachelor's degree in 1929 from
Syracuse University. In the 1930s she was the host of a Syracuse
talk-radio program and later did clerical work in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   After conceiving Dumbo and other vivid animal characters, she
returned to Syracuse and wrote ``Dumbo, the Flying Elephant.''
Asked how she came to write it, her son, Andrew, said: ``She just
got an inspiration about a flying elephant.'' He said she liked to
create animal characters and plotting that represented, to a
degree, people she knew or situations she had been in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there is trial and travail'' for Dumbo in the story,
Mayer added, ``but he persevered, and in the long run he was
successful.'' In the story, Dumbo the baby elephant is at first
mocked because of his oversize ears but he becomes a circus star
when he realizes that they allow him to fly. Mayer said that to
some degree the story represented his mother's struggles. ``At
times her life was difficult,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Pearl illustrated the story, Mayer said, and the two were
listed as its co-authors when it was published in 1939 by a company
called Roll-a-Book.
</P>
<P>
   The story, as it is remembered by Joe Grant, who worked with
Disney, was published in a distinctive format. Grant was one of the
two Disney ``story men'' who adapted it for the screen. Miss
Aberson's story and about a dozen illustrations appeared on a
small, short scroll that was built into a box, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Grant said he remembered seeing only one ``Dumbo''
box-and-scroll, the one that was used in making the movie. ``It was
sort of a little novelty idea,'' he said. ``As you rolled the
little wheels on top, the pictures would appear like they would in
a film.''
</P>
<P>
   The author's family said Roll-a-Book published the story as a
regular book in one printing of no more than a thousand copies.
They said they had never heard about the box-and-scroll version.
</P>
<P>
   It must have been soon after the story came out that Walt Disney
bought rights to it, said Dave Smith, archives director for the
Walt Disney Co., in Burbank, Calif. Asked why Walt Disney decided
to make a movie from the story, Smith said he had recently finished
``Pinocchio'' (1940), which was ``kind of a dark story, and I'm
sure he was looking for something a little more upbeat for his next
film.''
</P>
<P>
   The Disney movie makers had stuck to the story's basic plot
line, while adding much more detail, Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayer said the Disney people asked his mother to go to
California in 1939. ``She was out there until 1941,'' he said.
``She was on the premises and they were consulting her.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the Disney archivist, said he could find no record of
Miss Aberson's having been an employee of the company, but that she
might have worked for it nonetheless. Grant said he thought he
remembered meeting her and seeing her looking at preliminary
drawings for the film. When ``Dumbo'' was released in October 1941,
The New York Times critic Bosley Crowther called it ``a picture
which touches the very heart of sentiment'' and added, ``It may not
be the most impressive feature that Disney has turned out, but it
certainly is the most winsome, and it is the one that leaves you
with the warmest glow.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Aberson's husband, Richard, recalled that after Disney
bought the rights to her story, it was republished in book form, at
least once, almost exactly as she had written it. Her son said she
kept on writing children's stories into the 1960s, but that he knew
of no others that were published.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her son, of Staten Island, and her husband, she is
survived by a grandson.

OLAZABAL'S SAVVY PROPELS HIM INTO THE LEAD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ It was a day for Jose Maria Olazabal to display
his talent on a worldwide stage.
</P>
<P>
   He showed the diverse shot-making skill of a player who has won
tournaments round the globe. He showed the wisdom and poise of a
former Masters champion. He showed the passion of a player whose
career was threatened by injury, a man thankful to have his health,
and his game.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a blistering, bogey-free, six-under-par 66, including a
32 on the back nine, Olazabal left Augusta National Golf Club
holding a one-stroke lead over Scott McCarron heading into
Saturday's third round of the Masters. Olazabal stood at eight
under par (136, 70-66), one stroke better than McCarron (137), an
unexpected contender who followed Thursday's 69 with a 68 Friday.
But while Olazabal put himself in prime position for the weekend,
his journey is only half over.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Janzen, a two-time U. S. Open winner, and Greg Norman, a
two-time British Open champion, are tied for third place at five
under par, followed by Davis Love III and Nick Price at three under
par. Six players are tied at two under _ Steve Elkington, Bernhard
Langer, Justin Leonard, Brandel Chamblee, Bill Glasson and Colin
Montgomerie.
</P>
<P>
   With so much golf left, there were so many possibilities. Can
Norman, clearly the sentimental favorite, finally triumph in a
tournament that has haunted him and humbled him, most recently in
1996, when he lost a six-stroke lead to Nick Faldo in the final
round? Will Janzen, underrated by many despite winning two U. S.
Opens, add another major to his collection? Can either Tiger Woods
(even par), or David Duval (one over), mount a weekend charge, or
will the world's top two players be disappointed in the year's
first major?
</P>
<P>
   Those questions will be answered this weekend. Olazabal, who won
the Masters in 1994, knew enough not to celebrate yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are two more days to go, tough days,'' said
Olazabal, a 33-year-old Spaniard, who has finished no worse than
14th in his last five Masters. ``It's a wide-open golf tournament.
We've seen many, many things happen on this golf course. Experience
is very important. And because I won here in '94, that makes me
feel a little bit better than the players who haven't won.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a nerve problem in Olazabal's lower back caused
excruciating pain in his feet, so severe that by the summer of
1996, he could no longer walk. There were days when he literally
crawled to the bathroom, and in those dark moments, he cried in
solitude, fearing his career was over.
</P>
<P>
   A German doctor finally detected the cause of Olazabal's
problem, and the pain subsided with therapy and back injections. By
1997, Olazabal had returned to golf full time.
</P>
<P>
   On No. 16, he saved par with a brilliant chip shot from behind
the green, 30 feet from the pin, severely downhill. A poorly hit
ball could have rolled off the green and into the water, but
Olazabal delicately rolled the ball to within two feet for a
tap-in. At No. 13, he holed a wedge shot from 18 feet for birdie.
At the par-5 15th, he boldly hit a 1-iron approach shot, then hit
another superb chip shot from 35 feet to within a foot for an easy
birdie. And he capped the day with a birdie at No. 18, hitting a
9-iron approach shot to 10 feet, then making the putt.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Olazabal received the kind of luck that good
players get on Thursday, when a poorly hit 4-iron took a lucky
bounce over the creek at No. 13 that runs in front of the green.
The ball finally stopped 20-feet from the pin, and Olazabal
capitalized by making the putt for eagle, the only eagle at No. 13
in two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you have to have good breaks,'' Olazabal said. ``It
was a good break. I haven't had too many in my life, so I'll take
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McCarron made his own breaks, becoming the only
player with two rounds in the 60's. A 33-year-old native of
California, McCarron has not won on the PGA Tour since 1997, but he
has a history of playing well at Augusta, including a tie for 16th
last year. Many people expected McCarron to fade Saturday, and some
still expect the pressure to get the better of McCarron on
Saturday. But he thinks otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider myself a lesser known,'' McCarron, a long
hitter who had six birdies and only two bogeys, said today. ``I
finished 10th at the U.S. Open. I finished 16th at Augusta. When
I'm playing with Norman or Fred Couples, I feel I'm as good as
them. If you don't, you don't belong out here.''
</P>
<P>
   So McCarron found himself much higher on the leader board than
either Woods or Duval, the two players focused on before the
tournament. Both players have been hurt badly by big numbers. Woods
had a double-bogey at the par-3 No. 12, hitting an 8-iron tee shot
into Rae's Creek, after a gust of wind held up his ball. ``Eight
shots back still isn't that bad,'' Woods said after he birdied No.
18 to finish with his second consecutive 72. ``I just have to play
solid golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval, who shot a 74 Friday, had a triple-bogey at No. 15,
hitting his third shot into the water. After the drop and penalty
stroke, Duval's next shot sailed over the green, from where he
chipped and two-putted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little discouraged right now, no question,'' said Duval,
the world's top-ranked player, who has four victories this year.
``This is a place where mistakes can hurt you, and I've made
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   CHIP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson (151), Mark Calcavecchia (152), Paul Azinger (153),
Nick Faldo (153), Hal Sutton (155) and Steve Jones (156) all missed
the 148 cut. &QL;

WOMEN PETITION TO GET EQUAL PRIZE MONEY AT GRAND SLAM TOURNAMENTS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By NEIL AMDUR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1970, a group of female tennis players, frustrated by the
disparity in tournament prize money with their male counterparts,
formed the first women's professional tour. Last week, another
group of female pros signed a petition authorizing the WTA Tour to
demand equal prize money with the men at all four Grand Slam
championships.
</P>
<P>
   If the organizers of the Australian Open, French Open and
Wimbledon fail to embrace the equal prize-money principle by next
year, the women say they are prepared to vote to boycott these
tournaments. The U.S. Open offers equal prize money for men and
women.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 60 female players signed the petition during the
Family Circle Cup tournament last week in Hilton Head Island, S.C.,
including such top 10 pros as Martina Hingis, Lindsay Davenport,
Jana Novotna and Monica Seles. More players are expected to sign
the petition when the tour moves to Europe next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a top priority,'' said Bart McGuire, the chief
executive officer of the WTA Tour, who has been authorized by the
players to meet with officials of the Grand Slam tournaments. ``I
think it's important for the Slams to know that it's not just
administrators running around saying we deserve equitable
treatment. The players feel very strongly about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the French Open increased the women's purse to 90
percent of the men's. Wimbledon, which offered the women 80 percent
last year, is expected to announce its prize-money breakdown for
this year's tournament later this month. The women received 94
percent at the 1999 Australian Open in January.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments for paying the men more have been their playing
three-of-five-set singles matches (the women play two-of-three-set
matches), having more depth on their tour and being more in demand.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, when asked about the question of equal pay for
the women at Wimbledon, John Curry, the chairman of the tournament,
told The London Daily Telegraph: ``It is an incredibly emotional
subject. The women walk through the gates, see the men and say,
`Why should he get more than me?' It's like a heavyweight and a
middleweight in boxing. They might be on the same bill, but no
matter how good the middleweight is, the heavyweight gets paid
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in Europe. But in the United States, with the excitement
generated by Hingis, Davenport, Venus and Serena Williams and
others, the women are outdrawing the men in coverage by the news
media, television ratings and spectator interest. HBO may devote as
much as 70 percent of its Wimbledon coverage this year to the
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a cliff after Sampras and Agassi,'' Ross Greenburg,
the senior vice president and executive producer of HBO's Wimbledon
coverage, said of Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi and Americans'
interest in the men's tour.
</P>
<P>
   Although the women are still searching for a title sponsor for
their tour, they say they are united on the question of equal prize
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need that guarantee very soon,'' said Nicole Pratt, an
Australian player who helped organize the petition and told McGuire
she could produce 200 more signatures if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise there will have to be some action taken,'' Pratt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how soon the women would move on a boycott, McGuire said:
``I'm not going to go there now. I'm working to persuade the Grand
Slams to do the right thing.''

LONG ISLAND POLICE OFFICIAL CLAIMS RELIGIOUS DISCRIMINATION
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAUPPAUGE, N.Y. _ A high-ranking Suffolk County police official
has filed a federal civil rights suit against the county and its
police commissioner, charging them with denying him promotion to
inspector because he is Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Deputy Inspector Howard E. Mandell, a 30-year
member of the department who worked his way up through the ranks,
says in the lawsuit that promotions have also been withheld because
he has spoken out publicly against police practices, including what
he says is bigotry in the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's regarded as a whistle-blower, and has been treated
adversely as a result,'' said Mandell's lawyer, Alan Polsky . He
said his client was not available to comment on the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Polsky filed the complaint against the county and Commissioner
John C. Gallagher on March 11 in U.S. District Court here, asking
that the Police Department be ordered to promote Mandell to
inspector, and pay him back wages and fringe benefits for that
rank, as well as compensatory and punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   William Burke, the chief deputy county attorney, said Friday
that the county planned to ``vigorously oppose'' the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plaintiff is one of the highest-ranking police officers in
the department, and that by itself pretty much speaks to whether
his claim is meritorious,'' Burke said. ``This is not a patrolman,
a sergeant, a lieutenant or even a captain. He's right up there in
the top echelon in a department with 2,700 officers.''
</P>
<P>
   As deputy inspector, Mandell, who makes $110,000 a year,
commands the department's Staff Services Bureau. The only higher
appointive ranks are inspector, deputy chief and chief.
</P>
<P>
   In his lawsuit, Mandell said that almost from the time he joined
the department in 1969, he has been subject to many ethnic insults,
including being referred to as ``that Jew'' and ``Jew boy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These biased remarks were made by police officers with ranks
as high as inspector, have been pervasive throughout the
plaintiff's employment and created a hostile environment for the
plaintiff to work in, which persists to this day,'' the complaint
says.
</P>
<P>
   It also claims that Gallagher has begun speeches at division
meetings at which Mandell has been present by stating, ``We are all
good Christians.'' Under the commissioner, it says, the department
also holds Ash Wednesday religious services each year at its
headquarters in Yaphank.
</P>
<P>
   ``These circumstances have created an atmosphere within the
Police Department that is decidedly pro-Christian and is
necessarily anti-Jewish,'' the complaint says. ``The department is
and has been traditionally dominated by a clique that is
predominantly Irish Catholic, and this tradition has been continued
by defendant Gallagher.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher would not comment on Mandell's suit, a spokesman said,
because it is before the courts.
</P>
<P>
   But Deputy Commissioner James M. Abbott said, ``From the time
Gallagher was appointed in January 1997, he informed his chiefs
that he would not tolerate any expressions of racism or any jokes
or humor based on race or ethnicity.''
</P>
<P>
   The department has been the subject of past discrimination
complaints. In 1996, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission cited ``a pattern of discrimination'' against black,
Hispanic and female officers that included the denial of
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Polsky acknowledged that his client had received many
promotions, but he said that they were based on objective criteria,
like length of service, and that the only discretionary promotion
Mandell received was to his current rank, made in 1989 by the
police commissioner at the time, Daniel Guido.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before Bob Sheppard could complete the introduction
of Friday's special guest, the fans stood among the raindrops and
screamed. More than 56,000 pairs of eyes gazed toward the Yankee
dugout, looking for the beloved man who had come back home to
Yankee Stadium. They were searching for Yogi Berra.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, after Sheppard called the 73-year-old Berra ``a man
of conviction,'' Berra ended 14 years of self-imposed exile from
the Stadium. Berra walked in front of the mound, shook hands with
David Cone and lofted a high and inside pitch to Joe Girardi.
Finally, Berra was back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little nervous out there,'' Berra said. ``It was like
any opening day. I don't care how long you've played. You're always
a little nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   An awed Cone said: ``To see Yogi walk out there and get the
ovation he got after all these years was tremendous. It was one of
the loudest ovations I've heard at Yankee Stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Berra sat in George Steinbrenner's private box during the game,
three months after he received an apology from the owner who had
dismissed him 16 games into the 1985 season. Since that peace
meeting, Berra and Steinbrenner may feel as if they are on tour
together. Friday was at least the third time they have appeared
warm and fuzzy in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt great after 14 years,'' said Berra, who predicted
Chili Davis' grand slam from the television booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always a Yankees fan. I always watched them on TV. I
think they have a good team this year. I think they can win it
again this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Famers Whitey Ford and Phil Rizzuto raised the 1998
championship flag, but Berra, another Hall of Famer, was the
marquee attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been asking him for 14 years,'' Ford said. ``I don't care
what you think of Steinbrenner. The people really miss you. It's
nice to have him back.''
</P>
<P>
   For Berra, it was nice to finally be back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy,'' he said. ``I'm glad it's over.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky. _ Three weeks before the Kentucky Derby, the
people who invested their time, money and passion in Menifee were
standing at the crossroads of his career.
</P>
<P>
   It was one day before the Blue Grass Stakes, the final and most
important prep race in the East. The man who trains the colt,
Elliott Walden, reflecting the team's sense of the moment and its
anxiety, said, ``The next race will tell us what we've got.''
</P>
<P>
   What they have got is a promising bay colt who cost $37,000 when
they bought him at Keeneland two years ago and now costs $35,000 a
year to keep him trained and sound. Menifee won his first two races
last summer and even defeated Cat Thief and Lemon Drop Kid, two of
his rivals in the Blue Grass on Saturday. Then he took six months
off to heal a chip in his right knee, won his comeback race at
Gulfstream Park in February but missed by less than a length in the
Tampa Bay Derby in March. Now, Menifee is back home in Kentucky to
test his talent in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Can he handle Cat Thief, Vicar, Wondertross and the rest of
those heavy hitters? Can he even handle Pineaff, who upset him in
Tampa? Can he handle anybody at a mile and an eighth?
</P>
<P>
   The linemaker at Keeneland was still rating them in fractions:
Wondertross as the 5-2 favorite, followed by Vicar at 3-1, Cat
Thief and Menifee at 4-1 and Lemon Drop Kid at 9-2.
</P>
<P>
   It may be brinksmanship to stake all that investment on the way
one race is run, but 3-year-old horses have one shot at glory: the
Kentucky Derby. The road to the Derby winds through Keeneland,
where the 75th Blue Grass has drawn a field of eight horses with
talent and eight owners with ambition to match their investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He costs about as much as it costs to run my airplane for a
while,'' said Jimmy Stone, the Louisiana oil and gas executive who
owns Menifee with the colt's breeder, Arthur Hancock IIIof nearby
Paris, Ky. ``I've never had a horse in the Derby. But I won the
Ascot Gold Cup twice and lost the Arc de Triomphe by a nose.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone's partner, the elder son of the legendary Bull Hancock of
Claiborne Farm, has won the Kentucky Derby twice: with Gato del Sol
in 1982 (he ran second in that year's Blue Grass) and Sunday
Silence in 1989. But Hancock frets about everything from the
weather to the draw for post position. He finds omens in many
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd prefer an inside post,'' Hancock said before the Blue
Grass draw. ``In the Tampa Bay Derby, we drew on the outside and
got parked there. On the inside, we'd have choices, whether to go
straight ahead or tuck back.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Tampa, he broke wide. He got behind horses. He went way
wide on the second turn. Yet, he finished less than a length
behind. I figure he lost five lengths in all that running. The
track was deep and it was his first time around two turns. You
know, he didn't do so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days ago, Hancock and his wife, Staci, and Walden sat in the
Keeneland sales pavilion watching the draw for post positions for
the Blue Grass. Menifee drew the No. 8 slot on the far outside. So
much for the omens.
</P>
<P>
   Walden is no stranger to Triple Crown adventures. Last year he
trained Victory Gallop, who ran second to Real Quiet in the
Kentucky Derby and the Preakness before finally nailing him in the
last strides in the Belmont Stakes.  &QL;

NYC POLICE COMMISSIONER DEFENDS INQUIRY AFTER WIFE'S TRAFFIC
ACCIDENT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard
Safir Friday defended the commissioner's decision to send two
detectives to the home of a Queens woman who was involved in a
minor car accident with Safir's wife, saying the visit was an
appropriate inquiry into a potential security risk.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said the circumstances surrounding the accident two years
ago had concerned him, given the threats that he routinely receives
as the city's top law-enforcement official. The woman, Monica B.
Nascimento, rear-ended his wife's car on the Queensboro Bridge, he
said, and then gave a false name before leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to determine why somebody who ran into the back of
my wife, the police commissioner's wife _ whether it was a security
problem,'' Safir said at a hastily called news conference Friday
afternoon. ``There was a determination by my detail to follow up
and see who this person was.''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner's explanation, which came a day after he and
his aides refused to confirm the detectives' visit, seemed to
satisfy Giuliani, who said, ``I would be surprised if the Police
Department did not follow up on that for questions of security.''
</P>
<P>
   But it did not mollify City Councilman Sheldon Leffler, the
chairman of the Council's public safety committee, who said the
accident was a personal matter and did not warrant the involvement
of police detectives.
</P>
<P>
   In defending his actions, Safir also acknowledged that he had
left a message on Ms. Nascimento's answering machine, and then had
spoken to her on the telephone _ but as a husband, he emphasized,
not as the police commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm OK if I do things as a husband, aren't I?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The testiness of that remark reflects the aura of embattlement
that now envelops Safir. In recent weeks he has been criticized for
leaving the city shortly after four white officers shot and killed
Amadou Diallo, an unarmed black immigrant, in the Bronx two months
ago, and then for attending the Academy Awards in Los Angeles last
month just as the outcry over the Diallo shooting was reaching a
crescendo.
</P>
<P>
   His California trip has also spurred a conflict-of-interest
inquiry because it was paid for by George Fellows, the president of
Revlon, whom Safir describes as a longtime friend with no business
ties to the city. But Revlon's parent company, MacAndrews &AMP; Forbes,
participates in a city-sponsored program that enables it to hire
off-duty police officers, in uniform, to provide nighttime security
at its offices.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Safir has shaken off a call for his resignation
from Public Advocate Mark Green, and has received the unqualified
endorsement of Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Then, this week, Safir and his wife, Carol, filed a $1.25
million civil suit against Ms. Nascimento, alleging that Mrs.
Safir's injuries from the accident have required ongoing physical
therapy, and that the accident had deprived Safir of his wife's
``companionship and consortium.''

IRA J. HECHLER, FINANCIER KNOWN FOR CORPORATE BUYOUTS, DIES AT 80  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ira J. Hechler, a financier and private investor
known for friendly corporate buyouts in the 1980s, when hostile
takeovers dominated the corporate landscape, died last Sunday at
New York Hospital of complications resulting from a heart attack, a
family representative said. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   During his career, Hechler was involved in the acquisition of
more than 25 companies, including U.S. Banknote, the Leslie Fay
Cos., Big Bear Stores and the book publishers New American Library
and E.P. Dutton.
</P>
<P>
   After serving in World War II, Hechler worked in a series of
jobs with mortgage and real estate investment companies, at times
in partnership with major investment banks, including Oppenheimer &AMP;
Co., Merrill Lynch, Bankers Trust and Manufacturers Hanover. He had
been a partner in LHW Enterprises, a private investment firm, and
established his own company, Ira J. Hechler &AMP; Associates, in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   While working with Oppenheimer in 1979, Hechler was accused by
the Securities and Exchange Commission of illegal insider trading.
He settled the matter, agreeing to give back $145,260 to
shareholders of the company, although he contended he had done
nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his deals were very successful. After doing a leveraged
buyout of the Leslie Fay Co., a women's apparel maker, for $55
million in 1982, Hechler resold the company two years later for
$178 million. His profit was reported to be about $15 million, but
Leslie Fay's president, John Pomerantz, and two other senior
managers saw a $250,000 investment turn into $66 million in cash
and notes.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Hechler was known for using an investment strategy
called a net operating loss buyout. He used companies with large
losses to help shelter the earnings of profitable companies. The
practice eventually became known as a leveraged buyout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a fabulous sense of knowing what to do _ the critical
moment,'' said Howard Weingrow, a former partner. ``He really loved
to close the deal'' and then seek another investment opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would sit around and talk about a deal, and Ira would sit
there with his eyes closed; you thought that he was asleep,''
Weingrow said. ``But at a critical juncture he'd wake up and come
up with some brilliant idea that would help us close the deal. To
this day, I don't know if he was asleep, but apparently he
wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Hechler was also known as a patron of the arts, particularly
ballet and off-Broadway theater. He was a longtime patron of the
New York City Ballet and the Roundabout Theater. But Hechler's
philanthropy to institutions and individuals was often anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his financial support, Hechler and his wife,
Marilyn, enjoyed attending the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would go out practically every night to the theater if
they could,'' said Susan Mark, who was Hechler's secretary for
almost 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Hechler and his wife recently began sponsoring concerts at the
Tilles Center for the Performing Arts at C.W. Post College in
Greenvale, N.Y., often inviting as many as 40 friends to attend
with them. In February, they sponsored a concert by the Moscow
Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   Hechler was born in the Bronx in 1918 to parents who had
emigrated from Eastern Europe. His father was a watchmaker who
later became a real estate investor, and his mother was the
daughter of a rabbi. He graduated from City College in 1939 and
earned a master's degree in business administration from Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his wealth, estimated to be about $100 million, Hechler
lived modestly in Roslyn Heights, N.Y., in a house he bought for
$25,750 in 1954 with a G.I. mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Hechler also liked to travel. ``A favorite trip was to the
Galapagos Islands, a few years ago,'' his son David said. ``The
idea that he could be so close to these animals _ you actually felt
that you were in Darwin's world _ that is what excited him. He was
a city boy. To actually go someplace and see these animals they way
Darwin had actually amazed him.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1940 to 1943 he worked as a civilian for the Navy,
approving payments for contracts. He enlisted in the Army Air Corps
in 1943 and later served in the Eighth Air Force as a lead
navigator, flying bombing missions over Europe. He received a
Distinguished Flying Cross, an Air Medal with five oak leaf
clusters and other decorations.
</P>
<P>
   Hechler is survived by his wife, the former Marilyn Eisen, of
Roslyn Heights; two sons, David, of Larchmont, and Jon, of
Manhattan, and four grandchildren. &QL;

NURSING HOME CHAIN REPORTS HUGE LOSSES CAUSED BY MEDICARE PAYMENT
CUTS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reeling from severe cuts in Medicare payments for elderly
nursing home patients, Sun Healthcare Group Friday reported heavy
losses for the fourth quarter and all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sun, one of the nation's largest nursing home operators, said
Medicare had cut payments for an array of services for each patient
to $319 a day, from more than $500 a day before a new Medicare
payment system was phased in beginning last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts sent ``the entire nursing home industry into a
tailspin,'' said Andrew Turner, the chief executive of Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Goodman, a spokeswoman for Sun, said the government had
underestimated the impact of the new system. She said Congress had
projected savings of about $9 billion over five years in Medicare
payments for nursing home services, but added, ``Now it will be
about $15 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun, which had expected to lose about 17 percent of its Medicare
revenue, ended up losing 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the payment system, which is similar to
longstanding Medicare hospital payments, has created havoc for
several of the publicly traded nursing home chains, including
Vencor Inc. and Mariner Health Group. Vencor said recently that it
would report ``significant operating losses'' for the fourth
quarter when it announces 1998 results.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it lost $761.7 million, or $13.34 a share, on
revenue of $780.2 million in the fourth quarter. That compared with
a loss of $18.4 million, or 39 cents a share, in the fourth quarter
of 1997 on revenue of $678.5 million. The results included $95.7
million in charges to increase reserves and adjust for
restructuring as well as $696 million in noncash charges, mainly to
acknowledge sharp reductions in Medicare-related business.
</P>
<P>
   The company had previously said it would eliminate 10,000 jobs
as part of $400 million a year in planned spending cuts. Before the
cuts, it had 69,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Sun plans to sell 31 assisted living centers and 10
rehabilitation hospitals across the country. There are few
for-profit nursing homes and hospitals in the Northeast, where
for-profit health care companies face stiff legal and regulatory
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   Sun was especially vulnerable because it has the expense of
carrying $2 billion of debt and convertible preferred stock and $2
billion more, which analysts call ``imputed debt,'' for facilities
it effectively rents from real estate investment trusts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Sun's most profitable business _ supplying
therapists and pharmacy services to other nursing homes _ was
decimated by the Medicare changes. The company said Medicare had
cut payments by 60 percent for occupational, speech and physical
therapy. With the overall Medicare cuts, Sun's customers sharply
reduced purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nursing homes can still fill beds, but maybe not as
profitably,'' said Rob Mains, an analyst with Advest in Albany. Sun
operates 397 nursing homes with 44,941 beds in the United States
and 186 facilities in Britain, Australia, Germany and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Sun said it lost $753.7 million, or $14.49 a share, on revenue
of $3.09 billion in the 12 months ended last Dec. 31. But the
company said it had $74 million in cash on hand, up $20 million
from March 1, indicating positive cash flow to meet its
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What everybody should be focusing on is cash and cash flow,
and whether you can survive outside of a bankruptcy court,'' said
Jeffrey C. Villwock, an analyst at Robinson-Humphrey in Atlanta.
Sun has told analysts that some of its clients have already sought
protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is hurting badly,'' Villwock said. He said Sun and
Vencor, which also leases its facilities from an investment trust
it spun off, were ``closer to the brink'' than most nursing home
chains. He said that Mariner still owned its facilities and had a
stronger cash flow.

<P>
   Beverly Enterprises, the biggest chain, has less debt, Mains
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sun said it had violated provisions of its bank debt and was in
negotiations to obtain changes that would return it to compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Mains at Advest said the Medicare changes created ``sheer
havoc'' for the publicly traded companies. But a number of
privately held chains are ``doing fine,'' he said. In most cases,
they did not sell therapy and pharmacy services to outsiders and
did not push for maximum return on Medicare patients.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sun fell 6.25 cents to close at 87.5 cents Friday.  &QL;

COMPAQ EARNINGS ARE EXPECTED TO BE HALF OF FORECAST
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Compaq Computer Corp. said late Friday that its profits
would be less than half of what analysts had expected, dragged down
by declining sales and a shift into lower-margin products.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq said its revenue for the first quarter would be about
$9.4 billion, short of the $9.7 billion analysts had expected. And
it said that profits would be about $250 million, or 15 cents a
share, rather than the expected $540 million, or 32 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quarter's shortfall reflects lower-than-anticipated market
demand and increased competitive pricing in the commercial PC
sector,'' Earl Mason, Compaq's chief financial officer, said in a
statement. Compaq officials did not return calls seeking further
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they had expected that the first quarter would be
hard for Compaq, but were surprised by the magnitude of the
shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crash and burn time,'' Aaron C. Goldberg, the principal
analyst with Ziff-Davis, said. Computer companies have been hit
hard, he said, because a decade-long cycle of ever more complex
software, needing relentlessly upgraded machines to run it, has
ground to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The action now isn't in software but on the Web,'' Goldberg
said. ``And performance isn't determined by how fast your processor
is but by how much bandwidth you have.''
</P>
<P>
   This effect can be seen in the sharply plummeting average prices
for computers.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, the average PC sold in a retail store cost $1,141,
according to Ziff-Davis research. By the end of last year, the
price had fallen to $1,006. By the end of February, it was down to
$900, Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts conclude that Compaq has been hit harder than other
computer companies because it still does not appear to be in
control of its inventory. In the PC business _ where prices fall by
1 percent to 2 percent a week _ every extra machine sitting in a
warehouse is an expensive drag on the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think inventories built up towards the end of last year due
to a shortfall in sales,'' said Robert P. Anastasi, an analyst with
Robinson Humphrey. ``And that is a drag this year as the inventory
is brought into line.'' In particular, he said, Compaq appears to
be running into trouble selling to large corporations, one of its
traditional strengths.
</P>
<P>
   Anastasi said that the other big computer companies _ IBM and
Hewlett-Packard _ face the same pressure on prices that has hurt
Compaq, but they may not have the inventory problems.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has already realized that Compaq is facing
tough times.
</P>
<P>
   Its shares closed Friday, before the earnings announcement, at
$30.94, up $1.31 for the day. But the stock has fallen from $51.25
at the end of January, quite a drop amid a buoyant market.
</P>

<P>
   In contrast, Dell Computer Corp., Compaq's main rival, presented
a glowing picture of its business at an analysts meeting in New
York on Thursday. Michael Dell, the company's chairman, called the
PC market healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Dell does not have the inventory problems faced by Compaq
because it sells directly to customers, building machines only
after they are ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq has been trying to expand its direct sales capability.
But analysts said that so far this has had little effect. Indeed,
Anastasi said that Compaq's move may in fact be contributing to its
sales because of it has offended local dealers in what the computer
industry calls the ``channel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Compaq was so vocal about direct sales there may be some
retaliation in the channel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell is also able to use its direct sales capability to talk
customers into buying more expensive machines and to add on extras
like monitors and memory. If someone buys a low-cost Compaq
computer at a retail store, the sales clerk may well talk the
customer into a bigger monitor, say, but that sale is likely to be
a brand other than Compaq.

BOB PECK, 53, ACTOR OF STAGE AND SCREEN 
EMMETT COLVIN, 80, LAWYER FOR JACK RUBY 
H.S. KESSLER, 56, ANIMAL HOSPITAL FOUNDER

<P>
   Bob Peck, who appeared in the film ``Jurassic Park'' as well as
on stage and television in Britain, died on Sunday in London.
</P>
<P>
   He was 53 and had cancer, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Peck, who lived in London, was much better known in Britain than
in the United States, where his biggest role was that of a game
warden, Robert Muldoon, in ``Jurassic Park,'' Steven Spielberg's
1993 dinosaur film.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, Peck started as an actor with the National Theater
and the Royal Shakespeare Co., performing in plays like ``Nicholas
Nickleby,'' ``King Lear'' and ``The Tempest.''
</P>
<P>
   He later starred in numerous television dramas, including the
popular 1985 television series ``Edge of Darkness.'' In the series,
which featured music by Eric Clapton, Peck played Craven, a
grief-stricken police officer looking in an underground nuclear
reactor for clues to the death of his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Peck was regarded as an adaptable actor with a gift for
portraying Everyman. ``He was a hero, but without the heroics,''
said an obituary in The Guardian. ``We looked at the television
screen and saw ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Peck was born on Aug. 23, 1945, in Leeds, England, and was a
graduate of the Leeds College of Art.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Jill, two daughters and a son.
</P>
<P>
   Emmett Colvin, 80, Lawyer for Jack Ruby
</P>
<P>
   Emmett Colvin, a criminal defense lawyer from Texas, died on
April 2 at his home in Fairfax, Va. He was 80 and had retired to
Virginia from Dallas three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Colvin was among the lawyers who represented Jack Ruby in an
appeal of his murder conviction for shooting Lee Harvey Oswald, the
assassin of President John F. Kennedy. They successfully argued for
Ruby's right to a new trial, but Ruby died of cancer before it
could be held.
</P>
<P>
   Colvin practiced criminal law defense for more than 50 years,
mostly in Texas. He argued several cases before the U.S. Supreme
Court and for two years was dean of the National College of
Criminal Defense, a post-graduate school for practicing lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   He was educated at Arkansas State University and St. Louis
University and received a law degree from the University of
Arkansas in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Colvin is survived by his wife of 57 years, Mary Lee Colvin; two
sons, Lance, of Seattle, and Mark, of Fairfax; a daughter, Laurel
Colvin of Chappaqua, N.Y.; six grandchildren and two
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   H.S. Kessler, 56, Animal Hospital Founder
</P>
<P>
   Howard S. Kessler, a Manhattan veterinarian and former president
of the board of the Bide-a-Wee Association, died on Thursday at the
Southampton Hospital in Southampton, N.Y. He was 56.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said his mother, Gail Kessler of Atlantic
City.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler, who lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, was the
director of the New York Veterinary Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He was born on Jan. 12, 1943, in Milville, N.J., and graduated
from Michigan State University and the University of Pennsylvania
School of Veterinary Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Dr. Kessler founded the New York Veterinary Hospital,
which he directed until his death.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the co-founder and co-director of the Ansonia
Veterinary Center in Manhattan and was active in animal charities.
He was a sponsor for the Pet Owners with AIDS/ARC Resource Service.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his mother, Dr. Kessler is survived by his brother,
Barry Kessler of Egg Harbor, N.J., and a sister, Lois Kessler of
Manhattan.
