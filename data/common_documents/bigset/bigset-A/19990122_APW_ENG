<HEADLINE> Hamilton Divorces Director Cameron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Being married to James Cameron was a titanically  
miserable experience. 
</P>
<P>
	So says actress Linda Hamilton, who filed for divorce from the  
director of ``Titanic'' and ``The Terminator'' after nearly eight 
years of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to be the one to do the final destructive act. It's  
an important thing for me personally not to feel like the victim,'' 
Ms. Hamilton said in Friday's USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hamilton said that even at last year's Academy Awards -- when  
Cameron's ``Titanic'' won 11 trophies and he shouted, ``I'm the 
king of the world!'' -- he was still ``an absolutely miserable, 
miserable, unhappy man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the two had nothing in common except their 6-year-old  
daughter.

<HEADLINE> Internet Subsidies Disbursed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than $211 million -- the largest amount  
issued to date -- will go to schools and libraries to help pay for 
connections to the Internet, the program's administrator announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The Schools and Libraries Division of the Universal Service  
Administrative Company did not have a breakdown of how many schools 
and libraries will receive the money. That is because the 4,500 
commitment letters mailed out can cover entire school districts. 
</P>
<P>
	A list of the entities receiving the funding letters was not  
released Thursday. But the program's administrator said applicants 
in all 50 states, plus the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and 
the Virgin Islands received some money. 
</P>
<P>
	This third batch of funding pushes the total amount of money  
released thus far to more than $427 million, the administrator 
said. The group began disbursing money late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The money comes from fees imposed on telecommunications  
companies. The Federal Communications Commission oversees the 
program.

<HEADLINE>  Quayle Hints About 2000 Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After sitting out the 1996 presidential  
campaign, former Vice President Dan Quayle is taking the first step 
toward seeking the top spot on the Republican ticket in 2000. He 
came close to announcing today, promising a conservative group ``a 
choice worth fighting for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Very soon I will be making a final decision about my political  
future,'' Quayle told a receptive audience at the Conservative 
Political Action Conference in the Washington suburb of Arlington, 
Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here among friends, I can say I have been encouraged to run  
for president of the United States,'' Quayle said, promising ``an 
agenda of vision and a choice worth fighting for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had six years of misplaced priorities, slick  
salesmanship and amateurism,'' said Quayle, last of several 
presidential hopefuls to address CPAC. 
</P>
<P>
	In reference to the impeachment trial of President Clinton,  
Quayle said, ``I have never seen more courage on Capitol Hill than 
that being displayed by Henry Hyde and the House Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, values do matter,'' he said to loud cheers.  
</P>
<P>
	In remarks directed and Democratic front-runner Vice President  
Al Gore, Quayle said, ``Bill Clinton obstructs justice and Al Gore 
calls him a moral leader. ... Bill Clinton and Al Gore deserve each 
other. America deserves better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Tuesday night, we listened to Al Gore's platform. They want  
more taxes, more regulation, more government and more burdens 
placed on the hard-working middle class. They are not new 
Democrats. They are new-age socialists,'' Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday night on CNN's ``Larry King Live,'' the former vice  
president said, ``I've thought about this for a long time. I've 
wanted to be president for a long time, and the year 2000 is 
looking like my opportunity,'' 
</P>
<P>
	He intends to file a formal statement of candidacy next week,  
the first step in his bid for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle said he would push for a 30 percent, across-the-board tax  
cut and would stand up for middle American values. 
</P>
<P>
	The race for the GOP nomination is drawing a number of  
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	The early front-runner seems to be George W. Bush, the Texas  
governor who is son of former President George Bush. Other possible 
candidates are millionaire businessman Steve Forbes, former cabinet 
secretary Elizabeth Dole, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and 
activist Gary Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Polls are quite frankly irrelevant. You don't make decisions  
on whether you are running for president on a poll, on your poll or 
someone else's poll. You consult yourself; you talk with your 
family; and if you are convinced that you are the best person to 
lead the country, then you make a go of it; and that's what I have 
done,'' Quayle said in the CNN interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle said he believe it will take $20 million to run a  
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am convinced I can raise it. I know I can raise it,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Samaranch Threatened by IOC Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A ``palace revolt'' is brewing in the IOC and  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch will survive only if the committee 
takes quick, united action to oust members in the Salt Lake bribery 
scandal, a top U.S. Olympic Committee official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC executive director Dick Schultz said his ``gut feeling''  
was that Samaranch's 18-year reign at the top of the Olympics was 
threatened by ``some people who aren't being as supportive as they 
could be at this point in time. I think that's unfair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I sense a bit of a palace revolt,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Schultz, who as the day-to-day leader of the IOC's most  
important national subsidiary is generally considered an ally of 
Samaranch, would not say who might be involved in a festering coup. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there has been an increasingly loud call for Samaranch  
to step aside and take responsibility for the biggest scandal in 
Olympics history, none of the critics so far has come from inside 
the power base of the IOC, its member sports organizations or its 
influential corporate sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	But Schultz, about to leave for an IOC board meeting in  
Lausanne, Switzerland, that is expected to recommend expulsions of 
up to 11 members in the Salt Lake case, said the fate of the 
international committee and its president would be decided within 
the next two months. 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed to the special assembly March 17-18 at which the full  
113-member IOC will vote on sanctions against individual members 
and consider what are expected to be radical reforms in how Olympic 
host cities are picked. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is unanimity to vote those people out, then he is  
going to stay as president,'' Schultz said. ``If they don't, then 
not only Samaranch but the whole IOC is in serious trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz said Samaranch should stay in charge and was confident  
of the IOC president's ability to direct the Olympics through the 
bribery crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no doubt who is running the show,'' he said. ``No  
question who's in charge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Krimsky, the USOC's marketing director, whose job of  
negotiating sponsorships has been complicated by the Salt Lake 
scandal, said he has seen no meaningful threats to the IOC 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (Olympic) movement is solidly behind Samaranch because of  
his ability displayed over 20 years,'' Krimsky said. ``I'd be very 
surprised to see change at the top before the end of his term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, a 78-year-old Spaniard, was elected president in  
1980. His fourth and final term is to end in 2001, and he has said 
repeatedly in recent weeks he has no plans to leave earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky addressed sports marketing executives at the  
International Sports Summit and outlined a long-range plan to 
return luster to the Olympic rings by focusing on athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been bruised,'' he said. In a keynote speech, Krimsky  
said he was ``depressed and revolted'' by the scandal but noted 
with hope that recent surveys showed the public separated the 
actions of Olympic leaders from Olympic competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The story is the athlete,'' he said. ``We've just got to tell  
that story to a greater extent. This is a wakeup call for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Krimsky said it would take awhile for the Olympics to fully  
revive. He said he hoped the 2004 Games in Athens would see a 
``rebirth of the world's appreciation of Olympic competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Krimsky said, the IOC should follow the USOC's  
lead and focus on the athletes. He suggested, at the very least, it 
allow athletes to replace committee officials at the head of the 
procession of national teams when they march into the Sydney 
Olympics in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky also reiterated that he was certain Salt Lake would  
raise enough money from sponsors and ticket sales to meet its $1.5 
billion budget.

<HEADLINE> Hastert: HMO Bills Will Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Popular legislation regulating HMOs will reach  
the House floor this year, Speaker Dennis Hastert says. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, R-Ill., in a letter Thursday to House members, said a  
``patient protection'' bill will move through the committee process 
and reach the floor before adjournment in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year the House will address many important issues,'' he  
wrote. ``Key among them will be our discussion on patient 
protections in health care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Hastert warned he is not likely to support legislation  
making it easier for patients denied care to take health 
maintenance organizations and other managed care companies to 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not been shy about advocating a process where patients  
receive care in hospital rooms -- not in courtrooms,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	He also indicated he is wary about proposals that raise the cost  
of insurance -- an argument that a main line of defense for 
opponents of imposing new regulations on HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Hastert was the leader of a GOP task force that  
developed HMO legislation meant to counter more sweeping proposals 
by President Clinton, congressional Democrats and some Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	His bill gave patients many of the same protections Democrats  
want but added some controversial GOP ideas and did not include the 
right to sue. It was approved on a mostly party-line vote in the 
House but died in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Democrats have vowed to make HMOs an issue again  
this year.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Impeachment Trial-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	``Whenever (President Clinton's secretary) Betty Currie was  
questioned, they said, well she wasn't a witness. There was never 
any clue that she was going to be a witness; that the Jones' 
lawyers never anticipated that she was going to be a witness. That 
it was never put at all on the witness list. 
</P>
<P>
	``And that's very significant. I just want to drive this point  
home. This is Mr. (White House Counsel Charles) Ruff talking about 
prosecutorial fudging. How about defense fudging?'' -- Rep. Asa 
Hutchinson, R-Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear from the president's trial memorandum and his  
presentation here that President Clinton and his counsel know 
exactly what he is being charged with. And I would submit to you 
that if President Clinton had suffered from any lack of specificity 
in the articles, he could have filed a motion for a bill of 
particulars. He did not choose to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``Moreover, articles of impeachment have never, they have never  
been required to be drafted with the specificity of indictments. 
After all, this proceeding is not a criminal trial. If it were, 
then we as the prosecutors would not only be entitled to call 
witnesses, but would be required to call them to prove our case.'' 
-- Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Impeachment is a political and not a criminal proceeding, and  
that has been clear from the institution of this proceeding in our 
Constitution. '' -- Canady. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I would also point out that unlike the judicial impeachments  
of the 1980s, President Clinton has not committed a handful of 
specific misdeeds that can be easily listed in separate articles of 
impeachment. In order to encompass the whole assortment of misdeeds 
that caused the House of Representatives to impeach the president, 
the Judiciary Committee looked to the more analogous case, that of 
President Nixon.'' -- Canady. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It is absolutely crystal clear from the history of the  
drafting of the impeachment clause that the concern of the framers 
was: Is there such actions as so subvert our government that we can 
no longer persist in permitting, in their case, the president of 
the United States to remain in office?'' -- Charles Ruff, White 
House counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``You must ask what's the nature of the perjury that's been  
committed? What's the nature of the offense that's been committed? 
What's the factual setting in which it occurs? And ultimately does 
it so subvert the accused ability to perform the duties of his 
office that you must remove him?'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I have great respect for these counselors -- they're admirable,  
they're doing a great job for their client, and they're presenting 
their theory of the case. We're arguing our point of view. And it's 
the facts that make the determination.'' -- Hutchinson. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``One can talk around the law. One can talk about the law. One  
can ignore the law. And as we've seen, one can break the law. But 
one has to deal with the law in court and in these proceedings.'' -- 
Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``As I've tried to make clear in my earlier arguments, it is not  
enough simply I think to ask, does a particular generic form of 
misconduct, however serious it may be, lead inexorably to the 
conclusion that the president of the United States has committed an 
impeachable offense? 
</P>
<P>
	``As the framers made clear, and I think the history that lay  
behind their deliberations and the history that was followed made 
clear ... we speak of offenses which this body must ultimately 
judge as being so violative of his public responsibilities that our 
system cannot abide his continuing in office.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``If we haven't convinced you on the facts, I hope we'll  
convince you that the framers would have asked: Is our system so in 
danger that we must not only turn the president over to the same 
rule of law that any other citizen would be put under after he 
leaves office, but must we cut short his term and overturn the will 
of the nation? 
</P>
<P>
	``And in our view, in the worst-case scenario, you can find the  
answer to that question must still be 'no.''' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the response and the position taken by the  
counsel for the president here really involves two great errors. 
One error is in establishing a standard of conduct for the 
presidency that is too low. The other error is in attempting to 
minimize the significance of the offenses that this president has 
been charged.'' -- Canady. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that an essential part of the focus of your inquiry  
must be on whether there was a serious corrupt intent involved in 
the underlying conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``A president should not be impeached and removed from office  
for a mistake of judgment. He should not be impeached and removed 
for a momentary lapse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead, he should be impeached and removed if he engages in a  
conscious and deliberate and settled choice to do wrong, a 
conscious and deliberate and settled choice to violate the laws of 
this land. 
</P>
<P>
	``And we submit that he must be impeached and removed if he does  
that, because in doing so he has violated his oath of office, in 
doing so he has turned away from the unique role which he has under 
our Constitution as the chief executive charged with ensuring that 
the laws be faithfully executed. He steps aside from that role and 
takes on the role of one who attacks the rule of law.'' -- Canady. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We would further submit that the attempt to minimize the  
significance of the conduct of this president does a disservice to 
the laws of this land. The attempt to minimize this course of 
conduct which started out as an effort to deprive a plaintiff in a 
civil rights case of her just day in court is a serious course of 
conduct -- a course of conduct which brings disrespect on the office 
of the presidency and indeed undermines the integrity of the office 
of the presidency, the integrity of the judicial system.'' -- 
Canady. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``What kind of oath did the president take in the civil  
deposition? Did he take an oath -- did he raise his hand and swear 
to tell the truth, the evasive truth, and nothing but the evasive 
truth? Did he take an oath to tell the truth, the misleading truth, 
and nothing but the misleading truth? Did he take an oath to tell 
the truth, the incomplete truth, and nothing but the incomplete 
truth?'' -- Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Weather the Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Decimated. Incredibly strained. Nothing but  
sleepless nights and mental agony. 
</P>
<P>
	This dark Clinton family portrait by an old home-state friend  
trying to keep the president from being removed bears little 
resemblance to the sunny public faces of Bill, Hillary and Chelsea 
-- holding hands outside church, baking Christmas lasagna. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say it has been a strain for my family, but we have  
worked very hard and I think we've come through the worst,'' the 
president said. ``We love each other very much and we've worked on 
it very hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke with a New York Times interviewer hours after Dale  
Bumpers, the former Democratic senator from Arkansas, made a 
wrenchingly personal appeal to the Senate not to remove Clinton 
from office. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments in the president's sex-and-lies impeachment  
trial on Thursday, Bumpers excoriated House prosecutors for 
insensitivity to the Clinton family, which he said ``has already 
been about as decimated as a family can get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The relationship between husband and wife, father and child,  
has been incredibly strained, if not destroyed. There's been 
nothing but sleepless nights, mental agony,'' Bumpers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just after Monica Lewinsky made headlines last winter, Chelsea,  
an 18-year-old sophomore, skipped Stanford University's parents 
weekend in favor of a private week on Utah's ski slopes with her 
mother. The president doesn't ski. By November, the tabloids made 
sensational headlines of Chelsea's breakup with a boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, by his behavior with the young White House  
intern, brought ``unspeakable embarrassment and humiliation on 
himself, his wife whom he adored, and a child that he worshiped 
with every fiber in his body and for whom he would happily have 
died to spare her this or to ameliorate her shame and her grief,'' 
Bumpers told his former colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Bumpers did not clear his remarks with Clinton in advance, White  
House press secretary Joe Lockhart said, but Clinton found the 
presentation ``appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the only part of his own trial that Clinton watched --  
from a television in the small dining room off the Oval Office. ``I 
think he was just trying to inject the human element into what he 
was saying,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	But what Bumpers laid out was a raw and rare look inside a  
family that guards its private feelings with the stiff upper lip of 
British royalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The morning after Clinton was impeached last month, a stylishly  
put-together Chelsea smiled and held her father's hand outside 
Sunday services, unflinching as a fellow churchgoer shouted to 
Clinton, ``Damn you, for what you've done to the nation!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The following day, Mrs. Clinton and the president acted like a  
carefree couple as they made lasagna in front of news cameras at a 
Washington soup kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
	The few glimpses that sneak out from behind the curtain also  
suggest a family getting along. 
</P>
<P>
	As advisers scrambled last month to avoid impeachment, Clinton  
abruptly adjourned one strategy session, saying it was time to help 
his daughter with her homework. At a private, holiday dinner for 
friends, he told Kenneth Starr jokes and said it felt ``not bad'' 
to be impeached. 
</P>
<P>
	One friend who saw the family over Christmas said the pain is  
genuine, if hidden. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on condition of anonymity, this family friend said  
Bumpers' portrait of devastation was ``in sync'' with reality, but 
the Clintons are getting through it because they can talk to one 
another -- even if it's sometimes through screams or sobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are committed to their relationships,'' said Marsha  
Berry, a spokeswoman for the first lady. ``They have the ability to 
communicate with one another and always have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Caputo, Mrs. Clinton's former spokeswoman who has remained  
close to the family, agreed. ``This has not been easy for the first 
family and I think that they have made that clear by keeping it a 
private issue.''

<HEADLINE>  Dennis Rodman Hints at NBA Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Dennis Rodman is ``pretty much'' sick of  
basketball, but in the same breath Friday hinted that he'd like to 
continue his rebounding in the warm weather of Miami or Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to play somewhere,'' Rodman told Jay Leno during a  
``Tonight Show'' appearance. ``Hopefully, I'll be the first man to 
ever win three championships on three different teams. I was the 
first one to do it on two different teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, Rodman meant he was the first player two win  
consecutive titles with different teams -- Detroit in 1988-89 and 
'89-90 and Chicago the last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Leno asked the former Chicago Bulls forward if he'd like to play  
for the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``New York is all right, but I'd rather go where it's warm --  
Miami, Orlando,'' Rodman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leno suggested the Los Angeles Lakers, and Rodman said he had  
talked to owner Jerry Buss. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hmm, it's not a possibility. There's no money,'' he said.  
``With the new rules today, you can only make a million dollars. 
After making 10, 12 million the last three years I don't think I 
need to take one million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm better than most guys in the league and who better  
to fill up a stadium than Dennis Rodman?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman suggested a team could pay him $1 million and ``buy me  
some land that's worth about 10, 12 million and give it to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The TV appearance capped a wacky week for Rodman. On Tuesday,  
Rodman's retirement was announced and the next day the news was 
retracted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never left,'' said Rodman, who explained that he wants to do  
other things besides basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	The lockout that delayed the start of the season by three months  
didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you've been gone this long, it's like you don't want to  
go back,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other topics, Rodman said he isn't sorry former Chicago  
teammate Michael Jordan retired, and he confirmed that he's still 
married to actress Carmen Electra. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the girl to death, she's cool, she's beautiful,'' said  
Rodman, dressed in a black pinstripe suit, white shirt with large 
collar and cuffs, a dark feathered floppy hat and sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman declined Leno's invitation to remove the hat and glasses.

<HEADLINE> Dallas the Stars of the NHL So Far </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The way the Dallas Stars are playing this  
season, nothing less than a Stanley Cup championship would satisfy 
them. The same could be said for the Philadelphia Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won the President's Trophy last year, and we also advanced  
into the third round (of the playoffs),'' general manager Bob 
Gainey said. ``So in the spirit of trying to do more and better 
than last year, a trip to the finals would seem to be what we need 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars have the best record (27-9-7, 61 points) and the  
Flyers are second (24-10-10, 58) at the season's halfway point as 
the league breaks for Sunday's All-Star Game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are a team that's categorized as a Stanley Cup contender,  
and I think we're earning that right to stay in that category,'' 
Gainey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars will have four players in the All-Star game at the Ice  
Palace. Center Mike Modano, defenseman Darryl Sydor and goaltender 
Ed Belfour will represent the Stars on the North America team, 
while defenseman Sergei Zubov will play for the World team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers have two representatives on the North America team --  
center Eric Lindros and forward John LeClair. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars are among a group of strong teams in the West that  
also includes the Phoenix Coyotes and Detroit Red Wings. Included 
among the Stars' accomplishments this season is a 3-0 record 
against the defending Stanley Cup champion Red Wings, who knocked 
them out of the playoffs last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is just an understanding that we can win in Joe Louis  
(Arena),'' Modano said about his team's sudden turnaround against 
Detroit this season. ``That has been something that has weighed on 
our shoulders the last two or three years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until winning twice within two weeks in Detroit this season, the  
Stars had lost six straight in Joe Louis Arena and were 1-17-2 in 
their 20 previous visits there. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers reached the Stanley Cup finals two years ago, then  
were swept by the Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia had a 15-game unbeaten streak this season before  
losing to Toronto last weekend. The Maple Leafs, one of the NHL's 
surprise teams this season, lead the Northeast Division and have 
produced a league-high 152 goals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ottawa Senators were expected to do well after a strong  
showing in last season's playoffs, and a recent 8-0-3 run confirmed 
their strength. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings, meanwhile, had four players voted into the  
All-Star starting lineup by the fans -- but two have been knocked 
out of the game by injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Yzerman, the starting center on the North America team,  
broke his nose Thursday night against Carolina, and Lindros will 
start in his place. Yzerman was replaced numerically by Luc 
Robitaille of the Los Angeles Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman Uwe Krupp, injured previously, will be replaced in  
the World team starting lineup by Teppo Numminen of the Coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit's Brendan Shanahan will be one of the starting forwards  
on the North America team and Nicklas Lidstrom will start for the 
World Team on defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston defenseman Ray Bourque will make a record 12th All-Star  
start. Other starters for the North American team will be 
defenseman Al MacInnis of St. Louis, forward Paul Kariya of Anaheim 
and goaltender Martin Brodeur of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The other starters for the World Team are goaltender Dominik  
Hasek of Buffalo, center Peter Forsberg of Colorado, and forwards 
Jaromir Jagr of Pittsburgh and Teemu Selanne of Anaheim.

<P>
	AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- Auburn scoring leader Chris Porter, who was  
key to the Tigers opening the season with 17 straight wins, was 
suspended Friday for three games.

<HEADLINE> Lott Suggests All Senators Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Democratic support for President Clinton  
holding firm, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott today suggested a 
closed-door meeting of all senators to discuss guidelines for the 
balance of the impeachment trial. The lead Republican prosecutor 
suggested senators invite the president to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because the president is the only individual with knowledge of  
almost every material fact relevant to the trial, the House 
believes that this testimony could greatly help to expeditiously 
and fairly bring this matter to a close,'' Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., 
wrote in a letter today to the Senate leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde said the House ``would welcome the opportunity to  
participate in the fair examination of President Clinton'' if the 
Senate requests the president's appearance. The White House has 
said repeatedly that there are no plans for Clinton to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott denied he is seeking an exit from the trial but told  
reporters, ``There's a feeling that sometime next week we might 
want to have another one of those Old Senate Chamber meetings.'' He 
was referring to the session two weeks ago that produced a 
bipartisan plan for moving ahead with the first impeachment trial 
in 131 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republican lawmakers fear that a drawn-out proceedings  
would inflict long-term political damage to their party, as 
numerous Democrats have said in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
	He made his comments as senators prepared for a new phase of the  
trial, questioning of the two legal teams about the allegations of 
perjury and obstruction of justice. The questions would be handed 
to Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who would pose them formally. 
</P>
<P>
	One House prosecutor, Rep. George Gekas, conceded today he  
doesn't believe any Democrats have been swayed by the evidence of 
perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``As of now, no,'' Gekas, R-Pa., said in an interview with The  
Associated Press. ``Now, that may change and could change by way of 
the series of questions that need to be asked. And also on the 
question of witnesses,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	And a Republican senator suggested she wasn't impressed with the  
perjury charge against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't made a final decision on that. I think ... the  
obstruction charge is much stronger than the perjury charge,'' said 
Susan Collins of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's grand jury testimony is replete with lies with  
half truths and evasions. I'm considering whether despite that they 
meet the test under our perjury laws,'' Collins added. 
</P>
<P>
	At least twelve Democrats would have to vote in favor of  
conviction to remove the president. 
</P>
<P>
	One Democrat, Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, told reporters there  
were ``close to 45 votes to dismiss'' the trial, the total number 
of Democrats in the Senate. That's shy of the majority that would 
be needed, but would be a clear indication that Clinton would win 
acquittal at his trial, where a two-thirds vote is needed to 
convict. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle said Lott had not  
approached him with his suggestion for a closed-door meeting of all 
senators. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be interested in talking to Senator Lott about what he has  
in mind,'' Daschle said. He added, though, ``I would appreciate it 
if he'd talk to me before he talks to you, frankly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said he was amenable to giving House prosecutors a  
formal allotment of time to rebut the White House presentations, 
but with conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a rebuttal opportunity was part of an agreement for a date  
certain (to end the trial) without any witnesses I'd be willing to 
look at it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde, R-Ill., shrugged off suggestions their might be momentum  
among Republican senator to cut short the trial. ``I never try to 
read people's minds. They look pleasant enough to me, so I don't 
assume they're doing that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``if this is a process of momentum shifts, we'll try  
to shift it back our way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gekas said he and his 12 Republican prosecutor colleagues had  
not yet given up hope. Their next chance to change minds was today 
as senators submitted their first written questions to be asked of 
the lawyers after two weeks of evidence presentations. 
</P>
<P>
	Alternating between Republicans and Democrats, the procedure  
will be as awkward for senators as the requirement that they sit 
silently at the trial ``on pain of imprisonment.'' Senators will 
try to narrow the conflicts in the evidence that were highlighted 
by House prosecutors and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Was the job search for former White House intern Monica Lewinsky  
an effort to persuade her to sign a court affidavit denying a 
sexual relationship with Clinton? Who asked the president's 
secretary, Betty Currie, to pick up presidential gifts from Ms. 
Lewinsky -- the president or Ms. Lewinsky herself? Did Clinton try 
to coach Mrs. Currie for possible testimony the day after his 
deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case against him? 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are in a political bind once the question period is  
complete. The president's popularity continues to soar while the 
GOP's call for witnesses could extend the trial that -- according to 
polls -- is widely unpopular. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats were buoyed by Thursday's speeches on the president's  
behalf, but Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said today he is 
counseling fellow party members not to become smug and declare 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we need to give our Republican colleagues a dignified  
retreat out of this case,'' he said on NBC's ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats generally oppose witnesses. Most would likely vote for  
an expected motion to dismiss the case without voting on charges of 
perjury and obstruction of justice regarding Clinton's efforts to 
cover up his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Even some Republicans seemed undecided about the need for  
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more apt to cast a vote, yes, the deposition should be  
held, than I am to cast a vote that witnesses should be called. But 
we'll wait and see,'' Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The motion to dismiss and votes on witnesses, probably Monday,  
probably would end the bipartisanship that has sustained the trial 
inside the Senate, although political unity already has evaporated 
in front of television cameras stationed just outside the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., in a closing White House  
presentation Thursday that was praised for its eloquence by 
Republicans and Democrats alike, asked senators to give the public 
a break. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people are now and for some time have been asking  
to be allowed a good night's sleep. They're asking for an end to 
this nightmare. It is a legitimate request,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Seek Lewinsky Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House impeachment prosecutors obtained  
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's help Friday in attempting to 
force Monica Lewinsky to talk to them, contending her immunity 
agreement requires it, two congressional officials confirmed 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's prosecutors and lawyers for Ms. Lewinsky went to court  
late Friday afternoon to argue whether she had to cooperate. U.S. 
District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson made no immediate ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead prosecutor Henry Hyde, R-Ill., wrote Starr Thursday seeking  
his help with Ms. Lewinsky, who rejected being interviewed by the 
House team. 
</P>
<P>
	Two House sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Hyde  
cited Ms. Lewinsky's immunity agreement with Starr in his letter. 
</P>
<P>
	The July 28 agreement said Ms. Lewinsky ``will testify  
truthfully before grand juries in this district (Washington) and 
elsewhere, at any trials in this district and elsewhere, and in any 
other executive, military, judicial or congressional proceedings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter Friday to Starr, Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers contended  
that the immunity agreement with him ``does not require us to be 
interviewed'' by the House impeachment managers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate itself has provided its own rules for witness  
interviews. As we understand them, there must be a deposition with 
equal access. As of now, the Senate has not voted for 
depositions,'' her attorneys wrote. ``Ms. Lewinsky will of course 
respond to a subpoena to appear and testify before the Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House has urged the Senate to allow witnesses in Clinton's  
impeachment trial, a controversial issue that could be fought out 
next week along sharp partisan lines. Most Republicans have backed 
the call for witnesses and virtually all Democrats have opposed 
live testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate Democratic official, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said Democrats oppose Hyde's request to interview Ms. 
Lewinsky because it could delay the trial and was not part of a 
bipartisan agreement covering conduct of the proceedings. Majority 
Leader Trent Lott had no immediate reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	The managers have not yet submitted their witness list. But  
House prosecutors during the Senate trial have said repeatedly that 
Ms. Lewinsky's testimony could help clarify who is telling the 
truth about her sexual relationship with President Clinton and any 
cover-up efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We anticipate the Senate will scrutinize and require  
justification of every witness request the House makes,'' a House 
source said, requesting anonymity. ``Implicit in our opportunity to 
make a case for witnesses comes the responsibility to more 
precisely know what they will say in the trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the House officials said the impeachment prosecuting team  
sought Starr's help after Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers refused earlier 
this month to make her available.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Get United Center Experience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Tim Floyd got to coach the Chicago Bulls.  
Finally. He got to make an appearance in the United Center, too. 
There, in the house Michael Jordan made famous, he got booed. 
</P>
<P>
	Not loudly, but enough for everyone to notice.  
</P>
<P>
	All part of a long day for the former championship team that has  
been gutted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was fine,'' Floyd said of the reaction Friday  
from what was mostly an enthusiastic crowd of about 14,000 at the 
United Center where tickets for the ``fan appreciation'' scrimmage 
were free. 
</P>
<P>
	After he was introduced, the coach that Jordan didn't want to  
play for stayed at midcourt and, using a microphone, spoke to the 
fans about bridging ``the gap between the future and the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope everybody will hang with us.''  
</P>
<P>
	But the overhaul won't be easy. Winning games even tougher for  
the rookie coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The stars of Friday night's the 13-player scrimmage weren't any  
of the team's veterans who will start the exhibition opener Sunday 
against the Indiana Pacers. Instead, first-round draft pick Corey 
Benjamin and 6-9 free agent Kornel David of Hungary led the 
reserves to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	In a strange scene after the scrimmage, players participated in  
a 3-point shooting contest with fans, held up a sign thanking them 
and then threw mini-balls into the stands -- all part of an attempt 
to make amends after the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just fun to be back after six months,'' said Toni  
Kukoc. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls were still waiting word on trades and several players  
had to sit out, both the scrimmage and an earlier practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Bryant, Bubba Wells and Martin Muursepp still were waiting  
for their contracts to clear the league office after their trade 
from Phoenix for Luc Longley. 
</P>
<P>
	Same thing for Roy Rogers, who arrived via Houston for Scottie  
Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Kukoc, Ron Harper, Randy Brown and Keith Booth,  
who already were signed, also signed to on the training camp roster 
are free agent veteran center Bill Wennington, a member of all 
three title teams, who signed Thursday; David; guard Rusty LaRue, 
who played 14 games last season with the Bulls; rookie Curtis 
Staples, the 3-point artist from Virginia who was signed Thursday; 
Matt Steigenga, a 1992 draft pick of the Bulls, who played in the 
CBA last season; free agent Robert Werdann, who played CBA last 
year; and Charles Jones, who played collegiately at Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls also officially re-signed Steve Kerr and traded him to  
San Antonio for Chuck Person and a conditional first-round pick. 
Person is expected to be waived. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd met again Friday with free agent Brent Barry, who visited  
the Berto Center Thursday, then had dinner with Floyd 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hopeful at this point,'' Floyd said. ``I know Brent does  
have options. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is weighing them. The ball is in his court, and hopefully  
it will be in our court next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd said the Bulls could bring in another couple players next

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise Amid Falling Stocks / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose Friday as investors sought a  
safe haven from falling stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 7/8 point,  
or $8.75 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, fell to 5.07 percent from 5.13 percent late 
Thursay. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds benefited as investors shifted money from the falling  
stock market to the relative safety of U.S. Treasury securities. 
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 143.41 to 9,120.67 Friday 
after a rally in battered technology shares fizzled and blue-chip 
stocks came under selling pressure from a disappointing earnings 
report by IBM. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader bond market, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities were up between 1/16 point and 1/8 point, and intermediate 
maturities were up 1/4 point to 1/2 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 3.99 
points to 1,321.99. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.35 percent as the  
discount rose 0.05 percentage point to 4.25 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.42 percent, as the discount rose 0.01 percentage 
point to 4.28 percent. One-year yields were 4.44 percent as the 
discount fell by 0.01 percentage point from late Thursday to 4.25 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.63 percent from 4.00 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 125 5/32 from 124 21/32. The average 
yield to maturity fell to 5.14 percent from 5.16 percent.

<HEADLINE> Most Happy With U.S. Postal Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Plenty of people make wisecracks about the  
U.S. Postal Service, but it turns out most Americans say they are 
pretty satisfied with their mail service. 
</P>
<P>
	Rates increased this month for the first time in four years,  
raising the cost of sending a first-class letter one penny, to 33 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
	But about two-thirds of those questioned in an Associated Press  
poll said the new rate is about right or actually a bargain. Only a 
third said the new stamp cost too much. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost three-fourths of Americans believe the Postal Service is  
doing an excellent or good job, said the AP poll by ICR of Media, 
Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Howard, 42, a scientist from the San Francisco area, is  
among those who still considers the cost of sending a letter a 
pretty good deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lady who delivers our mail is a wonderful person,'' he  
said. But Howard is not always as happy with the service at the 
post office, where ``tellers aren't always the most pleasant 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 1,015 adults by ICR was taken Jan. 13-17 and has an  
error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Attitudes about the Postal Service, long the butt of jokes for  
delayed deliveries, bureaucratic boggle and disgruntled workers, 
have improved over the last five years. In 1994, just over six of 
10 said they viewed the Postal Service as excellent or good. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency has worked hard to improve both its businesslike  
performance and public perception, officials say. Post offices have 
been modernized, internal procedures revamped and the service has 
actually operated in the black, said spokesman Roy Betts. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers seem to have noticed.  
</P>
<P>
	Nearly one-third of those polled said they think service is  
better now than five years ago. Sixty percent think it is about the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked their biggest complaint, the leading issue was the  
speed of mail delivery, mentioned by just over a third. The cost of 
stamps was mentioned by about one in 10, as was counter service. 
Forty percent said they had no complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	Last March, the Postal Service ranked highest among all federal  
agencies in favorable ratings with the public, according to a 
survey by the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press. The 
independent accounting firm Price Waterhouse found in 1997 that 
overnight first-class mail was delivered on time more than 90 
percent of the time, 10 points higher than in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	That track record is no small accomplishment for an operation  
that handles 41 percent of the world's mail volume, more than 650 
million pieces of mail every day. 
</P>
<P>
	Public loyalty to the Postal Service may have much to do with  
the day-to-day contact many people have with its letter carriers, 
said Rep. John McHugh, R-N.Y., chairman of the House subcommittee 
on the Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``The person who brings the mail is almost a member of the  
family who visits each and every day,'' McHugh said. 
</P>
<P>
	If there's any area the Postal Service, with its 800,000  
employees, acknowledges need work, it is in labor relations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's clear that conditions on the workroom floor, the  
animosity between management and labor, is amongst the worst in the 
American workplace,'' McHugh said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the final product is generally appreciated.  
</P>
<P>
	Kate Muth of Arlington, Va., who writes an independent trade  
publication called ``Business Mailers' Review,'' said the rate 
increase has caused barely a stir. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't heard too much grousing,'' she said. ``For 33 cents,  
you can get your letter anywhere in the country. And service is 
improving.''

<HEADLINE> Alabama Explosion Kills Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Ala. (AP) -- A natural gas explosion leveled three  
downtown buildings Friday, shattered glass and ripped the tar off 
nearby roofs. Four people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This type of explosion, you just can't imagine it. ... It  
looks like a war zone,'' said Tommy Lands, police chief of 
Stevenson, nine miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the people killed were utility workers. A fourth person  
died in a local hospital later in the day. At least eight people 
were critically injured, and numerous others suffered cuts and 
bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Paul Smith said the late morning blast erupted as  
Bridgeport Utilities employees were working on a gas line. 
Witnesses said the whooshing roar of gas leaving a line could be 
heard after the explosion. The smell of gas lingered in the air for 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ran outside and saw it and the building was just gone,''  
said Misty Flynn, who was shopping in a convenience store. ``A city 
worker came running at me and his face was all bloody. He was 
saying, `It blew my eye out.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The downtown area was evacuated until the leak was contained  
three hours later. Authorities were searching for more possible 
victims as they looked through the damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The flattened structures included a vacant building, one being  
renovated and one used for storage. More than a dozen businesses 
within a two-block radius, including a U.S. Post Office, were 
damaged. The boom of the blast was heard miles away from this 
northeast Alabama town of 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Shattered glass and splintered wood littered streets and  
sidewalks. A utility pole was bent to the left. Bulldozers dug into 
broken glass, scooping up the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical evacuation teams said at least eight critically injured  
victims were taken to area hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Thompson, a car mechanic, said he had spoken with some  
utility workers as they headed to fix the gas line. Thompson saw 
the body of one of the man hundreds of feet away from the site. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the men I just saw laying there was my brother-in-law's  
best friend,'' said Ronnie Peacock, who arrived after hearing the 
explosion. ``They were like brothers. He's going to be devastated. 
It's just unbelievable. Everybody knows everybody here.''

<HEADLINE> Pierce a Dark-Horse for Aussie Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- There was glamor in women's tennis  
before Anna Kournikova sashayed onto court. There were power 
players before the Williams sisters hit town. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever happened to Mary Pierce?  
</P>
<P>
	She won the Australian Open in 1995 and was a finalist in 1997.  
The hip-high bounce of Melbourne's Rebound Ace courts sets up 
perfectly for her crunching groundstrokes. She is the No. 7 seed 
and has lost only 10 games in the first three rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	But nobody is listing her among the contenders.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've noticed that, but it doesn't bother me,'' Pierce said  
Friday. ``There are so many good women players now. The young girls 
get all the attention, and that's natural.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Natural for someone who celebrated her 24th birthday three days  
before this tournament, someone who is between Steffi Graf, a 
veteran at 29, and the new teen queens hogging the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	So, which contenders impress her most?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say the Williams sisters (Venus and Serena),'' she said.  
``Great power. Exciting to watch. They're very athletic, strong, 
confident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce might face both sisters in this tournament, with a  
possible semifinal match against Serena, while Venus is winning in 
the other half of the draw. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Pierce beat Italy's Rita Grande 6-2, 6-2, advancing  
to a fourth-round match against No. 12 Anna Kournikova. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty happy, except with my serve,'' Pierce said. ``I  
definitely will have to step it up another level. I need to be more 
consistent and serve better if I want to give myself a chance to 
beat the top players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce knows about generating excitement, and feeling it.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would say the emotions you feel on court superscede by far  
anything in life,'' she said. ``You love doing it and it's just 
your whole life right there. You have such amazing feelings. 
Nothing else exists for you. You don't even hear the crowd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strong feelings aren't enough. Pierce never sustained the  
buoyant aggression and focused ambition of that 1995 Australian 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt I'd proved something to the people who thought I wasn't  
up to it and I'd proved to myself I could do it,'' she said. ``I 
always knew I had the game, but I didn't have the record. So in '95 
I was very satisfied. I was at No. 3. I was close to my lifetime 
dream of getting to No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably I just got too caught up in things and put so much  
pressure on myself. Tennis became more of a job instead of fun. Now 
the fun is back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are reasons. Memories of the tense relationship with her  
father Jim are fading, as are the strains of assuming a French 
persona and building a French career. 
</P>
<P>
	With a French-born mother, Yannick, and American father,  
Pierce's loyalties have been divided. She opted to play in France 
in 1990, and played 17 matches for her adoptive country in the Fed 
Cup between July 1990 and October 1997. But she won't be playing 
for France this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will always be a French element in me through my mother,  
her family and the times I've spent there,'' she said. ``But I was 
raised in the States, my first language is English and I feel more 
comfortable living in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida is her home state, where she lives with baseball star  
Roberto Alomar. Previously known for her light schedule, she is 
increasing her workload, partly because of Alomar's example -- he 
plays all summer, then goes to Puerto Rico and plays winter ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said to me: `I just love baseball and when I retire I want  
to feel I've had enough,'' Pierce said. ``If you can play, keep 
playing. Same thing in tennis. If you're hot, play.''

<HEADLINE> Albright Steps Up Yugoslavia Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says she  
is lining up U.S. allies to push a series of demands on Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic to end ``new and unacceptable violence 
in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If he keeps rejecting the demands, she said Thursday, the  
Serbian leader runs the risk of a NATO bombardment. ``Force is the 
only language he appears to understand,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, President Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony  
Blair confirmed their growing concern with the situation in Kosovo 
in a 30-minute telephone conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	A White House spokesman, David Leavy, said the two leaders had  
agreed ``the Serb actions are clearly unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They consulted on the next steps and reiterated it is  
important for the security of the region that the international 
community insist on Serb compliance, through the use of force if 
necessary,'' Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic, meanwhile, backed down on evicting William Walker, an  
American diplomat who headed an international inspection team. 
Walker had been threatened with expulsion after expressing horror 
on inspecting the results of a massacre last Friday of 45 ethnic 
Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, head of a 750-person international monitoring team, had  
refused to vacate his offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Suspending that expulsion order is not sufficient action on  
Milosevic's part, Clinton's special envoy, Richard Holbrooke, said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problems we are now facing were caused primarily --  
unfortunately, not exclusively -- by the Yugoslav side and they must 
take corrective action,'' Holbrooke said on ABC's ``Good Morning 
America.'' ``We are moving ahead with NATO this morning to prepare 
for military action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in the midst of making it very clear that Milosevic  
can't choose who the head'' of the monitoring group is going to be, 
Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world is confronted by new and unacceptable violence in  
Kosovo,'' Albright said. The massacre at Racak ``has brought 
tensions to a razor's edge,'' she said as she prepared for a trip 
that will involve consultations with British, French and other 
allies as well as the Russians on the crisis in the Serbian 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the Yugoslav  
government's ``freezing'' of the expulsion order did not resolve 
the problems Milosevic had created. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to insist, and NATO continues to insist, that not  
only the verification mission be permitted and allowed to operate 
independently and without interference'' but also that Milosevic 
withdraw troops and police units from Kosovo, as he promised in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	As Albright took aim at Milosevic, it was clear that the Clinton  
administration -- and much of Europe -- still looked to the Serbian 
leader for a solution to the conflict between Serbs and ethnic 
Albanians, many of whom want to separate from Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	But some members of Congress and analysts suggested other  
approaches, including the stationing of NATO forces in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., and a handful of other senators have  
written to Clinton calling for an explicit U.S. statement that 
Milosevic must be replaced with a democratic government. 
</P>
<P>
	``No American policy to promote a stable and peaceful Balkan  
region can succeed if Serbia remains, as it has since the breakup 
of Yugoslavia, under the grip of a regime that depends on crisis 
for its continued hold on power,'' they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morton Abramowitz, a former U.S. ambassador and ex-director of  
the State Department's intelligence office, has suggested the 
administration pursue independence for the ethnic Albanians, who 
make up about 90 percent of the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic has been a central figure in U.S. diplomacy in the  
Balkans for years. He was courted for the negotiations that 
produced an agreement in November 1995 to end an ethnic war in 
Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the crisis in Kosovo, and the stern U.S. approach to the  
Serbian leader, typified by Albright in her speech Thursday to the 
Center for National Policy, has not spilled over to Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dayton agreements, which ended the war, gave Milosevic a  
prominent role in peacemaking in Bosnia ``and enabled him to 
transform his reputation from Balkan troublemaker to Balkans 
peacemaker,'' said James Hooper, executive director of the Balkan 
Action Council, a group that keeps tabs on the troubled region. 
``He has considerable leverage in Bosnia and could disrupt the 
situation any time he wants to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hooper proposed working with Milosevic ``to some extent,'' but  
working also with the democratic opposition. ``We would create new 
and more effective leaders,'' he said. ``This could result in a 
process gradually leading to democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bosnia agreement is holding, and the likelihood of a  
resumption of fighting is minimal, said George Biddle, vice 
president of the International Crisis Group, a private think tank. 
</P>
<P>
	But the conflict could spread to Macedonia, Albania and  
elsewhere, Biddle said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``Must we deal with Milosevic? He obviously is the president of  
Serbia and he is the man you have to deal with,'' Biddle said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Milosevic is not listening to the United States and the  
allies on Kosovo, Biddle said. So, he said, the best approach is to 
issue an ultimate and not talk to him. ``Nothing else is going to 
work now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Dempsey, an analyst with the Cato Institute, takes a far  
different view. He says NATO air strikes could further entrench 
Milosevic by unifying Serbs behind him, while giving the Kosovo 
Liberation Army an incentive to provoke Serb forces even more.

<HEADLINE> Death Penalty in Womb Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHEATON, Ill. (AP) -- Prosecutors argued Fedell Caffey was doing  
his girlfriend's bidding when he participated in the gruesome 
murders of two children and their mother, whose full-term fetus was 
cut from her womb. 
</P>
<P>
	Like his girlfriend, Caffey is now on death row.  
</P>
<P>
	Caffey, convicted last November of murder and kidnapping,  
repeatedly proclaimed his innocence before he was sentenced Friday. 
His attorneys had argued he was not present during the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	``How I got messed up in this I do not know,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Caffey's girlfriend, Jacqueline Williams,  
hatched the plot because she wanted the unborn child of Debra 
Evans, her cousin and his ex-girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans, 28, and her daughter Samantha, 10, were murdered in their  
apartment in Addison on Nov. 16, 1995. Evans' 7-year-old son, 
Joshua, was abducted and later stabbed to death by Caffey, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her son Jordan, 2, was left unharmed, but Evans' womb was  
slashed and her nearly full-term son removed. He survived, and the 
two boys are being cared for by Evans' father. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're obviously pleased with the outcome,'' said prosecutor  
Joseph Birkett. ``It does give some sense of closure to the family 
and the communities.''

<HEADLINE> More Woes May Be Ahead for IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The night before Sydney was awarded  
the 2000 Summer Games, the Australian Olympic chief sat down to 
dinner with two African IOC members in the swank Riviera resort of 
Monte Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
	During the course of the evening, he offered his two guests  
$70,000 in inducements to vote for Sydney, which defeated Beijing 
by two votes the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of that 1993 encounter were disclosed Friday, the latest  
and one of the most dramatic elements of the rapidly growing 
Olympic corruption scandal that threatens the IOC's leadership and 
the stability of the 2000 and 2002 games. 
</P>
<P>
	An Australian IOC member said the reported payments could put  
the Sydney Games in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, a Libyan official became the second International  
Olympic Committee member to resign in the bribery scandal 
surrounding Salt Lake City's selection as host of the 2002 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend promises more drama with possibly more resignations,  
expulsion recommendations and decisions to overhaul the entire 
Olympic bidding and selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch reiterated he has no  
intention of resigning and that he is determined to lead the 
committee out of its worst crisis ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this moment, I have to be at the head of the IOC more than  
ever,'' he told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	That was before the details of the dinner in Monaco surfaced,  
adding a major new element to what was already the biggest 
corruption scandal in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	``The perception will be quite damaging to Sydney,'' said Kevan  
Gosper, Australia's senior IOC executive board member. ``It's a 
very serious revelation. I think a lot of people will be 
destabilized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Australian newspapers reported that John Coates, president of  
the Australian Olympic Committee and a leader of the 2000 Sydney 
bid, said he offered $35,000 each to the national Olympic 
committees of Kenya and Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
	The offers were made to IOC members Charles Mukora of Kenya and  
Maj. Gen. Francis Nyangweso of Uganda on Sept. 22, 1993, the night 
before the vote, according to Coates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was necessary for us to show our commitment to  
those NOCs with a view to winning those votes,'' Coates told 
Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald. ``My view was it might encourage 
them to consider their votes for Sydney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney won 45-43 in the Monaco voting.  
</P>
<P>
	Coates denied the money was a bribe and said it helped finance  
sports in Kenya and Uganda. Australian reports said the two African 
committees were paid the money between 1994 and 2000 to support 
Olympic sports projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper, who said he had not seen the bid documents, described  
the reported inducements as going ``beyond good will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that John's decision was intended to influence the  
IOC members' thinking,'' Gosper said. ``The perception may not 
match John's intention, the event having taken place the night 
before the vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said the revelations were serious enough to raise the  
issue of whether Sydney should keep the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't rule it out that some may call for the games not to  
proceed in Sydney,'' he told the AP, indicating that even some IOC 
members may feel that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could see the published material being viewed as  
questionable conduct by the candidate city,'' he said. ``But I 
believe the first step should be to stabilize the situation. The 
executive board should reinforce the Monaco decision that Sydney 
should stage the 2000 games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said the difference between alleged misconduct in Salt  
Lake City and Sydney was the margin of votes. 
</P>
<P>
	While Salt Lake City was an overwhelming favorite and won in a  
landslide, Sydney was considered a slight underdog to Beijing. The 
votes of African members were considered crucial in the 2000 race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Chinese reaction will be important,'' he said.  
``There were really only two cities in the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said the IOC will probably decide to order a full-scale  
investigation into Sydney's bid -- similar to the inquiry into the 
Salt Lake Games. 
</P>
<P>
	He called on Sydney officials to release all documents related  
to the bid and send them to the IOC for its inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gosper dismissed suggestions -- raised by IOC vice president  
Dick Pound -- that the committee should open investigations into 
past bids, including those which awarded the 1996 Summer Games to 
Atlanta and 1998 Winter Games to Nagano, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see no reason in taking investigations back to the games  
which have already been held,'' he said. ``I see no logic in 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the Monte Carlo offer were contained in a package of  
previously confidential bid documents released to Australian news 
media by Coates, who was in Australia and not immediately available 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents also disclosed that Coates wrote to Mukora and  
Nyangweso a month before the vote, offering to put them up -- at 
Sydney's expense -- at the luxury Dorchester Hotel in London on 
their way to Monaco. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents also confirmed that Australia, at the time of  
Sydney's bid, offered more than $1 million to pay for an Olympic 
training center for African athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper was a senior official in the Sydney bid, but he said he  
was unaware of the 1993 dinner offers until a journalist called him 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Coates apparently made the decision to release the  
documents ``entirely by himself'' and later sought approval from 
his committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said he had not yet spoken to Coates, but defended him as  
an ``extremely competent'' and ``first-rate'' Olympic chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said he immediately brought the matter to Samaranch's  
attention, and described Samaranch's reaction as ``one of serious 
concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the spreading scandal, Gosper insisted the IOC can  
survive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a crisis that's continuing to escalate, but I don't  
consider it's out of control,'' he said. ``We have a responsibility 
to ensure the institution doesn't crumble. This is a tough one. But 
it's not the end of the world. We are not about to go south.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said the entire executive board stands behind Samaranch.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's the most appropriate person to bring us out of the  
problem,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Samaranch accepted the resignation of Libyan member  
Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi. 
</P>
<P>
	The 61-year-old Attarabulsi, an IOC member since 1977, stepped  
down following revelations that his son, Suhel, received tuition to 
attend an English language center at Brigham Young and a community 
college, plus $700 a month for expenses from Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said Attarabulsi was a ``good man'' who made a  
``mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch did not rule out other resignations this weekend. He  
said seven other members face possible expulsion in the Salt Lake 
case. Four others have been cited for minor violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Finland's Pirjo Haeggman resigned Tuesday. She was implicated  
because her former husband got jobs through bid committees in Salt 
Lake and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has said 13 members were implicated in the IOC's  
investigation into cash payments, college scholarships, free 
medical treatment, lavish gifts and other inducements related to 
Salt Lake's winning bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiry, headed by Pound, has found that the payments and  
gifts to members from Salt Lake City boosters totaled almost 
$800,000, with some members receiving more than $100,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the implicated members are expected to defend themselves  
in person before Pound's commission Saturday. On Sunday, the IOC 
executive board will recommend expulsions of members and propose 
ways of overhauling the entire Olympic bidding and selection 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has called a special IOC assembly for March 17-18 to  
vote on expulsions and ratify the new site-selection procedures.

<HEADLINE> Protestant Leaders Discuss Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pope John Paul II's trip to St. Louis is not  
the only significant religious happening in town. 
</P>
<P>
	Protestant leaders are meeting here trying to revive a plan that  
would bring nine U.S. denominations together. The talks are the 
first since 1988 about creating a union that would count 22.8 
million members. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consultation on Church Union is expected to issue a report  
on whether there is further hope for the merger after the meetings 
adjourn Sunday. The discussions, which began Wednesday, were 
planned well before the papal visit to St. Louis was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	When the process began in 1962, the Protestants intended to  
merge into one ``super-church.'' But church traditions made that 
impractical so the consultation developed a looser concept. The 
denominations would continue to exist but would recognize each 
other's basic doctrines, clergy and sacraments as constituting one 
united church. 
</P>
<P>
	Even that idea has run into trouble. In 1994, the Episcopal  
Church said it was not ready for such a move, and in 1997, regional 
units within the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) roundly defeated 
legislation to enact the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems are not over Christian doctrine but details of  
church government, especially the role of bishops. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved, the Protestant coalition would encompass the  
African Methodist Episcopal Church, African Methodist Episcopal 
Zion Church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Christian 
Methodist Episcopal Church, Episcopal Church, International Council 
of Community Churches, Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), United Church 
of Christ and United Methodist Church.

<HEADLINE> Tornadoes in Arkansas Kill Six </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Tornadoes ripped across the South for  
the second time in less than a week, killing six people in Arkansas 
and leaving thousands of people in three states without power early 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Wave after wave of twisters hit central Arkansas late Thursday  
afternoon and evening, collapsing roofs, knocking down power poles 
and leaving trees strewn about the grounds of the governor's 
mansion. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of eastern Arkansas was under a tornado watch again this  
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lights flickered a couple times, then it went black,''  
said Derrick Stallworth, who was shopping in the Harvest Foods 
grocery when the storm struck. ``I decided to hit the floor, then I 
saw the roof coming down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Severe weather also pounded parts of Mississippi and Louisiana  
late Thursday, but there were no reports of serious injuries. Just 
last Sunday, tornadoes tore through Tennessee, resulting in nine 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were killed in the Little Rock area when trees fell  
on them, and a 67-year-old pharmacist at the damaged supermarket 
died of his injuries this morning. In Beebe, 30 miles to the 
northeast, a 2-month-old baby was blown out of a home and killed 
and another woman was found dead at her home. 
</P>
<P>
	At Center Hill, Searcy school board member Wanda Wilson died  
when her mobile home was hit, Superintendent Tony Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just lucky to be alive,'' Kelton Keathley said after a  
tornado wrecked his lot in Beebe. 
</P>
<P>
	``It swept everything up,'' said Lulynn, his daughter.  
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas utilities said the storms left 72,000 customers without  
power, and authorities opened five shelters from the Little Rock 
area to Newark, 90 miles to the northeast. Forecasters said perhaps 
as many as 30 tornadoes hit the state, though it will be days 
before field checks can confirm an exact number. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm that hit Little Rock began southwest of the city,  
passed near the state's Fair Grounds and entered a residential area 
that includes the governor's mansion. Gov. Mike Huckabee said he 
and his family were fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going out to help my neighbors,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The storm passed through a section of town that includes some of  
the city's oldest homes, knocking down trees, some of them 100 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a real one, in the sky and coming down. Black and  
white. So many different colors,'' said Michelle Johnson, 
describing the tornado after it hit the Harvest Foods store. 
</P>
<P>
	The front of the grocery collapsed inward while 15 or so  
customers, including Stallworth, shopped inside. Seconds later, the 
storm had passed and he was pulling others to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some aisles you couldn't even see down,'' Stallworth said.  
Firefighters used scent-seeking dogs to make sure no one was 
missed. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 60 people were injured, including 45 in Little Rock.  
Parts of the state also reported grapefruit-size hail. 
</P>
<P>
	In Alexandria, La., an apparent tornado ripped apart businesses  
and downed electrical lines, cutting power to hundreds of 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was something you could just feel it encircling you,'' said  
Rhonda Baker as she surveyed the damage to a mall where she was 
working late processing tax loans. ``My ears started popping as 
everything went black I couldn't see nothing -- and I could feel the 
building shaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexandria police Lt. Sherman King said he could not begin to  
explain the damage to the city's southwest side. He said police 
were posted to watch for looters in the city 200 miles northwest of 
New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Another tornado flipped a tractor-trailer over on Interstate 20  
near Tallulah, State Police said. The truck, along with a few other 
vehicles, ended up in the median but no one was seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Mobile homes, trees and power lines were also damaged by high  
winds in Mississippi. In Greenville, just across the Mississippi 
River from Louisiana, Lori Wilkins recalled the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just like when you watch TV and these big funnel clouds  
pick up every kind of debris,'' she said. ``It was just like 
watching something like what I see on `National Geographic.'''

<HEADLINE>  Sprewell Says He Is a Good Guy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RYE, N.Y. (AP) -- He said he was sorry at least 10 times, asked  
for a second chance a half-dozen times, was quick with a smile, 
seemed at ease and sounded genuinely ready to get back to playing 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Could this be the same Latrell Sprewell who has been so widely  
portrayed as such a bad guy? 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm out to start all over and show people the real me,''  
Sprewell said Friday. ``P.J. is not a bad guy, and I'm here to show 
you guys that I'm not, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a contrite Sprewell who spoke Friday at a news conference  
just a few hours after he met with commissioner David Stern and was 
reinstated to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	He was caught in one exaggeration, claiming he had only one  
technical foul in his six-year career when he actually had six, but 
he also sounded like a man who looking forward to putting his 
darkest moment behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, acquired Thursday by the Knicks in exchange for John  
Starks, Chris Mills and Terry Cummings, repeatedly referred to his 
attack on Golden State coach P.J. Carlesimo by saying, ``I had a 
bad day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry. We all make mistakes. I'm not the person I've been  
portrayed to be,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened in December of '97 will never happen again with  
me, and hopefully not with any other players ever again. I'm 
looking for a fresh new start, and I'm going to be a positive 
person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proof, of course, won't come until Sprewell starts playing  
and makes it through some challenges from a new coach, who might 
set him off by saying something as innocuous as ``put a little more 
mustard on those passes'' -- as Carlesimo did. 
</P>
<P>
	Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy didn't seem to be the least bit  
worried, saying he only wants to coach Sprewell, not judge him. 
</P>
<P>
	Still uncertain is the reception he'll receive from a skeptical  
public. 
</P>
<P>
	New York fans have traditionally been eager to give sports  
figures a second chance, from Billy Martin and Darryl Strawberry in 
baseball to Lawrence Taylor in football and Marv Albert in 
broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
	Few Knicks fans probably remember Sprewell scoring a then  
career-high 41 points against the Knicks at Madison Square Garden 
on Feb. 10, 1994, and many of them only know him for his attack on 
his coach during practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the past 14 months I've talked to my mom and have had  
conversations with numerous people who gave me advice on how to 
handle situations when I'm frustrated, and I think that was my 
biggest problem,'' Sprewell said. ``The lesson is that you make 
mistakes, but you also have to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell was suspended for 68 games last season. His contract  
was terminated but later reinstated by an arbitrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell has also been involved in a reckless driving accident,  
lawsuits against his former agent and the NBA, and a fight with 
former teammate Jerome Kersey. 
</P>
<P>
	If Sprewell can lead New York to its first title since 1973, he  
may get the royal treatment yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team already has a good nucleus. Hopefully I'll be the  
extra added piece that you all have been looking for,'' he said. 
``Defensively, that's going to be my main role -- to be a stopper. 
Obviously, I have scoring potential, the ability to score points, 
and I want to do that as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell can begin practicing with the Knicks tonight, and will  
play his first exhibition game next Wednesday against New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	New York made two more moves Friday, signing Mavericks free  
agent power forward Kurt Thomas to a two-year contract by using the 
$1.75 million exception and re-signing 40-year-old center Herb 
Williams.

<HEADLINE>  Barnett's Heart Leads Back to Colo. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- He's not sure what kind of talent he has  
to work with, and he's still trying to learn everyone's name. But 
Gary Barnett has not forgotten what's important to Colorado 
football fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realize coming home means not losing to Nebraska,'' Barnett  
said Friday as he was introduced as Colorado's 22nd head coach, 
``because the last three years I was here, that didn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett's Colorado roots go deeper than his eight seasons as an  
assistant under Bill McCartney. He spent 11 years as a high school 
coach in Colorado Springs and two seasons at Fort Lewis College in 
Durango. 
</P>
<P>
	When Rick Neuheisel left Colorado for Washington earlier this  
month, Barnett became a logical choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a phone call from Gary, and I must admit my heart leaped  
a little bit,'' Barnett's wife, Mary, said, ``but in this 
profession, there's so many things that go on, you never really 
know what's really real and what's not. Until things are done, I 
try real hard to stay calm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Barnetts' resolve was tested as initial negotiations with  
Colorado athletic director Dick Tharp broke down, and the Buffs 
turned their attention to Denver Broncos offensive coordinator Gary 
Kubiak. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubiak withdrew from consideration last Sunday, returning the  
focus to the Barnetts in Evanston, Ill. Five days later, Barnett 
was celebrating a homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision here has been made from the heart,'' Barnett  
said. ``The decision to come here was what was in Mary's heart and 
my heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Board of Regents unanimously approved Barnett's  
five-year contract that will pay him $710,000 per season. Barnett's 
salary at Northwestern was about $480,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Because he had an 11-year contract with the Wildcats, Barnett  
will have to cover the school's $250,000 buyout clause. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a significant financial sacrifice -- a significant  
financial sacrifice for me to do this,'' Barnett said. ``It 
probably wasn't one that my financial adviser would tell me to do. 
It was just one of those things that's right in your heart, and you 
do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Northwestern, Barnett promised to take the ``Purple to  
Pasadena'' -- a reference to the Wildcats' four-decade absence from 
the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	He fulfilled that promise in 1995, completing a remarkable  
resurrection at Northwestern. Though the task is not as daunting at 
Colorado, Barnett's goal in Boulder is to ``Return to Dominance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players already are jumping on board.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am interested in what he will do, but at the same time his  
reputation speaks for itself,'' said quarterback Adam Bledsoe, whom 
Barnett recruited while at Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Barnett is hoping to make up for lost time. Neuheisel's  
departure left Colorado in limbo with high school recruits who 
weren't ready to commit to a school without a coach. 
</P>
<P>
	In hopes of minimizing the damage, Barnett said he plans to meet  
personally with every player who has committed to Colorado. He also 
plans to visit the home of each player returning next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is going to take me between now and June to get done,''  
Barnett said. ``But that relationship that they had with the coach 
that recruited them and the head coach that was here at the time 
has been lost. That is a very sensitive item.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In seven seasons at Northwestern, Barnett compiled a 35-45-1  
record and took the Wildcats to two bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, Barnett was a Colorado assistant under McCartney  
from 1984-91, serving as the quarterbacks coach for the Buffs team 
that went 11-1-1 to earn a share of the 1990 national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett had an 8-11-1 record in two seasons as coach at Fort  
Lewis.

bad day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry. We all make mistakes. I'm not the person I've been  
portrayed to be,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened in December of '97 will never happen again with  
me, and hopefully not with any other players ever again. I'm 
looking for a fresh new start, and I'm going to be a positive 
person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proof, of course, won't come until Sprewell starts playing  
and makes it through some challenges from a new coach, who might 
set him off by saying something as innocuous as ``put a little more 
mustard on those passes'' -- as Carlesimo did. 
</P>
<P>
	Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy didn't seem to be the least bit  
worried, saying he only wants to coach Sprewell, not judge him. 
</P>
<P>
	Still uncertain is the reception he'll receive from a skeptical  
public. 
</P>
<P>
	New York fans have traditionally been eager to give sports  
figures a second chance, from Billy Martin and Darryl Strawberry in 
baseball to Lawrence Taylor in football and Marv Albert in 
broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
	Few Knicks fans probably remember Sprewell scoring a then  
career-high 41 points against the Knicks at Madison Square Garden 
on Feb. 10, 1994, and many of them only know him for his attack on 
his coach during practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the past 14 months I've talked to my mom and have had  
conversations with numerous people who gave me advice on how to 
handle situations when I'm frustrated, and I think that was my 
biggest problem,'' Sprewell said. ``The lesson is that you make 
mistakes, but you also have to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell was suspended for 68 games last season. His contract  
was terminated but later reinstated by an arbitrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell has also been involved in a reckless driving accident,  
lawsuits against his former agent and the NBA, and a fight with 
former teammate Jerome Kersey. 
</P>
<P>
	If Sprewell can lead New York to its first title since 1973, he  
may get the royal treatment yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team already has a good nucleus. Hopefully I'll be the  
extra added piece that you all have been looking for,'' he said. 
``Defensively, that's going to be my main role -- to be a stopper. 
Obviously, I have scoring potential, the ability to score points, 
and I want to do that as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell can begin practicing with the Knicks tonight, and will  
play his first exhibition game next Wednesday against New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	New York made two more moves Friday, signing Mavericks free  
agent power forward Kurt Thomas to a two-year contract by using the 
$1.75 million exception and re-signing 40-year-old center Herb 
Williams.

<HEADLINE> Simon Hired As Ravens RB Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENTON, Texas (AP) -- Matt Simon, fired as North Texas' coach  
after his team went 4-7 in 1997, has been hired to coach the 
Baltimore Ravens' running backs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Matt is a long-time college coach and one of the most  
respected men in our profession,'' new head coach Brian Billick 
Friday said in a statement. ``His experience will help us, and he's 
an important and excellent addition to the staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In four seasons, Simon compiled a 18-26-1 record. The team  
finished 4-7 overall and 2-3 in the Big West Conference in 1997. 
During his first season, UNT was 7-4-1 and won the Southland 
Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon led North Texas from Division I-AA to Division I-A status  
in 1995. But he reportedly disagreed with athletics director Craig 
Helwig on a number of key topics, including scheduling and 
financial support for the football program. 
</P>
<P>
	While he has some bad memories of his final days in Denton,  
Simon said he won't cut all ties to the university. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have adopted a lot of friends here and relationships that I  
will want to keep,'' he told the Denton Record-Chronicle. ``I don't 
leave here regretting the experience.''

<HEADLINE> Cunningham Named Chiefs Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Gunther Cunningham figures that having  
spent his coaching career plotting how to stop an offense, he's 
learned a little bit about how to make one go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really believe I have a creative mind in the game of  
football, whether it's offense or defense,'' Cunningham said Friday 
after he was promoted from defensive coordinator of the Kansas City 
Chiefs to head coach to succeed Marty Schottenheimer. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiefs president and general manager Carl Peterson said  
Cunningham had ``unbelievable thoughts'' about offense, presumably 
all of them good thoughts as he takes over a 7-9 team that 
apparently wore down Schottenheimer after 10 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham's defensive credentials are impeccable -- the Chiefs  
led the NFL in scoring defense in 1995 and 1997, and lead the AFC 
since 1995 with a plus-30 in turnover margin. 
</P>
<P>
	Any worry that Cunningham would have trouble devising an offense  
was overwhelmed by the respect that he has earned within the 
organization and among the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a player's coach,'' Peterson said. ``They listen to him  
because they respect him. He will get them to respond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That became an issue amid the signs -- an embarrassing display of  
poor sportsmanship on Monday night, NFL records in penalties -- that 
Schottenheimer had lost control of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've got good football players,'' Cunningham said.  
``I'm looking forward to making our football players play the game 
the way I believe it should be played. I think they're trying to 
come back and show everybody what they can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham said there would be no change from Schottenheimer's  
decision that Elvis Grbac is the ``quarterback of the future,'' 
although he has been injured in each of the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Backup Rich Gannon played well last year even after Grbac had  
recovered from an opening game shoulder injury. Gannon, a free 
agent, is likely to sign with a team that will give him an 
opportunity to be a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``What are we going to do on offense? Well, I think I've got an  
idea or two since I've practiced this trade for 18 years in how to 
stop them,'' Cunningham said. ``I believe I know what it takes to 
move the football. I think we have tremendous players here. We can 
be explosive on offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On defense, Cunningham said he was confident that Derrick Thomas  
can come back from a poor season. The Chiefs devised an alignment 
they thought would maximize Thomas' pass-rushing ability, but it 
was a failure and Cunningham said the team would likely return to a 
more standard alignment that had Thomas back at linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know Derrick Thomas can still make the plays,'' Cunningham  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham, 52, was born in Germany and becomes the fourth  
foreign-born coach in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	He began his coaching career in 1969 at Oregon, his alma mater,  
and became a pro coach with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the CFL in 
1981. He was a defensive assistant with the Colts, San Diego 
Chargers and Los Angeles Raiders before joining Schottenheimer's 
staff in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	He had also been considered a leading candidate for the Chicago  
Bears' job. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham admits to being an emotional coach and says that will  
not change. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am euphoric at finally getting this opportunity,'' said  
Cunningham, who moved to the United States at the age of 12 when 
his mother married an American serviceman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have sat through meeting after meeting after meeting to  
learn and learn and I am ready to put my mark on a football team. I 
happen to wear my feelings on my sleeve. I will not change,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Players will play for him,'' said Chiefs second-year running  
back Rashaan Shehee. ``When you're doing something wrong he'll 
explain it to you, but if he has to get in your face, he'll get in 
your face. When you're doing something right, he'll pat you on the 
back.''

<HEADLINE> Hoffman Wins Suit Against Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A judge ordered Los Angeles Magazine on  
Friday to pay $1.5 million to Dustin Hoffman for publishing a 
computer-altered image of the actor in an evening gown and heels 
without his permission. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer-generated photo layout in the March 1997 issue of  
Los Angeles Magazine was titled ``Grand Illusions'' and it featured 
classic movie stills with actors in the latest fashions. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian, who called Hoffman ``one  
of our country's living treasures,'' said another hearing will be 
held Jan. 28 to decide the amount of punitive damages to award the 
actor. 
</P>
<P>
	During the four-day trial, Hoffman testified that he was turned  
him into an unpaid fashion model. He attended each day of trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor, who played a man masquerading as a woman in the 1982  
film ``Tootsie,'' filed the $5 million lawsuit in 1997 after the 
magazine published the layout. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were to be asked to be a model selling clothes, it would  
be worth millions of dollars,'' Hoffman, 61, testified under 
cross-examination Jan. 12. ``But if I were to do a commercial, I 
hardly think it would be selling clothes, male or female.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman alleged violation of publicity rights in his suit  
against Fairchild Publications Inc., owner and publisher of the 
magazine, and its parent, Disney-owned Capital Cities/ABC Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Magazine attorney Steven Perry didn't immediately return  
telephone calls placed to his office.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The owner of DirecTV, the nation's biggest  
satellite television service, is buying its No. 2 rival Primestar 
Inc., leaving only two major players to compete with cable by 
beaming TV signals into homes through pizza-sized satellite dishes. 
The $1.82 billion deal announced today, along with DirecTV's 
pending purchase of a movie-channel service, will give DirecTV 
about 7 million U.S. subscribers and more than 370 channels. Its 
closest competitor, EchoStar Communications Corp., has about 2

float against the dollar. The Central Bank began selling dollars to 
support the real, which strengthened somewhat but soon headed down 
again. Markets were jittery despite good news from Brazil's 
congress, where the lower house passed a key bill that aimed to 
reduce the government's budget deficit and instill new investor 
confidence in Brazil's willingness to make painful economic 
reforms.

its own doctors recommended at a hospital outside the plan's

County jury founding Aetna committed ``malice, oppression and

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Abortion Clinic Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Abortion clinics could use federal funds for  
alarm systems, bulletproof windows and closed-circuit camera 
systems, under a White House plan to counter clinic violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is seeking $4.5 million to enable clinics to  
bolster security measures and pay for security assessments to 
determine which clinics are most at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton made the announcement today in  
a speech to the National Abortion Rights Action League on the 26th 
anniversary of the Supreme Court's landmark Roe vs. Wade ruling 
that legalized abortion nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, thousands of anti-abortion advocates gathered on a  
grassy area just south of the White House to sing, pray, wave signs 
and demand an end to what one speaker called ``the unseemly and 
aggressive persecution of children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., called on the crowd to fast and  
pray that President Clinton and Vice President Gore take steps to 
make abortion illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The scandals that have rocked the White House pale to near  
insignificance when compared to the anti-child policies so 
methodically pursued by our abortion president and his 
administration,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the 26th time the March for Life had organized a  
massive rally and march to the Supreme Court and the Capitol on the 
anniversary of the Supreme Court decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are touching the hearts and minds of people more and  
more,'' said Teresa Snyder of South Hampton, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must work to make abortion safe, legal and rare,'' Mrs.  
Clinton told an abortion-rights crowd in a ballroom at the Omni 
Shoreham Hotel. ``Violence, harassment and intimidation have no 
place in our health care system or in the debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She saluted slain obstetrician Barnett Slepian of Amherst, N.Y.,  
who was shot to death in October. She suggested an appropriate way 
to honor him is to ``make sure doctors are trained and available to 
provide health care to women all over our nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When doctors are murdered or clinics are bombed, she said,  
``This is not free speech. This is domestic terrorism and it must 
stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She emphasized the importance of providing contraceptives and  
health counseling to young women and men to avoid teen pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
	The money the president is seeking, to be included in the budget  
proposal for fiscal 2000, also would help clinics purchase motion 
detectors and improved lighting, according to a senior 
administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think with the escalation of violence waged against abortion  
provider clinics, this is good news,'' said Belle Taylor-McGhee, 
spokeswoman for NARAL. She stressed the need for doctors, abortion 
providers and women to all have safe access to clinics, which 
provide a variety of health services. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good first step, and it's important that the  
administration is taking domestic terrorism seriously,'' said 
Jacquelyn Lendsey, vice president of public policy for Planned 
Parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, Attorney General Janet Reno set up a national task  
force to prosecute and prevent attacks and threats against abortion 
providers. The announcement was made a month after Slepian, an 
abortion provider, was killed by a rifle shot fired into his home. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force plans to train local law enforcement and abortion  
providers in how to respond to and prevent such attacks and 
establish a national database with all information on clinic 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey released Thursday by the Feminist Majority Foundation  
showed that in the first seven months of 1998, 22 percent of 
clinics experienced one or more forms of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	These included blockades, invasions, bomb threats and bombings,  
arson threats and arsons, chemical attacks, death threats and 
stalking. This was a slight decrease from 25 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But the foundation's president, Eleanor Smeal, said even the  
current percentage of clinics that ``are battered day after day 
with violence is unconscionable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also found clinics that reported law enforcement  
response as ``excellent'' experienced lower levels of violence than 
those that characterized local law enforcement as ``poor.''

<HEADLINE> Gingrich To Retain Security Detail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Threats against former House Speaker Newt  
Gingrich have led authorities to keep a security detail assigned to 
him even though he has left public office. 
</P>
<P>
	Such security teams usually are reserved for former holders of  
higher government offices -- such as president -- and this is the 
first time one has been assigned to a former speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich's team will remain in place until authorities decide  
it's no longer needed, U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Dan Nichols said in 
a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Security officers have been assigned to Gingrich since 1995,  
when he was elected speaker shortly after the GOP's 1994 takeover 
of Congress, because of threats against his safety, Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Gingrich has been the subject of various threats during  
his tenure as speaker,'' Nichols said. ``The level and frequency of 
threats compelled the U.S. Capitol Police to exercise its authority 
to take reasonable and prudent measures to protect the speaker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The expense of the detail will be paid for with money  
traditionally set aside for former speakers to maintain an office 
and staff. Gingrich has declined to use that money to pay for his 
current office, said Gingrich spokesman Mark Shields said.

 *Geologists Speculate on Noah's Flood    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- What?! New scientific proof demonstrating that  
the great biblical Flood really did occur thousands of years ago? 
</P>
<P>
	Such is the sensational but speculative implication in the new  
book ``Noah's Flood: The New Scientific Discoveries About the Event 
That Changed History'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25) by William Ryan and 
Walter Pitman. The authors are adjunct geology professors at 
Columbia University and senior scientists at the Lamont-Doherty 
Earth Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
	Some biblical fundamentalists have expended great energy  
searching for the remains of Noah's ark. However, before they break 
out the non-alcoholic champagne to celebrate, they should know that 
the two scientists see no evidence for a worldwide deluge in line 
with a strictly literal reading of Genesis 7. 
</P>
<P>
	But geological research does find reason to believe there was  
indeed a vast, sudden and deadly flood around 5,600 B.C., close 
enough to the possible time of Noah to fascinate biblical 
literalists and liberals alike. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ryan-Pitman scenario was first publicized in a British  
television documentary in late 1996. The following year they laid 
out the technical data in the journal ``Marine Geology,'' but that 
scientific report avoided the all-important links with the biblical 
Flood that are central to the current book. 
</P>
<P>
	Till now the best stab at modern scientific corroboration of the  
Flood was the work of British archeologist Charles Leonard Woolley, 
who caused a sensation with his 1929 book ``Ur of the Chaldees,'' 
said to be the most widely read archeology book ever published. 
</P>
<P>
	Digging in present-day Iraq at the site of ancient Ur,  
birthplace of the first patriarch Abraham, the Bible-believing 
Woolley found an ancient blanket of waterborne silt without human 
remains. It was evidence of a deadly flood that appeared to 
substantiate Genesis. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ryan and Pitman say later scholars learned that this silt  
layer covered only a few square miles. Thus it was no more 
significant than many other localized floods in the region of the 
Tigris and Euphrates rivers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ryan-Pitman candidate for the great Flood locale is what we  
know as the Black Sea, bordering Turkey to the north. In 1993, Ryan 
and Pitman joined a Russian expedition on the Black Sea and used 
the latest technology to examine evidence of geological patterns, 
soil layers and forms of aquatic life that existed in ancient 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	One telltale clue: Freshwater mollusks with smashed shells gave  
way to salt-water creatures that had intact shells, a biological 
transition that could be dated through carbon-14 testing of the 
shell remains. 
</P>
<P>
	From such research, the scientists spin this scenario:  
</P>
<P>
	Until about 5600 B.C. the Black Sea was an inland fresh-water  
lake, considerably smaller than today's salt-water sea and lying 
far below the level of the Mediterranean Sea. Then the sea waters 
broke through a natural dam that existed at the Bosporus strait, 
the waterway adjoining present-day Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
	The flood was unusually sudden, powerful and deadly because sea  
waters were driven by the full force of the Mediterranean. It 
lasted a long time because all the world's oceans continually 
pushed in new water to keep the Mediterranean at constant sea 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	By their calculations, the water would have rushed through at 50  
mph with the power of Niagara Falls 200 times over. The waters 
inundated farmlands and drove the surviving inhabitants into other 
regions, including the areas to the south where flood stories were 
to be written down. 
</P>
<P>
	Surely, the authors contend, such a radical and frightening  
flood would have been burned into the permanent memory of the 
survivors and succeeding generations. 
</P>
<P>
	But the weak link in their theory comes right there. Could the  
flood story have been preserved for thousands of years before it 
reached the form we know from the biblical Genesis 6-8 and the 
similar narrative in pagan Babylon's Gilgamesh epic? 
</P>
<P>
	The geologists think that's not a stretch; others will doubtless  
disagree. 
</P>
<P>
	Biblical purists will note that Noah's flood was caused by  
rainfall, not the onrushing oceans depicted by the geologists. Also 
the biblical flood was temporary, not permanent as in the new 
theory. 
</P>
<P>
	Further input from Bible experts would have made this book even  
more intriguing. Among the matters Ryan and Pitman do not explore: 
</P>
<P>
	Is there any correlation between the ``mountains of Ararat''  
where Noah's ark eventually hit ground, according to Genesis 8:4, 
and the peak known as Mount Ararat in present-day Turkey, not all 
that far from the shores of the Black Sea? 
</P>
<P>
	And does their estimate that the Black Sea surge lasted for 300  
days have some relation to the nearly identical ten-month period in 
Genesis 8:5 between the start of Noah's Flood and the receding of 
the waters?

<HEADLINE> USDA Defends New Food Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The incidence of salmonella is decreasing in  
the nation's chicken, beef and pork supplies, the Agriculture 
Department says, despite criticism from government inspectors that 
the food inspection system is not working. 
</P>
<P>
	In a nine-month progress report on the Hazard Analysis and  
Critical Control Point program, the department said salmonella had 
decreased by 50 percent in chicken. The report, released Thursday, 
found that 20 percent of chicken carcasses tested positive for the 
bacteria before the program, known as HACCP, compared with 10.7 
percent under HACCP. 
</P>
<P>
	For pork, there was a drop of more than 25 percent with 8.7  
percent of swine testing positive before the new system and 6.2 
percent afterwards. With ground beef, 7.5 percent tested positive 
before and 4.3 percent afterwards -- a decline of more than 40 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system really does improve food safety,'' said Catherine  
Woteki, USDA's undersecretary for food safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The hazard analysis program was put into use last year by 300 of  
the largest processing plants. Nearly 3,000 smaller plants begin 
implementing it on Monday. The smallest plants will join the system 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	With institution of HACCP, plants replaced the longtime system  
of poking carcasses for visual signs of disease with a method that 
involves checking meat throughout the food production system for 
such things as fecal contamination and proper temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	``For almost 100 years neither law nor regulation required meat  
and poultry companies to produce clean, safe products. We've come a 
long way,'' said Carol Tucker Foreman, coordinator for the Safe 
Food Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	But government inspectors say problems remain. They say the  
agency wants to phase out inspectors and allow the industry mostly 
to regulate itself. At a news conference Wednesday, they complained 
of being powerless to stop problems with meat, including an 
instance of meat tainted with diesel fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Billy, administrator of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection  
Service, said there are no plans to eliminate the inspectors. But 
the agency is seeking ways to move some inspectors from the plant 
and into other areas of the food chain such as distribution 
warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy said the goal is to make ``a net improvement in food  
safety while at the same time maintaining the other consumer 
protections.''

<HEADLINE>  Falcons May Cash In on New Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Suddenly, the Atlanta Falcons are a  
marketing director's dream. 
</P>
<P>
	They've got their own dance, a catchy nickname, an inspirational  
coach and their first trip to the Super Bowl. Now, it's time to 
cash in. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got a town that's just on fire for this football  
team,'' Rob Jackson, vice president of marketing and sales, said. 
``Everybody wants to have a piece of this football team, which is 
exciting to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long one of the NFL's dormant franchises, the Falcons are hoping  
their improbable season will generate some enthusiasm for the rest 
of 1999. Specifically, it is imperative for the team to increase a 
season-ticket base that didn't even reach 30,000 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a perfect home record and the first NFC West title in 18  
years, Atlanta produced only two sellouts for eight regular-season 
games at the 71,228-seat Georgia Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to lower the bar,'' Jackson said Friday. ``You lower  
the bar by getting more season tickets in the house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falconmania had resulted in a hefty boost in sales over the past  
six weeks. The team has taken more than 3,800 refundable deposits 
for the 1999 season, which is nearly double the 2,000 or so new 
season-ticket packages that were sold all last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the team has a long way to go to create the kind of  
demand that exists in cities like Green Bay, where there are long 
waiting lists for season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a totally different situation than any I've ever been  
involved in,'' said Dan Reeves, who previously worked in Dallas, 
Denver and New York, all pro football hotbeds. ``We got a few 
people turned around a little bit at the end of the season (by 
winning six of the last eight games), but we still didn't see a 
drastic chance during the offseason as far as ticket sales.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``I think they're about as turned on right now as we  
can get 'em turned on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some fans hanging around the team's suburban training complex,  
hoping to snag a few autographs, wondered why the team hasn't 
launched a more aggressive season-ticket campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons have focused their advertising on newspapers so far,  
ignoring the broader appeal of television because local stations 
are devoting so much air time to the team anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been listening on TV, but I haven't heard anything about  
pre-sales,'' said Malcolm Cash, a potential new customer who lives 
less than two miles from the team headquarters. ``I would think 
they'd be talking about it. I guess everybody's concerned about 
getting Super Bowl tickets. But when it's over, people might change 
their minds in a hurry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said the Falcons, who usually begin their season-ticket  
campaign in April, plan to strike at potential buyers as soon as 
the Super Bowl is over. A championship would provide an enticing 
element for the advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've not done a lot of marketing, a lot of advertising at  
this time,'' he said. ``We've got a game a week from Sunday, so our 
strategy is still 60 minutes shy of what this (campaign) is going 
to look like. But we'll be aggressive while the excitement and 
momentum is there during the month of February, then we'll pick 
back up around draft time'' in April. 
</P>
<P>
	No advertising campaign could duplicate the marketing that has  
evolved naturally. The players got it started when they nicknamed 
themselves the ``Dirty Birds'' and developed an arm-flapping dance 
of the same name to celebrate touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, the city was galvanized by the plight of Reeves,  
who underwent heart bypass surgery with two games left in the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons kept on winning while Reeves was recovering at home,  
then he made an inspirational return for the divisional playoff 
victory over San Francisco. Last week, Atlanta shocked heavily 
favored Minnesota in the NFC championship game, rallying for a 
30-27 overtime victory in one of the great postseason games in 
league history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's that magical type season that every franchise dreams  
of,'' Jackson said. ``You can't manufacture the kind of stuff 
that's happening out there. If we tried to contrive a Dirty Bird 
song or a Dirty Bird logo, it couldn't have happened. It happened 
because the fans got excited and the players got into it. These 
guys are having fun with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So is Jackson, who optimistically hopes to increase the  
season-ticket base to 45,000 next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to be easy. It will take a lot of work,'' he  
said. ``But this marketplace is excited about this football team.''

<HEADLINE> Busing Changed Boston Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- White flight and a burgeoning immigrant population  
have so changed the racial makeup of some parts of Boston that the 
city is contemplating abandoning widespread busing. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five years ago, Boston was the scene of some of the  
country's fiercest protests against court-ordered desegregation. 
But blacks, Hispanics and Asians now constitute about 85 percent of 
the city's 64,000 public school students, up from 48 percent when 
busing began. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, most areas of the city -- including the once  
lily-white South Boston, where the worst trouble took place in the 
early 1970s -- are now racially and ethnically diverse. 
</P>
<P>
	The change has prompted Mayor Thomas M. Menino to propose  
building five new schools in the city and returning to ``walk-to 
schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal has some people concerned that it will simply be a  
return to the old days. After all, integration is still not 
complete. Roxbury, one of Boston's poorest sections, is almost 
uniformly black; West Roxbury, one of the wealthiest, is almost 
uniformly white. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're not paying attention to what goes on, history has a  
tendency to repeat itself,'' Leonard Alkins, president of the 
Boston branch of the National Association for the Advancement of 
Colored People, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1972, the NAACP sued the city, charging that black children  
weren't getting an equal education. What resulted was court-ordered 
busing and the enduring images of parents hurling epithets and 
rocks at school buses. 
</P>
<P>
	As in other U.S. cities, many whites pulled their children out  
of the public schools. Others moved to the suburbs. As the white 
population dwindled, the minority population boomed. Immigrants 
from Asia, Africa and Latin America poured into Boston, and had a 
higher birth rate than the whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago, Boston was released from direct court  
supervision, but there are monitoring committees to ensure that the 
schools maintain racial balance. If they do not, the city can be 
hauled back into court. 
</P>
<P>
	The city came up with a new racial-balance formula, still in  
place today, that bases school assignments on race and parent 
choice. About two-thirds of the school system's students are now 
bused under this formula. 
</P>
<P>
	But because of Boston's large minority population, ``you're  
taking predominantly minority children and putting them on a bus, 
shuffling the deck,'' and sending them to schools that are mostly 
minority anyway, said City Councilor Peggy Davis-Mullen, who is 
white and represents South Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current formula, parents more often than not opt  
against the school down the street. But the mayor believes more 
parents will want to send their children to schools nearby if new 
buildings are added to the equation. 
</P>
<P>
	Even under the mayor's plan, busing would still be necessary  
because of a shortage of schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal needs the approval of the school board. But the  
plan is still being drawn up, and no vote is scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	The renewed discussion about busing is so far proving far less  
controversial than in the 1970s. School board meetings and public 
hearings on the subject have drawn few participants. 
</P>
<P>
	Many black leaders now believe that integration -- while  
important -- is less crucial than fixing the school system, which is 
plagued by poor test scores and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``People want a quality education system and if it means they  
have to put their kid on a yellow bus, they will do it,'' said 
Loretta Roach, executive director of City Wide Educational 
Coalition, which was appointed by the federal courts to monitor 
Boston's racial compliance.

                        *Roderick M. Chisholm    	
</P>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Roderick M. Chisholm, an influential  
figure in contemporary philosophy, died Tuesday at age 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Chisholm, who taught for four decades in the philosophy  
department at Brown University, was a leading thinker in the branch 
of philosophy known as epistemology, or theory of knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	His 1957 book, titled ``Perceiving: A Philosophical Study,''  
tackled a metaphysical issue that has been debated by philosophers 
for centuries -- whether you can trust your senses to give you 
reliable knowledge of the outside world. A realist, Chisholm 
concluded that you can. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, he was selected to be the subject of a volume in the  
``Library of Living Philosophers,'' a collection that examines the 
views of the world's great thinkers. In that series, Chisholm's 
thoughts joined those of 24 other 20th century intellectual giants, 
including Bertrand Russell, John Paul Sartre and Albert Einstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Chisholm's many publications are ``Realism and the  
Background of Phenomenology'' and ``The Princeton Studies: 
Humanistic Scholarship in America.'' 

</P>

</P>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Eugene S. Pulliam, who started out  
delivering newspapers as a school boy and rose to be publisher of 
The Indianapolis Star and The Indianapolis News, died Wednesday. He 
was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	The Star won the Pulitzer Prize twice during his tenure for  
investigations on police corruption and medical malpractice. 
</P>
<P>
	Pulliam got his first newspaper job as a grade school boy  
delivering papers for the Lebanon Reporter, which his father, 
Eugene C. Pulliam, had purchased, and The News. 
</P>
<P>
	Pulliam joined United Press in 1935, which later became United  
Press International, working in the news service's bureaus in 
Chicago, Detroit and Buffalo, N.Y. He became news director at radio 
station WIRE in Indianapolis in 1936, then also owned by his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
	After World War II, he joined the Star, which his father bought  
in 1944, working as aviation editor, assistant city editor and city 
editor. When the elder Pulliam bought the afternoon News in 1948, 
Pulliam became the paper's managing editor. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1953, he served on a special committee formed to investigate  
Sen. Joseph McCarthy's attack on New York Post editor James 
Wechsler. Pulliam concluded McCarthy was ``not only a threat to the 
freedom of the press, but also a peril to America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1962, Pulliam became assistant publisher of The Star and The  
News, taking over as publisher of the papers when his father died 
in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years earlier, Pulliam was appointed executive vice  
president of Central Newspapers, the parent company of the Pulliam 
newspaper group and publisher of the Indianapolis newspapers, The 
Muncie Star and The Muncie Press -- later combined as the Star Press 
-- The Vincennes Sun-Commercial, the Topics Newspapers of suburban 
Indianapolis, the Alexandria (La.) Daily Town Talk, and in Arizona, 
The Arizona Republic and The Phoenix Gazette, which ceased 
publication in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He was active in professional news organizations, serving on the  
board of The Associated Press Managing Editors and as president of 
the American Newspaper Publishers Association Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his wife, Jane, Pulliam is survived by daughters  
Myrta J. Pulliam, director of electronic news and information for 
Indianapolis Newspapers Inc., and Deborah S. Pulliam, a free-lance 
writer; son Russell B. Pulliam, editor of the News; two 
half-sisters and six grandchildren.

</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Toichi Shito, the farmer who for more than 30 years  
stood in the way of plans to expand Japan's main international 
airport, died Thursday of heart failure. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Shito, who owned land that the government wants to turn into a  
second runway for the busy Narita airport outside Tokyo, lived on 
the site with his wife. He was one of the most stubborn of a 
handful of farmers who blocked airport expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	The showdown turned violent during the 1970s when the farmers  
used pointed sticks and crude barriers to defend themselves against 
the bulldozers and riot police sent to evict them. 
</P>
<P>
	Shito's oldest son, Takao, 48, who will inherit the land,  
pledged to continue farming the plot, according to Kyodo news 
service.

                          *Susan Strasberg    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Susan Strasberg, the actress daughter of acting  
coach Lee Strasberg and a close friend of Marilyn Monroe, died 
Thursday of cancer. She was 60. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Strasberg made her Broadway debut playing Anne Frank in  
1955. She starred in ``Time Remembered,'' with Richard Burton and 
Helen Hayes in 1957. She had roles in films like ``Picnic'' in 
1954, and ``Stage Struck'' in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	The actress appeared in at least 23 films and television  
productions, including ``Frankenstein,'' a 1973 television version 
of the horror classic, and in the 1988 ``Prime Suspect'' with Frank 
Stallone. 
</P>
<P>

the policewoman on Eastchester Drive.

<HEADLINE> Top Microsoft Exec Next on Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A senior Microsoft executive alleged to have  
threatened to crush software rival Netscape is taking center stage 
in the government's antitrust case against Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive, Paul Maritz, begins testifying next week in  
Microsoft's defense. But his written testimony, covering 160 pages, 
was to be made public today. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz's testimony was expected to include a denial of the  
alleged threat against Netscape attributed to him during a November 
1995 meeting with Intel Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz also was expected to deny charges that Microsoft  
strong-armed Apple Computer Inc. into distributing Microsoft's 
Internet browser software in 1997 and that Microsoft intimidated 
Intel Corp. into abandoning a rival technology earlier in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	As a group vice president, Maritz ranks only below Microsoft's  
billionaire chairman, Bill Gates, and its president, Steve Ballmer, 
in seniority. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz joined the company in 1986 after five years at Intel. He  
is responsible for Microsoft's most important products, including 
its dominant Windows operating system and its profitable Office 
software programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the 11 weeks of trial, Maritz's name appears on  
nearly every controversial e-mail used by the government as 
evidence, either as the author or a recipient. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz also was a key player in convincing a reluctant Gates to  
include America Online's software within Windows in exchange for 
AOL distributing Microsoft's Internet software. The March 1996 deal 
proved immensely important for Microsoft, whose browser now is used 
by many of AOL's 15 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know Mr. Gates was very, very uncomfortable about shipping  
AOL,'' Microsoft executive Brad Silverberg told government lawyers 
before the trial. ``Maritz ... arranged to try to get Mr. Gates to 
see the benefits of Microsoft working with AOL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another witness, Intel Vice President Steven McGeady, testified  
during the trial Maritz and others from Microsoft met with 
executives in Oregon to discuss technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges, in part, that Microsoft decided in 1995  
to include its Internet software free into newer versions of 
Windows to try to ``crush'' rival Netscape, whose own popular 
browser earned tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paul and some of the other attendees made some fairly colorful  
statements that stick out in my memory,'' McGeady testified. ``... 
It was Microsoft's plan to cut off Netscape's air supply. By giving 
away free browsers, Microsoft was going to keep Netscape from 
getting off the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGeady also charged that at the meeting, ``Maritz described  
Netscape as a common enemy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft attorneys confronted McGeady with his own notes, which  
do not mention Maritz's alleged ``air supply'' comment. They also 
produced notes from two other Intel executives, who also did not 
mention the phrase. 
</P>
<P>
	``The phrase was so far out of bounds with what I consider to be  
an acceptable business practice,'' McGeady testified. ``It stuck 
out clearly in my mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft showed that McGeady was irate that Microsoft had  
persuaded Intel months earlier to restructure its software labs, 
where McGeady worked. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz, in an April 1996 e-mail to Gates, offered back-handed  
praise for McGeady. He said McGeady's support at Intel for a rival 
technology ``remains an issue for us'' but concluded: 
``Unfortunately, he has more IQ than most there.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Amsterdam Indulged IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Joao Havelange of Brazil, one of  
the International Olympic Committee's longest-serving members, 
accepted lavish treatment by Dutch officials trying to bring the 
1992 Games to Amsterdam, a newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	De Telegraaf said Havelange was among numerous IOC members who  
were wined and dined, given expensive gifts and escorted regularly 
to exclusive brothels in the Dutch capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper did not specify the treatment the 82-year-old  
Brazilian industrialist received, but quoted a former Amsterdam 
organizer as saying he ``went overboard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember it very well because he had special wishes -- wishes  
which were in conflict with the IOC laws,'' said Peter Kronenberg, 
who headed the press office of the Amsterdam Olympic Games 1992 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the gifts were diamonds, bicycles, sports articles, Delft  
blue porcelain, paintings and exclusive art books, De Telegraaf 
said, citing former foundation members it did not identify. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone asked for a VCR or a television set, he just got  
it,'' it quoted an unidentified former Amsterdam Games official as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	An IOC member since 1963 and a former president of FIFA,  
international soccer's governing body, Havelange up to now has not 
been implicated in the widening Olympics bribery scandal stemming 
from Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Allegations that sex was used to get the 1992 Games to Amsterdam  
first surfaced earlier this week from Prince Frederic von 
Saxe-Lauenberg, a member of the Pierre de Coubertin International 
Committee, an Olympics promotional group. 
</P>
<P>
	``A member of the foundation almost had a day job preparing  
these little outings, and it happened on a very wide scale,'' De 
Telegraaf quoted another unidentified former official as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said top officials of major international sports  
federations also could count on very lavish treatment in Amsterdam, 
and that African IOC members figured prominently among those who 
were pampered. 
</P>
<P>
	```Do you want my vote? Buy me a Mercedes,''' a former Dutch  
member of parliament, Marijn de Koning, said an African IOC member 
told her. ``That's the way it went. I was not under the impression 
that statements like that were meant as a joke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Krijn Reitsma, former director of the  
Amsterdam foundation, said the city in no way violated the rules. 
``We never gave expensive gifts to IOC members, nor did they ask 
for it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kronenberg told De Telegraaf he was surprised at Reitsma's  
denials. 
</P>
<P>
	``That man apparently has a very selective memory,'' he said.  
``He must have known what was going on. I do understand that he 
wants to keep his own backyard clean, but at this time, you can't 
just deny everything anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De Telegraaf said foundation members described working in a  
special ``war room'' where they examined individual IOC members' 
preferences, the chances of winning them over and what it would 
take to get their votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutch IOC member Anton Geesink is under investigation in the  
Salt Lake City bribery scandal. A foundation run by the former 
Olympic judo gold medalist has been accused of accepting $5,000 
from the Salt Lake City organizers.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Zeroes In on Successor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Jordan's King Hussein informed his brother  
today that he was removing him as heir to the throne and moving his 
sons in line for the crown, sources close to the king said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein, 63, told Prince Hassan through aides that he will  
appoint him as his deputy -- a new post that appears to entail 
limited authority, the sources said, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear whether Hussein was ready to  
announce a new successor to the throne of the Hashemite Kingdom of 
Jordan, which he inherited from his father Talal in 1953 at the age 
of 17. 
</P>
<P>
	The change, which comes three days after King Hussein's return  
from cancer treatment abroad, is expected to be announced soon, the 
sources said. Hassan, 51, was named crown prince to succeed the 
king in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	Other sources, also well informed on the royal family, said the  
strongest candidate to become crown prince is Hussein's eldest son, 
Abdullah, provided that the future king will appoint his brother 
Hamza as his heir. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah, who turns 37 on Jan. 30, is Hussein's son from his  
second marriage, to Britain's Toni Gardiner, who adopted the name 
of Mona when she converted to Islam upon her marriage to Hussein in 
1960. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah is an army major general and in charge of a special  
force that oversees the security of the royal dynasty. He attended 
military schools in England and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamza, who turns 19 on March 29, is Hussein's son from his  
fourth marriage, to American-born Queen Noor, the former Elizabeth 
Halaby. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamza is attending courses at Britain's Sandhurst Military  
Academy. 
</P>
<P>
	Western diplomats long have said Queen Noor was ruffling family  
feathers by grooming Hamza for the throne, possibly in place of 
Hassan. They spoke on customary condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein appears to be worried that if Hassan succeeds him, it  
would be Hassan's sons -- and not Hussein's -- who then would be in 
line for the throne. 
</P>
<P>
	The constitution stipulates that Hussein's successor is his  
eldest son. The king has recently hinted that when he appointed 
Hassan, he had no other choice at the time because his children 
were young. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein hinted that he would replace Hassan in a statement to  
his countrymen last Sunday, two days before his return from six 
months of treatment for cancer in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	He clarified his intention further in an interview with the  
Cable News Network on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Hussein refused to confirm reports that he would  
replace Hassan, he did not give his usual endorsement of his 
brother -- raising speculation that a change was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have said Hussein was cured following six rounds of  
chemotherapy and a marrow cell transplant for non-Hodgkins 
lymphoma.

<HEADLINE> Heat's Mourning Can Play in Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Miami Heat center Alonzo Mourning will not be  
forced to miss next month's season opener after the NBA on Friday 
lifted the rest of his suspension from last year's playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning was issued a two-game suspension after fighting with  
New York's Larry Johnson in Game 4 of their Eastern Conference 
first round series. Mourning sat out the next game, which the 
Knicks won to take the series, and had been scheduled to finish the 
suspension when Miami opened the season Feb. 5 against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	But NBA Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik said the suspension no  
longer would stand because of the six-month lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``In light of the events of the past several months, it does not  
seem appropriate for Alonzo to have to now sit out one more game at 
this stage of the season,'' Granik said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning was not available for comment. He was ill and missed  
the Heat's morning workout Friday.

<HEADLINE> Denver Nuggets Re-Sign Two Players </HEADLINE>

<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Denver Nuggets have re-signed guard Cory  
Alexander, who averaged 14 points in 23 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal Friday were not announced.  
</P>
<P>
	Alexander signed on last March and helped the Nuggets win six of  
their last 23 games after winning only five of the their first 59. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander played in 37 games for the San Antonio Spurs last  
season before being waived in February. He posted career-high 
average of 8.1 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-1-inch, 190-pound guard was the Spurs' first-round  
draft pick in 1995 out of the University of Virginia. He has 
averaged 6.2 points in 200 career NBA games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuggets also re-signed 6-4 guard Eric Washington, who  
averaged 7.7 points in 66 games as a rookie.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Will Barely Be on National TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The mystery team from Chicago will not be seen  
on national television. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign of how different this NBA season will be, the new  
television schedule was released Thursday, along with the new 
regular season schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Every team will play 50 games, six of them non-conference games,  
and NBC and Turner Sports will televise 89 of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago will appear only once as a regional telecast Feb. 21 in  
an NBC tripleheader, and no Bulls games will be on TNT or TBS -- not 
even a finals rematch between Chicago and the Utah Jazz on opening 
night Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't look at that as a rematch of the NBA Finals because  
of the complete overhaul of the Bulls' roster,'' TNT spokesman Greg 
Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of Bulls-Jazz, TNT will broadcast an opening-night  
doubleheader of New York at Orlando and Houston at the Los Angeles 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC will begin its schedule with a doubleheader on Sunday, Feb.  
7, with regional telecasts featuring the Miami Heat at New York and 
Indiana at the Detroit Pistons, followed by Utah at the L.A. 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be no All-Star game, and there also won't be any  
nights devoid of NBA games. 
</P>
<P>
	The slowest night of the season will be Saturday, Feb. 13, when  
only two games are scheduled. There are just five nights when four 
or fewer games are played. 
</P>
<P>
	The season will last until May 5, and the playoffs will begin  
Saturday, May 8. The NBA Finals will conclude no later than 
Tuesday, June 29. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in more than a decade, teams will play games  
on three consecutive nights. 
</P>
<P>
	Each team will have a couple of back-to-back-to-back stretches,  
and the schedule will be grueling. The Knicks, for example, will 
play seven games in nine nights from March 14-22. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers have a stretch in which they play three road games in  
three nights at Seattle, Denver and Vancouver before returning to 
Los Angeles for a day off and then a home-and-home series with the 
Clippers -- a total of five games in six nights, four of them road 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Toronto Raptors will find themselves with four straight days  
off in mid-February, but then will have four road games in five 
nights in late March -- at New Jersey, Chicago, Houston and San 
Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers will have the most appearances on cable television,  
12 games on TNT or TBS, and the Knicks will have 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastern Conference teams will play each conference opponent  
three times, two conference opponents one additional time apiece 
and six non-conference teams (three home, three away). 
</P>
<P>
	Western Conference teams will play each conference opponent  
three times, five conference opponents one additional time and six 
non-conference teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the imbalance of teams in the Eastern and Western  
Conferences, six Eastern Conference teams will play five 
non-conference games and one additional conference game.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Down 92.69 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today, with Internet shares  
bouncing back from a steep selloff while blue-chip stocks remained 
under selling pressure led by a big decline in IBM. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 92.69 at 9,171.39. The blue-chip index fell as much as 
175-points this morning before bouncing back. 
</P>
<P>
	``This market can't rock and roll day in and day out,'' said  
Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; 
Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ``The Dow was up 900 points in four weeks 
time, and now gravity is getting to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly lower, with the exception  
of the Internet-laden Nasdaq composite index. After falling 40 
points in early trading and 71 points Thursday, it was up 6 at 
2,350.72. 
</P>
<P>
	Disappointing fourth-quarter sales at IBM, the world's biggest  
computer maker, put pressure on blue-chip stocks today. IBM was 
down 14 9/16 at 182 7/16, which accounted for more than 58 points 
of the Dow's losses today. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks fell sharply in early trading, but rebounded at  
midday. While investors worry that the Internet stock boom will 
soon end, many couldn't resist the bargains available after 
Thursday's steep selloff. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at where prices were a few weeks ago and where  
they are now, of course you have people jumping in to buy them 
because they think they are bargains,'' said Barry Berman, head 
trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also kept a close watch on developments in Brazil.  
Latin America's largest economy continues to struggle with its 
ailing economy and weakening real, the Brazilian currency which has 
depreciated by about 31 percent since Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Worries over Brazil led to a decline in overseas markets. In  
Asia, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.64 percent and Hong 
Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 3.1 percent. In Europe, Germany's DAX 
index fell 3 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 2.7 percent, and 
France's CAC-40 fell 3.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 525 million shares, 
down from 594.20 million shares on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 2.93 at 1,232.23, the  
NYSE composite index was down 1.88 at 586.15, and the American 
Stock Exchange composite index was up 0.36 at 705.35.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Currency Falls Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's week-old decision to let  
its currency float against the dollar hasn't by any means calmed 
investor nerves about Latin America's largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian real fell again in early trading today, slipping  
to 1.75 against the dollar from 1.70 at Thursday's close. The 
Central Bank began selling dollars to support the real, which 
strengthened some but soon headed down again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sao Paulo stock exchange's Bovespa index rose by 1 percent  
in morning trading. On Thursday, jitters over the plunging real 
sent the Bovespa down by 4.6 percent after a euphoric 52-percent 
rise the four previous days. 
</P>
<P>
	Market analysts had expected a brighter scenario Thursday after  
good news from Brazil's Congress, where the lower house passed a 
key bill on Wednesday that aimed to reduce the government's budget 
deficit and instill new investor confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	But the weakening real has depreciated by about 31 percent since  
Jan. 12, apparently keeping investors skeptical about Brazil's 
ability to strengthen its shaky economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this isn't enough to attract inflows and kick-start  
exports, things will only get worse,'' a currency dealer in Rio de 
Janeiro said when the value of the real to the dollar plunged to 
1.73 on Thursday. He spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The real, which started Thursday at 1.59, made a slight comeback  
to close the day at 1.70. Some dealers believed the Central Bank 
intervened to prop up the currency, but it denied this. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said the  
government did not intend to dump its free-float policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has decided what course the real will take, and  
we'll continue in the same way,'' said George Lamaziere in an 
interview with CBN radio station. 
</P>
<P>
	He attributed instability to markets' finding their  
``equilibrium'' after the real's depreciation. 
</P>
<P>
	The government hopes its new currency policy will lure back  
foreign investors with a cheaper real. It follows a six-month 
period in which the Central Bank spent some $45 billion in foreign 
reserves in a failed effort to support the real. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's biggest worry remains an outflow of dollars. Despite  
the currency depreciation, some $1.7 billion has left the country 
since Friday. Markets estimate that reserves have dipped below $30 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, the Chamber of Deputies passed a bill  
reducing pensions for retired federal employees, which could save 
the government $2.5 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more important than the savings, the vote sent a signal  
that Cardoso has the support needed to reduce the swollen budget 
deficit. The pension bill had failed four times earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has promised to reduce its estimated $65 billion  
public deficit this year by about $16.4 billion. The pledge was a 
condition for approval of a $41.5 billion loan package assembled by 
the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate, which must approve the pension tax for the measure  
to take effect, decided Thursday to make the matter an urgent 
priority, meaning it could come to a vote as early as Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Ticket Turnout 'Super' for Nuns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Franciscan nuns in Denver call the response to  
their charity raffle of two Super Bowl tickets ``a gift from God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nuns at the Francis Heights Senior Center expected to sell  
3,000 raffle tickets, at $5 each, over three days. It took only 
three hours to sell all of the tickets Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver city councilman Dennis Gallagher donated his two Super  
Bowl tickets to the nuns to give the average person a chance at 
going to the Jan. 31 game between the Denver Broncos and Atlanta 
Falcons. The nuns decided to raffle off the tickets, which are 
selling for about $1,600 each, to raise money to repair the 
swimming pool at the senior center. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting at dawn, people dressed in Broncos orange and blue  
lined up outside the center and Gallagher's office, where the 
tickets were on sale. 
</P>
<P>
	One businessman detoured his private jet to Denver just to buy  
20 tickets. People came from as far as Grand Junction and Pueblo to 
buy tickets, and called from as far as Georgia and Wisconsin to ask 
if they could have money sent by overnight courier to get in on the 
raffle. One man bought 400 tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``By 9 o'clock, when the doors opened, it was loud and  
harried,'' Sheila Harris, Francis Heights' assistant director, 
said. ``But it was fun. Everybody was orderly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos traditionally make two tickets available to public  
officials who want them. Gallagher bought his tickets for face 
value, $325 each. He was thrilled that the tickets would make two 
fans happy and help a good cause. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was overwhelmed,'' Gallagher said. ``I think the people were  
so pleased that an average person might have a shot at getting 
Super Bowl tickets. A lot of people were just happy to help the 
sisters with the pool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The swimming pool repairs are expected to cost $300,000. Before  
the raffle, the nuns had raised $100,000 through grants and craft 
sales. Publicity from the raffle has generated other donations, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher said the raffle might draw some divine intervention in  
the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now the nuns are praying for the Broncos,'' he said. ``Maybe  
they'll win.''

<HEADLINE> Webber Missing in Sacramento </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- For the third straight season, the  
Sacramento Kings started training camp without their best player. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Kings continued to negotiate with free-agent center  
Vlade Divac, power forward Chris Webber was conspicuously absent 
Thursday night as new coach Rick Adelman conducted his first 
post-lockout practice with 18 veterans and free agents present. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives the appearance that he is trying to force a trade,''  
said Geoff Petrie, the Kings' vice president of operations. ``But 
I've been instructed by the owners, present and future, not to 
pursue that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings began the previous two seasons without Mitch Richmond,  
the team's six-time All-Star guard and seven-time leading scorer. 
Richmond, who sought a renegotiated contract, was traded last May 
to the Washington Wizards with veteran forward Otis Thorpe for 
Webber. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials said they did not know the whereabouts of Webber,  
the high-scoring but troubled player the Kings hope to built their 
future around. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings were also expected to renounce the rights to  
free-agent small forward Corliss Williamson. But the team said 
Williamson, the team's second-leading scorer last season, remains 
in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know as much as you know,'' Adelman said. ``We expected him  
today; we contacted his agent and we believe he knew the schedule. 
I really don't know any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Jason Williams, the team's No. 1 draft choice last summer,  
and center Jerome James, the team's second-round pick, attended 
practice. But they did not participate because they've yet to sign 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Webber, who has averaged 20.0 points and 9.5 rebounds in his  
five NBA seasons, told a national radio talk show host last weekend 
he was ready to play for the Kings. But until earlier this week, he 
had not been to Sacramento since the trade. 
</P>
<P>
	But after visiting and working out in Sacramento with his close  
friend Billy Owens, the Kings' starting power forward last season, 
Webber remained aloof. The team said he has not yet taken his 
required physical examination. 
</P>
<P>
	Divac, beginning his 10th NBA season, played for seven seasons  
with the Los Angeles Lakers and the past two seasons for the 
Charlotte Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrie said the team expects to announce the signing of Divac to  
a multiyear contract today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're working on it; it's a big contract,'' Petrie said. ``But  
I think we'll be OK with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Petrie threatened to resign. The following day,  
managing general partner Jim Thomas announced he was selling the 
majority of his interest to the Maloof family of Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maloof family, who previously owned 25 percent of the  
franchise and were the former owners of the Houston Rockets, are 
officially to assume majority ownership July 1. But it was the 
Maloof family brothers who reportedly flew to Arkansas on Wednesday 
night to meet with Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings didn't announce an official training camp roster, but  
the team will likely begin the season with only four or five 
players remaining from their 1997-98 season-ending roster. 
</P>
<P>
	The expected returning team members are swingman Tariq  
Abdul-Wahad, the team's No. 1 pick last season; reserve shooting 
guards Terry Dehere and Chris Robinson and second-year forward 
Lawrence Funderburke. Williamson would increase the returning 
roster to five.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Banks, Jews Come to Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lawyers for Jewish groups, Holocaust survivors  
and Swiss banks today worked out more details for an agreement to 
pay $1.25 billion in compensation for wartime losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks, which included the Swiss banks UBS AG and Credit  
Suisse, began in federal court in New York late Thursday and ended 
shortly after midnight, said Elan Steinberg, executive director of 
the World Jewish Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks, which were accused of profiting from deposits and  
other assets belonging to Holocaust victims, agreed last summer to 
pay the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's agreement spells out who is entitled to the money,  
though details were not immediately available. How the payments 
will eventually be made remains to be resolved, said Edward Fagan, 
an attorney for survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the sides worked together in a constructive way and we are  
satisfied that the intensive discussions found a worthy 
conclusion,'' said UBS spokesman Christoph Meier. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was reached before U.S. District Court Judge Edward  
Korman. The parties are expected to sign it at a later date, Fagan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The significance of what occurred tonight appeared to be the  
... dotting of the i's and crossing of the t's of what was 
negotiated August 12,'' Fagan said. ``I think we're all sorry and 
frustrated that it took six months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jewish groups say tens of thousands of Holocaust victims  
deposited money in Swiss banks in secret accounts as the Nazis 
gained power in Europe, expecting to retrieve it later. 
</P>
<P>
	But heirs and survivors say the banks stonewalled, claiming they  
could not find accounts or in some cases requesting death 
certificates of victims killed in Nazi camps. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement ends two years of litigation that has dominated  
U.S.-Swiss relations and marred the image of Switzerland, which 
declared neutrality during World War II.

<HEADLINE> Grains Rise a Bit; Soybeans Fall / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain futures prices rose moderately Friday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybean futures retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans retreated after influential forecasting firm Spark Cos.  
of Memphis, Tenn., predicted record U.S. soybean plantings this 
spring -- at a time when inventories are expected to remain high 
because of weak export demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Further depressing prices were updated forecasts calling for  
beneficial weather in competing Brazilian growing regions. Amid 
expectations that Brazil will harvest a large crop this year is a 
backdrop in which economic problems may lead to increased exports. 
Most commodities are priced in U.S. dollars, so export sales could 
bring in more hard currency to cash-strapped Brazilian shippers. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures found support on Sparks' forecast for smaller  
acreage planted this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures advanced as market participants worried that heavy  
rains over the past few days and forecasts for even more in the 
next two weeks could flood winter wheat farms. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery rose 3 1/4 cents to $2.71 1/4 a bushel; March  
corn rose 1/4 cent to $2.16 1/4 a bushel; March oats were unchanged at 
$1.07 1/4 a bushel; March soybeans fell 4 3/4 cent s to $5.25 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures rose strongly on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Biggest German Union To Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Germany's biggest union has rejected a  
2 percent pay increase offer by employers and says it will call 
strikes next week after a grace period for wage negotiations 
expires. 
</P>
<P>
	``Employees are annoyed'' after several years of salary  
increases smaller than inflation, IG Metall chairman Klaus Zwickel 
said Friday. The union is demanding a 6.5 percent rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The industrial union's 3.4 million workers would begin protest  
strikes across the country after midnight next Thursday, Zwickel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the 2 percent rise, employers also offered a lump  
sum payment of 0.5 percent of the worker's annual salary, though 
payment was to be made dependent on the financial health of 
individual companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Zwickel rejected that too, saying the union would not accept the  
creation of what he called a two-class system of enterprises, with 
workers effectively being awarded on the basis of the quality of 
management. 
</P>
<P>
	Unions negotiate with employers in Germany on a state-by-state  
basis. Talks were held Friday in three big states -- North 
Rhine-Westphalia, Hesse and Bavaria. 
</P>
<P>
	Unions say they are fed up with years of meager pay increases as  
company profits in Germany have risen and that it is time they 
shared the prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers argue that meeting their demands will kill jobs and  
hurt productivity.

<HEADLINE> GOP Chair Predicts Political Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jim Nicholson, elected Friday to a second term  
as GOP chairman, said Republicans ``have sustained political 
damage'' during the impeachment process. But he argued that 
Democrats will suffer more for defending President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``In failing to stand up for basic democratic ... values,  
Democrats have sustained damage that goes way beyond the political 
and will cling to them for years,'' Nicholson told the Republican 
National Committee, moments after defeating Florida Republican Tom 
Slade 127-36. 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks reflected mounting concern among Republicans about  
the price of pursuing the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the Potomac River, the party's most conservative  
activists heard former Vice President Dan Quayle call Clinton and 
Vice President Al Gore ``New-Age socialists.'' Gore's office fired 
back, calling Quayle ``a medieval conservative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle and Gore are running for their parties' presidential  
nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet even as they re-elected Nicholson and listened to Quayle's  
presidential pitch, Republicans spanning the party's ideological 
spectrum said they were increasingly worried about the impact of 
defying public opinion and pursuing Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tend to be seen as the party of impeachment,'' said J.  
Warren Tompkins, an influential South Carolina Republican. ``We 
need to get on to other things, other ideas, the sooner the 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The RNC members met in a downtown hotel, only blocks from the  
Capitol building where the Senate was weighing Clinton's fate. In 
hallway interviews, most of the GOP leaders said the president 
deserves to be tossed from office, but predicted that he will 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
	And many reluctantly reached the same conclusion: If the outcome  
is certain, why delay it? 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need to have this thing hanging around our necks into  
the spring and summer,'' Tompkins said. ``We need our people to 
focus on governing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson himself conceded that ``in standing up for American  
values, Republicans have sustained political damage, at least in 
the short term.'' But he said the Senate must do its duty. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a sense of resignation at the Conservative Political  
Action Conference, where staunchly anti-Clinton conservatives 
predicted that Clinton would not be convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	James Broussard, a history teacher from Annville, Pa., said he  
doesn't think that the House managers made enough of a case, and 
that the votes are clearly not there to remove Clinton. ``Under 
those circumstances, they don't have much choice but to keep him 
around,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he didn't think the Senate should do anything to shorten  
the vote -- and that Republicans certainly shouldn't throw in the 
towel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then you'd have the tremendous anger and frustration on the  
right that, hey, we didn't get our day in court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clyde Smithson, a Mount Vernon, Va., retiree, said, ``I don't  
think Republicans are losing anything. But we need to get it over 
with as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian Coalition, set the tone  
Wednesday when he said out of frustration that the trial ``might as 
well be dismissed'' because Clinton had won ``from a public 
relations standpoint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are signs that Republicans are already looking beyond the  
trial, to the 2000 presidential campaign and the most likely 
Democratic nominee: Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson devoted an unusual amount of time in his address  
attacking Gore, calling him the ``chief defender and heir-apparent 
as leader of the tax-and-spend wing of the Democratic Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle clearly intends to make Gore pay for the sins of his  
boss. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Clinton obstructs justice and Al Gore calls him a moral  
leader,'' he told CPAC. ``Bill Clinton and Al Gore deserve each 
other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He called the president's State of the Union address ``Al Gore's  
platform,'' saying it calls for more taxes and government 
regulation. ``They are New-Age socialists,'' Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Chris LeHane responded: ``The beliefs that former  
Vice President Quayle espouses and hopes to impose on Americans 
identify him as a medieval conservative.''

<HEADLINE> Boston Ponders School Bus Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Twenty-five years after racial violence erupted in  
Boston over court-ordered desegregation, the city is considering 
abandoning widespread busing and sending students to their 
neighborhood schools again. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason: White flight and a burgeoning immigrant population  
have dramatically changed the racial makeup in many parts of 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks, Hispanics and Asians now constitute about 85 percent of  
the city's 64,000 public school students, up from about 48 percent 
when busing began. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, most areas of the city -- including the once  
lily-white South Boston, where the worst trouble took place in the 
early 1970s -- are now racially and ethnically diverse. 
</P>
<P>
	The change has prompted Mayor Thomas M. Menino to propose  
building five new schools in the city and returning to ``walk-to 
schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal has some people concerned that it will simply be a  
return to the old days. After all, integration is still not 
complete. Roxbury, one of Boston's poorest sections, is almost 
uniformly black; West Roxbury, one of the wealthiest, is almost 
uniformly white. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're not paying attention to what goes on, history has a  
tendency to repeat itself,'' Leonard Alkins, president of the 
Boston branch of the National Association for the Advancement of 
Colored People, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1972, the NAACP sued the city, charging that black children  
weren't getting an equal education. What resulted was court-ordered 
busing and the enduring images of parents hurling epithets and 
rocks at school buses. 
</P>
<P>
	As in other U.S. cities, many whites pulled their children out  
of the public schools. Others moved to the suburbs. As the white 
population dwindled, the minority population boomed. Immigrants 
from Asia, Africa and Latin America poured into Boston, and had a 
higher birth rate than the whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago, Boston was released from direct court  
supervision, but there are monitoring committees to ensure that the 
schools maintain racial balance. If they do not, the city can be 
hauled back into court. 
</P>
<P>
	The city came up with a new racial-balance formula, still in  
place today, that bases school assignments on race and parent 
choice. About two-thirds of the school system's students are now 
bused under this formula. 
</P>
<P>
	But because of Boston's large minority population, ``you're  
taking predominantly minority children and putting them on a bus, 
shuffling the deck,'' and sending them schools that are mostly 
minority anyway, said City Councilor Peggy Davis-Mullen, who is 
white and represents South Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current formula, parents more often than not opt  
against the school down the street. But the mayor believes more 
parents will want to send their children to schools nearby if new 
buildings are added to the equation. 
</P>
<P>
	Even under the mayor's plan, busing would still be necessary  
because of a shortage of schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal needs the approval of the school board. But the  
plan is still being drawn up, and no vote is scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	The renewed discussion about busing is so far proving far less  
controversial than in the 1970s. School board meetings and public 
hearings on the subject have drawn few participants. 
</P>
<P>
	Many black leaders now believe that integration -- while  
important -- is less crucial than fixing the school system, which is 
plagued by poor test scores and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``People want a quality education system and if it means they  
have to put their kid on a yellow bus, they will do it,'' said 
Loretta Roach, executive director of City Wide Educational 
Coalition, which was appointed by the federal courts to monitor 
Boston's racial compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Reyes, 15, has been bused her whole life, and doesn't  
mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``With busing, you have more of a choice what school you want to  
go to, instead of just having to go to the one near your house,'' 
she said.

	Prosecutors Seek Lewinsky Testimony  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House impeachment prosecutors obtained  
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's help late today in attempting 
to force Monica Lewinsky to talk to them, contending her immunity 
agreement requires it, two congressional officials confirmed. 
Starr's prosecutors and lawyers for Ms. Lewinsky went to court late 
this afternoon to argue whether she had to cooperate. U.S. District 
Judge Norma Holloway Johnson made no immediate ruling. Lead 
prosecutor Henry Hyde, R-Ill., wrote Starr yesterday seeking his 
help with Ms. Lewinsky, who rejected being interviewed by the House 
team. Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers contended that the immunity agreement 
``does not require us to be interviewed'' by House impeachment 
managers.

	45 Die in Eastern Indonesia Rioting  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Troops patrolled the streets Saturday  
on islands in eastern Indonesia after clashes between Christians 
and Muslims this week killed 45 people. A curfew was imposed to 
prevent further fighting between rival gangs on Ambon, Sanana and 
Seram islands, known in Dutch colonial times as the Spice Islands. 
News reports said the situation after three days of mayhem was 
tense. The islands in eastern Maluku province are the latest site 
of rioting that has plagued crisis-ridden Indonesia in the past 
year.

	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The head of the U.N. nuclear agency  
suggested today that any inspection of Iraq's weapons capabilities 
be carried out by an organization independent of the Security 
Council. The suggestion by International Atomic Energy Agency chief 
Mohamed ElBaradei was an unusual, albeit indirect diplomatic jab at 
the U.N. Special Commission, which has worked with the IAEA for the 
past seven years to disarm Iraq. ElBaradei alluded to earlier 
espionage allegations, saying that inspectors cannot ``reciprocate 
and become part of a web of intelligence agencies.''

mission to recharge the Catholic Church in the Americas for the new 
millennium. Hundreds of thousands of people lined the streets of 
this sprawling capital after waiting for hours -- and some for days

Cuauhtemoc Cardenas handed the pope the keys to the city.

	MINSK, Belarus (AP) -- About 3,000 people marched in the  
Belarusian capital today to protest the government's plan for 
closer integration with neighbor Russia, chanting, ``No to the 
Russian occupation!'' Protesters said that the union would mean 
that violence and regional conflicts would spill over into Belarus. 
The union between Russia and Belarus, two former Soviet republics, 
was signed in 1996 and calls for closer political, economic and 
military ties, but stops short of creating a single state.

	Proposed Medicare Changes Unveiled

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of a Medicare reform commission  
advising President Clinton and Congress said today the panel could 
recommend a higher eligibility age and make the wealthy pay more 
for old-age health coverage. Under the compromise plan, Medicare 
would also shift to helping elderly Americans buy health insurance 
instead of paying individual medical bills, as it does now. John 
Breaux, D-La., chairman of the National Bipartisan Commission on 
the Future of Medicare, also said the commission is likely to 
recommend adding a prescription benefit to Medicare.

<HEADLINE>  Malone Back With Jazz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone made his peace with the Utah  
Jazz -- and his teammates breathed a sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Karl would be back, but I was a little worried, I  
admit it,'' Jeff Hornacek said. ``I look at the Bulls after 
Michael, and that doesn't look like a lot of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After an extended summer of discontent during which Malone  
appeared to be miles away from returning to the Jazz, he was back 
in the fold on Thursday after an emotional press conference with 
team owner Larry Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, Malone joined his Jazz teammates for workouts on  
the first day of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really had no doubt Karl and Larry would work something  
out,'' guard John Stockton said. ``This is Karl's home, and this 
team knows him very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting Karl back doesn't change our plans for the season,''  
coach Jerry Sloan said. ``If it hadn't worked out, then you'd see a 
different look on my face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two months ago, Malone vowed never again to play for the Jazz.  
But in the broader scope of Malone's tumultuous offseason, two 
months is an eternity. 
</P>
<P>
	Things have changed.  
</P>
<P>
	``You say things sometimes that you wish you wouldn't have said.  
It takes a bigger man to admit he was wrong,'' Malone said. ``I 
apologize for a lot of things I said. The stuff that happened this 
summer made me grow up quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the hastily arranged press conference, Malone, Miller and  
Malone's agent, Dwight Manley, all said they intend to keep the 
Mailman in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	They also criticized as untrue an earlier report that they had  
already agreed to a four-year extension. Malone has one year 
remaining on his current contract and will be paid $3.7 million 
during the abbreviated season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always been committed to keeping Karl in a Jazz uniform  
for the rest of his career ... and I am sure that we're going to be 
able to do that,'' the teary-eyed Miller said. ``I'd like to have 
an agreement right now, but that's not possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone and Miller hadn't spoken for weeks before an intense,  
lengthy conversation on Wednesday night. They said they emerged 
from the meeting with a spoken agreement to work out a lucrative, 
long-term deal as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to playing my career out here in Utah,''  
said the 35-year-old Malone. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller and Manley said they lobbied for an addition to the NBA's  
collective bargaining agreement that would allow teams to sign 
players who have been in the league for 12 years and with their 
teams for 10 years to extensions for an unlimited amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Karl is one of the only players like that,'' Manley said.  
</P>
<P>
	The addition wasn't made to the agreement, but the Jazz have  
petitioned the league for a waiver that would allow them to sign 
the 1997 MVP to a similar contract. If the waiver is granted, 
Miller said, the Jazz will be quick to act. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as the agreement allows us to talk about an extension,  
at the first opportunity, we'll do it,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the waiver isn't granted, no deal could be completed until  
next summer, when Malone would become a free agent for the first 
time in his career. Manley said the Jazz ``will obviously have the 
first and best shot'' to sign Malone. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone has dabbled in everything from pro wrestling to talk  
radio since the Jazz lost the NBA Finals to the Chicago Bulls last 
June. But with the lockout over and the Jazz a strong favorite to 
contend for their first NBA title, Malone said he decided the grass 
was greener on his own side of the fence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes a man to admit he was wrong,'' Malone said. ``My  
family and I want to spend the rest of our lives in Utah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gail Miller and Kay Malone, wives of the owner and the player,  
sat together during the press conference. The families live only 
minutes apart in an affluent hillside suburb of Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	``I drive past his house every night and every morning and I  
think about him,'' Larry Miller said. ``Maybe we've got too 
emotionally dependent on each other, I don't know.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After sitting out the 1996 presidential  
campaign, former Vice President Dan Quayle is taking the first step 
toward seeking the top spot on the Republican ticket in 2000. He 
came close to announcing today, promising a conservative group ``a 
choice worth fighting for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Very soon I will be making a final decision about my political  
future,'' Quayle told a receptive audience at the Conservative 
Political Action Conference in the Washington suburb of Arlington, 
Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here among friends, I can say I have been encouraged to run  
for president of the United States,'' Quayle said, promising ``an 
agenda of vision and a choice worth fighting for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had six years of misplaced priorities, slick  
salesmanship and amateurism,'' said Quayle, last of several 
presidential hopefuls to address CPAC. 
</P>
<P>
	In reference to the impeachment trial of President Clinton,  
Quayle said, ``I have never seen more courage on Capitol Hill than 
that being displayed by Henry Hyde and the House Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, values do matter,'' he said to loud cheers.  
</P>
<P>
	In remarks directed and Democratic front-runner Vice President  
Al Gore, Quayle said, ``Bill Clinton obstructs justice and Al Gore 
calls him a moral leader. ... Bill Clinton and Al Gore deserve each 
other. America deserves better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Tuesday night, we listened to Al Gore's platform. They want  
more taxes, more regulation, more government and more burdens 
placed on the hard-working middle class. They are not new 
Democrats. They are new-age socialists,'' Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday night on CNN's ``Larry King Live,'' the former vice  
president said, ``I've thought about this for a long time. I've 
wanted to be president for a long time, and the year 2000 is 
looking like my opportunity,'' 
</P>
<P>
	He intends to file a formal statement of candidacy next week,  
the first step in his bid for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle said he would push for a 30 percent, across-the-board tax  
cut and would stand up for middle American values. 
</P>
<P>
	The race for the GOP nomination is drawing a number of  
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	The early front-runner seems to be George W. Bush, the Texas  
governor who is son of former President George Bush. Other possible 
candidates are millionaire businessman Steve Forbes, former cabinet 
secretary Elizabeth Dole, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and 
activist Gary Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Polls are quite frankly irrelevant. You don't make decisions  
on whether you are running for president on a poll, on your poll or 
someone else's poll. You consult yourself; you talk with your 
family; and if you are convinced that you are the best person to 
lead the country, then you make a go of it; and that's what I have 
done,'' Quayle said in the CNN interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle said he believe it will take $20 million to run a  
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am convinced I can raise it. I know I can raise it,'' he  
said.

homeland, and published reports have linked Ganga to a total of 
$70,000 from Salt Lake officials. He and his mother also received 
medical care paid for by SLOC. Olympic officials say his case is

<HEADLINE> Y2K Forces Close of Online Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prodigy Communications Corp. notified the  
208,000 subscribers of its pioneer ``Prodigy Classic'' online 
service Friday that it will shut down in October because of the 
Year 2000 computer problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the so-called ``Y2K'' problem was not expected  
to affect the 433,000 subscribers of its newer ``Prodigy Internet'' 
service, launched in late 1996, and it encouraged its Classic 
subscribers to enroll there. 
</P>
<P>
	Prodigy's chief executive officer, Samer Salameh, sent e-mail to  
subscribers nationwide explaining that the company's Classic 
service was ``built using proprietary technologies that predate 
current Internet standards'' and the company's engineers were 
``unable to make them Y2K compliant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that this announcement will be a disappointment to many  
of you,'' Salameh wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement also was posted on the company's ``Year 2000  
Readiness Disclosure'' Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	In electronic messages on Prodigy's discussion groups, customers  
expressed skepticism late Friday that the Year 2000 problem was to 
blame for the service's demise. Some openly suggested that the 
company manufactured the explanation to encourage them to migrate 
to its newer Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	One subscriber called it a ``pre-planned plot,'' and another  
said Salameh's e-mail was ``nothing but deceitful writing'' and ``a 
complete, total excuse for issues they won't put in writing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mainly, I can't stand the idea of being lied to,'' another  
subscriber wrote. ``If they can't fix the Y2K deal, they should go 
out of business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Executives couldn't be reached late Friday for additional  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Many computers originally programmed to recognize only the last  
two digits of a year won't work properly beginning Jan. 1, 2000, 
when machines will assume it is 1900. Some computers can be 
reprogrammed, but many devices have embedded microchips that must 
be physically replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	Prodigy's Classic service was launched nationally in 1990, years  
before the booming popularity of the Internet and its World Wide 
Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Prodigy, based in White Plains, N.Y., boasted 1.13 million  
subscribers in 1995, but that number has declined sharply in recent 
years as users fled to Internet service providers that offered 
faster, more reliable access to the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online, the world's largest Internet provider, has more  
than 15 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	Prodigy never was profitable. In 1996 and 1997, it incurred net  
losses of $114.1 million and $129.3 million, and it lost $47.6 
million during the nine months that ended in September.

<HEADLINE> Texas Considers Moving Death Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Texas prison officials, responding to a scathing  
report on how seven convicted killers escaped in November, are 
considering moving death row inmates to a more modern prison 30 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly is the highest priority this board, the entire  
department, has at this point in time,'' said Allan Polunsky, 
chairman of the state's prison board. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading candidate for the new death row is the Terrell Unit,  
which has a capacity of nearly 3,000 inmates and was built in 1993. 
For now, death row remains at the Ellis Unit, near Huntsville. It 
was established in 1963 and has about 2,000 inmates, including 448 
on death row. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report released Thursday, a panel of investigators blamed  
negligence by prison employees, combined with physical problems at 
the Ellis Unit, for the Thanksgiving night escape. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the seven inmates, Martin Gurule, 29, managed to scale  
two 10-foot-tall fences topped with razor wire and flee into the 
darkness. The other six surrendered after guards in towers opened 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Gurule's escape was the first from Texas' death row in 64 years,  
but he didn't get far. He drowned in a 15-foot-deep creek a couple 
of miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Prison officials said officers had failed to follow procedures,  
such as conducting proper headcounts and cell inspections. The unit 
warden was demoted and reassigned this week, his two assistants 
were transferred and at least three officers on duty that night 
could be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also said the prison needed better lighting, higher  
watchtowers and motion sensors.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Scandal Spreads to Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The Olympic corruption scandal grew  
dramatically today when an Australian official said he offered 
$70,000 in inducements to two African IOC members the night before 
Sydney won the 2000 Games by two votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's senior IOC member, who said he was not involved in  
the offer, acknowledged that it could be considered a bribe and 
bring demands for Sydney to be stripped of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest development in the growing crisis came on the same  
day that a Libyan delegate became the second IOC member to resign 
amid vote-buying allegations in Salt Lake City's selection as host 
of the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi gave his resignation to IOC president  
Juan Antonio Samaranch, one day before an IOC commission concludes 
its inquiry into the Salt Lake scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch did not rule out other resignations this weekend. He  
said seven other members face possible expulsion in the Salt Lake 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, Samaranch got the damaging news from Sydney.  
</P>
<P>
	John Coates, president of the Australian Olympic Committee and a  
leader of the 2000 Sydney bid, said he offered $35,000 apiece to 
the national Olympic committees of Kenya and Uganda, according to 
Australian news reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The offers were made to IOC members Charles Mukora of Kenya and  
Maj. Gen. Francis Nyangweso of Uganda at a dinner in Monte Carlo, 
Monaco, on Sept. 22, 1993, the night before Sydney beat Beijing for 
the 2000 Games, according to Coates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was necessary for us to show our commitment to  
those NOCs with a view to winning those votes,'' Coates told 
Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald. ``My view was it might encourage 
them to consider their votes for Sydney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney won 45-43.  
</P>
<P>
	Coates denied the money was a bribe and said it help sport in  
Kenya and Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the offer were contained in a package of previously  
confidential bid documents released to Australian news media by 
Coates, who was in Australia and not immediately available for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents also disclosed that Coates wrote to Mukora and  
Nyangweso a month before the vote, offering to put them up at 
Sydney's expense at the luxury Dorchester Hotel in London on their 
way to Monaco. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevan Gosper, an IOC executive board member from Australia, said  
the reports indicated the inducements offered by Coates went 
``beyond good will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear if Gosper had seen the documents.  
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that John's decision was intended to influence the  
IOC members' thinking,'' Gosper told The Associated Press. ``The 
perception may not match John's intention, the event having taken 
place the night before the vote. .... 
</P>
<P>
	``I can see this being viewed as questionable conduct. The  
perception will be quite damaging to Sydney. It's a very serious 
revelation. I think a lot of people will be destabilized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper was a senior official in the Sydney bid, but he said he  
was unaware of the offers until a journalist called him today. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said he immediately brought the matter to Samaranch's  
attention. He described Samaranch's reaction as ``one of serious 
concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said the revelations were serious enough to raise the  
issue of whether Sydney should keep the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't rule it out that some may call for the games not to  
proceed in Sydney,'' he said, indicating that even some IOC 
officials may feel that way. ``I think the Chinese reaction will be 
important. There were really only two cities in the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said he would urge the IOC this weekend to endorse the  
1993 vote awarding the games to Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	He also called for all of Sydney's documents to be made public  
and said the IOC should consider a full-scale inquiry into the 
city's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper didn't rule out that Coates would resign over the matter.  
He said he had not spoken to Coates directly, but defended him as 
an ``extremely competent'' and ``first-rate'' Olympic chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the 61-year-old Attarabulsi, an IOC member since 1977,  
stepped down because of revelations that his son, Suhel, received 
tuition to attend an English language center based at Brigham Young 
and a community college, plus $700 a month for expenses, from Salt 
Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I accepted his resignation and I thanked him for his 22 years  
as a member of the IOC, what he did for sport in his country and 
for us,'' Samaranch said in a telephone interview. ``He's a good 
man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said Attarabulsi made ``a mistake.''  
</P>
<P>
	Finland's Pirjo Haeggman resigned Tuesday. She was implicated  
because her former husband got jobs through bid committees in Salt 
Lake and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has said 13 members were implicated in the IOC's  
investigation into cash payments, college scholarships, free 
medical treatment, lavish gifts and other inducements related to 
Salt Lake's winning bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he did not know what action would be taken  
against four other members cited for minor violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-member inquiry, headed by IOC vice president Dick Pound,  
has found that the payments and gifts to members from Salt Lake 
City boosters totaled almost $800,000, with some members receiving 
more than $100,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said Pound's report has not yet been completed. He said  
the commission would begin meeting late today, then reconvene for 
most of Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the implicated members are expected to defend themselves  
in person before Pound's commission Saturday. On Sunday, the IOC 
executive board will recommend expulsions of members and propose 
ways of overhauling the entire Olympic bidding and selection 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has called a special IOC assembly for March 17-18 to  
vote on expulsions and ratify the new site-selection procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Members who choose not to resign will be suspended pending a  
vote by the full assembly, where a two-thirds majority vote is 
needed to expel a member. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Sydney news broke, Samaranch said the IOC was ready  
to investigate any documented allegations of corruption during 
other Olympic bid campaigns.

<HEADLINE> Aetna To Appeal Calif. Jury Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Aetna's chief executive called a jury's  
$120.5 million judgment against a California subsidiary the work of 
a ``skillful ambulance-chasing lawyer, a politically motivated 
judge and a weeping widow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A California jury Wednesday ordered Aetna U.S. Health Care of  
California to pay the damages to a woman whose husband fought until 
his death for coverage of experimental cancer treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Teresa Goodrich was awarded $116 million Wednesday in punitive  
damages and $4.5 million last week for medical expenses and loss of 
companionship in the 1995 death of her husband, David Goodrich. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard L. Huber said Thursday his company would vigorously  
appeal the award. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a travesty of justice,'' Huber said. ``It proves what  
we've been saying all along, that the tort system is a pretty 
inefficient way of resolving disputes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huber said key rulings in the case prevented the jury from  
hearing critical facts. He said there is ``no way'' the company 
will offer a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna released a point-by-point defense, claiming Goodrich  
failed to get prior approval for some of his chemotherapy and that 
another insurer, his wife's, covered his out-of-network treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also said a key Aetna manager was not allowed to  
testify during the punitive phase of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Huber said the verdict should also serve as a warning to  
businesses that their insurance costs could skyrocket if lawmakers 
across the nation begin passing laws that give patients the right 
to sue their HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict ``is going to alert the employers of America to the  
huge risks in this,'' Huber said. ``If ever there was a wake-up 
call to the employers of America, this is it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna recently announced that, beginning in July, its 6 million  
members will be able to appeal insurance coverage denials to 
committees of independent physicians. Aetna said it will abide by 
the decisions.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Byrd Wants Charges Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After two weeks of merely observing, senators  
posed their first questions in President Clinton's impeachment 
trial today and transformed the proceeding into a seesaw debate 
between prosecutors and presidential lawyers. A key Democratic 
senator said he would lead an effort to dismiss the impeachment 
charges next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia announced he would  
introduce a motion to dismiss the charges, but not because he 
believed the president had done no wrong. ``I am convinced that the 
necessary two-thirds for conviction are not there and that they are 
not likely to develop,'' he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have also become convinced that lengthening this trial will  
only prolong and deepen the divisive, bitter and polarizing effect 
this sorry affair has visited upon our nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd's move was particularly significant because he is widely  
viewed as a fierce defender of the Senate's prerogatives. In this 
case, he had publicly cautioned the White House not to lobby him to 
vote for Clinton's acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead prosecutor Henry Hyde urged the Senate to ``reject this  
motion'' and ``demand a full record'' of evidence. ``We always knew 
that there would be a motion to dismiss in this process; now we 
know who will offer that motion,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House reacted with cautious optimism. ``Senator Byrd's  
statement speaks for itself. Our position has been clear. We 
believe in a fair, bipartisan and expeditious resolution of this 
whole matter,'' spokesman James Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of Republicans have suggested in recent days that a way  
be found to end the trial promptly, despite fresh requests from 
House prosecutors for witnesses to be called. Senate Majority 
Leader Trent Lott suggested earlier in the day that a bipartisan 
caucus might be called next week to allow all senators to attempt 
to fashion guidelines for the remainder of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current rules, a motion to dismiss the proceedings may  
be made as soon as a 16-hour period for questioning the lawyers has 
expired. That could be as soon as Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd disclosed his intention as the senators submitted a series  
of questions to the two legal teams on the Senate floor. Those 
questions prompted a lively debate but broke little new ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Clinton wants all the benefits of a criminal trial  
without bearing any of its burden,'' Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., 
declared as he rejected White House claims that the impeachment 
articles were too broad and vague and would never survive the test 
of a criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear that President Clinton and his counsel know exactly  
what he is being charged with,'' Canady told the senators, who 
remained silent but submitted their questions to Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist to be read aloud. ``Impeachment is a political 
and not a criminal proceeding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House Counsel Charles Ruff used an early question to  
differentiate between impeachment of a federal judge and that of a 
president, arguing the threshold for the latter must be much 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you ask the same questions about the trauma the nation  
suffers when you are removing a judge as when you are removing a 
president?'' Ruff said. ``That answer must be stunningly different 
when you are asked should the president of the United States be 
removed and the will of the electorate overturned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several House managers made a new pitch to call witnesses, but  
Clinton's private attorney noted Ms. Lewinsky already has given 
eleven accounts about one key event in the case. ``I don't think 
you going to learn anything from a twelfth account. ... Calling 
witnesses will add nothing to the record before you,'' David 
Kendall argued. 
</P>
<P>
	And the presidential lawyer warned that if witnesses are  
summoned the White House will need ``many months to have a fair 
discovery process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Far from giving up, Hyde suggested senators invite the president  
to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House has said repeatedly that there are no plans for  
Clinton to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	The question-and-answer debate produced plenty of theater, as  
House prosecutors dismissed the White House arguments as ``legal 
schizophrenia'' and presidential lawyers accused the lawmakers of 
``straw-man'' building. Neither side broke new ground. 
</P>
<P>
	One House prosecutor, Rep. George Gekas, conceded today he  
doesn't believe any Democrats have been swayed by the evidence of 
perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``As of now, no,'' Gekas, R-Pa., said in an interview with The  
Associated Press. ``Now, that may change and could change by way of 
the series of questions that need to be asked. And also on the 
question of witnesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Republican senator suggested she wasn't convinced by the  
perjury evidence against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's grand jury testimony is replete with lies,  
with half-truths and evasions. I'm considering whether despite that 
they meet the test under our perjury laws,'' said Susan Collins of 
Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican senators used the early portion of the question  
period -- set to last two days -- to ask broad questions that gave 
House prosecutors a chance to answer the intense attacks on their 
evidence that White House lawyers made during a three-day opening 
argument that ended Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic senators followed up, using their turn three straight  
times at the start to ask Clinton's lawyer: ``Could you please 
comment on any of the legal and factual assertions'' made by the 
prosecutors in their last statement. The repetition made Rehnquist 
smile at one point. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff dismissed suggestions that the White House believed no  
private conduct by a president could ever rise to the level of an 
impeachable offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``The managers have, in their straw-man building role, tried to  
suggest that our position somehow is so distant from constitutional 
reality ... that we could not conceive of a situation in which 
private conduct, no matter how egregious, would lead to removal. 
And of course that is not the case,'' the president's counsel said. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutor James Rogan assailed the White House defense  
against the charge that Clinton committed perjury. ``If anybody 
wants a lesson in legal schizophrenia, please read the president's 
trial brief,'' the lawmaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., accused the White House of leaving  
out a key fact in its arguments that Clinton was not trying to 
tamper with a witness when he summoned Oval Office secretary Betty 
Currie to his office last year and went over his recollections of 
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers said Clinton wasn't trying to influence Mrs.  
Currie, and was simply refreshing his recollection in anticipation 
of media interest in the story.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Tumble; Dow Ends Down 143.41 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks ended lower Friday, after a rally in  
battered technology shares fizzled and blue-chip stocks came under 
selling pressure from a disappointing earnings report by IBM. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 143.41 to 9,120.67. The  
blue-chip index fell as much as 175 points in the morning before 
trimming its losses, and ended down 219.88 for the week. Friday's 
volume on New York Stock exchange totaled 947 million shares, down 
from Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index fell 5.84 to 2,338.88, and the  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index declined 9.97 to 1,225.19. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks fell sharply in early trading, extending steep  
losses logged earlier in the week. They rebounded around midday but 
ended the session mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're going to stabilize for some time,'' said  
Tom Rhinelander, an Internet analyst at Forrester Research. ``We 
still have a huge amount of speculation that's driven this 
run-up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. in  
Milwaukee, said Internet stocks could only go so low. ``If you look 
at where prices were a few weeks ago and where they are now, of 
course you have people jumping in to buy them because they think 
they are bargains.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America Online shares ended down 9/16 at 140 7/16 on the Big  
Board. In Nasdaq trading, the Web portal company Lycos lost 6 7/8 to 
110 1/8. But the bookseller Amazon.com rose 17 to 123, while portal 
company Yahoo! added 21 to 286. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM fell 17 1/4 to 179 3/4, accounting for more than 68 points of the  
Dow's losses. Although IBM's per share earnings of $2.47 beat 
analyst predictions, sales fell short. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to IBM, Dow components were led lower by American  
Express, down 4 at 98 1/2; Merck, down 7 5/16 to 139; J.P. Morgan, 
down 2 3/4 to 103 1/8; and General Electric, down 1 7/16 to 97 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer stocks declined on developments in Brazil, whose  
economic problems continued. 
</P>
<P>
	Colgate-Palmolive fell 1 13/16 to 75 1/4, and Kimberly-Clark lost 2  
1/16 to 48 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian currency, the real, ended another volatile session  
slightly weaker against the dollar, as unconfirmed buying of reals 
by the Brazil central bank appeared to contravene a week-old policy 
to let it float. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists have suggested that Brazil must refrain from selling  
its dollar reserves in an effort to boost the value of the real and 
must pass strict economic reform measures to prevent its recession 
from spreading throughout Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Worries over Brazil also battered overseas markets. In Asia,  
Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.64 percent and Hong Kong's Hang 
Seng Index fell 3.1 percent. In Europe, Germany's DAX index fell 3 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 2.7 percent, and France's CAC-40 
fell 3.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered  
advancers by a 3-to-2 margin. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 4.28 to 583.75, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.30 to 704.69. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.61 to 422.44.

<HEADLINE> Russian Athletes Can't Get Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian athletes who received cash bonuses for  
winning Olympic medals have seen their dreams collapse -- because 
their money is stuck in an ailing bank and they still have to pay 
taxes on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Olympic team who won medals at last year's winter  
games in Japan got bonuses from the Russian government for boosting 
the country's prestige. Gold medal winners got $50,000, silver 
medal winners got $20,000 and bronze medal winners got $10,000. 
Trainers and support staff for medal winners also received bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	But some $500,000 of the winnings is frozen in the Russian Bank  
for Reconstruction and Development, one of the dozens of banks 
crippled by last August's financial crisis, The Moscow Times 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The money was in the athletes' accounts at the bank, which was  
used by the Russian Olympic Committee. There is little chance the 
money will be recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian athletic officials worry the banking failure could be  
the last straw for many top competitors, who receive only modest 
state support. 
</P>
<P>
	``Keeping our champions in Russia will be incredibly hard for us  
now that they've been virtually punished for winning at the 
Olympics and have lucrative contracts with foreign teams pending,'' 
Valentin Piseyev, president of the Russian Figure Skating 
Federation was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Making things worse, state tax authorities are saying the  
winners must still pay tax on their winnings, even if they can't 
get it out of the bank, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia paid out $1 million in Olympic bonuses after the team won  
18 medals. Some winners withdrew all or part of their winnings and 
got to keep it. But other athletes transferred their winnings to 
other banks, some of which also collapsed, the report said.

	International Olympic Committee members linked by officials,  
news media reports or their own statements to the bribery 
investigation stemming from the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City 
include: 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

</P>
<P>
	Arroyo's stepdaughter, Nancy, worked briefly for both Utah state  
government and the Salt Lake bid committee, and received tuition 
help from the committee while attending a school in Texas, 
according to former Salt Lake Olympics chief Tom Welch. Olympic 
officials say his case is serious enough to warrant expulsion.

	Attarabulsi's son, Suhel, told the Deseret News of Salt Lake  
that he received tuition at BYU and other Utah schools, plus $700 a 
month for expenses, from both the Salt Lake bid and organizing 
committees. On his application to BYU, the address he listed was 
the Salt Lake Bid Committee offices. Attarabulsi, whose case was 
listed as serious by Olympic officials, resigned from the committee 
today.

Montreal, made a $60,000 profit on a land deal in Utah arranged by 
a member of the Salt Lake bid and organizing committees. Welch said 
he gave Ganga $50,000 to help feed children in his war-torn 
homeland, and published reports have linked Ganga to a total of 
$70,000 from Salt Lake officials. He and his mother also received 
medical care paid for by SLOC. Olympic officials say his case is 
serious enough to warrant expulsion.

<HEADLINE> Wu-Tang Clan Rapper Posts Bail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rapper ODB posted $150,000 cash bail Friday  
after spending a week in jail for allegedly firing a gun during an 
encounter with undercover police. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old Wu-Tang Clan rapper, whose real name is Russell  
Jones, is charged with attempted murder in the first degree, 
attempted murder in the second degree and criminal weapons 
possession. The principal charge carries a maximum penalty of 25 
years to life. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say Jones fired at undercover officers after they stopped  
his sport utility vehicle for a routine traffic violation Jan. 15. 
The officers fired four or five shots back, but no one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have yet to comment on whether they found the gun  
allegedly used to fire at the officers. Jones' attorney, Peter 
Frankel, did not return a telephone call regarding the results of a 
paraffin test -- used to detect gunpowder residue on a suspect's 
hands. Jones took the test last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones is a founding member of Wu-Tang Clan. Since 1987 he has  
had several run-ins with the law, including four arrests in the 
past year for such offenses as menacing security officers, alleged 
shoplifting and threatening a former girlfriend.

<HEADLINE>  Pope Still Enjoys Traveling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE (AP) -- Twenty years after beginning his  
jet-age papacy, Pope John Paul II set out today for Mexico, hinting 
in an airborne news conference that he would like to visit Russia 
and China. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-and-a-half hours into the 13-hour flight, the pope came  
out of his compartment on the specially converted Alitalia jetliner 
and walked to the rear to meet the media. 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old pontiff greeted the media by holding up his  
wooden cane and donning a sombrero given to him by a Mexican 
journalist. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit is John Paul's 85th foreign trip as pope. After five  
days in Mexico City, he heads to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope is wildly popular in Mexico, and people were already  
gathering today for his Saturday Mass at the Basilica of Our Lady 
of Guadalupe. They said they would stand in front of the gates 
until the pope had come and gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to wait to hear the word of God that the father will  
sing,'' said Rosalia Antonia Jacobo, a 55-year-old Indian who 
traveled from the Gulf of Mexico state of Veracruz. ``I have to see 
him. He's the messenger of God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pope has been plagued by health problems in recent years,  
but he appeared in relatively good form today. Leaning on a seat in 
the MD-11, he answered questions in English, Italian and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	His first papal trip abroad was to Mexico in 1979. Asked if  
after all these years he was still keen on traveling, the pope 
insisted he had the ``will and enthusiasm'' to keep going, noting 
he has not yet visited Russia or China. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions with the Orthodox church make a visit to Russia  
unlikely soon, and China does not recognize the Roman Catholic 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope noted the biggest change since he first visited the  
United States 20 years ago was the end of the Cold War and the fall 
of the Soviet Union, leaving the United States as the only 
superpower. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it's a good or a bad thing. That's the way it  
is,'' John Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope noted that during his meeting with President Clinton,  
the two will discuss the changed world. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope is scheduled to talk with Clinton on Tuesday in an  
airport hangar, their fourth face-to-face meeting. The Vatican has 
serious differences with the Clinton administration, particularly 
over the airstrikes against Iraq and its economic embargo of Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope is likely to raise issues discussed on previous visits  
to the United States, encouraging economic generosity, openness to 
immigrants and condemnation of abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul said he was looking forward to being steeped again in  
Mexican enthusiasm. ``They don't let you sleep at night,'' he 
joked. 
</P>
<P>
	Invited by bishops from both North and South America during a  
special assembly in Rome in the fall of 1997, the pope will answer 
some of the concerns they raised in a document to be released 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	He is expected to address economic injustice and the burden  
foreign debt places on poor countries, as well as introduce 
proposals to give the church a greater role in culture and public 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Aboard the plane, John Paul addressed another issue riveting  
Mexico, the leftist rebellion in the southern state of Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be no solution without recognition that the  
indigenous people were the first owners of the land,'' the pope 
told reporters. He also stressed the need for dialogue and 
cautioned against transforming Marxist liberation theology into 
``indigenous theology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking about one of the most watched of all his foreign  
pilgrimages, last year's trip to Cuba, the pope said he was 
``relatively pleased'' with progress since then, and pointed to the 
restoration of Christmas as an official holiday on the 
Communist-run island. He noted he was invited to make a stop there 
on this trip, but that the schedule had already been arranged. 
</P>
<P>
	His message on this trip will guide the Catholic church in  
countering inroads made by Protestant evangelicals, who present a 
major challenge to Catholicism's historical dominance in the 
region, where half the world's 1 billion Catholics live. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico was the chief destination of his first foreign trip in  
1979, just three months after the Polish cardinal became pope. He 
quickly won over Mexicans by wearing a sombrero and praying at the 
basilica dedicated to Our Lady of Guadalupe, the olive-skinned 
Virgin Mary who is a figure of wide devotion. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope made a second major tour of Mexico in 1990 and stopped  
briefly in the Yucatan three years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all the events planned for the pope's five days in  
Mexico, this visit is far less demanding than his previous 
barnstorming tours to give him more rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope moves slowly now, often shuffling. His slurred speech,  
trembling left hand and sometimes absent expression could be 
symptoms of Parkinson's disease, a progressive neurological 
disorder, but the Vatican has never stated exactly what ails him.

immigrants and condemnation of abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul said he was looking forward to being steeped again in  
Mexican enthusiasm. ``They don't let you sleep at night,'' he 
joked. 
</P>
<P>
	Invited by bishops from both North and South America during a  
special assembly in Rome in the fall of 1997, the pope will answer 
some of the concerns they raised in a document to be released 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	He is expected to address economic injustice and the burden  
foreign debt places on poor countries, as well as introduce 
proposals to give the church a greater role in culture and public 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Aboard the plane, John Paul addressed another issue riveting  
Mexico, the leftist rebellion in the southern state of Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be no solution without recognition that the  
indigenous people were the first owners of the land,'' the pope 
told reporters. He also stressed the need for dialogue and 
cautioned against transforming Marxist liberation theology into 
``indigenous theology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking about one of the most watched of all his foreign  
pilgrimages, last year's trip to Cuba, the pope said he was 
``relatively pleased'' with progress since then, and pointed to the 
restoration of Christmas as an official holiday on the 
Communist-run island. He noted he was invited to make a stop there 
on this trip, but that the schedule had already been arranged. 
</P>
<P>
	His message on this trip will guide the Catholic church in  
countering inroads made by Protestant evangelicals, who present a 
major challenge to Catholicism's historical dominance in the 
region, where half the world's 1 billion Catholics live. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico was the chief destination of his first foreign trip in  
1979, just three months after the Polish cardinal became pope. He 
quickly won over Mexicans by wearing a sombrero and praying at the 
basilica dedicated to Our Lady of Guadalupe, the olive-skinned 
Virgin Mary who is a figure of wide devotion. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope made a second major tour of Mexico in 1990 and stopped  
briefly in the Yucatan three years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all the events planned for the pope's five days in  
Mexico, this visit is far less demanding than his previous 
barnstorming tours to give him more rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope moves slowly now, often shuffling. His slurred speech,  
trembling left hand and sometimes absent expression could be 
symptoms of Parkinson's disease, a progressive neurological 
disorder, but the Vatican has never stated exactly what ails him.

<HEADLINE> Hornets' Rice Undergoes Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- Charlotte Hornets forward Glen Rice  
had loose particles removed from his right elbow Friday in what the 
team said was a successful surgical procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation was performed by Dr. Harlon Selesnick at  
HealthSouth Doctors' Hospital, the Hornets said in a prepared 
statement. Rice was expected to be sidelined for six to eight weeks 
and should recover fully, the team said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the Hornets said the procedure to remove bone  
chips could keep Rice out for up to six weeks -- about 40 percent of 
the 50-game season. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice averaged 21.6, 26.8 and 22.3 points per game over the past  
three seasons. He missed just six games in that span. Rice, 31, has 
missed just 20 games in a nine-year NBA career. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the NBA's best 3-point shooters and an All-Star the past  
two seasons, Rice has been wearing a neoprene sleeve on his right 
elbow for most of the past two years.

<HEADLINE> Hit Pedestrian Gets $11 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A man who was hit by a police car while  
crossing a downtown street will receive $11 million, the largest 
legal settlement paid by the city in its history, the City Council 
decided Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro Antonio Espinoza, 52, suffered a brain injury when he was  
struck in a crosswalk in October 1997. The acclaimed salsa dancer 
and assistant printer is unable to speak or talk and remains in a 
rehabilitation hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Espinoza's bills total about $32,000 a month and have so far  
reached nearly $1.9 million. A city attorney's report said 
Espinoza's lawyers had initially sought $15.4 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is above what we would expect in a settlement but below  
what we could have gotten from a jury,'' said Espinoza's lawyer, 
F.X. Sean O'Doherty. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant City Attorney Michael K. Fox said in a report to City  
Council members that liability in the case was ``virtually 
inescapable.'' He added a jury would ``easily'' approve a verdict 
in Espinoza's favor higher than $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant City Attorney Dan Woodard said the settlement is the  
largest paid by the city.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Close Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Profit-taking drove down Japanese stocks today,  
capping a rally earlier this week led by bank shares. The dollar 
was higher against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 91.02 points,  
or 0.64 percent, to close the session at 14,154.40. On Thursday, 
the average closed up 217.37 points, or 1.55 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 113.70 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.58  
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo, and above its late New York level 
of 113.68 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, traders took profits and unwound  
positions ahead of the weekend, ending a rebound in which the main 
index gained 474.98 points, or 3.45 percent, over the last two 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There isn't a sense that the Nikkei average can sustain itself  
close to 15,000,'' said Masaru Arai, general manager of the stock 
division at Ryoko Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices had been higher for most of the session on buying  
by investors expecting that streamlining and mergers in the banking 
industry and other sectors will pave the way to recovery, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The engine of the market's recent rebound, bank shares, closed  
mixed today. Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi Ltd., Sumitomo Bank Ltd. and 
Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp. ended higher, while Sakura Bank 
Ltd., Fuji Bank Ltd. and Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. all fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section lost 7.63 points, or 0.69 percent, to 1,097.29. The 
TOPIX closed up 14.85 points or 1.36 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 514.65 million shares changed hands on the First  
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from 539.61 million 
shares Thursday. Retreats outnumbered advances 708 to 441, while 
153 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar continued to strengthen in  
Tokyo after surging in New York on rumors China was going to 
devalue its currency, which would further harm the struggling 
Japanese economy. 
</P>
<P>
	But the greenback's gains could be capped by worry over trade  
friction between the U.S. and Japan, which tends to weaken the 
dollar, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those concerns were fueled when Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi  
Miyazawa said early today that Japan's soaring exports to the U.S. 
might become a political issue, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 113.50 yen and 114.12 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was traded at 131.92 yen, down from 130.92  
yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government bond  
fell to 1.725 percent from 1.780 percent on Thursday, driving its 
price up to 100.60 yen from 100.16 yen.

<HEADLINE> TV Station Shooting Victim Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- An AT&AMP;T employee died Friday from a  
gunshot wound to the head suffered eight days earlier when a woman 
went floor to floor firing a handgun in a TV station. 
</P>
<P>
	The death of Anne Sleater means De-Kieu Duy will now face  
capital murder and aggravated homicide charges, prosecutor Dick 
Shepherd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sleater was never upgraded from critical condition since she and  
another man were shot Jan. 14, LDS Hospital said. The other victim 
sustained only minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Duy, 24, was tackled and disarmed by workers after the shootings  
in the downtown building that houses several businesses. Ms. 
Sleater, 30, worked for AT&AMP;T Wireless Services in the office above 
KSL television and radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Duy, who has a history of mental problem, believed a  
KSL worker was harassing her and was trying to gain access to the 
newsroom to shoot that employee.

<HEADLINE> Couples Work More, Enjoy It Less </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Bulletin from the job front: People work  
more than they want to. 
</P>
<P>
	A new study of two-career couples finds that the number of hours  
they spend on the job has risen substantially in the past two 
decades. And they don't like it. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are working longer hours, and it's not because they  
want to,'' said Marin Clarkberg, a Cornell University sociologist. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarkberg and other researchers presented their latest findings  
on the work-family time squeeze Friday at a meeting of the American 
Association for the Advancement of Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sexes feel stressed by the competing demands of job and  
home. But in some ways, the situation can seem worse for women, 
said Clarkberg, because they often have to choose between working 
full time or not at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason: too few part-time jobs for women with families, and  
the ones that exist often pay poorly and do not offer health 
insurance or other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarkberg's research showed that actually, both men and women  
would often like to work something less than a standard 40- or 
50-hour week. 
</P>
<P>
	Her results were based surveys of 4,554 married couples. They  
were questioned in 1988 and 1994 as part of the National Study of 
Families and Households. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--43 percent of men and 34 percent of women said they work more  
hours than they want to. The number is smaller for women only 
because one-quarter of them don't have paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	--Half of all the women and 20 percent of the men said they  
wished they could work part time. In fact, though, just 20 percent 
of the women and 6 percent of the men did this. 
</P>
<P>
	--Only about 10 percent of couples said they prefer the  
traditional roles of the man as breadwinner and woman as full-time 
housewife. Yet 25 percent of the couples fit this mold. 
</P>
<P>
	--Just 14 percent of couples said they want both spouses to work  
full-time. However, twice that number actually do. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the problem, said Phyllis Moen, another Cornell  
sociologist, is that the job market is still largely geared toward 
the traditional pattern of working full-time or not at all -- a 
setup suited best to working husbands and stay-at-home wives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Workers increasingly are caught in a time squeeze,'' said  
Moen. ``They have two jobs, one at work, one at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Home computers, e-mail, faxes and other innovations  
theoretically should make it possible for people to be more 
flexible about their work hours. But the researchers said the 
technology often seems to result in people working still more. 
</P>
<P>
	``People can work anyplace, anytime, but they can also work  
everywhere, all the time,'' said Moen. 
</P>
<P>
	Other data collected by Clarkberg shows that when couples' work  
hours are added up, they are spending more time on the job than 
ever before. Between 1972 and 1994, couples' total average working 
time has increased by seven hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Another study by Robert Drago of the University of Wisconsin in  
Milwaukee examined teachers' hours to see if they are really as 
cushy as they are sometimes portrayed. He found that while teachers 
are required by their contracts to work an average of 6 1/2 hours a 
day, they actually average just under 10 hours when their extra 
hours at school, commuting time and homework are added in.

<HEADLINE> Promise of 'Master Cell' Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Should the tax dollars of people who oppose  
abortion be used for medical research based on cells taken from 
aborted fetuses or discarded embryos? 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone against abortion might answer no. But suppose that  
research creates a cure for, say, Parkinson's disease and an 
abortion opponent who had opposed the research gets Parkinson's. 
Should treatment be withheld? 
</P>
<P>
	Ethics experts are grappling with these kinds of questions as  
medical science moves toward a new frontier: research using master 
cells that are the root of human life. 
</P>
<P>
	They are called embryonic stem cells, microscopic dots that grow  
inside weeks-old embryos before morphing into 210 types of cells 
that make up a human body. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding and controlling embryonic stem cells has been a Holy  
Grail of science. Understanding how they develop could prevent 
birth defects. These cells could grow huge tissue banks for safer 
drug testing. They might even grow replacement body parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearts cannot regenerate. But imagine doctors one day repairing  
heart-attack damage with a simple injection of cells to grow new 
heart tissue -- or curing diabetes by injecting insulin-producing 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Excitement in the scientific community was understandably great  
last fall when researchers in Wisconsin and Maryland culled some of 
these mysterious cells and grew large supplies of them in 
laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	Sound like science fiction? Look to Johns Hopkins University,  
where Dr. John Gearhart already has used the technology to grow 
fledgling human brain cells in his lab. 
</P>
<P>
	The research is controversial because the original cells came  
from aborted fetuses, or from embryos donated by infertile couples 
who had extras left over from fertility treatment. Some ethicists 
have concerns, and abortion opponents declare stem cell technology 
immoral and want it banned. 
</P>
<P>
	That is unrealistic. Powerful patients' groups are demanding the  
research, and private companies already are racing ahead. But 
private research gets no public scrutiny. The government is about 
to finance stem cell research -- and it can set limits. So President 
Clinton's National Bioethics Advisory Commission is charting the 
ethical boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
	What is ``the degree to which the use of stem cells is tainted''  
because of their original source, asked ethics adviser R. Alta 
Charo of the University of Wisconsin. Does federal financing make 
abortion opponents unwilling partners to embryo-derived research? 
``We take seriously the notion of complicity,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a taxpayer, ``I pay for a lot of things I don't approve of,''  
responded Georgetown University ethicist Patricia King, one of the 
panel's expert witnesses. ``Should we ever treat anybody with moral 
objections to abortion with treatments derived'' from fetal tissue? 
</P>
<P>
	If the laboratory-grown stem cells run out, is it OK to  
reharvest just from aborted fetuses, or are fertility clinics' 
unused embryos acceptable? Clinics would destroy many of those 
embryos anyway, said University of Texas ethicist John Roberton. 
But custody fights over frozen embryos attest they are precious to 
the couples who produced them. If they are used, how do you ensure 
couples aren't pressured to donate? 
</P>
<P>
	Does a cell have any rights? What uses of stem cell technology  
are acceptable? Should scientists ever create an embryo just to 
grow stem cells? 
</P>
<P>
	That is not so far-fetched, if patients one day wanted a  
customized cell transplant containing their own genes. 
</P>
<P>
	Science is progressing so rapidly in this new area of research  
that it may circumvent these dilemmas. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers announced Thursday that adult mice harbor certain  
``mature stem cells'' designed to replenish one tissue that can 
sometimes be recoded to grow other tissues. If humans have the same 
capacity, stem cells from embryos might not be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	But for now, the ethical questions demand attention because this  
research is taking off, and Clinton's advisers are debating the 
limits.	   ``I don't see why we need to take an all-or-nothing approach,'' 
said Dr. Lawrence Miike, Hawaii's state health director, who urged 
that abortion concerns be balanced against the ``burden of 
disease'' that stem cells might alleviate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may not have explained adequately what is at stake ... in  
terms of having public interest in this beyond fear,'' King added.

<HEADLINE> Gay Discharges Reportedly Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Air Force and Army report sharp increases  
in the number of troops discharged for homosexuality, and officials 
believe many are discontented recruits looking for a way out. 
</P>
<P>
	In releasing the figures Friday, the Defense Department said it  
was satisfied with its ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy on 
homosexuality in the services. It asserted that the 1998 discharge 
numbers ``align'' with those of previous years, even though they 
reached an 11-year high. 
</P>
<P>
	A watchdog group, the Servicemembers Legal Defense Fund, said it  
interpreted the rise in discharges last year as fresh evidence that 
gays still are being mistreated in the 1.4-million-member 
active-duty military. 
</P>
<P>
	``Commanders are still asking, pursuing and harassing people,''  
said Dixon Osburn, the group's co-executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy, adopted in 1994, is  
supposed to allow gays to serve if they keep their sexual 
orientation private. It punishes those who engage in homosexual 
acts or take actions that call attention to their orientation. But 
critics accuse the services of hunting down gays and driving them 
out of the service. 
</P>
<P>
	If a service member voluntarily states his or her homosexuality,  
discharge is automatic. In the case of a recruit still in basic 
training, a voluntary declaration of homosexuality means an 
administrative discharge that does not carry a bad-conduct stigma. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force said it discharged 414 people last year for being  
gay, up from 309 in 1997. The Army's total jumped from 197 to 310, 
while the Navy reported a drop from 413 to 345. Discharges in the 
Marine Corps, by far the smallest of the services, dipped from 78 
to 76. 
</P>
<P>
	The military-wide total of 1,145 gay discharges compares with  
997 in 1997 and is the highest total since 1987. The number reached 
a low of 617 in 1994, the year the new policy took effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Pentagon policy there are three grounds for discharge:  
if a service member voluntarily states that he or she is gay; if 
someone is determined to have engaged in a homosexual act; and in 
the case of same-sex marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of the Air Force's 414 discharges were at  
Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, where new recruits take their six 
weeks of basic training. In the vast majority of cases servicewide, 
the person voluntarily stated that he or she was gay, Air Force 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In virtually every self-initiated disclosure, the second  
statement made is, `I'd also like to be discharged,''' said David 
Smith, a spokesman for the Air Education and Training Command at 
Randolph Air Force Base, Texas. He said this led officials to 
conclude that a growing number of recruits are using a gay 
declaration to get out. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said commanders are legally prohibited from questioning  
Air Force members about such voluntary statements. ``You kind of 
have to take them at their word,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	T'jae Gibson, an Air Force spokeswoman at the Pentagon, said an  
official review of discharges and personnel policies at Lackland 
last year found that most instructors and trainees there believed 
the acknowledgments of homosexuality were made to cut short an 
enlistment. 
</P>
<P>
	Army officials said Friday they also suspect many gay discharges  
in their service involve soldiers looking for a quick way out, but 
they do not consider the trend to be a major source of worry. 
</P>
<P>
	Last April, the Pentagon released a report on enforcement of its  
gay policy. It said early discharges based on voluntary statements 
of homosexuality occurred most often in the Air Force, where 212 of 
the 309 Air Force gay discharges in 1997 occurred in basic 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said ``the reasons for this increase are not known  
and would be difficult to ascertain.''

<HEADLINE> U S West Reports Higher Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- U S West Inc. reported a 62 percent increase in  
net income in the fourth quarter over the same period a year ago, 
when the regional phone company's results were dragged down by a 
regulatory charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income rose to $368 million, or 73 cents per share, from  
$227 million, or 45 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1997. 
Revenue was $3.2 billion, up 13.5 percent from $2.8 billion for the 
1997 fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were in line with analysts' expectations. U S West's  
stock rose 31 1/4 cents to $61.43 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West spokesman Dave Banks said the huge increase reflects a  
$250 million charge for regulatory refunds, issued primarily in the 
state of Washington, that dragged down earnings in the final 
quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking into account those refunds, the net income increase for  
the 1998 fourth quarter is closer to 6 percent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, U S West reported net income of $1.43 billion, or  
$2.84 per share, an increase of 5.4 percent from $1.36 billion, or 
$2.70 a share, for all of 1997. Revenues rose 8.7 percent to $12.4 
billion from $11.5 billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Sol Trujillo, president and chief executive officer, said the  
company expects to achieve 12 percent to 14 percent earnings growth 
beginning in 1999, a year earlier than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West provides telecommunications services to more than 25  
million customers nationally and in 14 Western and Midwestern 
states.

<HEADLINE> FDA Warns About Salted Fish Recall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government reports the recall of 18,000  
pounds of Hansung salted yellow croaker, a type of salted fish, by 
a California company because of concerns the fish may cause the 
life-threatening food poisoning botulism. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration warned consumers Thursday not  
to eat the recalled fish even if it does not look or smell spoiled. 
</P>
<P>
	Uneviscerated Hansung salted yellow croaker, distributed by  
Pacific Giant Inc. of Los Angeles, has the potential to be 
contaminated with Clostridium botulinum, bacteria that emit 
botulism-causing toxins, the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms include weakness, dizziness, double vision, trouble  
speaking or swallowing, difficulty breathing, abdominal swelling or 
constipation. People experiencing these symptoms should seek 
immediate medical care, the FDA warned. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA knows of no illnesses from eating the fish, which have  
been sold for the last 18 months. But if the salted fish are stored 
in a freezer, they may be eaten months after purchase, the agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled fish was sold mostly in oriental markets in  
California, New York, Hawaii, Arizona, Washington, Texas, Illinois 
and Washington, D.C. Sixteen-ounce packages containing five or six 
whole fish are labeled with the name ``Hansung salted yellow 
croaker'' in English and Korean. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA issued the warning after New York state inspectors said  
the fish may not have been prepared in a way to prevent botulism. 
It is imperative for proper salting of the intestinal tract of 
uneviscerated fish, which is where the toxin can form, the agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For more information call Pacific Giant at 213-689-4000.

<HEADLINE> Pistons Start Drills, Sign Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- The pace picked up, both on and off  
the court, as the Detroit Pistons acquired Loy Vaught, Christian 
Laettner and Jud Buechler on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the team's practice facility, coach Alvin Gentry was putting  
the Pistons through tough two-a-day drills. In the front office, 
general manager Rick Sund was busy wheeling and dealing. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was over, the Pistons:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Renounced the rights to Malik Sealy, Grant Long and Rick  
Mahorn. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Waived second year guard Charles O'Bannon.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Re-signed veteran guards Joe Dumars and Jerry Stackhouse.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Acquired Laettner from the Atlanta Hawks in exchange for  
second-year center Scot Pollard and a conditional first round draft 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Signed Vaught and Buechler to multi-year contracts.  
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Pistons traded the draft rights to first-round  
draft pick Bonzi Wells to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange 
for a conditional first-round draft choice. On Friday, that choice 
was sent to Atlanta as part of the Laettner and Pollard trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Buechler, a 6-foot-6 swingman who can play either guard or  
forward, played last season for the Chicago Bulls. Detroit will be 
his fifth team in eight NBA seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he gives us some needed depth,'' Gentry said.  
</P>
<P>
	Vaught, a former Michigan standout, played last season for the  
Los Angeles Clippers. He said he was completely recovered from back 
surgery that cut his season short last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``My back is fine,'' Vaught said. ``I feel very strong and  
flexible. It's much better than before the surgery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laettner, a teammate of Grant Hill at Duke, is recovering from a  
ruptured Achilles tendon and might not be able to play until March. 
He played for the Atlanta Hawks last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being able to play with Grant again was part of wanting to  
come here,'' Laettner said. ``I liked the team they had here last 
season. I made sure my agent kept us in the mix. I wanted to come 
here, even before I knew they were signing Loy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks signed Laettner to a three-year, $18 million deal  
before he was traded. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaught, Laettner, Buechler, Dumars and Stackhouse all had to sit  
out the first of Friday's two-a-day drills because they didn't sign 
until late afternoon. All except Laettner took part in the evening 
practice session. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, all I do is coach the guys that are out here,''  
Gentry said with a shrug. ``But I can say I'll be glad when those 
guys are all here, so I can coach the whole team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Gentry was doing what he could with the players  
he had. That meant mostly running. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like every drill we do involves running,'' Hill said  
after the morning workout. ``He's definitely trying to sneak it in 
there. The guys are really fatigued. There are some sore legs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gentry said he was running the players hard for two reasons:  
One, he wants to play a fast, uptempo game this season. Two, there 
isn't much time to get ready for the 50-game season, which begins 
Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess you can look at that two ways,'' forward Bison Dele  
said. ``We'll be in really good shape. But then the talent level 
kicks in. They'll be coming in with fresh legs. 
</P>
<P>
	``So, they'll have the legs and we'll have the lungs, I guess.  
We'll see how that plays out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, there was no question how Gentry's first camp as  
coach was going to play out. Gentry made it clear that he was boss, 
demanding the players do the drills right, even after fatigue began 
to set in. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can be out here five more minutes, or we can be out here  
five more hours,'' Gentry barked toward the end of practice. ``It's 
all up to you, how we get it done.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Lilith Fair may soon be the stuff of  
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``After this summer, we might take a holiday for a year, or four  
years, or permanently,'' said Terry McBride, who co-founded the 
all-women's musical caravan with singer Sarah McLachlan and is her 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. MacLachlan will headline at this summer's fair, which begins  
July 8 in Vancouver, British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lilith Fair is such a big undertaking -- you're moving a small  
village of people every single day. We're managers and artists, not 
promoters. Putting on a festival shouldn't dominate our lives,'' 
Ms. McBride said in Friday's USA Today.

<HEADLINE> Payton Likes Sonics Shot at Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Gary Payton thinks he'll get along fine with new  
coach Paul Westphal. 
</P>
<P>
	He also thinks the Seattle SuperSonics, even without George  
Karl, can win an NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a different look, but I'm going to have fun  
with it,'' Payton said. ``I can't complain about really nothing 
right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westphal has replaced Karl this season, and Payton is just  
getting to know the former Phoenix Suns' coach. 
</P>
<P>
	In 6 1/2 seasons under Karl, the combative Payton developed into  
one of the NBA's top point guards. Karl gave Payton a long leash, 
but the nine-year veteran doesn't feel Seattle's coaching change 
will create any problems for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's going to be a coach where he's going to give us a  
lot of leeway,'' Payton said. ``We're going to have to come out and 
play for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payton applauded two moves team president Wally Walker made  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker sent unproductive center Jim McIlvaine to the New Jersey  
Nets and signed Olden Polynice, 34, another 7-footer, to a one-year 
contract as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Olden's the type of player that I like,'' Payton said. ``He's  
a player who bangs and gets stuff done. When he gets motivated, he 
starts getting his little dance and stuff. I think we need that 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payton is earning an average of $12 million a season on a  
seven-year contract. He returned practice after the lockout in 
which he lost $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was with the players,'' he said. ``That's what we wanted to  
do. Now we can go on with our lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payton is joined by All-Star forward Vin Baker and former  
All-Stars Detlef Schrempf and Hersey Hawkins. And Payton thinks 
that core group can produce a title. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sonics are a veteran team that won 61 games and the Pacific  
Division last season before losing to the Los Angeles Lakers and 
Shaquille O'Neal in the playoffs, costing Karl his job. 
</P>
<P>
	McIlvaine wasn't a playoff factor. Payton thinks Polynice could  
be. 
</P>
<P>
	``Olden's a guy who's going to score for us and who's going to  
get some rebounds,'' Payton said. ``When Shaq was coming out and 
getting 40 (against the Sonics in the playoffs), we needed a big 
man who could go down in there and get us 18 or 20 points, too.''

<HEADLINE> Death Row Escapees Exploited Flaws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The warden of a prison where seven convicted  
killers escaped from death row on Thanksgiving night was demoted 
after the state released a report critical of the prison's 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The report released Thursday by the Texas Department of Criminal  
Justice and others found that inmates took advantage of poor 
supervision by guards and inadequate lighting and fences at the 
Ellis Unit near Huntsville. 
</P>
<P>
	Former warden Bruce Thaler is a 26-year veteran of the  
corrections department who had headed Ellis for about seven years. 
He was demoted and transferred to an administrative job involving 
classification of inmates. His two assistant wardens also were 
transferred. 
</P>
<P>
	``Failure to make sure policies and procedures were followed,''  
agency executive director Wayne Scott said in explaining the 
ousters. ``If the staff on duty had performed correctly, this 
wouldn't have occurred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Disciplinary actions, which could be as severe as firing, are  
pending against at least three uniformed officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The inmates escaped Nov. 26. Six were stopped by gunfire from  
guards in two security towers. Martin Gurule, 29, managed to climb 
over two 10-foot fences and became the first inmate to escape from 
Texas' death row in 64 years. 
</P>
<P>
	His body was found a week later in a creek a couple of miles  
from the prison. An autopsy determined that he had drowned. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the report, staffing was below minimum requirements  
because sergeants had allowed too many officers to have the night 
off, then allowed others to leave early. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also said the inmates were able to hide on the prison  
roof because officers did not follow procedure during their regular 
count of prisoners. Some inspections were conducted via TV monitors 
only. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also determined that one of the guards who fired  
at the inmates flushed a cigarette down a toilet before grabbing 
his rifle. Smoking is forbidden in the prison.

<HEADLINE> GE To Pay $100 Million Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A federal judge Friday approved a settlement  
agreement in a class action lawsuit that accused General Electric 
Capital Corp. of unfair debt collection practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the 50-state settlement, GE Capital will reimburse  
bankrupt debtors a total of about $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed in April 1997, claimed that Stamford,  
Conn.-based GE Capital solicited agreements from bankrupt debtors 
to repay their credit card debts but failed to notify bankruptcy 
courts about the agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit card debts are erased when customers file for bankruptcy.  
But when customers sign reaffirmation agreements, they agree to 
continue paying off their debt in exchange for keeping the credit 
card. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claimed that GE Capital was required by law to file  
the agreements with bankruptcy courts and did not do so. 
</P>
<P>
	GE Capital, which owns and operates the Montgomery Ward credit  
card among others, admitted to no wrongdoing in the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, which was reached by both sides in August  
and approved by U.S. District Judge James F. Holderman Friday, the 
company will refund, with interest, all credit card payments made 
after debtors entered into the reaffirmation agreements between 
Jan. 1, 1993, and June 30, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will also advise credit bureaus to correct any  
negative credit reports related to class members' failure to pay 
reaffirmed debt and will contribute about $2 million to consumer 
education programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Fredric Ellis, one of the attorneys who filed the lawsuit in  
April 1997, said there are at least 60,000 people eligible for 
reimbursements under the agreement and possibly as many as 180,000 
when debtors are notified of the settlement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Oliver, a spokesman for GE Capital, said Friday that the  
settlement will not affect GE Capital's earnings because the 
company began setting aside funds in anticipation of the agreement 
in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Nicholson Re-Elected GOP Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jim Nicholson overcame an aggressive challenge  
today to win a second term as chairman of the Republican National 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson, a Colorado businessman, defeated Florida Republican  
Party chairman Tom Slade, 127-36, despite disappointment with the 
party's showing in the 1998 midterm elections. 
</P>
<P>
	In his acceptance speech, Nicholson blasted President Clinton  
and Vice President Al Gore, who is running for the Democratic 
presidential nomination in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clinton has few ironclad beliefs, but he does believe this:  
Winning is the sole judge of right and wrong,'' Nicholson asserted. 
</P>
<P>
	He conceded, however, that the Republican Party has ``sustained  
political damage, at least in the short term,'' for its 
poll-defying push to impeach Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	But he predicted Democrats will pay the price in the long term.  
``In failing to stand up for basic democratic ... values, Democrats 
have sustained damage that goes way beyond the political and will 
cling to them for years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Gore, who he said was Clinton's chief defender, Nicholson  
promised to keep tabs on the administration's spending policies 
with a display at the RNC Washington headquarters that he will call 
the ``Gore Spend-o-Meter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Gore is ``the chief defender and heir-apparent and  
leader of the tax-and-spend wing of the Democratic Party.

<HEADLINE>  Floyd Ready To Get Bulls on Floor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- As Tim Floyd walked to center court, the  
basketballs stopped bouncing and his new players gathered around 
him, eager to hear what the Chicago Bulls' new coach had in store 
for his first day of practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Free day!  
</P>
<P>
	No, he wasn't trying to win over his players like a new teacher  
letting class out early. After six months in limbo, Floyd wanted to 
practice Thursday worse than possibly anyone in the NBA. But you 
need players to practice, and that's something the Bulls don't 
have. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm numb at this point, and just ready to get to the floor,''  
he said. ``There is a frustration level, but no more so than what 
our players are going through as well. There was a scowl or frown 
or two just from the standpoint that I think these guys were 
looking forward to getting to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA officially opened for business Thursday, and teams got  
the go-ahead to open training camps. But with only six players 
under contract by midafternoon, the Bulls had two options: run some 
really tame 3-on-3 drills or cancel practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't rightly hold a practice with four players,'' said  
veteran center Bill Wennington, who signed a one-year, $1 million 
deal earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't the way Floyd wanted to start his NBA rookie season.  
He spent six months in limbo as Chicago's director of basketball 
operations until Phil Jackson said again after the lockout ended 
that he wasn't coming back. Floyd was officially named the head 
coach last Friday, only to have training camps pushed back three 
days while lawyers haggled over the final details of the labor 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	When training camp finally opened, 14 players took the floor.  
About 45 minutes later, Floyd broke the bad news. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was wishful thinking,'' he said. ``Our guys were really  
anxious, the coaching staff was anxious and our practice plans were 
in place. We've had six months to work on the practice plan and it 
was ready to go, but unfortunately, no practice today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today will be different, though. Even if there still weren't  
enough players for the morning practice, Floyd said there was no 
way the Bulls were canceling tonight's practice-scrimmage at the 
United Center. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll even press assistant coach Bill Cartwright, a member of  
Chicago's first three championship teams, into service if he has 
to. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be ready to go,'' Floyd promised. ``If Cartwright has  
to go, we'll be ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The one good thing about canceling practice was it gave Floyd  
more time to meet his players. He'd been barred from any contact 
with players during the lockout, so he was meeting many for the 
first time Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	When he walked onto the floor for the first time, he said hello  
to Ron Harper, who gave his new coach a friendly slap on the 
shoulder as the two talked and laughed. Then he headed over to 
shake hands with Randy Brown, who playfully patted the coach on the 
stomach. 
</P>
<P>
	``He seems like a very nice guy so far,'' Harper said. ``When I  
walked in today, we talked. He had a very good friendly talk. He 
told me to go out and lead this team, show guys how our old team 
was. I told him I was happy to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd isn't the only one who needs introductions. Of last year's  
championship team, only four players -- Harper, Brown, Toni Kukoc 
and Keith Booth -- had contracts for this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely need some name tags,'' Harper said, laughing.  
``It will take me a week or two to find out who's on my team.''

	GENEVA (AP) -- The United States, China and the two Koreas made  
only moderate progress in talks that closed Friday on ending nearly 
five decades of Cold War on the Korean peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	The delegations said they would meet again in mid-April. But all  
four said the process of replacing the armistice that ended the 
1950-53 Korean War with a permanent peace would be extremely long. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement, they said that agreement had been reached  
on procedures for two working groups that are discussing how to 
reduce tensions and put in place a permanent peace. 
</P>
<P>
	That step was ``highly significant,'' said a senior U.S.  
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. But, he said, there 
was unlikely to be any ``measurable progress'' any time soon on 
replacing the armistice. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan, who chaired  
this session, was even more downbeat. ``I don't think I can find 
any visible progress out of the current talks,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said the talks would be ``empty'' unless North Korean  
demands are met concerning the withdrawal of 37,000 U.S. troops 
from South Korea and other issues. North Korea will continue to 
press its demands, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-party talks started in December 1997 and have been  
largely devoted to procedural wrangling. China and the United 
States are attending as major combatants in the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
	The first two rounds stalled over the North's insistence that  
the conference agree on an agenda -- including the issue of the 
troops -- before setting up the two committees convened this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Ideas for easing tension on the Korean peninsula, including a  
humanitarian corridor and a new communications channel, were raised 
but not agreed on this week, delegates said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have time to discuss these details,'' said Chinese  
delegation leader Qian Yong-nian, who said he was ``rather happy'' 
with the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said the issue of a North Korean diplomat, whom Pyongyang  
claims was kidnapped in Berlin last week by South Korean agents and 
then handed over to the United States, was a ``great obstacle'' to 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
	However, other delegations said the talks were not the right  
place to raise the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea says the diplomat and his wife defected and were  
seeking asylum in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-party talks will be followed Saturday by renewed  
negotiations between the United States and North Korea over U.S. 
demands for access to a suspected North Korean underground nuclear 
weapons site. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar talks last weekend failed to produce a breakthrough.  
</P>
<P>
	Washington has rejected North Korean demands for $300 million in  
compensation to inspect the Kumchangni site, uncovered last summer 
by satellite photos.

<HEADLINE> Gay Discharges in Air Force Climb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Air Force said today it discharged 414  
people last year for being gay, a one-third increase over the 
previous year and the highest yearly total since the Pentagon 
stopped requiring service members to disclose their sexual 
orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force officials said most of those discharged had  
voluntarily acknowledged they are gay and most were new recruits 
undergoing basic training at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	T'jae Gibson, a spokeswoman at Air Force headquarters in the  
Pentagon, said an Air Force review of the situation at Lackland 
last year found that most instructors and trainees there believed 
the acknowledgments of homosexuality were made to escape the Air 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
	In most instances in which trainees at Lackland told their  
instructors of their homosexuality they also asked to be 
discharged, Ms. Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 414 gay discharges last year, 271 were of trainees at  
Lackland, Ms. Gibson said. Others were cases in which an 
investigation was triggered by witness reports of alleged 
homosexual acts, and in one case two female members were discharged 
for announced plans of same-sex marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Figures on 1998 gay discharges in the Army, Navy and Marine  
Corps were not immediately available, although Defense Department 
spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the figures would be released. 
</P>
<P>
	A leading advocacy group for military members asserted today  
that the increase in discharges suggests Air Force commanders are 
openly hostile to gay service members. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon's policy on gays, adopted in 1994 and labeled  
``don't ask, don't tell,'' is not providing relief for gays serving 
in the military but instead ``has been used to target gays even 
more,'' said Dixon Osburn, co-executive director of the 
Servicemembers Legal Defense Network. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in gay discharges in the Air Force was disclosed in  
today's San Antonio Express-News. 
</P>
<P>
	The 414 discharges for homosexuality compare with 309 in 1997  
and 180 in 1994, the year the Pentagon changed its policy. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the newspaper's report, the Air Force released  
figures showing that of the 414 discharges in the fiscal year ended 
last September, 391 were cases in which service members made 
statements that the Air Force calls ``voluntary admissions'' of 
being homosexual, bisexual or engaged in homosexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gibson said Gen. Lloyd Newton, commander of Air Education  
and Training Command at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas, ordered a 
review of the situation at Lackland last year after learning that 
gay discharges were ``disproportionately high'' there. 
</P>
<P>
	Newton's review concluded that Lackland commanders were fully  
complying with the Defense Department's policy on gays, Ms. Gibson 
said.

<HEADLINE> Senators Pose Questions at Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After two weeks of merely observing, senators  
posed their first questions to lawyers in President Clinton's 
impeachment trial today and transformed the proceeding into a 
seesaw debate between prosecutors and presidential lawyers. Neither 
side yielded any ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Clinton wants all the benefits of a criminal trial  
without bearing any of its burden,'' Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., 
declared as he rejected White House claims that the impeachment 
articles were too broad and vague and would never survive the test 
of a criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear that President Clinton and his counsel know exactly  
what he is being charged with,'' Canady told the senators, who 
remained silent but submitted their questions to Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist to be read aloud. ``Impeachment is a political 
and not a criminal proceeding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House Counsel Charles Ruff used an early question to  
differentiate between impeachment of a federal judge and that of a 
president, arguing the threshold for the latter must be much 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you ask the same questions about the trauma the nation  
suffers when you are removing a judge as when you are removing a 
president?'' Ruff said. ``That answer must be stunningly different 
when you are asked should the president of the United States be 
removed and the will of the electorate overturned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the questioning began, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott  
suggested a closed-door meeting of all senators to discuss the 
future of the impeachment trial amid indications that Democrats 
were holding firm in their support of the president. Far from 
giving up, the lead Republican prosecutor suggested senators invite 
the president to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because the president is the only individual with knowledge of  
almost every material fact relevant to the trial, the House 
believes that this testimony could greatly help to expeditiously 
and fairly bring this matter to a close,'' Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., 
wrote in a letter today to the Senate leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House has said repeatedly that there are no plans for  
Clinton to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	The question-and-answer debate produced plenty of theater, as  
House prosecutors dismissed the White House arguments as ``legal 
schizophrenia'' and presidential lawyers accused the lawmakers of 
``straw-man'' building. Neither side broke new ground. 
</P>
<P>
	One House prosecutor, Rep. George Gekas, conceded today he  
doesn't believe any Democrats have been swayed by the evidence of 
perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``As of now, no,'' Gekas, R-Pa., said in an interview with The  
Associated Press. ``Now, that may change and could change by way of 
the series of questions that need to be asked. And also on the 
question of witnesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One Republican senator suggested she wasn't convinced by the  
perjury evidence against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's grand jury testimony is replete with lies,  
with half-truths and evasions. I'm considering whether despite that 
they meet the test under our perjury laws,'' said Susan Collins of 
Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican senators used the early portion of the question  
period -- set to last two days -- to ask broad questions that gave 
House prosecutors a chance to answer the intense attacks on their 
evidence that White House lawyers made during a three-day opening 
argument that ended Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic senators followed up, using their turn three straight  
times at the start to ask Clinton's lawyer: ``Could you please 
comment on any of the legal and factual assertions'' made by the 
prosecutors in their last statement. The repetition made Rehnquist 
smile at one point. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff dismissed suggestions that the White House believed no  
private conduct by a president could ever rise to the level of an 
impeachable offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``The managers have, in their straw-man building role, tried to  
suggest that our position somehow is so distant from constitutional 
reality ... that we could not conceive of a situation in which 
private conduct, no matter how egregious, would lead to removal. 
And of course that is not the case,'' the president's counsel said. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutor James Rogan assailed the White House defense  
against the charge that Clinton committed perjury. ``If anybody 
wants a lesson in legal schizophrenia, please read the president's 
trial brief,'' the lawmaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark.., accused the White House of leaving  
out a key fact in its arguments that Clinton was not trying to 
tamper with a witness when he summoned Oval Office secretary Betty 
Currie to his office last year and went over his recollections of 
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers said Clinton wasn't trying to influence Mrs.  
Currie, and was simply refreshing his recollection in anticipation 
of media interest in the story. 
</P>
<P>
	``They never discussed the fact that just two days later, the  
same series of questions or statements or coaching were addressed'' 
by the president to Mrs. Currie, Hutchinson argued. ``The only 
possible explanation for that is that the president was trying to 
make a very clear statement to her, 'This is what I remember and 
this is what I want you to do.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff acknowledged the omission. ``I owe him indeed an  
explanation,'' he conceded. Ruff then went on to say that although 
White House lawyers hadn't mentioned the second encounter in their 
presentation it wouldn't have mattered because Mrs. Currie still 
wasn't a witness in any proceeding when it occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with a five-minute limit on answers imposed by Rehnquist,  
Rep. Ed Bryant at times rushed his words to state as much 
information as possible -- and in fact took nine minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats remain united in their support of Clinton. Sen. Bob  
Kerrey, D-Neb., told reporters there were ``close to 45 votes to 
dismiss'' the trial, the total number of Democrats in the Senate. 
That's shy of the majority that would be needed, but would be a 
clear indication that Clinton would win acquittal at his trial, 
where a two-thirds vote is needed to convict.

<HEADLINE> New Knick Sprewell Apologizes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RYE, N.Y. (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell said he was sorry Friday,  
declared himself a changed man and asked to be given another 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he went back and did it a second time.  
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, the newest member of the New York Knicks, was  
reinstated by the NBA after a 15- to 20-minute meeting with 
commissioner David Stern. He apologized for his attack on Golden 
State coach P.J. Carlesimo that earned him one of the longest 
suspensions in league history, and promised to control his anger in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Next up was an appeal to the public, and Sprewell was contrite.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry. We all make mistakes. I made one, I said I'm sorry  
about that and I'm asking for a second chance,'' Sprewell said. 
``I'm not the person I've been portrayed to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, acquired Thursday in exchange for John Starks, Chris  
Mills and Terry Cummings, repeated the words ``sorry,'' 
``apologize,'' ``mistake'' and ``second chance'' over and over. 
</P>
<P>
	He also repeatedly referred back to the attack on Carlesimo by  
saying, ``I had a bad day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell did not come off as the surly, thuggish bad boy the  
public perceives him to be. He spoke in a relaxed manner, was quick 
with a smile and seemed genuinely anxious to finally get back to 
playing basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm out to start all over and show people the real me,''  
Sprewell said. ``P.J. is not a bad guy, and I'm here to show you 
guys that I'm not either. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened in December of '97 will never happen again with  
me, and hopefully not with any other players ever again. I'm 
looking for a fresh new start, and I'm going to be a positive 
person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proof, of course, won't come until Sprewell gets back to  
playing and makes it through his first confrontations with a coach 
who might set him off by saying something an innocuous as ``put a 
little more mustard on those passes,'' as Carlesimo did. 
</P>
<P>
	Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy didn't seem to be the least bit  
worried, again saying he only wants to coach Sprewell, not judge 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Still uncertain is the reception he'll receive from a skeptical  
public. 
</P>
<P>
	New York fans have traditionally been eager to give sports  
figures a second chance, from Billy Martin and Darryl Strawberry in 
baseball to Lawrence Taylor in football and Marv Albert in 
broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
	Few Knicks fans probably remember Sprewell scoring a then  
career-high 41 points against the Knicks at Madison Square Garden 
on Feb. 10, 1994, and many of them only know him for his attack on 
his coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the past 14 months I've talked to my mom and have had  
conversations with numerous people who gave me advice on how to 
handle situations when I'm frustrated, and I think that was my 
biggest problem,'' Sprewell said. ``The lesson is that you make 
mistakes, but you also have to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell was suspended for 68 games last season and had his  
contract terminated and then reinstated by an arbitrator after he 
choked and threatened to kill Carlesimo at practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell's history also includes a reckless driving accident,  
lawsuits against his former agent and the NBA and a fight with 
former teammate Jerome Kersey. 
</P>
<P>
	If Sprewell can lead New York to its first title since 1973, the  
fans will come to accept him. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team already has a good nucleus, hopefully I'll be the  
extra added piece that you all have been looking for,'' he said. 
``Defensively, that's going to be my main role -- to be a stopper. 
Obviously I have scoring potential, the ability to score points, 
and I want to do that as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Union director Billy Hunter, deputy commissioner Russ Granik and  
two other officials attended Sprewell's meeting with Stern. It was 
the first time they were all together since nearly a year ago, when 
Sprewell was fighting the severity of his punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Latrell has given us assurances that he will be able to  
control his anger both on and off the court in the future,'' Stern 
said. ``Billy and I were both satisfied that he seems sincere in 
that commitment.''	   Sprewell can begin practicing with the Knicks on Saturday, and 
will play his first exhibition game next Wednesday against New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	New York made two more moves Friday. They signed Mavericks free  
agent power forward Kurt Thomas to a two-year contract by using the 
$1.75 million exception. And the Knicks re-signed 40-year-old 
center Herb Williams.

<HEADLINE> Stewart Back in IRL As Team Owner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- Tony Stewart was the driver and  
Larry Curry the team manager when Team Menard won the Indy Racing 
League championship in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the two have become co-owners of their own team, along with  
Indianapolis businessman Andy Card. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, this started as a dream,'' said Curry, who left  
John Menard's team at the end of last season. ``That dream became a 
reality about 4 p.m. (last) Friday when Teco (Energy) said it was 
coming in as our sponsor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the deal is only for the season-opening Indy 200 at Walt  
Disney World Speedway, but Curry is hopeful it will turn into a 
full-season deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Gualter Salles, a regular in the rival CART series the past two  
years, is in the cockpit of the team's Dallara-Aurora, the car Sam 
Schmidt drove to second place last October in the season-finale in 
Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who has moved to NASCAR's Winston Cup stock car series  
full time this year, also is on hand to coach the Brazilian driver 
in practice and to act as his spotter in the race on the one-mile 
oval. 
</P>
<P>
	``Larry's done 98 percent of the work and I've done 2 percent,''  
Stewart said. ``Last summer Larry brought up the concept, and it 
became reality last week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curry is excited about the deal with Stewart, who could be in a  
second team car for the Indianapolis 500 on May 30 if the 
sponsorship deal works out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the exciting thing is that Tony and I have had a very  
strong relationship on and off the track,'' Curry said. ``Tony was 
such a great driver in the IRL -- and hopefully will be again. 
</P>
<P>
	``He felt the IRL launched his career. This is his way of  
saying, 'Hey guys, I may be driving in Winston Cup, but this is my 
way of giving something back.''' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	NOT YET: IRL officials like to play it safe when it comes to  
driver safety. That's why rookies Jaques Lazier, the younger 
brother of 1996 Indianapolis 500 winner Buddy Lazier, and Greg 
Gorden will sit out this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazier passed his rookie test Wednesday but was told by the IRL  
he would have to wait until the race in Phoenix on March 28 to make 
his series debut. The same for Gorden, who passed his rookie test 
in October at Pikes Peak International Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
	``They understand that safety takes priority,'' said Brian  
Barnhart, director of racing operations for the IRL. ``Jaques did a 
fine job passing his rookie test, completing all four phases within 
a half-day of running. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since safety is the primary concern, we have a rule that no  
driver can compete in an event within seven days after completing 
their rookie test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to hold Gorden back was not as easy. But had  
virtually no seat time after passing his test. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are really happy with Greg,'' said Joe Truscelli, owner of  
the team for whom Gorden will drive. ``It was unfair to him that we 
weren't able to give him more seat time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Truscelli concurred with the IRL decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``We will test at Phoenix three times, so the entire team will  
be ready for the next race. I appreciate Greg's attitude. He is 
here helping us all weekend, and that says a lot for his 
character.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Truscelli team has put Brian Tyler into the car for the race  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazier will run for ISM, which already fields cars full-time for  
Jeff Ward. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	SHHH!: A lot of race fans have complained that the cars fielded  
by the IRL sound more like stock cars than Indy cars. That could 
change next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Leo Mehl, the IRL's executive director, said Friday that new  
engine specifications, coming in 2000, should fix the problem. That 
includes reducing the engine capacity from its current 4 liters to 
3.5, thereby reducing horsepower. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the engine noise has been a negative factor, so we're  
pretty excited about changing the sound of our engine,'' Mehl said. 
``The important thing about the change in the engine regulations is 
that we didn't obsolete all the engines we have.''

<HEADLINE> Dan Quayle May Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After sitting out the 1996 presidential  
campaign, former Vice President Dan Quayle is taking the first step 
toward seeking the top spot on the Republican ticket in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've thought about this for a long time. I've wanted to be  
president for a long time, and the year 2000 is looking like my 
opportunity,'' Quayle said Thursday night on CNN's ``Larry King 
Live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He intends to file a formal statement of candidacy next week,  
the first step in his bid for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	The race for the GOP nomination is drawing a number of  
contenders besides Quayle, vice president under George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	The early front-runner seems to be George W. Bush, the Texas  
governor who is son of the former president. Other possible 
candidates are millionaire businessman Steve Forbes, former Cabinet 
secretary Elizabeth Dole, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and 
activist Gary Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Polls are quite frankly irrelevant. You don't make decisions  
on whether you are running for president on a poll, on your poll or 
someone else's poll. You consult yourself; you talk with your 
family; and if you are convinced that you are the best person to 
lead the country, then you make a go of it; and that's what I have 
done,'' Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle said he believe it will take $20 million to run a  
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am convinced I can raise it. I know I can raise it,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Senators Loosen Up With Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- What happened to all those open minds? When  
senators began their questioning in President Clinton's impeachment 
trial, their brand of blind justice seemed to be taking a peek. 
</P>
<P>
	They coaxed and needled and got their licks in, after more than  
a week of sitting mute. But fact-finding was not at the core of the 
written questions put Friday to the president's accusers and 
defenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Isn't the White House argument ... a red herring?'' Republican  
senators prodded the House Republicans prosecuting the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Why, yes, they were told.  
</P>
<P>
	Democrats lobbed softballs, too, to the White House team. How  
about that ``overly broad'' point by the other side? they asked. 
Can that ``unbending argument'' by Republicans possibly be 
reconciled with the facts? 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Chief Justice, senators, I could probably simply say, no,  
given the articulate framing of that question,'' a pleased White 
House counsel, Charles Ruff, answered. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the fence went that ball.  
</P>
<P>
	Harnessed by strict rules of conduct since the trial began,  
senators finally got to loosen up a bit. They scribbled questions 
in pen on tan-colored cards, or submitted typed queries that had 
been prepared beforehand, and sent them up to be read by Chief 
Justice William Rehnquist. 
</P>
<P>
	The tone of the questions underscored the point made early in  
the trial by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and upheld by Rehnquist, that 
senators should not be called jurors in this trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Some questions were so transparently leading that senators on  
both sides chuckled when they were read. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's counsel stated the president did not commit  
perjury. Please respond.'' So Republican Sen. Don Nickles of 
Oklahoma asked of the House impeachment managers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank the senator for the question,'' Rep. James Rogan of  
California said, wondering aloud how much of the perjury case he 
could stuff into his allotted five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost without exception, Democrats put their questions to the  
White House team and Republicans, to the House members. But seven 
Republicans departed from that pattern in a question to the 
president's lawyers that mentioned Dick Morris, a Clinton 
consultant once disgraced for a liaison with a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House team hesitated, as if his very name were a hot  
potato, until Ruff agreed to be the one to answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't find any volunteers,'' Ruff cracked, to hearty  
laughter from both sides. He suggested the motive behind the 
question was mischief, not fact-finding, noting ``use of that name 
conjures up all sorts of images. And that's why, I'm sure, it finds 
its way into the process from the managers' side.''

<HEADLINE> Webber Comes to Kings' Camp Late </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Chris Webber showed up at the  
Sacramento Kings' training camp Friday, a day late, as he worked 
out for the first time with a team his agent had hinted he'd spurn. 
</P>
<P>
	Webber, traded from the Washington Wizards in mid-May for Mitch  
Richmond and Otis Thorpe, skipped the Kings' first workout Thursday 
night. But, after a phone conversation with his father, he got his 
team physical Friday and practiced with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Webber, whose past 12 months have included marijuana offenses,  
traffic violations and accusations of sexual misconduct, was vague 
when asked why he missed the opening practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Where was he Thursday night?  
</P>
<P>
	``My own personal private space,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Why didn't he show up?  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be in a position where I can give my all here, and I  
wasn't in that position yesterday,'' he responded. 
</P>
<P>
	When Webber was traded May 14, his agent, Fallasha Irwin, hinted  
the power forward might protest the trade by refusing to play for 
the Kings. On Friday, Webber hardly sounded like he was happy to be 
in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to stay here?'' he was asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to win,'' he said, not having to mention that the Kings  
have had an NBA-record 15 consecutive losing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Rick Adelman did not know if Webber, who has averaged 20  
points per game in his five-year NBA career, will be fined for 
missing Thursday's workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just happy that he's here,'' Adelman said. ``I don't care  
what happened yesterday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest concern for Adelman was filling out his roster and  
getting first-round draft pick Jason Williams, the seventh overall 
selection, on the court. There were a few snags in Williams' rookie 
contract, preventing him from practicing Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	While his soon-to-be teammates worked out, the point guard sat  
forlornly on a chair -- dribbling a basketball between his legs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to stay in shape if I can't play,'' a frustrated  
Williams said. ``But I'm learning by paying attention.''

<HEADLINE> Boeing Settles Discrimination Suits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Rhonda Capps says she had seen so little  
advancement of fellow blacks during 13 years of work at The Boeing 
Co. that she recently felt ready to quit. 
</P>
<P>
	But a settlement forged between the aerospace giant and black  
workers who sued the company for various discriminatory practices 
has given her hope. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other day I changed my mind,'' said Capps, an electrical  
engineer and one of the suit's plaintiffs. ``I want to see this 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing agreed Friday to pay $15 million to settle allegations it  
discriminated against blacks in hiring, promotions and workplace 
treatment. The company admitted no wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed settlement, which will go mostly to 20,000 past and  
present black employees, was announced by Boeing chairman Phil 
Condit, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and lawyers for the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	About $3.7 million will be used for equal-opportunity and  
diversity training at Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would settle two class-action lawsuits filed last year.  
It is subject to approval by a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``This settlement ensures further expansion of our efforts to  
improve our promotion processes, enhance training opportunities and 
ensure employees have avenues available to address their 
concerns,'' Condit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement is ``a significant step on the long journey to  
making Boeing the best it can be,'' said Jackson, who helped broker 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits were filed on behalf of employees in the Seattle  
and Philadelphia areas who alleged they were treated with hostility 
and passed over for promotions that went to less-qualified white 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing is the world's biggest maker of passenger jets.

<HEADLINE> 8 Die When Tornadoes Hit South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Ravaged by tornadoes that claimed eight  
lives and destroyed hundreds of homes in five states, Southerners -- 
and one very prominent former resident -- struggled to express their 
shock. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that the Governor's Mansion, where Hillary and I  
raised Chelsea for 12 years, was actually in the path of the storm 
made it all the more real to me,'' President Clinton said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Little Rock storm knocked over trees at the Governor's  
Mansion and blew down a treehouse where Chelsea Clinton once 
played. Clinton plans to visit Arkansas on Sunday for a first-hand 
look at the damage. 
</P>
<P>
	James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management  
Administration, planned visits to Arkansas and Tennessee today. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Little Rock's oldest areas, the 100-year-old Quapaw  
Quarter, was sliced in half by a twister that killed three people 
Thursday night. Four other people were killed in White County, 
north of Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	After pounding Arkansas, the storm moved into Tennessee, killing  
a woman west of Nashville when she went outside to get her dogs. 
The state was still trying to recover from storms that killed nine 
people on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A tornado also slammed into the historic district of  
Clarksville, Tenn., early Friday, leaving gaping holes in buildings 
like the 121-year-old courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	It cut off power to 25,000, ripped apart a five-block area, tore  
through the center of Austin Peay State University and skipped into 
a residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, downtown residents and business owners will get their  
first look at the destruction, accompanied by police or state 
troopers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are walls here with no support. The first gust of wind  
could blow them down,'' said Clarksville Fire Chief Eugene Keel. 
</P>
<P>
	Classes were canceled and won't resume until all buildings are  
checked for soundness, said Austin Peay President Sal Rivella. The 
school was making lodging arrangements for the 300 or so students 
with no friends or relatives to put them up. 
</P>
<P>
	In downtown Clarksville, the Madison Street United Methodist  
Church, which underwent a $1.3 million renovation last year, was 
heavily damaged. ``It's like a death has happened,'' the Rev. Doug 
Norfleet said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two blocks away, 124-year-old Trinity Episcopal Church lost its  
steeple and sanctuary, but the large, round stained-glass window in 
front remained whole. 
</P>
<P>
	Kari Carson sat cross-legged on the wet sidewalk, staring up at  
her second-floor apartment in a building that was heavily damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	``My whole life was here and it's gone. It's all gone,'' she  
said. ``I know it could have been a lot worse, but this is just so 
depressing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Power was knocked out to more than 100,000 homes in Arkansas and  
Tennessee, and Gov. Mike Huckabee declared emergencies in 16 
Arkansas counties and asked Clinton for federal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	In Alexandria, La., an apparent tornado ripped apart businesses  
and downed electrical lines, cutting power to hundreds of 
residents. Mobile homes, trees and power lines also were damaged in 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	In Alabama, severe storms cut through the state, damaging  
houses, downing power lines and blowing the roof off a church. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Red Cross set up shelters in the storm-ravaged  
areas and provided hot meals. The Arkansas Office of Emergency 
Services estimated 920 homes were damaged in the state, including 
308 in Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Red Cross, the nation has had 101 tornadoes  
this month, which normally is the quietest for tornadoes. The 
previous mark for a January was 52 in 1975. Arkansas alone had 38 
tornadoes Thursday.

<HEADLINE>  Chiefs Hire Cunningham As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Gunther Cunningham, the defensive  
coordinator behind Kansas City's usually tough defense, was 
promoted to head coach today. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham replaces Marty Schottenheimer, who won 101 games in  
10 years with the Chiefs but resigned unexpectedly on Jan. 11 
following a troubled 7-9 campaign, his first losing season in 15 
years as a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gunther has an unbelievable worth ethic,'' Chiefs  
president-general manager Carl Peterson said at a news conference. 
``Gunther is a player's coach, they listen to him and they respect 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will get in their face when they need it, he will get them  
to respond ... he does it for one reason, he wants them to be the 
best they can be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham thanked Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt and then said, ``the  
last 24 hours have probably been the most interesting 24 hours I've 
spent in my life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this last season the Chiefs lost their way a little.  
It's like walking in a forest, and the Chiefs took the wrong 
path.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham has been an NFL assistant for 17 seasons, the past  
four with the Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City's defense had been a strength during Cunningham's  
tenure until this year's 7-9 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called Marty this morning,'' Peterson said. ``Marty was  
ecstatic with this decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham said he naturally would concentrate on the defense,  
but knew that the Chiefs would be able to move the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have spent these many years concentrating on how to stop  
them,'' Cunningham said. ``But there is no doubt in my mind that I 
know how to move the football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham began his coaching career at Oregon, his alma mater,  
in 1969 and became a pro coach with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the 
Canadian Football League in 1981. He was an assistant with the 
Colts, San Diego Chargers and Los Angeles Raiders before joining 
Schottenheimer's staff in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham also had interviewed for the Chicago Bears' job.  
</P>
<P>
	Under Cunningham, the Chiefs' defense led the NFL in fewest  
points allowed in 1995 and 1997 but slipped last season amid an 
epidemic of injuries and poor play that doomed the Chiefs to their 
first losing season since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham is one of the most popular assistant coaches in the  
10-year Schottenheimer/Peterson era. He can be gruff; when he 
becomes impatient, his voice can be heard from one end of the 
practice field to another. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Germany, Cunningham came to the United States as a  
youngster after his mother married an American serviceman. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham will be taking over a troubled team that set an NFL  
record for penalties and penalty yardage and was also plagued with 
obvious disciplinary problems. The low point in a year when many 
expected the Chiefs to challenge for the AFC championship came on 
Nov. 16 and got star linebacker/defensive end Derrick Thomas 
suspended for one game. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 30-7 Monday night loss to Denver, the Chiefs had an  
emotional and mental meltdown and committed five personal fouls on 
the Broncos' final TD drive. The next day, linebacker Wayne Simmons 
was waived and Thomas, a nine-time Pro Bowl selection, was 
suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt called the entire episode ``a disgrace'' and Schottenheimer  
said he had never been so embarrassed in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	That game, however, seemed to personify the entire season for a  
character-deficient team that started out 4-1 but then lost eight 
of its last 11, including a six-game losing streak.

<HEADLINE> Islanders Win After Milbury Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mike Milbury knows the look of a team that has  
quit. He's seen it repeatedly in a quarter-century as a player, 
coach and general manager in hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, he had never seen it in his own team.  
</P>
<P>
	That's what made Milbury's decision to resign as the New York  
Islanders' coach for the second time in two years so easy Thursday: 
The quitters he always despised suddenly were wearing his team's 
uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the team quits on the coach, it's tough to get them  
back,'' Milbury said hours before new coach Bill Stewart directed a 
5-2 victory in Pittsburgh, ending the Islanders' 11-game winless 
streak (0-10-1). 
</P>
<P>
	Milbury, who first stepped down as the Islanders' coach last  
Jan. 24, will remain as general manager. He hadn't really wanted to 
return as coach, but was coaxed back last March, not long after the 
Islanders lost 10 in a row under former coach Rick Bowness. 
</P>
<P>
	Milbury, 46, signed a five-year coaching contract at $750,000  
per year in May, only to keep the job about 10 months before 
turning it over to Stewart, an assistant coach and former NHL 
defenseman. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't get into a streak like we were, it happened to Rick  
last year,'' said Milbury, who decided to quit following a lifeless 
5-2 loss Wednesday to Florida. ``The message our players sent was a 
strong one and not a good one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Islanders (14-29-3) sent a different one Thursday, playing  
with considerably more passion and aggression under Stewart, the 
1997-98 AHL coach of the year with Calder Cup finalist St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Milbury, Stewart is demanding and pragmatic, but puts more  
of an emphasis on defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he felt he was a lousy assistant coach, that he  
couldn't open up the way he wanted to,'' Milbury said. ``He's 
aggressive and straight forward and no-nonsense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Islanders (14-29-3) had won only three times since Nov. 26  
until Claude Lapointe's two goals led them to their first victory 
in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good feeling, but we've got a long way to go,'' Stewart  
said of the Islanders, who have fewer points than any NHL team 
except Tampa Bay. ``We'll use this as a yardstick for character in 
room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he made many changes, Stewart said, ``I didn't have any  
time. It was basically the same thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart wasn't oblivious to the unhappiness that was evident on  
the team, or the grumbling that followed the trading of Bryan 
Berard and the long holdout of star Zigmund Palffy, and will give 
every player a fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that there's a new coach, what happened in the past has  
happened, and we look to the future because that's the only thing 
we can take care of,'' Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	There's certainly not much to look back on recently with a team  
that hasn't made the playoffs since 1994. Now, Stewart becomes the 
fourth coach in three years -- counting Milbury's two stints -- to 
try to change it. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he was hired as associate coach, I thought he could be a  
coach who could handle the team in my absence,'' Milbury said. ``I 
always felt Bill would be the guy. ... He's a fairly 
defensive-minded guy, a batten-down-the-hatches guy and maybe now 
we can win some games by scoring three goals but giving up only 
two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milbury spent 20 years in the Boston Bruins organization as a  
player, coach and front office executive before becoming the 
Islanders' coach on July 5, 1995, a year after New York's last 
appearance in the playoffs. He took over as general manager from 
Don Maloney on Dec. 12, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 56-111-24 as Islanders coach and 90-49-21 with Boston,  
reaching the Stanley Cup finals in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Trial Procedures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Impeachment trial procedures in place once the question period  
ends on Saturday. There is no calendar schedule for the remainder 
of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, there will be a two hour public debate (an hour for  
the House, an hour for the White House) on a motion to dismiss the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators then will go into closed session to debate that  
resolution with each senator allowed up to 10 minutes to speak. The 
closed session is likely to begin with a motion to open it to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	Before voting on the motion to dismiss, the trial would proceed  
to public debate on witness lists the House and White House are 
expected to propose. Each side would have three hours to say why it 
wants to call particular witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate would deliberate in private on the witness lists,  
unless the move for open deliberations was approved. 
</P>
<P>
	When the deliberations are finished, there would be public  
votes, first on the motion to dismiss and then on the witness 
lists. Any witness approved would have to appear for questioning 
under oath by staff. Not yet determined is whether senators would 
be present for the depositions. 
</P>
<P>
	Based largely on the deposition testimony, the Senate would  
decide which of the witnesses, if any, should testify in the Senate 
chamber.

<HEADLINE> Russia Readies for Year 2000 Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov set up a  
government commission Friday to find solutions to the Year 2000 
computer glitch -- an effort some fear could be too little, too 
late. 
</P>
<P>
	While concentrating on the worst economic crisis since the  
Soviet collapse, Russian leaders have largely ignored the so-called 
millennium bug. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem may cause older computers that only recognize the  
last two digits of a year to go haywire on Jan. 1, 2000, when they 
will assume it is 1900. Some computers can be reprogrammed, but 
many devices have embedded microchips that must be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts warn that many of Russia's critical computer  
systems, including those that control nuclear weapons and power 
plants, could be destabilized. But the government has dragged its 
feet on funding efforts to fix the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov finally ordered the creation of a government panel  
Friday that will consist of representatives of the ministries of 
defense, nuclear power, finance and fuel and energy to ``avert 
negative impacts of the computer glitch,'' the ITAR-Tass news 
agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement did not say how much money the government would  
allocate to cope with the problem. Estimates on how much it will 
cost to fix the problem range from $500,000 for military computers 
to more than $1 billion nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts say, however, that because Russia has fewer  
computers and a lower level of technology than many Western 
countries, it won't be as badly affected by the bug.

<HEADLINE> Allen Hires Cochran for Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. FRANCIS, Wis. (AP) -- Ray Allen, who could be in line for a  
seven-year, $84 million payday, has hired famed criminal attorney 
Johnnie Cochran on an hourly basis to examine contract offers from 
the Milwaukee Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, a third-year guard who becomes eligible for free agency  
at the end of the season, plans to negotiate directly with Bucks 
owner, U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, who wants to avoid paying a sports agent's commission of  
between 4 percent and 10 percent, has not approached the team about 
extending his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess the impeachment proceedings are tying the senator up  
right now,'' Allen said. ``There's no urgency on my part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cochran has become a sports agent, but won't represent Allen as  
one. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen became acquainted with Cochran through Allen's  
Connecticut-based business manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are from the same fraternity, and you know how  
fraternities are,'' Allen said.

<HEADLINE> GM Truck Owners Get $1,000 Vouchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- About 6 million owners of General Motors  
trucks with fuel tanks on the side will get $1,000 vouchers to use 
in buying new GM vehicles, under a court ruling that could wrap up 
a 7-year dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	A leading consumer advocacy group, which had opposed earlier  
settlements in other state courts, said it would not challenge the 
Louisiana decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The vouchers will go to the 5.8 million people who owned the  
trucks as of July 1, 1996, when the national class-action 
settlement was first approved, said Michael Crow, attorney for the 
truck owners. 
</P>
<P>
	The vouchers are good toward the purchase of any GM vehicle  
except Saturns. They go to owners of General Motors C- or K-series 
trucks built from 1973-87 or a R- or V- series truck built from 
1987-91. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics had claimed side-mounted gas tanks on the trucks were  
fire hazards in side-impact crashes. Most trucks' tanks are mounted 
in the middle of the frame to protect them. The settlement also 
drew criticism for the more than $24 million in payments to 
attorneys when truck owners were not getting cash but vouchers that 
had to be used to buy a new GM vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Crow said there was a reason plaintiffs couldn't get more: GM  
proved that the trucks held their resale value. ``We as plaintiffs 
could not prove that the value of the vehicles had been diminished 
at all as a result of the location of the tanks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A settlement, signed Wednesday and filed Thursday by Iberville  
Parish Judge Jack Marionneaux, in the southeast Louisiana community 
of Plaquemine is the same one sent back to him last year by a state 
appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the First Circuit Court of Appeal had complained  
that Marionneaux failed to consider federal rules aimed at 
protecting the rights of the truck owners and had erred in 
approving the case as a class-action suit addressing the rights of 
truck owners nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Marionneaux's 15-page opinion explains why it should be a class  
action, reaffirms the earlier settlement and adds at least $500,000 
to a fund being set up under the settlement to study ways to make 
the tanks safer. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the original settlement, the plaintiffs' attorneys, who  
are getting $24 million in fees and up to $2.1 million more in 
expenses, agreed to put $1 million into the fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund will now also get money when vouchers are sold by  
people who don't want to use them in buying new GM cars and trucks. 
The attorneys agreed to buy at least 100,000 of the vouchers for 
$100 each if nobody else wants to buy or broker them, and to put $5 
for each -- $500,000 -- into the fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The provision for buying back vouchers was the key to getting  
people who objected to the original settlement to go along with it, 
attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Washington-based  
nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, said the consumer advocacy group 
had objected to an earlier settlement reached in Texas and 
Pittsburgh courts, because they did nothing to make the trucks 
safer. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the government having dropped the ball and GM not willing  
to pay one cent for C-K safety, this settlement offers the last 
best chance for people who keep the pickups to get a safer gas tank 
in them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Any class action is always a compromise, he said, and he'd like  
to see this one move ahead as fast as possible, getting the 
certificates to people who have waited three years for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it a good settlement from the safety viewpoint? No, because  
it doesn't do anything immediate for the pickup safety. But it 
offers a better deal than what the government got,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Department of Transportation dropped an investigation  
of whether to recall the trucks, GM agreed to put $51 million into 
public education, child seat safety and research. 
</P>
<P>
	``But not one penny of that money went to help C-Kers,'' Ditlow  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM released a three-sentence statement saying that it was  
pleased that Marionneaux had approved the settlement but 
``disappointed that excessive attorney fees were awarded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM had appealed that award before, it said. Company spokesman  
Terry Rhadigan said he did not know where that appeal stands.

<HEADLINE> Senators Lob `Softball' Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- They coaxed, they coached, they did not  
interrogate. The senators who asked questions in President 
Clinton's impeachment trial Friday could in no way be confused with 
jurors seeking a closer look at fingerprints found at the scene of 
a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Isn't the White House argument ... a red herring?'' Republican  
senators prodded the House Republicans prosecuting the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Why, yes, they were told.  
</P>
<P>
	Democrats lobbed softballs, too, to the White House team. How  
about that ``overly broad'' point by the other side? they asked. 
Can that ``unbending argument'' by Republicans possibly be 
reconciled with the facts? 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Chief Justice, senators, I could probably simply say, no,  
given the articulate framing of that question,'' a pleased White 
House counsel, Charles Ruff, answered. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the fence went that ball.  
</P>
<P>
	Harnessed by strict rules of conduct since the trial began,  
senators finally got to loosen up a bit. They scribbled questions 
in pen on tan-colored cards, or submitted typed queries that had 
been prepared beforehand, and sent them up to be read by Chief 
Justice William Rehnquist. 
</P>
<P>
	After having delivered a series of polished monologues, the  
president's accusers and defenders had to do some thinking on their 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	But the tone of the questions underscored the point made early  
in the trial by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and upheld by Rehnquist, 
that senators should not be called jurors in this trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Some questions were so transparently leading that senators on  
both sides chuckled when they were read. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's counsel stated the president did not commit  
perjury. Please respond.'' So Republican Sen. Don Nickles of 
Oklahoma asked of the House impeachment managers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank the senator for the question,'' Rep. James Rogan of  
California said, wondering aloud how much of the perjury case he 
could stuff into his allotted five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost without exception, Democrats put their questions to the  
White House team and Republicans, to the House members. But seven 
Republicans departed from that pattern in a question to the 
president's lawyers that mentioned Dick Morris, a Clinton 
consultant once disgraced for a liaison with a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House team hesitated, as if his very name were a hot  
potato, until Ruff agreed to be the one to answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't find any volunteers,'' Ruff cracked, to hearty  
laughter from both sides. He suggested the motive behind the 
question was mischief, not fact-finding, noting ``use of that name 
conjures up all sorts of images. And that's why, I'm sure, it finds 
its way into the process from the managers' side.''

<HEADLINE>  Raul Salinas Found Guilty of Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOLUCA, Mexico (AP) -- The brother of an ex-president has been  
convicted of masterminding a rival's murder and sentenced to 50 
years in prison in the highest-profile murder case in modern 
Mexican history. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge sentenced Raul Salinas de Gortari on Thursday following  
a blockbuster criminal trial that lasted four years. The trial 
broke Mexico's long-standing taboo against prosecuting the 
relatives of powerful politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after his brother's arrest, former President Carlos  
Salinas de Gortari left the country and now lives in self-imposed 
exile in Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	``It couldn't have been any worse,'' Juan Velazquez, an attorney  
for the Salinas family, said of the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Raul Salinas' lawyers filed an immediate appeal and said corrupt  
prosecutors framed their client, who was convicted and sentenced to 
the maximum penalty for the 1994 murder of Jose Francisco Ruiz 
Massieu. 
</P>
<P>
	``Raul Salinas de Gortari and his defenders will fight  
wholeheartedly and tirelessly to recuperate the freedom that today 
was denied,'' lawyer Mariano Albor said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal challenges Judge Ricardo Ojeda Bohorquez's ruling  
that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence linking Raul 
Salinas to the crime, although there was no confession or direct 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news release, the Attorney General's Office said it would  
make ``a maximum effort'' to ensure that the sentence is upheld on 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Raul Salinas worked as head of Conasupo, a government agency in  
charge of distributing affordable food to poor people. He became 
wealthy and was widely known for his lavish lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	But his high life came to an end when he was arrested on Feb.  
28, 1995 in connection with the death of Ruiz Massieu, a leader in 
the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party and a former Salinas 
brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, prosecutors suggested that Ruiz Massieu had  
become a threat to the Salinas family's political power. They also 
said there was bad blood stemming from Ruiz Massieu's divorce from 
the Salinas' sister. 
</P>
<P>
	The case has dragged on, and the evidence presented filled 42  
bound books. 
</P>
<P>
	Raul Salinas maintained his innocence throughout the trial,  
saying the charges were the result of a vendetta against him and 
his brother. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation of Ruiz Massieu's killing had been mired in  
problems. The first prosecutor in the case -- the victim's own 
brother -- fled the country shortly before he was accused of 
covering up Raul Salinas' involvement in the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	Raul Salinas' attorneys have accused the Attorney General's  
Office of paying witnesses -- one as much as $500,000 -- to implicate 
Raul Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, a former prosecutor announced that remains had  
been found on Raul Salinas' property of a missing politician whom 
Raul Salinas had allegedly paid to kill Ruiz Massieu. 
</P>
<P>
	The body turned out to be that of a relative of a clairvoyant  
who had been paid by prosecutors to help locate the politician. 
</P>
<P>
	Since his arrest, Raul Salinas has been held in the  
maximum-security Almoloya de Juarez prison near Toluca, 35 miles 
west of Mexico City, where prisoners are under 24-hour surveillance 
and lights never go off in their cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Raul Salinas was informed of his sentence Thursday night by his  
wife, Paulina Castanon, and his sister Adriana, who visited him in 
prison, the government news agency Notimex reported. 
</P>
<P>
	His sister said she ``hoped to God'' the appeal would ``be a  
speedy one, since Raul is innocent of the crimes he is blamed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal could take months.  
</P>
<P>
	Journalists weren't allowed into courtroom to hear the verdict.  
An impromptu briefing was held in a courtroom garage, where a court 
clerk read the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Raul Salinas was also convicted Thursday of unrelated counts of  
using false documents and making false statements to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	He is also being tried separately on charges of illegal  
enrichment, a count that covers alleged bribes, aiding drug 
smugglers and misusing public funds.

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted of Killing Old Woman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A young man was convicted of murder  
Friday for beating, kicking and stomping to death an 81-year-old 
woman who had criticized him for singing a rap song with vulgar 
lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
	Victor Brancaccio, 21, could get life in prison in the 1993  
slaying of Mollie Mae Frazier. Because he was 16 at the time, he 
cannot get the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Brancaccio bit his lip when the verdict was read, then turned  
and appeared to scowl at his family, who were weeping loudly. 
Defense lawyers said they will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Brancaccio conceded he killed the woman, but his lawyers argued  
that brain damage, depression and a psychiatric drug rendered him 
legally insane at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Frazier, a neighbor, had criticized him for rapping the  
lyrics of the Dr. Dre song ``Stranded on Death Row'' as he walked 
down the street. 
</P>
<P>
	He beat Mrs. Frazier, jumped on her rib cage and bashed her  
skull with a toy gun, leaving her to die in a vacant lot. He 
returned the next day to spray paint on her body and burn it. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors argued that Brancaccio was a rebellious boy with a  
history of violence who was angry at his mother and took it out on 
Mrs. Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time Brancaccio was convicted of kidnapping  
and murder in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995 he was sentenced to life in prison, but an appeals court  
ordered a new trial because the judge did not specifically tell 
jurors they could consider whether the anti-depressant Zoloft 
rendered Brancaccio ``involuntarily intoxicated'' when he killed 
Mrs. Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
	Brancaccio's parents lost their home and their pizza business  
trying to pay for their son's first trial. But for the second 
trial, they were able to hire celebrity attorney Roy Black -- who 
defended William Kennedy Smith and Marv Albert -- after winning $2.7 
million in the Florida lottery.

<HEADLINE> Williams Closes Career at Hula Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAILUKU, Hawaii (AP) -- Ricky Williams played his first game as a  
freshman for Texas in 1995 against the University of Hawaii, an 
easy Longhorns victory thanks in part to his 95 yards rushing and 
two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years, 6,279 yards and a Heisman Trophy later, the career  
NCAA rushing leader is back in Hawaii to close his college career 
at the Hula Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Entering that first game, Williams said he had no idea he would  
rewrite 20 NCAA records and 44 Texas records, help revive the 
Longhorns program and put himself in position to be one of the 
first players chosen in the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that point, I was playing fullback; I think I got 10  
carries that game,'' Williams said Thursday after his first 
practice with the South team. ``I never thought I'd be here today. 
It's just been a great ride for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams decided before the season that he wanted to end his  
career on Maui at the Hula Bowl, admitting part of the reason he 
came back for his senior year was to play in an All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you grow up you watch all the All-Star games,'' he said.  
``I was kind of upset last year because juniors couldn't play. I 
really wanted to be a part of something like this my whole 
career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, though, had to find time for the game in between  
accepting awards and attending banquets that will keep him 
traveling for the next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams flew to Hawaii on Wednesday from Dallas, where on  
Tuesday he received the Doak Walker Award as the nation's best 
running back. After the Hula Bowl, it's back to Austin for a parade 
with the football team, then off to the Super Bowl, then to his 
hometown of San Diego for another awards banquet. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's just the start of it.  
</P>
<P>
	``Then the ESPY (Awards) in New York on the 15th and then the  
Maxwell Award on the 23rd and the Touchdown Club in Columbus (Ohio) 
on the 20th, then I go to Walter Camp on the 25th of February,'' 
Williams said. ``I think then I go to baseball,'' spring training 
with the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams admits he's a bit out of shape for playing football,  
but said he told South coach Mike Price he wants to play as much of 
the game as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a healthy guy so I'm not going to get too out of shape,''  
he said. ``Coach, I think he figured I didn't want to play much, 
but he asked me and I said I want to play the whole game if 
possible. I came here to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scout Tom Braatz of the Miami Dolphins said Williams' condition  
will be factored in by scouts.

<HEADLINE> Elvis Lives -- in Sumerian Language </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Elvis lives -- even in the long-dead  
language of Sumerian. 
</P>
<P>
	A Finnish professor who has recorded two albums of Elvis Presley  
songs translated into Latin now plans to record some of them in 
Sumerian, a language that died out about 4,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Jukka Ammondt said Friday that the first track he plans to  
record is ``Blue Suede Shoes.'' In that Sumerians had neither suede 
nor shoes, per se, the title translates into ``Esir Kus Za-gin,'' 
literally ``sandals of leather of the color of a blue gem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike many rockers who don't care if their singing is  
comprehensible, Ammondt is concerned about enunciation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure about my Sumerian, but they say Finnish is  
well-suited to pronouncing Sumerian because it's such a phonetic 
language,'' said Ammondt, a literature professor at the University 
of Jyvaskyla, 160 miles north of Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that there will be anyone around to criticize if he  
mispronounces a few words. Sumerian, used in the lower Euphrates 
River valley in what is now Iraq, died out as a spoken language in 
about 2000 BC. 
</P>
<P>
	Ammondt's recordings have novelty value, but also reflect the  
wide interest in languages in Finland, where almost everyone is at 
least trilingual. National radio even has regular programming in 
Latin.

<HEADLINE> FBI: Race Common Hate Crime Motive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than half the 8,049 hate crimes in 1997  
reported to the FBI were motivated by racial prejudice, the bureau 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As in 1996, racial prejudice was the most common motivation for  
hate crimes, accounting in 1997 for 4,710 incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	In order of magnitude, other reported motivations were 1,385  
incidents attributed to prejudice about religion, 1,102 sexual 
orientation, 836 ethnic or national origin, 12 to disability and 
four to multiple prejudices, the FBI said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 data come from 11,211 law enforcement agencies in 48  
states and the District of Columbia, representing 83 percent of the 
population. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, there were 8,759 hate crime incidents, of which 5,396  
were racially motivated. But the 1996 data came from 11,354 law 
enforcement agencies in 49 states and the District of Columbia, 
representing 84 percent of the population. 
</P>
<P>
	There were several hundred more incidents in 1996 than 1997, but  
there were more than 100 more police agencies reporting in the 
earlier year. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the number of agencies reporting varies under the  
voluntary system established by the Hate Crimes Statistics Act of 
1990, officials caution against drawing conclusions about trends in 
hate crime volumes between years. They say the figures provide a 
rough picture of the general nature of hate crimes.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dismisses Banana Dispute Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The United States dismissed a proposal  
made by the European Union on Friday urging the World Trade 
Organization's highest body to rule on a trans-Atlantic dispute 
over bananas. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials claim the EU unfairly restricts imports of Latin  
American bananas marketed by U.S. companies in order to protect 
European importers and former European colonies in Africa and the 
Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, the WTO found in favor of the United States and  
forced the EU to adjust its import rules. Washington says the 
changes do not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
	EU Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan said the latest move was ``a  
new initiative to bring about an amicable solution'' to the 
dispute, but the proposal was immediately condemned as ``cynical'' 
by Rita Hayes, the U.S. trade representative at the WTO in Geneva, 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to ... change the rules to suit them,'' Hayes said.  
</P>
<P>
	Brittan said the EU was asking the WTO's General Council, which  
comprises the trade body's full membership, to rule on whether 
Washington has the right to impose sanctions on the EU in the 
banana battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Brittan is trying to head off $520 million in U.S. sanctions  
against the EU as the dispute over bananas takes the world's two 
largest trading partners to the brink of a trade war. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is scheduled Monday to formally notify the WTO  
of its intention to impose sanctions and they could kick in as soon 
as next month.

<HEADLINE> Don't Fret About Index Comparisons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One sure way to mess up your mind as a  
mutual-fund investor is to spend time worrying about whether your 
funds are beating the market. 
</P>
<P>
	You know the routine: You check fund performance results for any  
recent period and compare those numbers to the gain registered by 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock composite index over the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, noting how managed funds failed again to keep pace with  
the 500 index, you conclude with some disparaging comment about 
high-priced managers' inability even to match a bunch of stocks 
selected almost at random. Something like ``a monkey could do 
better than these bozos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No question, it is important to be aware of this situation. It  
sheds light on some of the limitations of funds in general, and 
helps make the case for index funds, which merits the attention of 
every investor in stock funds. 
</P>
<P>
	But after that, focusing too much on the funds-vs.-indexes  
controversy can cause you to misunderstand the whole game -- and 
maybe to lose track of your purpose in owning mutual funds in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
	Always remember: When it comes time to put your nest egg to its  
intended purpose, the treasurer's office at Old Ivy U. or the sales 
manager at Meadow Pines Retirement Village won't give a penny to 
know whether your funds beat the S&AMP;P 500. All they will care about 
is whether your check is good for the amount specified. 
</P>
<P>
	To restate that point in simpler terms: Your purpose in  
investing is, and always will be, defined by your own 
circumstances, not by what happens in the markets. 
</P>
<P>
	What does this mean for a typical investor in stock funds? By  
all means, watch funds and the market indexes, but keep a sense of 
perspective, and consider that the story might be a little more 
complicated than it first appears. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year,'' notes Norman Fosback, editor-in-chief of the  
newsletter Mutual Fund Forecaster in Deerfield Beach, Fla., ``the 
S&AMP;P turned in its fourth consecutive year of 20 percent-plus gains, 
with a 29 percent total return. In contrast, the average equity 
mutual fund managed a 14 percent gain. 
</P>
<P>
	``In any other year, a 14 percent return would be enough to  
break out the champagne ... several percentage points above the 
long-term norm. But next to the S&AMP;P's heady return, it seems almost 
like a bear market in comparison.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's what may come of comparing -- getting a negative  
impression of how you're doing even as you are making excellent 
progress. As a general rule, if you can find an investment that 
reliably earns you 14 percent a year, forget how it compares to 
some benchmark and buy it. It will take you a long way, especially 
in later years as compounding works its powerful effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, whenever you use the S&AMP;P 500 as a standard of comparison,  
keep in mind that it doesn't represent the whole stock market, much 
less the full range of investments. 
</P>
<P>
	The 500 is dominated by big stocks, which fared much better than  
medium-sized and small stocks in 1998 and, indeed, over the past 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
	If you own shares of a small-stock fund, you can berate yourself  
for your timing or your choice of category. But you can't by any 
logic castigate a small-stock manager for not outperforming a 
big-stock index. 
</P>
<P>
	Adds Daniel Wiener, chairman of the Fund Family Shareholders  
Association, which publishes newsletters on fund investing, ``The 
S&AMP;P 500 is not a good measure against which to compare a portfolio 
diversified among many different asset classes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't take into account the fact that many investors own  
portfolios that include funds of small stocks, bonds and cash. In 
addition, many investors own municipal bond funds, which pay a 
lower yield but leave them with more money after taxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conversely, if you own a big-stock fund, it may make sense to  
temper your enthusiasm. Several of the largest managed funds at 
Fidelity Investments, the biggest of the fund families, DID beat 
the S&AMP;P 500 last year -- news which Fidelity is now enthusiastically 
publicizing. 
</P>
<P>
	But nobody should buy those funds just because they beat the  
market last year. Your choice of funds should emphasize whichever 
ones fit best with your own hopes and plans.

<HEADLINE>  Nissan, DaimlerChrysler in Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Nissan Motor Co., Japan's second-largest automaker,  
and DaimlerChrysler AG are discussing a possible alliance, 
DaimlerChrysler said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came amid reports that DaimlerChrysler was  
ready to provide an infusion of capital amounting to as much as a 
30-percent stake in the troubled Japanese automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler said in a statement that its co-chairman Juergen  
Schrempp, who arrived in Japan on Thursday, has met with Nissan 
President Yoshikazu Hanawa. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company said that although talks on possible  
``cooperation projects'' with Nissan Motors will continue, no 
decision had been made on what such cooperation might entail. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference today in Tokyo, Schrempp and his  
co-chairman Robert Eaton said that they had ``nothing more to add'' 
to the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	But Schrempp confirmed his company was hoping to expand in Asia,  
saying he wanted 20-25 percent of DaimlerChrysler's total revenues 
to come from Asia within 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we are looking at Asia, more so than in the past,'' said  
Schrempp. ``You could do that in an evolutionary fashion ... and 
you can also do it through other means, like an equity 
participation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two chairmen also declined to say if progress had been made  
in DaimlerChrysler's widely expected plans to buy a stake in Nissan 
Motor's truck-making subsidiary, Nissan Diesel. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan has expressed an interest in forming an alliance with an  
overseas partner in a step to restructure its troubled business. In 
addition to DaimlerChrysler, Renault SA of France and Ford Motor 
Co. also have been reported to be potential suitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Nihon Keizai financial daily today reported that Ford's  
chief financial officer, John M. Devine, denied in an interview 
that his company was considering investing in Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asahi newspaper reported that Nissan will solicit a capital  
investment of $1.76 billion to $2.65 billion from DaimlerChrysler 
AG, the world's fifth-largest automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be roughly equivalent to a 20-30 percent stake in  
Nissan on the basis of the company's current stock price, the paper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan officials refused to comment on the report.  
</P>
<P>
	Nissan has been in talks with Daimler-Benz AG, the German  
automaker that engineered a takeover of Chrysler Corp. last year, 
over the sale of an equity stake in Nissan Diesel for more than a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan is struggling to survive under a debt load totaling an  
estimated $22.2 billion. The company has lost money in five of the 
past six years and saw its U.S. sales decline 14 percent last year 
-- the largest drop of any automaker.

<HEADLINE> Quayle Hints About 2000 Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After sitting out the 1996 presidential  
campaign, former Vice President Dan Quayle is taking the first step 
toward seeking the top spot on the Republican ticket in 2000. He 
came close to announcing today, promising a conservative group ``a 
choice worth fighting for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Very soon I will be making a final decision about my political  
future,'' Quayle told a receptive audience at the Conservative 
Political Action Conference in the Washington suburb of Arlington, 
Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here among friends, I can say I have been encouraged to run  
for president of the United States,'' Quayle said, promising ``an 
agenda of vision and a choice worth fighting for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had six years of misplaced priorities, slick  
salesmanship and amateurism,'' said Quayle, last of several 
presidential hopefuls to address CPAC. 
</P>
<P>
	In reference to the impeachment trial of President Clinton,  
Quayle said, ``I have never seen more courage on Capitol Hill than 
that being displayed by Henry Hyde and the House Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, values do matter,'' he said to loud cheers.  
</P>
<P>
	In remarks directed and Democratic front-runner Vice President  
Al Gore, Quayle said, ``Bill Clinton obstructs justice and Al Gore 
calls him a moral leader. ... Bill Clinton and Al Gore deserve each 
other. America deserves better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Tuesday night, we listened to Al Gore's platform. They want  
more taxes, more regulation, more government and more burdens 
placed on the hard-working middle class. They are not new 
Democrats. They are new-age socialists,'' Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday night on CNN's ``Larry King Live,'' the former vice  
president said, ``I've thought about this for a long time. I've 
wanted to be president for a long time, and the year 2000 is 
looking like my opportunity,'' 
</P>
<P>
	He intends to file a formal statement of candidacy next week,  
the first step in his bid for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle said he would push for a 30 percent, across-the-board tax  
cut and would stand up for middle American values. 
</P>
<P>
	The race for the GOP nomination is drawing a number of  
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	The early front-runner seems to be George W. Bush, the Texas  
governor who is son of former President George Bush. Other possible 
candidates are millionaire businessman Steve Forbes, former cabinet 
secretary Elizabeth Dole, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and 
activist Gary Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Polls are quite frankly irrelevant. You don't make decisions  
on whether you are running for president on a poll, on your poll or 
someone else's poll. You consult yourself; you talk with your 
family; and if you are convinced that you are the best person to 
lead the country, then you make a go of it; and that's what I have 
done,'' Quayle said in the CNN interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle said he believe it will take $20 million to run a  
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am convinced I can raise it. I know I can raise it,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Exec Denies Gov't Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first Microsoft executive to testify in  
the company's antitrust case denied uttering an often-quoted phrase 
about his company's aggression toward a software rival, that he 
once promised to ``cut off Netscape's air supply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Maritz, the senior Microsoft executive alleged to have made  
that threat, takes the witness stand Monday to defend his company. 
Throughout the 11 weeks of trial, Maritz's name appears on nearly 
every controversial e-mail used as evidence by the government, 
either as author or recipient. 
</P>
<P>
	But in 160 pages of written testimony made public Friday, Maritz  
denied ever saying the words attributed to him by one witness 
during a November 1995 meeting with Intel Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never said, in the presence of Intel personnel or otherwise,  
that Microsoft would 'cut off Netscape's air supply,' or words to 
that effect,'' Maritz wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz also flatly denied other central allegations in the  
government's case, such as charges that Microsoft strong-armed 
Apple Computer Inc. into distributing its Internet browser software 
in 1997 and that it intimidated Intel into abandoning a rival 
technology earlier in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz accused government lawyers of trying to ``portray  
instances of routine interaction between companies in the computer 
industry, who inevitably must deal with one another, as something 
nefarious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a group vice president, Maritz falls in seniority below only  
Microsoft's billionaire chairman, Bill Gates, and its president, 
Steve Ballmer. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz joined the company in 1986 after working five years at  
Intel, and he is responsible for Microsoft's most important 
products, including its dominant Windows operating system and its 
profitable Office software programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz also was a key player in convincing a reluctant Gates to  
include America Online's software within Windows in exchange for 
AOL distributing Microsoft's Internet software. The March 1996 deal 
proved important for Microsoft, whose browser is used by many of 
AOL's 15 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL buying Netscape for $4.2 billion. The judge on Friday  
ordered the Justice Department to turn over to Microsoft's outside 
lawyers some documents submitted by AOL and Netscape related to the 
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft requested the paperwork to investigate whether the  
deal might rejuvenate the market because AOL can distribute 
Netscape's browser to all its subscribers, dramatically boosting 
its popularity.

<HEADLINE> Hawks Trade Laettner to Pistons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Christian Laettner signed a three-year, $18  
million deal Friday with the Atlanta Hawks, who then traded the 
injured power forward to Detroit for former Kansas star Scott 
Pollard and a first-round draft pick from Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was in everybody's best interest to allow this happen,''  
Hawks general manager Pete Babcock said. ``This way he gets the 
contract he wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laettner, who averaged 13.7 points and 6.6 rebounds a game last  
season, tore his right Achilles' tendon during a pickup game in 
September. His agent said Friday that the former Duke star could be 
ready in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we won't know for sure until we get closer to it,'' said  
agent Lon Babby, who also represents Detroit star Grant Hill. 
``It's in no one's interest -- the Pistons or Christian's -- to rush 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the deal said Laettner's contract will be  
prorated this year, and he could earn another $4.5 million in 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be Laettner's third stop in a sometimes-stormy career.  
After being taken by the Minnesota Timberwolves with the third 
overall pick, he feuded with teammates and coaches, leading to his 
trade exit to Atlanta in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Laettner made his first All-Star team in 1997, but last season  
lost his starting position to Alan Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Pistons, he will be reunited with fellow Duke alum  
Hill, with whom he teamed on the 1991 and 1992 NCAA national 
championship squads. In the 1992 regional final, Duke beat Kentucky 
104-103 in overtime on a last-second shot from Laettner set up by a 
three-quarters-court pass from Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good sign that he's here,'' Hill said. ``I like the  
fact that he's here for a few more years. This gives us a good mix 
of players all in their prime. Christian is really, really 
competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pollard is expected to back up power forward free agent Alan  
Henderson, who remains unsigned. In his rookie year last season, 
Pollard played in 33 games, averaging 2.7 points and 3.3 rebounds.

<HEADLINE> Actress Susan Strasberg Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Susan Strasberg, the daughter of acting coach  
Lee Strasberg, a close friend of Marilyn Monroe and an actress in 
her own right, died at age 60. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Strasberg, who lived in San Francisco, died of cancer in New  
York, said Victoria Krane, president of the Lee Strasberg Theatre 
Institute in West Hollywood, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	After making her Broadway debut playing Anne Frank in 1955, Ms.  
Strasberg also starred in ``Time Remembered,'' with Richard Burton 
and Helen Hayes in 1957. She also appeared in films, including 
``Picnic,'' with William Holden and Kim Novak, in 1954, and ``Stage 
Struck'' with Henry Fonda in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the actress appeared in at least 23 films and television  
productions, including ``Frankenstein,'' a 1973 television version 
of the horror classic, and in the 1988 ``Prime Suspect'' with Frank 
Stallone. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Strasberg and her family were close confidantes of Miss  
Monroe, and her father coached the star through hit movies 
including ``Bus Stop,'' ``The Prince and the Show Girl'' and ``Some 
Like it Hot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Strasberg, who died in 1982, was well-known for teaching the  
``method'' approach to acting at the famous school the Actors 
Studio. The teachings were based on the teachings of Konstantin 
Stanislavsky and stressed the actor's use of life experiences. 
</P>
<P>
	In her memoir: ``Marilyn and Me, Sisters, Rivals and Friends,''  
Ms. Strasberg recalled her close relationship with Miss Monroe. She 
also wrote about the troubled actress in an earlier autobiography, 
``Bitter Sweet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Strasberg was born and raised in Manhattan. She married  
actor Chris Jones in 1965, a union that ended a year later. The 
couple had a daughter, Jennifer, Krane said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in a state of absolute shock,'' said Krane. ``We knew  
that she had cancer but we were told that it was in remission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides her daughter, Ms. Strasberg is survived by a brother, a  
stepmother and two half brothers.

<HEADLINE> Is There Etiquette for Cell Phones? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The bbrrrrring! during a play at Ford's  
Theatre wasn't part of the script. It was a cell phone call to a 
woman down front. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hello,'' the woman answered, and to the audience's chagrin,  
kept on yakking. ``Hang up!'' a child shouted. Instead, the woman 
got up and chatted all the way up the aisle. 
</P>
<P>
	As the number of cell phone customers in the United States has  
grown -- it's now at 66 million -- so has annoyance at people who use 
their cell phones at movies, in restaurants, at the gym, hair 
salons -- even at church. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really is very thoughtless of people,'' said etiquette  
doyen Letitia Baldridge. ``It's just an invasion of other people's 
privacy and quiet time. What's sad is that people don't realize 
they are being rude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that's a manners no-no, etiquette experts say.  
</P>
<P>
	Even when people talk on cell phones in the privacy of their  
cars -- which can be dangerous -- it annoys etiquette experts. They 
think most of the incessant chatter is a status thing and could 
just as easily take place on home or office phones. They do make 
two exceptions: for emergencies and for brief calls to apologize if 
running late. 
</P>
<P>
	But a man in a Bethesda, Md., hair salon was doing neither  
recently as he talked away while his hair was being washed and cut, 
said Lynn McReynolds, a customer. ``I felt sorry for the poor woman 
trying to cut his hair,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baldridge was appalled when a man's cell phone went off at  
church. But the priest saw it differently: ``He said, `I'd rather 
have that young man here on his cell than not attending.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, people should turn off their phones before  
entering churches, movie houses or restaurants, etiquette experts 
say -- or at the very least, excuse themselves and take the call in 
the cloakroom, lobby or near public phones. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorothea Johnson of The Protocol School of Washington said an  
outing with a friend at an upscale restaurant was recently spoiled 
when a woman at the next table talked incessantly -- and loudly -- on 
her phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Many other customers turned around and glared, but that didn't  
stop the woman from taking two more calls. ``There was no regard 
whatsoever for anybody else in that room,'' Johnson says. 
</P>
<P>
	She suggests complaining to a waiter or a theater usher rather  
than confronting the caller directly. 
</P>
<P>
	Baldridge offers different advice. ``I would lean over and  
whisper, 'Would you be terribly nice, incredibly kind and finish 
that conversation so we can hear the play or the movie?' If you 
just use a lot of sugar sweetness, you'll disarm the person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Whittington, who manages a Washington movie theater, says  
that when customers complain about cell phone users, managers will 
ask the person to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have kids, it's a status kind of thing,'' said Whittington.  
``Last year when we had the `Star Wars' trilogy, we had long lines 
and people were calling when they got in the theater and said: 
`Hey, I'm in the theater.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In one case, though, moviegoers at a different theater benefited  
from a man with a cell phone: When the film was out of focus, he 
called management. 
</P>
<P>
	At gyms, fitness buffs chat on cell phones while on treadmills,  
Stairmasters, even doing weights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how important these people really are, but they  
make themselves seem really important,'' said Petr Speight, program 
director for a Gold's Gym here. 
</P>
<P>
	Even President Clinton is not immune.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, as he stood to give his official toast at a  
White House state dinner for Argentine President Carlos Menem, it 
happened: Bbrrrrring!

<HEADLINE> Duck Head Wants To Spread </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINDER, Ga. (AP) -- In some circles, Duck Head pants are as much  
a Southern tradition as iced tea, grits or college football 
Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sure is prevalent down here,'' said Leigh Murphy, a  
professional fund-raiser in Charleston, S.C. ``So I guess it is a 
Southern thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most guys she knew in her school days wore Duck Head pants while  
she and other young women bought them to make cutoff shorts. ``That 
was just very common,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The brand, with its green-headed, yellow-billed logo, is  
familiar to lifelong Southerners. As a new advertising campaign 
reminds: ``We were khakis before you were born -- unless you're 134 
years old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But because Duck Head is primarily a regional label, and unknown  
to many consumers in other parts of the United States, the company 
has struggled in recent years. Management considered selling the 
firm until recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Duck Head, hoping to increase its exposure and sales, is  
trying to flap its way into the thick of the highly competitive 
national apparel market, partly through the creation of an online 
store (www.duckhead.com). 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good exposure. You can go directly to the consumer with a  
strong message,'' said Paul Robb, president and chief executive 
officer of the 133-year-old company based in Winder, in northern 
Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Robb, a veteran of pantsmakers Levi Strauss and Haggar Apparel,  
came to Duck Head three years ago with a mission to revitalize and 
expand the brand. Helped by placement in national retail chains 
such as J.C. Penney and Belk Stores, Duck Head sales have jumped 
from $40 million to $100 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``So it's already been a pretty strong turnaround,'' Robb said.  
</P>
<P>
	Its parent company, Delta Woodside Industries Inc. of  
Greenville, S.C., had put Duck Head on the sales block last 
October, saying it wanted to generate cash and predicting that Duck 
Head would do better nationally if it could be sold to a larger 
apparel company. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all the consolidation going on in retail, national brands  
are becoming increasingly important. And for Duck Head to be 
successful, it needs to become a national brand,'' said E. Erwin 
Maddrey II, Delta Woodside's president and CEO, when he announced 
the possible sale. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Delta Woodside said Thursday it was rethinking a sale  
of Duck Head after the parent posted a $2.8 million loss in its 
second fiscal quarter. It ``cannot be reasonably certain that a 
transaction on satisfactory terms will be consummated in the near 
future,'' Delta Woodside said of Duck Head. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has about 200 employees left in Winder, with most of  
its manufacturing now done overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Duck Head dates to 1865, when brothers George and Joe O'Bryan  
founded a Nashville, Tenn., company dedicated to making rugged 
workclothes from a dense, closely woven cotton cloth called 
``duck.'' Their trademarked Duck Head name soon became synonymous 
with khakis around the South, and millions of U.S. servicemen and 
women during World War II wore khakis made after the O'Bryans 
turned their plant over to the war effort. 
</P>
<P>
	But Robb said the company never pushed beyond its Southern base.  
Acquired by Delta Woodside in 1989 in the aftermath of the jeans 
explosion in America, Duck Head is now expanding amid the growth of 
``casual office attire'' that has pushed the khaki industry to an 
estimated $3 billion, led by such brands as Gap and Levi's Dockers. 
</P>
<P>
	A branding survey conducted last summer by Atlanta's Kurt Salmon  
Associates and New York-based NPD Group found that 31 percent of 
male consumers nationally had heard of Duck Head and 12 percent had 
bought the brand -- both strong national numbers for a mainly 
regional brand. 
</P>
<P>
	Robb also has expanded Duck Head licensing and lines such as  
women's wear, golf attire, school backpacks and ``Duck Tucks,'' 
designed for schoolchildren who must hide logos because of school 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	While reaching new audiences, the company also moved to add to  
its Southern appeal with a series of radio commercials that depict 
such moments as South Carolina youths dancing the shag in the 1950s 
and Atlantans lining up for chili dogs at the Varsity Restaurant 
when it opened seven decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should know,'' the Duck Head commercials say. ``We were  
there.''

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Markets Stabilize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's Central Bank calmed  
jittery markets and slowed the free fall of the Brazilian currency 
Friday by propping it up in international markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Currency dealers said the government-run Banco do Brasil sold  
dollars to prop up the currency, the real, which closed at 1.72 to 
the dollar, compared with 1.70 on Thursday. Before the devaluation, 
a dollar bought just 1.21 reals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank declined to comment on reports it had sold  
dollars through Banco do Brasil. But little else would explain the 
strengthening of the real after it opened down sharply at 1.75 
Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The real had fallen about 30 percent since last week, when the  
Central Bank stopped spending dollars to support its value. Bank 
President Francisco Lopes said the monetary authority would allow 
the real to float but might step in to avoid exaggerated swings. 
</P>
<P>
	The steadier real also helped calm the Sao Paulo stock exchange,  
Latin America's largest. The exchange's Bovespa index declined 2.3 
percent in trading Friday. On Thursday, jitters over the plunging 
real sent the Bovespa down by 4.6 percent after a euphoric 
52-percent rise the four previous days. 
</P>
<P>
	The real's decline and the continued outflow of dollars -- more  
than $1.7 billion since the devaluations began Jan. 12 -- are seen 
as a sign that the financial crisis here could deepen. 
</P>
<P>
	The turmoil in Latin America's largest economy has raised fears  
that it could spread across the continent and even affect the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Lopes met with Finance Minister Pedro Malan and said  
the government has no plans to restrict capital outflows. Markets 
estimate that Brazil's currency reserves have fallen to less than 
$30 billion, not including the $9 billion Brazil received under a 
$41.5 billion aid package from international lenders.

<HEADLINE> Old Colorado Town Booming Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEADVILLE, Colo. (AP) -- In 1882, Oscar Wilde visited this  
rough-and-tumble mining town high in the Rockies and read the works 
of Renaissance author Benvenuto Cellini to a group of townspeople. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd liked it so much they asked Wilde why he hadn't  
brought the writer along. Wilde explained that Cellini was dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who shot him?'' someone in the crowd asked.  
</P>
<P>
	As of Friday, the mines that made Leadville a tough and pitiless  
Wild West outpost are all gone. But while the place is a far cry 
from its heyday, when 40,000 people packed the city, Leadville is 
no ghost town. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Leadville is booming again, a growing middle-class  
community of charming Victorian homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leadville will never die because living here becomes the most  
important thing in your life,'' said Stephanie Olson, who gave up 
her law practice to care for her kids and run a small scenic 
railroad in Leadville, at 10,430 feet the nation's highest 
incorporated city. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of Leadville's rebirth can be attributed to the success --  
and sheer expense -- of the nearby Vail and Copper Mountain ski 
resorts, where home prices start at $300,000. That has forced 
resort employees to turn to Leadville and its more affordable 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, most of Leadville's revenue comes from small  
businesses, tourism and people living here and working in the 
ski-resort towns. 
</P>
<P>
	Leadville has also become a magnet for ultramarathoners and  
other extreme sports enthusiasts. It also holds burro races and ski 
joring, in which a rider on horseback pulls a skier through an 
obstacle course down Harrison Avenue, the city's main street. 
</P>
<P>
	But history remains the area's biggest draw.  
</P>
<P>
	Leadville was once part of the biggest silver-mining district in  
the country. Though Abe Lee first struck gold in the region in 
1859, the big fortunes were made in the 1870s when silver made 
Meyer Guggenheim, Horace Tabor and J.J. Brown -- husband of the 
``Unsinkable'' Molly Brown of Titanic fame -- the Silver Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of mines were carved in the 20-square-mile district,  
some on top of each other. At Leadville's peak during the 1870s, 
tens of thousands of people caroused on the dirt streets, filling 
brothels and saloons. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilde, gunfighter Doc Holliday and suffragette Susan B. Anthony  
were among the colorful characters drawn to the boomtown 100 miles 
west of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Hangings were frequent and popular, drawing crowds of up to  
10,000. Today, a judge takes visitors on a tour of 21 spots where 
murders were committed. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent influx of middle-income residents is changing the  
face of Leadville, squeezing out lower-income immigrant workers -- 
many of them Hispanic -- who had become a burden on the county's 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	John Ozello, head of social services for Lake County, said his  
welfare caseload has dropped from about 60 cases a month to 12 in 
the last several years, and fewer people are on food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	The population is about 8,500, up 40 percent from 1990.  
Virtually every available home has been sold and builders cannot 
keep up with demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors now can sip lattes and read The New Yorker at the Cloud  
City Coffee House, in what was the atrium of Tabor's Grand Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone is pleased with the transformation of the mining  
town to what some would call a tinsel town. State Sen. Ken 
Chlouber, a former miner, fears for the town's soul. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we lost our mining industry we had to reach every which  
way, and now we're getting a lot of developers. They want to pick 
the bones of what is left,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But nobody seems overly worried about the miners who lost their  
jobs with the closing of Leadville's last mine. ASARCO's Black 
Cloud mine, where lead, zinc, gold and silver were taken from the 
ground, had been losing more than $200,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of jobs are available in the region. Also, other mining  
companies already are recruiting them. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the jobs in the region require a drive ``over the  
hill,'' as the roads to the Copper Mountain and Vail ski resorts 
are called. 
</P>
<P>
	But the county is trying to keep jobs at home. It is working to  
build a small prison, Colorado Mountain College is expanding and 
Copper Mountain is considering moving some of its operations to 
Leadville. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're unsinkable,'' Chlouber said. ``But sometimes we get  
wet.''

<HEADLINE>  Payton Likes Sonics Shot at Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Gary Payton thinks he'll get along fine with new  
coach Paul Westphal. 
</P>
<P>
	He also thinks the Seattle SuperSonics, even without George  
Karl, can win an NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a different look, but I'm going to have fun  
with it,'' Payton said. ``I can't complain about really nothing 
right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westphal has replaced Karl this season, and Payton is just  
getting to know the former Phoenix Suns' coach. 
</P>
<P>
	In 6 1/2 seasons under Karl, the combative Payton developed into  
one of the NBA's top point guards. Karl gave Payton a long leash, 
but the nine-year veteran doesn't feel Seattle's coaching change 
will create any problems for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's going to be a coach where he's going to give us a  
lot of leeway,'' Payton said. ``We're going to have to come out and 
play for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payton applauded two moves team president Wally Walker made  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker sent unproductive center Jim McIlvaine to the New Jersey  
Nets and signed Olden Polynice, 34, another 7-footer, to a one-year 
contract as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Olden's the type of player that I like,'' Payton said. ``He's  
a player who bangs and gets stuff done. When he gets motivated, he 
starts getting his little dance and stuff. I think we need that 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payton is earning an average of $12 million a season on a  
seven-year contract. He returned practice after the lockout in 
which he lost $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was with the players,'' he said. ``That's what we wanted to  
do. Now we can go on with our lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payton is joined by All-Star forward Vin Baker and former  
All-Stars Detlef Schrempf and Hersey Hawkins. And Payton thinks 
that core group can produce a title. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sonics are a veteran team that won 61 games and the Pacific  
Division last season before losing to the Los Angeles Lakers and 
Shaquille O'Neal in the playoffs, costing Karl his job. 
</P>
<P>
	McIlvaine wasn't a playoff factor. Payton thinks Polynice could  
be. 
</P>
<P>
	``Olden's a guy who's going to score for us and who's going to  
get some rebounds,'' Payton said. ``When Shaq was coming out and 
getting 40 (against the Sonics in the playoffs), we needed a big 
man who could go down in there and get us 18 or 20 points, too.''

	The cubicle-bound engineer who suffers the tortures of office  
life in Scott Adams' comic strip is the star of ``Dilbert,'' a 
clever new animated series on UPN that gives the struggling network 
a reason to live. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dilbert,'' debuting 8 p.m. EST Monday, doesn't suffer so much  
as a paper cut in the transition from the funny pages. The show 
skewers the absurdities of the workplace with wit as pointed as the 
hair of Dilbert's evil supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Am I late?'' says the top boss, strolling into a meeting.  
</P>
<P>
	Minion: ``Right on time, sir.''  
</P>
<P>
	Top boss: ``Oh. In that case, I've got time to make some phone  
calls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thumbs twiddle, boss finally returns: ``Am I late now?''  
</P>
<P>
	Minion: ``Yes. But it's not because you're an inconsiderate  
dolt. It's because you're more important than us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to Dilbert's world (maybe yours?) and don't forget to  
check the voice mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have 937 messages,'' intones the machine. ``All of which  
are marked URGENT.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Think of Fox's ``The Simpsons'' with its clever social satire,  
but drop the warm and fuzzy family trappings. Dilbert is part of a 
chain gang, not a clan. And they're breaking rock piles for The 
Company not because it makes sense, but because. Period. 
</P>
<P>
	The series' fidelity to the comic strip reflects the involvement  
of Adams, who is co-executive producer. Executive producer Larry 
Charles, whose credits include ``Mad About You'' and ``Seinfeld,'' 
helps make it work as a TV show. 
</P>
<P>
	An odd couple visually -- the neatly groomed Adams wears  
understated jeans and T-shirt, while Charles favors a colorful 
blend of long hair, beard and pajamas -- they profess to be in 
perfect sync about what matters in life and in ``Dilbert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both read physics books. For fun. Both are 41, and from New York  
City. And they both want the series to make viewers laugh by being 
smart as well as silly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got its share of slapstick and abuse of authority and  
talking animals,'' said Adams. ``Then there's another level of, 
'Oh, my God, that happened to me.' That has always been the 
strongest Dilbert element. 
</P>
<P>
	``The subtler part, the more subliminal and metaphorical kinds  
of things, those are the reasons you'll be able to wrap your mind 
around it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But comedy is still the goal here, the producers say, so don't  
fret about being forced to think too hard -- and feel free to bring 
the kids. 
</P>
<P>
	The satire may be beyond them, but the characters offer the  
requisite visual cuteness for the younger set. 
</P>
<P>
	There's Dilbert (voiced by Daniel Stern), the ultimate office  
corps nerd whose hopeless wardrobe is matched by his socially 
clueless behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	He's joined on the home front by the manipulative Dogbert (Chris  
Elliott) and ego-bruising Dilmom (Jackie Hoffman). Making Dilbert's 
office life unbearable are the Pointy-Haired Boss (Larry Miller), 
slacker colleague Wally (Gordon Hunt) and hostile Alice (Kathy 
Griffin). 
</P>
<P>
	That's letter-perfect casting, including Stern as the crucial  
lead drone. The actor has been heard to good effect before, 
providing the voice-over for ``The Wonder Years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adams said he and Charles were determined not to do the series  
unless it had great voice actors. ``We felt like we could make 
everything else work, but you can't bluff if you have the wrong 
voice. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we found Daniel Stern, that was the big, 'Ahhh, this is  
possible,' because he has that vocal quality, that nice-guy thing 
that comes through regardless of the dialogue. It's vulnerability 
without getting you to that uncomfortable thing you wouldn't want 
to watch for 21 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of actors wanted to give us Barney Fife, stuttering,  
'I'm such a nerd.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The big question, given the saturation marketing of the Dilbert  
strip through books and innumerable other items, is what took it so 
long to get to television. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams said he has been talking to prospective partners for about  
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``As Dilbert grew and grew, we got better meetings and met a  
higher class of people who were more serious than speculative,'' he 
said. When he and Charles hooked up through Sony's Columbia TriStar 
Television, the next step was finding the right network. 
</P>
<P>
	UPN might seem an odd choice, given its difficulties in  
attracting an audience. Fellow fledgling network WB, which has 
successfully targeted young viewers, posted nearly double UPN's 
household rating last week. 
</P>
<P>
	But Adams and Charles saw opportunity at UPN, which agreed to  
air 13 episodes. That commitment, a rarity now in the competitive 
TV market, gives the show a chance to develop and gain an audience, 
Charles said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's the big-fish-little-pond aspect, which appeals to  
Adams. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's good, it will be an important part of redefining what  
UPN is,'' the cartoonist said. ``And how cool is that? It allows me 
to be part of something that's bigger than the page is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And much bigger than a cubicle.  
</P>
<P>

	ALL DRESSED UP: No one can accuse E! Entertainment Television of  
giving short shrift to the Golden Globes. Or any awards ceremony. 
The cable channel plans 10, count 'em, 10 hours of live programming 
for Sunday's Golden Globes, beginning at noon EST and including two 
hours of star arrivals at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills 
with hosts Joan Rivers and her daughter, Melissa. That segment 
shows at 6 p.m. EST. So what's E! going to do for the really big 
show, the Oscars, on March 21? Offer 11 hours of coverage, 
including two hours of arrivals with, natch, the Rivers gals as 
hosts.

<HEADLINE> Britain Wants IOC 'To Clean Up' Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Britain's sports minister said the country won't  
bid for the Olympics until the IOC ``cleans up'' its act. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until it's cleaned up, until our own British Olympics  
Association's recommendations are put into place, I would not be in 
favor of this country or any city in this country bidding for any 
Olympic Games,'' Tony Banks said late Thursday. ``We have to clean 
up the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cities like Manchester, which competed for previous Olympic  
Games, have a right to feel very, very upset that they clearly were 
not competing on a level playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Simon Clegg, chief executive of the British Olympic  
Association, called for Salt Lake City to forfeit the 2002 Winter 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a perfect world, Salt Lake City wouldn't be allowed to host  
the 2002 Games, but the practicalities of the situation mean that 
finding an alternative at such short notice would be almost 
impossible,'' Clegg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The blame for this situation lies equally between the IOC  
members and the bidding cities. Guidelines given to the cities have 
clearly been broken and some IOC members have acted improperly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clegg said ``certain allegations'' about IOC members' conduct  
during Manchester's bid for the 1996 and 2000 Olympics had been 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	``The complaints were forwarded onto the IOC, but they were hard  
to substantiate,'' Clegg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, the British Olympic Association called for a  
complete overhaul of the Olympic bidding and site-selection process 
to prevent any further bribery scandals.

<HEADLINE> New Browns Coach Starts Immediately </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Chris Palmer has never been one of those  
sleep-in-the-office coaches, who after endless hours studying game 
film and scouting reports collapses at his desk or on a sofa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd much rather sleep next to my wife than on a couch in my  
office,'' Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for Donna Palmer, she's probably going to see a  
lot less of her husband now that he's coach of the Cleveland 
Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, who was hired on Thursday, spent the first part of his  
second day on the job in Florida, saying good-bye to his 
Jacksonville Jaguars' co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
	He had hoped to clean out his office, but needing to get back to  
Cleveland quickly, asked someone else to pack his things, then 
headed for the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Once he arrived in Cleveland, Palmer planned to start working  
the phones like a telemarketer. He said putting together his 
coaching staff was his No. 1 priority, and as he learned on 
Thursday, every second counts. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of teams signing guys pretty quickly,'' he  
said. ``I talked to a guy on the phone and he had just accepted a 
job. I missed him by two minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The list of available quality assistants with NFL experience is  
short, and getting shorter by the minute. Five other teams -- 
Baltimore, Philadelphia, Seattle, Carolina and Kansas City -- have 
hired new head coaches the past two weeks and all are trying to 
assemble staffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said he would interview potential assistants this  
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chemistry of the staff is very, very important,'' he said.  
``There are several guys who have to make a decision by Monday and 
we want to be part of that and give them a chance to see what we 
have in Cleveland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What the Browns have in Cleveland is a heavy work load with a  
team needing to be built -- quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be putting in 16- to 18-hour days,'' Palmer said. ``It's  
going to be a hectic time for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And it's only going to get crazier. February will be a critical  
month for the Browns, who will build most of their roster through 
the expansion draft Feb. 9 and in the free-agent signing period 
which begins Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, there are college scouting combines to attend and  
mini-camps to run in March; April's NFL college draft in which the 
Browns hold the No. 1 pick; training camp in July; and the team's 
first exhibition on Aug. 9 in Canton against the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's difficult,'' Palmer said. ``It's  
challenging, and as a coach you look for challenges. Everything 
will work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer doesn't expect his routine to change much. He still  
intends to make it home every night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm an early morning person,'' he said. ``I like to get my  
sleep.''

<HEADLINE> McDyess To Decide on Nuggets Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Antonio McDyess is back to being undecided, and it's holding up  
several other deals. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess spent Thursday in Denver meeting with Nuggets officials,  
but the day ended with McDyess leaving McNichols Arena without 
having signed a contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll get it all wrapped up,'' Denver general manager Dan  
Issel predicted, but the day's events showed that McDyess returning 
to the Nuggets was not a certainty. 
</P>
<P>
	Until McDyess makes up his mind, Tom Gugliotta, Vlade Divac and  
other free agents will have to wait. McDyess traveled to Denver on 
Thursday, but the Suns were keeping their possibilities open in 
case they could woo him back. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're interested to hear what led to this,'' Phoenix general  
manager Bryan Colangelo said. ``It would be shortsighted not to 
listen to what Antonio has to say. Waiting one more day can't 
hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But James Bryant, one of McDyess' agents, hinted it's likely  
that the Suns are out of the McDyess sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phoenix has been calling all day, and their biggest complaint  
is we don't return their phone calls,'' Bryant said from Denver. 
``We certainly haven't tried to send the kid back there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The job of processing each and every new contract and trade was  
a slow one on the first full non-lockout day since June 30, and the 
expected signings of McDyess, Divac, Jerry Stackhouse, Hot Rod 
Williams, Christian Laettner and Joe Smith were delayed for one 
reason or another. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the day, there were 56 signings and five trades  
that had been announced. But the Chicago Bulls, for example, did 
not have any of their transactions cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Jerry Krause said the new player contracts were  
so different from past ones that there was a backlog in the league 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Several deals went through, including Latrell Sprewell being  
traded from Golden State to New York, Jayson Williams re-signing 
with New Jersey, and a three-way trade between Minnesota, Denver 
and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the teams opened training camps, and they will have only  
a few days to practice before the regular season starts Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Each team will play 50 games in 90 nights.  
</P>
<P>
	For some of the players, the small amount of preparation time  
will make it difficult to get back into game shape quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Kemp of the Cleveland Cavaliers was carrying around at  
least 20 extra pounds during the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my 10th season. My condition is not too bad,'' Kemp  
said before going through practice with the Cavs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Shawn Kemp gave every ounce he could out there  
today,'' Cleveland coach Mike Fratello said. ``He understands we 
all have some work to do. He worked hard. I don't know how much 
more he could have done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first deal to clear the league office Thursday was the trade  
sending Latrell Sprewell to the New York Knicks for John Starks, 
Chris Mills and Terry Cummings. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell brings a tarnished reputation to a team anxious over  
the public relations risk. He was suspended for 68 games last 
season and had his contract terminated after he choked and 
threatened to kill coach P.J. Carlesimo at a Warriors practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not here to judge him, I'm here to coach him,'' Jeff Van  
Gundy said. ``I'm not really thinking about what happened in the 
past, I'm really thinking about what we can do in the future. He's 
a talent, he's a competitor and he's a complement to some of the 
other guys we have here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks reiterated that they were not interested in signing  
free-agent forward Dennis Rodman. Rodman plans to elaborate on his 
future tonight on the ``Tonight Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's agent, Dwight Manley, was in Salt Lake City to announce  
that another of his clients, Karl Malone, would be staying with the 
Utah Jazz for the rest of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone and Jazz owner Larry Miller both were teary-eyed.  
</P>
<P>
	Malone and Miller hadn't spoken for weeks before an intense,  
lengthy conversation on Wednesday night. They said they emerged 
from the meeting with a verbal agreement to work out a lucrative, 
long-term deal as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	The sign-and-trade deal sending Scottie Pippen to the Rockets  
was being held up because of unspecified contract language 
problems. It was expected to be finalized today. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Rudy Tomjanovich canceled the scheduled first practice  
that was supposed to follow the announcement of Pippen's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to thank all the fans for being very warm to me  
around the city the little time I've been here,'' Pippen said. 
``I'm looking forward to bringing a champion here. I can see I'm 
going to have a wonderful career here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets also re-signed free agent Charles Barkley for $1  
million. Barkley signed his contract on the 10th tee at La Quinta, 
Calif., where he was playing in the Bob Hope Desert Classic.

<HEADLINE> Another Day of Signings in the NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The signing of Antonio McDyess was expected to unleash a domino  
effect, but Tom Gugliotta didn't fall into place. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess, the player considered the top free agent on the market,  
finally made up his mind Friday and signed with the Denver Nuggets 
despite a last-minute lobbying effort by three members of the 
Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta then left Phoenix without signing a contract and  
headed to Minnesota hoping to meet with Timberwolves owner Glen 
Taylor. No one was certain what Gugliotta's next move would be, 
from re-signing with Minnesota to signing with Phoenix to being 
involved in a sign-and-trade deal that could send him somewhere 
else. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a lot of positive feedback,'' Phoenix coach Danny Ainge  
joked, ``but, hey, I had a year of positive feedback from McDyess, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, free agent Vlade Divac signed with the Sacramento Kings  
while Joe Smith agreed to terms with the Timberwolves, and now it 
looks like the Suns could be the biggest losers of the post-lockout 
frenzy if they wind up losing Gugliotta, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very nervous, no question about it,'' Ainge said. ``We're  
taking a little bit of a gamble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rod Strickland remained a no-show Friday as the Washington  
Wizards started three-a-day workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The point guard and the Wizards remain far apart on a new  
contract. Strickland and agent David Falk originally demanded $65 
million over five years but reportedly lowered that to $55 million 
Thursday. The Wizards have offered about $30 million over three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington executive vice president and general manager Wes  
Unseld said both sides will continue talking. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade sending Scottie Pippen to Houston was finally cleared  
by the league office, allowing the Rockets to then re-sign five of 
their own free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The pace of player movement stayed steady Friday, with three  
more trades and dozens of signings. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Atlanta re-signed Christian Laettner and dealt him to Detroit  
for Scott Pollard and a draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Chicago re-signed Steve Kerr and traded him to San Antonio for  
Chuck Person and a conditional first-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Detroit traded the draft rights to Bonzi Wells to the Portland  
Trail Blazers for a future first-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
	A few teams, such as Sacramento and Detroit, made all their  
major moves practically at once, while other teams filled out their 
training camp rosters or added an extra part here or there. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who reportedly turned down $80 million from Golden State  
last season before he was dealt to Philadelphia, agreed to a 
one-year deal with Minnesota for $1.75 million. The deal remained 
unsigned, however, while Smith waited to see how the Gugliotta 
situation played out. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit re-signed two of its own free agents, Jerry Stackhouse  
and Joe Dumars, and added free agents Loy Vaught and Jud Buechler. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacramento gave Divac $62.5 million, welcomed Chris Webber to  
camp and found a way to re-sign Corliss Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
	Divac, one of just five active NBA players with 8,000 career  
points, 5,000 rebounds, 1,500 assists and 1,000 blocks, said he 
wants to break a streak of 15 consecutive losing seasons by the 
Kings -- a league record. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one of the biggest challenges in my career now, to make  
Sacramento a competitive team,'' he said. ``It's a very big 
challenge, and I like challenges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana Pacers re-signed Rik Smits, giving him a contract  
that will average a reported $14 million, the Dallas Mavericks 
signed Suns free agent center Hot Rod Williams and the Milwaukee 
Bucks signed the last member of the original Charlotte Hornets, 
Dell Curry. 
</P>
<P>
	In other free agent moves, Seattle signed free agent forward  
Billy Owens, San Antonio signed forwards Mario Elie and Jerome 
Kersey, the Trail Blazers signed point guard Greg Anthony, 
Minnesota signed guard Malik Sealy, the Knicks signed forward Kurt 
Thomas, Vancouver signed center Cherokee Parks and Utah brought 
back Thurl Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
	The sign-and-trade deal sending Luc Longley to Phoenix still had  
not been cleared by the league office.	   In New York, Latrell Sprewell met with commissioner David stern 
and was reinstated. He was expected to begin practicing with the 
Knicks on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry. We all make mistakes. I made one, I said I'm sorry  
about that and I'm asking for a second chance,'' Sprewell said. 
``I'm not the person I've been portrayed to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets announced that Glen Rice had undergone successful  
surgery to remove bone chips from his elbow. He will be out 6-8 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Heat brought veteran shooting guard Terry Porter into  
camp, and he immediately found himself a possible starter after it 
was learned that last season's starter, Voshon Lenard, will be out 
8-10 weeks with a stress fracture in his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami got one small piece of good news -- word from the league  
office that Alonzo Mourning will not have to serve the second game 
of his two-game suspension for fighting with New York's Larry 
Johnson during last year's playoffs.

<HEADLINE> GOP Selects Philadelphia As Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's official: Republicans will nominate their  
next presidential candidate in Philadelphia, site of the 1776 
convention that began the American revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia was chosen unanimously Friday to host the 2000  
Republican National Convention, a prize worth millions of dollars 
in business to a city that flirted with bankruptcy in the early 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	For Republicans, it was a chance to claim a battleground state  
that has picked presidential winners since 1972, eluding 
Republicans the past two elections. Pennsylvania has 23 electoral 
votes, one-twelfth of the number needed to win the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine a better place than for the next president of  
the United States to be captured at the end of the convention in 
front of the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall,'' said Jan 
Larimer, head of the convention site-selection committee. ``What a 
great way to start the next century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have narrowed the convention site to Los Angeles,  
Boston and Denver. Party officials have identified Los Angeles as 
the leading candidate. An announcement is expected by next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The 165 members of the Republican National Committee approved  
the advisory panel's recommendation on a voice vote. Delegates 
cheered as RNC Chairman Jim Nicholson declared, ``We are going to 
Philadelphia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sporting a tie with the GOP's elephant symbol, Philadelphia  
Mayor Edward G. Rendell, one of the few Democrats in attendance, 
presented Republicans with a 6-foot-long Philadelphia cheese steak, 
made with 35 pounds of meat, six pounds of Cheese Whiz and 10 
pounds of onions. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 GOP convention was held in San Diego, which welcomed  
Republicans with beachfront hotels and warm weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia has been the site of eight political conventions,  
including the first Republican convention in 1856. The city last 
served as a convention host in 1948 when both Republicans and 
Democrats met in Philadelphia to nominate Thomas Dewey and Harry S. 
Truman.

Communications Corp. is telling its 208,000 subscribers it will 
shut down its pioneer ``Prodigy Classic'' online service. 
</P>
<P>
	Prodigy notified customers nationwide by e-mail late Friday it  
could not avoid the effects of the so-called ``Y2K'' problem and by 
October must shut down one of the most well-established 
neighborhoods in cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the Year 2000 problem was not expected to  
affect the 433,000 subscribers of its newer ``Prodigy Internet'' 
service, launched in late 1996, and it encouraged its Classic 
subscribers to enroll there. 
</P>
<P>
	Prodigy's chief executive officer, Samer Salameh, sent e-mail to  
subscribers explaining that the company's 9-year-old Classic 
service was ``built using proprietary technologies that predate 
current Internet standards'' and the company's engineers were 
``unable to make them Y2K compliant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that this announcement will be a disappointment to many  
of you,'' Salameh wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Prodigy also posted the announcement on its Web site.  
</P>
<P>
	Subscribers used Prodigy's own electronic bulletin boards to  
express skepticism that the Year 2000 problem was to blame for the 
service's demise. Some openly suggested that the company 
manufactured the explanation to encourage them to migrate to its 
newer Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	Many computers originally programmed to recognize only the last  
two digits of a year will not work properly beginning Jan. 1, 2000, 
when machines will assume it is 1900. Some computers can be 
reprogrammed, but many devices have embedded microchips that must 
be physically replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	Prodigy, based in White Plains, N.Y., did not explain in e-mail  
or on its Web site exactly how the Year 2000 problem manifested 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Prodigy's Classic service was launched nationally in 1990, years  
before the booming popularity of the Internet and its World Wide 
Web. Rival services, such as America Online and CompuServe, dwarfed 
its subscriber base as they gradually concentrated on offering 
unadulterated access to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Not Prodigy, which still requires Classic subscribers to use its  
awkward, proprietary e-mail software and Internet browser to 
venture beyond the confines of its own online content. 
</P>
<P>
	But the service's strength was always its relatively civil  
discussion groups, where people gathered to talk about shared 
interests without the off-topic interruptions and insults so common 
among the Internet's Usenet discussion areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the Internet, Prodigy uses censors who monitor its  
bulletin boards to ensure messages are appropriate and do not 
contain obscenities. 
</P>
<P>
	Prodigy boasted 1.13 million Classic subscribers in 1995, but  
that number has declined sharply in recent years as users fled to 
Internet service providers that offered faster, more reliable 
access to the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, America Online, the world's largest Internet  
provider, has more than 15 million subscribers. Prodigy Internet 
has grown from 7,000 subscribers in 1996 to 433,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Prodigy incurred net losses of $114.1 million in 1996 and $129.3  
million in 1997, and it lost $47.6 million during the nine months 
that ended in September.

<HEADLINE> Falcons May Cash In on New Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Suddenly, the Atlanta Falcons are a  
marketing director's dream. 
</P>
<P>
	They've got their own dance, a catchy nickname, an inspirational  
coach and their first trip to the Super Bowl. Now, it's time to 
cash in. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got a town that's just on fire for this football  
team,'' Rob Jackson, vice president of marketing and sales, said. 
``Everybody wants to have a piece of this football team, which is 
exciting to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long one of the NFL's dormant franchises, the Falcons are hoping  
their improbable season will generate some enthusiasm for the rest 
of 1999. Specifically, it is imperative for the team to increase a 
season-ticket base that didn't even reach 30,000 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a perfect home record and the first NFC West title in 18  
years, Atlanta produced only two sellouts for eight regular-season 
games at the 71,228-seat Georgia Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to lower the bar,'' Jackson said Friday. ``You lower  
the bar by getting more season tickets in the house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falconmania had resulted in a hefty boost in sales over the past  
six weeks. The team has taken more than 3,800 refundable deposits 
for the 1999 season, which is nearly double the 2,000 or so new 
season-ticket packages that were sold all last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the team has a long way to go to create the kind of  
demand that exists in cities like Green Bay, where there are long 
waiting lists for season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a totally different situation than any I've ever been  
involved in,'' said Dan Reeves, who previously worked in Dallas, 
Denver and New York, all pro football hotbeds. ``We got a few 
people turned around a little bit at the end of the season (by 
winning six of the last eight games), but we still didn't see a 
drastic chance during the offseason as far as ticket sales.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``I think they're about as turned on right now as we  
can get 'em turned on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some fans hanging around the team's suburban training complex,  
hoping to snag a few autographs, wondered why the team hasn't 
launched a more aggressive season-ticket campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons have focused their advertising on newspapers so far,  
ignoring the broader appeal of television because local stations 
are devoting so much air time to the team anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been listening on TV, but I haven't heard anything about  
pre-sales,'' said Malcolm Cash, a potential new customer who lives 
less than two miles from the team headquarters. ``I would think 
they'd be talking about it. I guess everybody's concerned about 
getting Super Bowl tickets. But when it's over, people might change 
their minds in a hurry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said the Falcons, who usually begin their season-ticket  
campaign in April, plan to strike at potential buyers as soon as 
the Super Bowl is over. A championship would provide an enticing 
element for the advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've not done a lot of marketing, a lot of advertising at  
this time,'' he said. ``We've got a game a week from Sunday, so our 
strategy is still 60 minutes shy of what this (campaign) is going 
to look like. But we'll be aggressive while the excitement and 
momentum is there during the month of February, then we'll pick 
back up around draft time'' in April. 
</P>
<P>
	No advertising campaign could duplicate the marketing that has  
evolved naturally. The players got it started when they nicknamed 
themselves the ``Dirty Birds'' and developed an arm-flapping dance 
of the same name to celebrate touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, the city was galvanized by the plight of Reeves,  
who underwent heart bypass surgery with two games left in the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons kept on winning while Reeves was recovering at home,  
then he made an inspirational return for the divisional playoff 
victory over San Francisco. Last week, Atlanta shocked heavily 
favored Minnesota in the NFC championship game, rallying for a 
30-27 overtime victory in one of the great postseason games in 
league history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's that magical type season that every franchise dreams  
of,'' Jackson said. ``You can't manufacture the kind of stuff 
that's happening out there. If we tried to contrive a Dirty Bird 
song or a Dirty Bird logo, it couldn't have happened. It happened 
because the fans got excited and the players got into it. These 
guys are having fun with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So is Jackson, who optimistically hopes to increase the  
season-ticket base to 45,000 next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to be easy. It will take a lot of work,'' he  
said. ``But this marketplace is excited about this football team.''

<HEADLINE> Alleged Mobsters Plead to Extortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As alleged mobster John Cerasini left court, he  
smiled as he was asked whether he ever made money on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tons,'' he answered.  
</P>
<P>
	Cerasini was among four reputed mobsters who pleaded guilty  
Thursday to a scheme to drive up the price of an Arizona company's 
stock by forcing young Wall Street brokers to promote it to their 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say the 1997 conspiracy netted the men more than  
$1.3 million in the largest case ever involving organized crime 
influencing the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of HealthTech International Inc., which owns fitness  
centers, rose after the participants made a deal with the company's 
chairman and then brokers convinced unwitting buyers the stock was 
severely undervalued. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosario Gangi, 59, an alleged captain in the Genovese family,  
and Frank Lino, 61, an alleged Bonanno family captain, were among 
those who arranged secret payments to brokers and principals at 
Meyers Pollock &AMP; Robbins Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Both pleaded guilty to securities and extortion conspiracy  
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Eugene Lombardo, 47, a reputed associate of the Bonanno family  
who admitted using threats to get what he wanted, also pleaded 
guilty, as did alleged Bonanno soldier Cerasini, 60. 
</P>
<P>
	All face less than a decade in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	HealthTech Chairman Gordon Hall has pleaded innocent to charges  
and is awaiting trial. Three employees of the now-defunct firm, 
including two brokers, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit 
securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Lombardo said the mob was looking to extend its influence over  
Wall Street by inserting its own people as brokers at Meyers 
Pollock. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the judge that he had threatened to use force to remove  
a Meyers Pollock employee who was preventing mob-backed people from 
being hired.

<HEADLINE> Charge in 23-Year-Old Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- After 23 years on the run, a 70-year-old  
man was tracked down and charged Friday with killing a little boy 
at the dinner table with a bullet meant for the toddler's 
grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson Moore was picked up Thursday in Binghamton, 150 miles  
from Rochester. He pleaded innocent to murder in the 1975 slaying 
of 18-month-old Tremayne Lovett. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy was sitting in his chair between Moore and his  
girlfriend when the couple began arguing over a plate of food, 
police said. Moore allegedly pulled a gun and fired at his 
girlfriend, Ethel Lovett. 
</P>
<P>
	The bullet went through the boy's brain.  
</P>
<P>
	Police issued a murder warrant for Moore, but the trail went  
cold and they gave up the hunt after a year or two, prosecutor 
Howard Relin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, two detectives in a newly formed Cold Case Squad  
noticed that overlooked information in Moore's file indicated he 
might be living in the Binghamton area. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not known how long he had been in Binghamton, but a  
landlord said Moore had moved into an apartment there eight months 
ago.

<HEADLINE>  Fossil Suggests Dinosaurs Were Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A well-preserved fossil of a 110  
million-year-old baby dinosaurs suggests that the extinct animal 
had the lungs to be a swift and deadly hunter, researchers say in a 
new study. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas Geist, a paleobiologist at Oregon State University,  
said the remains of a specimen called Scipionyx may be the best 
preserved dinosaur fossil ever found and will provide researchers 
with new insights into the extinct animals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The extraordinary condition of the fossils allows us to hang  
some meat on the bones of these animals,'' said Geist, the senior 
author of a study appearing today in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you usually get in fossils is just bones, but in this one  
there are remnants of liver, large intestine, windpipe and 
muscle,'' he said. ``It is like a Rosetta stone for dinosaurs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scipionyx was a theropod, a type of meat-eating dinosaur that  
walked on its hind legs, had a big head with a large mouth and 
teeth, a long tail and small forearms. 
</P>
<P>
	Geist said the soft tissue impressions show that the Scipionyx  
had a two-partition abdominal cavity, with the lungs and heart in 
one section, and the liver and guts in the other. The liver was 
connected by muscle to a pelvic bone, he said, suggesting that the 
animal had a breathing system called a hepatic piston. 
</P>
<P>
	In such a system, muscles pull against the liver, causing the  
breathing cavity to expand slightly. This forces air into the lungs 
at high rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is necessary for sustained activity,'' said Geist.  
``These theropods were exceedingly fast and dangerous animals. They 
were not slow and sluggish like many modern reptiles. They could go 
like hell whenever they wanted to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mammals have a diaphragm muscle that causes the lung cavity to  
expand and draw in air. The ability to rapidly ventilate the lungs 
is essential for moving swiftly for long periods. 
</P>
<P>
	This lung capacity may be one reason that dinosaurs dominated  
mammals for about 150 million years, said Geist. Mammals during 
this period were small and no match for the meat-eating dinosaur. 
</P>
<P>
	``These dinosaurs were fierce animals that could run prey down  
over extended distances and definitely not the sort of sluggish 
movers of many living reptiles,'' Geist said. ``This was like a 
turbo-charged lizard. The mammals couldn't get a foothold and just 
tried to stay out of the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Geist said the hepatic piston works best in a warm, mild climate  
such as the Earth enjoyed during most of the dinosaur era. When the 
climate chilled, the dinosaurs were in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``These animals may have been so specialized for the warm  
climate, that even a minor change over an extended period may have 
helped do them in,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The interpretation of this fossil makes this animal more like  
the popular idea of the dinosaur, such as in the movie 'Jurassic 
Park', that they were fast and agile and able run for some 
distance,'' said Terry D. Jones, a co-author of the study. ``This 
gives some credence to that idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not all experts agree that the Scipionyx fossil gives such  
precise evidence of a hepatic pump breathing system, said Paul 
Soreno, a dinosaur expert at the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``For many in the field, that interpretation is controversial,''  
said Soreno. 
</P>
<P>
	The Scipionyx fossil, the only dinosaur ever found in Italy, is  
small enough to hold in two hands and the animal may have been only 
days old when it died. Geist said it perished in a saltwater marsh 
which preserved its body structure. 
</P>
<P>
	No fossil for an adult Scipionyx has been found and Geist said  
the animal species probably grew to only about the size of a large 
dog.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Announces Clinic Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thousands of anti-abortion activists gathered  
near the White House for speeches, songs and prayers to mark the 
26th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion 
while across town first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton celebrated the 
law's survival. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should all take heart that despite many attempts to chip  
away at its guarantees, Roe is still the law of the land,'' she 
said, referring to the decision in the famous case known as Roe vs. 
Wade. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton announced Friday that President Clinton plans to  
seek $4.5 million for alarm systems and closed-circuit camera 
systems to protect clinics where abortions are performed. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinics would buy security devices -- which also include motion  
detectors, bulletproof windows and improved lighting -- with federal 
money under a White House plan to counter clinic violence. The 
money also would be used to determine which clinics were most at 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the president will include the plan in his budget  
proposal for the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Violence, harassment and intimidation have no place in our  
health care system or in this debate,'' she told members of the 
National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, which was 
celebrating its 30th anniversary at a Washington hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also saluted Dr. Barnett Slepian, an obstetrician  
who was shot to death by a sniper last October in the kitchen of 
his home in Amherst, N.Y., a Buffalo suburb. Investigators suspect 
he was killed by an anti-abortion protester. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not free expression,'' she said of doctor murders and  
clinic bombings. ``This is domestic terrorism and it must stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-abortion rally was held by the group March for Life on  
the Ellipse, a grassy area just south of the White House. Many 
participants said they'd never tire of returning to Washington year 
after year to demand that the government outlaw abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still here. For 26 years!'' rally organizer Nellie Gray  
said to enthusiastic applause. ``We stay here for personhood, for 
the babies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Public opinion is changing,'' said Richard Miranti, a dentist  
from Toms River, N.J. ``The reality of the cruelty and violence is 
becoming more apparent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters snarled traffic even before they started marching as  
they walked to the Ellipse for the rally. Many came on buses from 
states as far away as Wisconsin, Ohio, Missouri and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants waved dozens of colorful signs -- some hand  
lettered, some professionally printed -- that shouted slogans and 
carried gruesome pictures of aborted fetuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Natural CHOICE is LIFE,'' said one. ``Hey Pres, read that  
Bible,'' said another. 
</P>
<P>
	One couple waved a sign that protested so-called partial-birth  
abortion by featuring a syringe needle jabbed into the back of a 
doll's head against the background of a U.S. flag. 
</P>
<P>
	``Abortion means violent, painful death to little children,''  
Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., told the crowd.

<HEADLINE> After Wait, New Bulls' Coach Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- He jogged halfway up the floor, intensely  
trailing a fast break. The hardwood felt good to Tim Floyd's feet 
as he hollered instructions to his new team. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, after months of waiting and a frustrating first day  
when his first practice was canceled, Floyd was getting to coach 
the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, these aren't the same Chicago Bulls who won six NBA titles  
during the 1990s. Who will fill out the roster of this overhauled 
championship team was still undecided Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But at last Floyd was getting to do what he was hired for last  
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gets the blood flowing again,'' Floyd said.  
</P>
<P>
	Floyd got his first Chicago welcome hours later before a ``fan  
appreciation'' scrimmage at the United Center where the tickets 
were free. 
</P>
<P>
	And it wasn't all warm. As Floyd was introduced and came to the  
center of the floor, the boos from a large and enthusiastic crowd 
estimated at 14,000 were noticeable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was fine,'' Floyd said of the reaction.  
</P>
<P>
	After he was introducted, the coach Michael Jordan didn't want  
to play for stayed at midcourt and, using a microphone, spoke to 
the fans about bridging ``the gap between the future and the 
past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It won't be easy. The stars of Friday night's the 13-player  
scrimmage weren't any of the team's veterans who will start the 
exhibition opener Sunday against the Pacers, but first-round draft 
pick Corey Benjamin and 6-9 free agent Kornel David of Hungary, who 
led the reserves to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	In a strange scene after the scrimmage, players participated in  
a 3-point shooting contest with fans, held up a sign thanking them 
and then threw mini balls into the stands-- all part of an attempt 
to make amends after the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls had canceled their first post-lockout practice  
Thursday because they had only six players under contract. 
</P>
<P>
	And only 10 players were able to participate in the early  
2 1/2-hour practice. Mark Bryant, Bubba Wells and Martin Muursepp 
still were waiting for their contracts to clear the league office 
after their trade from Phoenix for Luc Longley. 
</P>
<P>
	Same thing for Roy Rogers, who arrived via Houston for Scottie  
Pippen. Dickey Simpkins, a member of the Bulls' last three title 
teams, signed in time for the scrimmage at the United Center. 
Benjamin signed between the practice and the scrimmage, but Cory 
Carr, their second-round pick, and former draft choice Jeff Sanders 
still had not. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Toni Kukoc, Ron Harper, Randy Brown and Keith  
Booth, who already were signed, also signed to on the training camp 
roster are free agent veteran center Bill Wennington, a member of 
all three title teams, who signed Thursday; David; guard Rusty 
LaRue, who played 14 games last season with the Bulls; rookie 
Curtis Staples, the 3-point artist from Virginia who was signed 
Thursday; Matt Steigenga, a 1992 draft pick of the Bulls, who 
played in the CBA last season; free agent Robert Werdann, who 
played CBA last year ; and Charles Jones, who played collegiately 
at Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls also officially re-signed Steve Kerr and traded him to  
San Antonio for Chuck Person and a conditional first-round pick. 
Person is expected to be waived. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd met again Friday with free agent Brent Barry, who visited  
the Berto Center Thursday, then had dinner with Floyd 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hopeful at this point,'' Floyd said. ``I know Brent does  
have options. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is weighing them. The ball is in his court, and hopefully  
it will be in our court next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd said the Bulls could bring in another couple players next  
week and add to the roster even after the season begins Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is just a lot of traffic right now through the league  
office,'' Floyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	His first practice was spent trying to acclimate the old and new  
with the complex triangle offense, created by assistant Tex Winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are seven guys who have run the triangle,'' Floyd said.  
``That will be recognized by some Bulls fans. They'll get a chance 
to see seven guys run to the right spots and three guys asking 
questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Tex is trying to give us a crash course,'' said Harper,  
appointed captain by Floyd. ``We have about five guys who know what 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the first practice was spent talking and listening.  
</P>
<P>
	``Coach Floyd is new as well, and he is at the same time  
learning the offense, even though he's had six months to learn 
it,'' Kukoc said.

<HEADLINE>  Rockets Still Work on Pippen Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Houston Rockets welcomed their latest  
superstar at their first practice in eight months. 
</P>
<P>
	Then they went home without working out and with Scottie Pippen  
still not officially a member of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	After a delay of nearly four hours in a scheduled announcement,  
Rockets owner Les Alexander called off the celebration late 
Thursday night by announcing there was a problem with the wording 
in the collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take some time.'' Alexander said.  
</P>
<P>
	Alexander stressed that the deal would be done, and Pippen  
already was getting used to his new surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to thank all the fans for being very warm to me  
around the city the little time I've been here,'' Pippen said. 
``I'm looking forward to bringing a champion here. I can see I'm 
going to have a wonderful career here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Sexton, Pippen's agent, said the problem was not with  
Pippen's five-year, $67.2 million contract. The Rockets and Pippen 
declined to define the contract problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing wrong with the contract,'' Sexton said.  
``It's just that with us getting a chance to look at the collective 
bargaining agreement so late today, we have to work through the 
night to get it corrected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have it corrected later tonight. It has nothing to do  
with the trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets must sign Pippen to put themselves over the salary  
cap before they can sign their other players. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the collective bargaining agreement, teams can  
still sign their own free agents even if they are over the salary 
cap. But if the other players signed first, they could not add 
Pippen to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Rudy Tomjanovich canceled the scheduled first practice  
that was supposed to follow the announcement of Pippen's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Bulls signed Pippen, then sent him to the Rockets  
for a second-round draft choice and forward Roy Rogers. Pippen will 
be paid $10.6 million this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets also re-signed free agent Charles Barkley for $1  
million. With typical flare, Barkley signed his contract on the 
10th tee at La Quinta, Calif., where he was playing in the Bob Hope 
Desert Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets started the day with only three players under  
contract, center Hakeem Olajuwon, guard Brent Price and second year 
guard-forward Rodrick Rhodes, who is out 6-8 weeks following 
surgery to repair a torn tendon in his right pectoral muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets called a 6 p.m. EST news conference to announce  
Pippen's signing, but delayed the announcement for one hour to 
complete the deal. That turned into a lengthy wait for the Rockets 
players, who lounged in their locker room at Westside Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, 33, had been with the Bulls since the 1987-88 season  
when he was drafted out of Central Arkansas. He averaged 19.1 
points and 5.2 rebounds last season when the Bulls won their sixth 
NBA championship of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen will form a formidable front line with Barkley and  
Olajuwon following the retirement of Clyde Drexler after last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal gives the Rockets three of the players ranked among the  
top 50 in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets are hoping for the same result as in 1995 when they  
got Drexler from the Portland Trail Blazers and won a second 
straight NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets sent Chucky Brown, Mark Bryant, Sam Cassell and  
Robert Horry to Phoenix in 1996 to bring Barkley on board, but 
another title didn't follow. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50-game schedule might be conducive to the aging Rockets,  
but the condensed time game could cause problems. Barkley is 35, 
Pippen 33, Olajuwon 36 and Eddie Johnson 39. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets have four days to get ready for the first exhibition  
game, on Tuesday against the San Antonio Spurs in Houston. Houston 
opens the regular season Feb. 5 at Los Angeles against Lakers. The 
home opener is Feb. 8 against the Denver Nuggets.

	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Houston Rockets welcomed their latest

<HEADLINE> Stocks Tumble; Dow Ends Down 143.41 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks ended lower Friday, after a rally in  
battered technology shares fizzled and blue-chip stocks came under 
selling pressure from a disappointing earnings report by IBM. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 143.41 to 9,120.67. The  
blue-chip index fell as much as 175 points in the morning before 
trimming its losses, and ended down 219.88 for the week. Friday's 
volume on New York Stock exchange totaled 947 million shares, down 
from Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index fell 5.84 to 2,338.88, and the  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index declined 9.97 to 1,225.19. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks fell sharply in early trading, extending steep  
losses logged earlier in the week. They rebounded around midday but 
ended the session mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're going to stabilize for some time,'' said  
Tom Rhinelander, an Internet analyst at Forrester Research. ``We 
still have a huge amount of speculation that's driven this 
run-up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. in  
Milwaukee, said Internet stocks could only go so low. ``If you look 
at where prices were a few weeks ago and where they are now, of 
course you have people jumping in to buy them because they think 
they are bargains.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America Online shares ended down 9/16 at 140 7/16 on the Big  
Board. In Nasdaq trading, the Web portal company Lycos lost 6 7/8 to 
110 1/8. But the bookseller Amazon.com rose 17 to 123, while portal 
company Yahoo! added 21 to 286. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM fell 17 1/4 to 179 3/4, accounting for more than 68 points of the  
Dow's losses. Although IBM's per share earnings of $2.47 beat 
analyst predictions, sales fell short. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to IBM, Dow components were led lower by American  
Express, down 4 at 98 1/2; Merck, down 7 5/16 to 139; J.P. Morgan, 
down 2 3/4 to 103 1/8; and General Electric, down 1 7/16 to 97 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer stocks declined on developments in Brazil, whose  
economic problems continued. 
</P>
<P>
	Colgate-Palmolive fell 1 13/16 to 75 1/4, and Kimberly-Clark lost 2  
1/16 to 48 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian currency, the real, ended another volatile session  
slightly weaker against the dollar, as unconfirmed buying of reals 
by the Brazil central bank appeared to contravene a week-old policy 
to let it float. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists have suggested that Brazil must refrain from selling  
its dollar reserves in an effort to boost the value of the real and 
must pass strict economic reform measures to prevent its recession 
from spreading throughout Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Worries over Brazil also battered overseas markets. In Asia,  
Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.64 percent and Hong Kong's Hang 
Seng Index fell 3.1 percent. In Europe, Germany's DAX index fell 3 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 2.7 percent, and France's CAC-40 
fell 3.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered  
advancers by a 3-to-2 margin. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 4.28 to 583.75, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.30 to 704.69. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.61 to 422.44.

<HEADLINE> In Key Area, Ruff Admits Error </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a concession forced by House prosecutors,  
White House Counsel Charles Ruff acknowledged Friday the 
president's legal team had mischaracterized evidence about alleged 
obstruction of justice in a way that favored Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff and deputy White House counsel Cheryl Mills told the Senate  
earlier this week that Clinton could not have obstructed justice in 
his Jan. 18 conversation with secretary Betty Currie because she 
was never a prospective witness in the Paula Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	But House prosecutor Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., noted Friday that  
Mrs. Jones' lawyers added Mrs. Currie to their witness list and 
subpoenaed her within 48 hours of the Monica Lewinsky controversy 
erupting in the news media on Jan. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not accurately reflect the fact that ... the Jones  
lawyers indeed issued ... a long list of subpoenas,'' Ruff told the 
Senate. ``For that misleading statement I apologize.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson also focused on another relevant fact that Mills and  
Ruff never mentioned during their presentations at Clinton's Senate 
trial -- that Clinton had a second conversation with Mrs. Currie a 
few days after the Jan. 18 discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	In both meetings, Clinton made statements such as ``you were  
always there when she (Ms. Lewinsky) was there, right?'' and 
``Monica came on to me, and I never touched her, right?'' Mrs. 
Currie testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff said in the end it did not matter because Clinton did not  
know Mrs. Currie would be called at the time of either conversation 
with his secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	House managers, however, maintained that Clinton had essentially  
identified Mrs. Currie as a potential witness during his Jan. 17 
deposition in the Jones case when he claimed that Ms. Lewinsky's 
frequent visits to the White House could be explained by her 
friendship with Mrs. Currie.

<HEADLINE> Entrepreneurs Profit From Y2K Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- If the millennium computer bug leaves  
supermarket shelves barren, cities powerless and communities in 
chaos, Roy Leonard's $2,000 Magna-Chair might come in handy. 
</P>
<P>
	He says it uses magnets to increase blood circulation -- useful  
for those too afraid to venture out into the darkness for exercise. 
And he says he can't keep them in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lubbock furniture salesman was one of dozens of  
entrepreneurs pushing preparedness Friday at one of the nation's 
first Y2K conventions. The three-day show drew hundreds of buyers 
and sellers convinced that a computer glitch could cause havoc at 
the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	Many computers originally programmed to recognize only the last  
two digits of a year won't work properly beginning Jan. 1, 2000, 
when machines will assume it is 1900. Some computers can be 
reprogrammed, but many devices have embedded microchips that must 
be physically replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	Most analysts say the problem will likely be a nuisance rather  
than a catastrophe. But few at the convention were willing to go 
unprepared. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus the need for full-body hygiene wipes, solar-powered lamps  
and gas masks -- in case martial law is declared. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're on the way to a major breakdown, in which things  
may never be the same again,'' said Jerry Gentry, who runs a 
business called Y2K Club out of his home in the east Texas town of 
Gladewater. 
</P>
<P>
	Gentry expects to sell out of his $1,290 survival kit by the end  
of the year. The kit, designed to feed four people for one year, 
includes 20 containers of organic wheat, eight containers each of 
corn and soybeans, and several water filters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel we are doing these people a service -- giving them a  
chance to buy things you can't find in a supermarket,'' Gentry 
said. ``At worst, they'll be prepared in the case of any major 
disturbance for the better part of their life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some at the convention warned that a breakdown could leave  
people spiritually needy as well as physically threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Farrar had just the book -- ``Spiritual Survival During the  
Y2K Crisis.'' The book suggests families unable to leave their 
homes should hold daily Bible studies, for example, to keep faith 
strong in shelter-like conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all the conventioneers were preaching panic.  
</P>
<P>
	James Stevens, author of ``Back to Basics,'' told attendees at  
one seminar not to buy things they will never use. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't buy anything you'll feel silly owning,'' he said. ``You  
folks are smart and want to be prepared, but don't get into a 
bunker mentality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lubbock has plenty of experience with Y2K preparedness.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, in what was called the first exercise of its kind in  
the nation, city officials staged mock disasters -- a prison riot, 
911 system problems -- to simulate worst-case scenario chaos. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who devised the so-called ``Doomsday Test'' testified  
before a congressional committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Why the Y2K obsession in Lubbock, a city of 120,000 in the  
middle of cotton country? 
</P>
<P>
	``People out here understand that it only takes one link of the  
chain to fall out to make the chain useless,'' said economist 
Michael Craft. 
</P>
<P>
	``People live by that principle out here because of agriculture.  
When the drought hits, there is a massive chain reaction not too 
dissimilar, in principle, from what some people say could happen 
with Y2K.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in rugged west Texas, people don't like the idea of not  
being ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to get caught with my pantry down,'' said  
engineer Lisa Brady, as she walked out of the convention with 
several Y2K books -- including ``Don't Get Caught With Your Pantry 
Down.''

<HEADLINE> McNabb's Stock Rises at Bowl Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- It was only last month that Donovan McNabb  
was sitting at home while three other college quarterbacks were 
invited to the Heisman Trophy presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb couldn't believe it. There were three quarterbacks better  
than him? He didn't think so. 
</P>
<P>
	So the Syracuse quarterback made it his mission to prove he  
belonged in that group. After one week of hard work, which will end 
in the Senior Bowl on Saturday, McNabb has made believers out of 
many NFL coaches and scouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Donovan McNabb has had a very good week,'' said Oakland  
Raiders coach Jon Gruden, who has coached McNabb all week on the 
North squad. ``He has answered any questions people may have had 
about his ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-3, 220-pound McNabb threw for 22 touchdowns and ran  
for eight more while leading Syracuse to the Orange Bowl this 
season. But he came to the Senior Bowl knowing people had their 
doubts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ran the option, so no one knew if I could throw the ball or  
if I could play in the pocket,'' McNabb said. ``So I came here with 
one goal in mind, to open some eyes and answer some questions about 
me. I think I did that this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't take long for a buzz to grow about McNabb. When  
Jacksonville Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin was asked who the most 
surprising player had been, he immediately said McNabb. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has had an exceptional week,'' Coughlin said. ``He showed  
he had great arm strength to go along with the mobility everyone 
knew about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh Steelers coach Bill Cowher, who drafted Kordell  
Stewart when other teams hedged on Stewart because he ran the 
option at Colorado, also thought McNabb had silenced many critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the guys who made a very wise decision when he  
decided to come play in this game because he's showed that he's a 
very promising, very good quarterback,'' Cowher said. ``He's just 
one, though, of a very good group coming out this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky's Tim Couch, who was invited to the Heisman  
presentation, is still the top available quarterback for April's 
NFL draft. But McNabb has generated enough talk that some scouts 
believe he'll be one of the next quarterbacks to go. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a high compliment considering the crop of quarterbacks at  
the Senior Bowl. McNabb is joined on the North squad by Ohio 
State's Joe Germaine, the Big Ten's most valuable player this year. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll square off Saturday against UCLA's Cade McNown, who also  
attended the Heisman presentation, Miami's Scott Covington and 
Tulane's Shaun King. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really didn't come here to show anyone up or do better than  
another player,'' McNabb said. ``I just wanted to do my best and 
bring a smile to the faces of some of these scouts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from a strong class of offensive linemen, many scouts  
believe quarterback is the second deepest position available in the 
draft. The talent level is so high at the Senior Bowl that Kansas 
State's Michael Bishop, the second highest vote-getter in Heisman 
balloting behind winner Ricky Williams, isn't even here. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's five very good quarterbacks here and seven or eight  
that aren't,'' said Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy, coach of 
the South squad. ``A lot of teams would be pleased to get any of 
them.''

<HEADLINE> Suns Focus on Getting Gugliotta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Finally, the Phoenix Suns may be able to  
concentrate on signing Tom Gugliotta once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rocky Mountain News in Denver and The Arizona Republic  
reported today that Antonio McDyess signed with the Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns, meanwhile, focused their attention on Gugliotta, who  
arrived in Phoenix late Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We met with him last night,'' coach Danny Ainge said today.  
``We're waiting on his decision. I don't know what time frame that 
is -- 24 hours, 48 hours or eight hours. I have no idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns had found it difficult to believe McDyess would leave  
them for the lowly Nuggets. But after McDyess announced his choice 
on Wednesday night, the Suns quickly regrouped and were close 
Thursday to signing Gugliotta as a consolation prize. 
</P>
<P>
	Then McDyess had second thoughts. Ainge confirmed three Suns --  
Rex Chapman, Jason Kidd and George McCloud -- flew to Denver 
Thursday to try to persuade McDyess to come back to Phoenix. The 
Rocky Mountain News reported the three were outside McNichols Arena 
in a limousine, apparently talking to McDyess by cell phone late 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	And McDyess' agent contacted the Suns on Thursday night to ask  
if they were still interested. 
</P>
<P>
	The answer was yes.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're interested to hear what led to this,'' general manager  
Bryan Colangelo said. ``It would be shortsighted not to listen to 
what Antonio has to say. Waiting one more day can't hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, apparently McDyess finally decided Denver was the right  
place after all. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns said Thursday they renounced 10 free agents, including  
McDyess, to create some of the salary cap room that would be needed 
to sign Gugliotta. But later, they said that McDyess' name was 
included erroneously and that he was not renounced. 
</P>
<P>
	That raised speculation he still was considering re-signing with  
Phoenix. McDyess showed up at McNichols Arena in Denver, where a 
news conference was planned to announce the signing, but the 
announcement was called off. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations continued in the Nuggets' locker room, and  
eventually all parties retreated to a luxury box to watch the 
Colorado-Calgary hockey game with no contract signed. McDyess was 
seen in animated conversation on his cell phone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns managed only an informal workout this morning, with  
Danny Manning the only player under an approved contract on hand. 
Luc Longley was there. He said he had signed his contract with 
Chicago on Thursday. The Bulls are to send Longley to the Suns for 
Mark Bryant, Martin Muursepp and Bubba Wells, but the deal hadn't 
been approved by the NBA as of this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will go through,'' Longley said. ``I'd have to throttle  
somebody if it didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns had been prepared to offer McDyess the maximum  
seven-year, $86 million allowed for a team to retain its free 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo said Wednesday night the team would be able to clear a  
maximum of about $8 million to offer a free agent such as 
Gugliotta. That's short of the $9 million maximum allowed under the 
new collective bargaining agreement, but the figures were close 
enough that it wouldn't be a problem, a source close to the 
situation said. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-year contract worth about $60 million would contain a  
clause allowing Gugliotta out of the deal after five years, when he 
would be eligible for a much bigger raise as a 10-year veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta averaged 20.1 points for the Timberwolves last season,  
but missed 41 games after foot surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	He could have made $86 million over seven years by re-signing  
with Minnesota, but has indicated all along that the money would 
not prevent him from signing with a team that he felt was the right 
fit for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta, 29, played four seasons in Minnesota after two  
seasons with the Washington Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns did not renounce Clifford Robinson or Chapman.  
Robinson's agent, Brad Marshall, told Phoenix radio station KATR 
Thursday that Robinson reached a five-year, $30 million contract 
agreement, but wouldn't confirm that when the McDyess situation 
developed later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Chapman's agent, David Falk, who represents nine other free  
agents, was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns renounced the rights to McCloud, Kevin Johnson, George  
McCloud, Mike Brown, Horacio Llamas, Loren Meyer, Marko Milic, 
Dennis Scott, Wayman Tisdale and Hot Rod Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is gone for sure and Tisdale is retired from the NBA,  
but still has money charged to Phoenix's salary cap. The NBA has 
eliminated the 56-day waiting period to re-sign renounced free 
agents, meaning the Suns might be able to able to re-sign some of 
its renounced players, including McCloud.

<HEADLINE> Richard Holbrooke Denies Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Richard Holbrooke, President Clinton's choice  
to be ambassador to the United Nations, today denied violating 
anti-lobbying laws while he was out of government. 
</P>
<P>
	``The so-called contacts I had in three years since I left the  
State Department with government officials have all been in my 
capacity as a senior adviser official to the secretary of state,'' 
Holbrooke said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any contacts I had -- any contacts I had -- were under that hat  
and did not violate any laws,'' added Holbrooke, now service as 
Clinton's special envoy to the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	Interviewed on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' Holbrooke  
acknowledged that his lawyer has been discussing the case with the 
Justice Department but declined further comment on the issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department is seeking a civil fine from Holbrooke as  
a result of a contact with U.S. Ambassador James Laney in South 
Korea while Holbrooke was a government consultant meeting Asian 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The department contends the meeting with Laney was improper  
under ethics laws that limit lobbying contacts that former 
officials may have for a period of time after leaving the 
government. The meeting came shortly after Holbrooke had quit as 
assistant secretary of state to work for the investment banking 
firm of Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Another former State Department official, Winston Lord, said  
Thursday that he had asked Holbrooke while on a mission for Credit 
Suisse to visit foreign officials, explain U.S. policy and report 
back his impressions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course he contacted Ambassador Laney,'' Lord said. ``It  
would have been ridiculous if he hadn't. It would have been rude, 
inappropriate and would have undercut the ambassador. I would have 
called him up and yelled at him if he hadn't contacted the 
ambassador.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lord said he and Holbrooke did not discuss business, but only  
U.S. policies in Asia and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of the contact with Laney arose while the FBI was  
investigating Holbrooke's background after Clinton announced seven 
months ago that he planned to nominate him to the U.N. job. The 
dispute has held up formal submission of the nomination to the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am confident this will be resolved shortly and I look  
forward to going before the Senate for what I'm sure will be a 
tough but fair confirmation process,'' Holbrooke said today. ``I 
hope to serve soon at the U.N. But that will be up to the United 
States Senate.''

<HEADLINE> Lycos Resumes Effort To Sell Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lycos Inc., a leading Internet destination, has  
stepped up an effort to sell part of itself now that a main rival, 
Excite Inc., is getting bought by At Home Corp., an industry 
analyst said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos this week resumed a search for a partner willing to buy up  
to a 20 percent stake, said Alan Braverman, an Internet analyst 
with Deutsche Bank Securities who is familiar with the Lycos 
effort. The stake would be worth about $900 million at Thursday's 
stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiative began last summer when Lycos' largest investor,  
David Wetherell, sought to sell a chunk of his 30 percent stake to 
a media or telecommunications company. 
</P>
<P>
	Excite, another popular Web destination, agreed Tuesday to be  
acquired by At Home, a high-speed Internet service aimed at cable 
television subscribers, for more than $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Excite's agreement to be acquired by At Home has intensified a  
rush by Lycos and others to seek partners in the rapidly 
consolidating Internet industry. 
</P>
<P>
	One potential bidder, Braverman said, is German publisher  
Bertelsmann, which has a joint venture with Lycos in Europe. Other 
likely suitors include U.S. media companies like Time Warner, News 
Corp. or Viacom, or a cable or telephone company. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're all circling, realizing the power of the Internet,''  
Braverman said. ``Lycos is extremely well-positioned to be a great 
partner for any of these folks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Lycos, based in Waltham, Mass., declined to  
comment beyond a statement by chief executive Robert Davis, who 
said Lycos is ``an independent company committed to continuing our 
rapid growth and expanding our broad-based consumer offering.'' 
Davis was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	But another company executive, Eric Gerritsen, was quoted by the  
Financial Times Thursday as saying Lycos was holding ``informal 
discussions'' with media and telecommunications companies about 
taking the 20 percent stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos stock jumped 12 percent, or $12.18 3/4, to $117 on the Nasdaq  
Stock Market.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- An armed gang stole $2.9 million from a  
bank in southeastern Brazil on Friday after holding bank employees 
and their families hostage for 12 hours, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 15 men seized five bank workers when they left work  
Thursday in Ribeirao Preto, 200 miles northwest of Sao Paulo, 
police investigator Darci Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the gang took the hostages at a country house, while the  
others kidnapped 10 of their family members, said Gonzalez. All 
were held overnight at the country house. 
</P>

	On Friday morning, they took the staff back to the bank and  
forced them to open the vaults. The robbers then fled.

	CANCUN, Mexico (AP) -- Colombia expects to produce 830,000 to  
860,000 barrels of oil a day this year, up about 10 percent from 
last year, Mines and Energy Minister Luis Carlos Valenzuela said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports will grow to 450,000 to 500,000 barrels a day, with  
output for domestic consumption holding steady at about 350,000 
barrels a day, Valenzuela told reporters at the Santander 
Investment Latin American Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The increased output will have little impact on global oil  
prices because Colombia is a marginal producer, Valenzuela said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first 10 months of last year, Colombian production  
averaged 735,526 barrels a day. In an effort to encourage more 
exploration, the government plans to send to Congress in March a 
proposal to modify royalties, Valenzuela said.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Move Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly  
higher early today on the Chicago Board of Trade on hopes for new 
export business. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants were hoping weekend export business would  
materialize, and held out hope that exports to beleaguered Russia 
would begin soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybean futures prices remained under pressure,  
however, on concerns about the state of Brazil's economy. That 
country's currency, the real, continues to fall against the U.S. 
dollar after it was devalued last week. The weaker real could 
prompt more export sales from Brazil as people seek to get hard 
currency from dollar-based commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery rose 3 1/4 cents to $2.71 1/4 a bushel; March  
corn rose 3/4 cent to $2.16 3/4 a bushel; March oats rose 3/4 cent to 
$1.08 a bushel; March soybeans fell 3/4 cent to $5.29 3/4 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Energy Dept. To Review Plutonium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department plans to review a  
private study that claims using a plutonium-based fuel in civilian 
reactors poses greater safety risks than previously acknowledged, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	But a department spokesman said a summary of the Nuclear Control  
Institute study suggests some flaws. ``We do take issue with many 
of the basic assumptions,'' spokesman Matthew Donoghue said. 
</P>
<P>
	The institute, a private watchdog group that specializes in  
nuclear proliferation issues, opposes an Energy Department plan to 
process 36 tons of weapons-grade plutonium into a mixed oxide, or 
MOX, and burning that fuel in civilian power reactors. It objects 
to mixing military and civilian nuclear programs because of 
proliferation concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The department is expected next month to issue a contract to a  
consortium -- including two electric utilities -- for processing and 
burning MOX fuel at six reactors in South Carolina, North Carolina 
and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCI study claims the department has severely underestimated  
the number of potential cancer deaths that would occur should there 
be a major release of radiation from reactors using the MOX fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the government's own calculations, Edwin Lyman, an energy  
physicist and the study's author, concluded nearly twice as many 
cancer deaths could occur from a severe accident using MOX fuel 
than if conventional uranium were in use. That could mean 1,430 to 
6,165 additional eventual cancer deaths as a result of exposure 
during the first week after an accident, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyman said the fuel, processed from plutonium, would release a  
much larger burst of highly radioactive and toxic materials known 
as actinides -- including plutonium, americium, cesium and curium -- 
than the low-enriched uranium fuel that normally is used. 
</P>
<P>
	These conclusions conflict sharply with the findings of the  
Energy Department. In a draft environmental impact analysis, the 
agency concluded that even a severe accident would cause at most 8 
percent more -- and possibly fewer -- cancer deaths. That compares 
with the 27 percent to 96 percent increase calculated by Lyman. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyman argues that the department study assumed an  
unrealistically low release of actinides and use of an 
advanced-design reactor not yet built instead of reactors that 
actually would be used. ``They didn't ask the hard questions,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The department on Friday stood by its calculations, although  
Donoghue, the spokesman, said the NCI study would be closely 
examined once the full report is received. Lyman made public only a 
summary, saying the report was being peer-reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	The consortium expected to be given the Energy Department  
contract consists of two utilities -- Duke Power Co. and Virginia 
Power Co. -- and the French nuclear fuel manufacturer Cogema. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the MOX program is safe,'' said Joe Maher, a  
spokesman for Duke Power, based in Charlotte, N.C. He noted the 
National Academy of Sciences has endorsed such disposal of 
plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Zuercher, a spokesman for Virginia Power, said the  
utility has been assured that use of MOX fuel would ``pose no added 
risk to the employees or the public, and that's a safe thing to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Leventhal, the NCI's president, acknowledged that Lyman's  
findings assume the severest of nuclear accidents -- one in which 
the reactor's steel and concrete containment dome is breached and 
allows radiation to stream into the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Such an accident, he said, would be ``highly improbable,'' but  
must still be taken seriously by federal regulators weighing public 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
	In America's worst nuclear accident, at Pennsylvania's Three  
Mile Island power plant in 1979, the containment vessel remained 
intact. The world's worst civilian nuclear accident at Chernobyl 
involved a reactor without a containment dome. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke Power has said it would use two reactors at the McGuire  
plant south of Charlotte, N.C., and two reactors at Catawba plant 
near Rock Hill, S.C. Virginia Power plans to use its two reactors 
at the North Anna plant near Mineral, Va. Cogema would process 
plutonium into MOX fuel at a yet-to-be-built facility at DOE's 
Savannah River complex near Aiken, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The first MOX fuel shipments likely would not be produced until  
2007.

<HEADLINE>  Davis Wants Proper Elway Sendoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Last year, the ring was the thing.  
</P>
<P>
	With quarterback John Elway in the twilight of his career,  
running back Terrell Davis and his Denver teammates desperately 
wanted to get Elway a Super Bowl ring that had eluded him in three 
previous attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, it's a proper goodbye. With Elway almost certainly in  
the final season of a brilliant 16-year career, the Broncos are 
using Elway's departure as motivation to send him off with another 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are going to ride that thing this year,'' Davis  
said. ``Last year, we wanted him to get a ring. I think he's going 
to leave this year, and we really want to send him out on a high 
note.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was mainly responsible for Elway's ring, rushing for 157  
yards and three touchdowns in the Broncos' 31-24 victory over Green 
Bay, a performance that earned him Super Bowl MVP honors. 
</P>
<P>
	For several anxious moments, however, the Broncos were without  
the services of their star running back. Davis neglected to take 
his migraine headache medicine and suffered a blinding migraine 
that sidelined him almost the entire second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to emergency treatment on the sideline, he was able to  
return for the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	If, on Super Bowl Sunday in Miami, Davis suddenly sees stars,  
has blurred vision and experiences a searing pain in his head, he 
wants it to be from a hard tackle -- not from another migraine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will make sure it won't happen again,'' Davis said Thursday  
with a sheepish grin. ``I already have a reminder. I will have this 
big sign and put it on my locker. That's the first thing I'm going 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, plagued by migraines since he was a teen-ager, has  
experienced relief from the debilitating symptoms in recent years, 
provided he follows his doctors' orders. In fact, he has proved to 
be much more of a headache for opposing defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	During the regular season, the fourth-year pro rushed for 2,008  
yards, becoming only the fourth player in NFL history to reach the 
2,000-yard plateau, and was named the league's MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	He has topped 100 yards rushing in six straight postseason  
games, including 199 and 167 yards this postseason, the latter 
coming in last week's 23-10 victory over the New York Jets in the 
AFC championship game to advance the Broncos to the Super Bowl on 
Jan. 31 against the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	In four postseason games last season, he rushed for 581 yards,  
and playoff statistics are numbers he cherishes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping for a lot of postseason numbers because people tend  
to measure you by that,'' he said. ``Eric (Dickerson) was the 
greatest back to play the game, but as far as his postseason 
numbers, they're not really up there. That's one thing I'm trying 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``You look at Emmitt Smith, he's really been put in front of a  
lot of running backs because of the championships he's won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's small but mobile offensive line received much of the  
credit for the Broncos' offensive success in 1997, but Davis 
believes this year's revamped line -- with two new starters and a 
third player moving to a different position -- is actually better 
than last year's. 
</P>
<P>
	Since last year, Pro Bowl left tackle Gary Zimmerman retired,  
and right guard Brian Habib signed a free-agent contract with 
Seattle. Then, in the preseason, David Diaz-Infante, who was 
projected to be Habib's replacement, injured his knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Right tackle Tony Jones moved to Zimmerman's vacated spot on the  
left side, second-year pro Dan Neil became the starting right 
guard, and veteran Harry Swayne became the starter at right tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this line is definitely better,'' Davis said. ``We had  
some people move in and change positions, but the continuity has 
been there the entire year. Losing Zim and switching Tony over to 
left tackle, you would think we would lose something. But I think 
Tony is a better left tackle than he is a right tackle, and Harry 
came in and played great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones and center Tom Nalen both are headed to the Pro Bowl.

<HEADLINE> 43 Dead in Indonesian Rioting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Thousands of police and soldiers today  
patrolled three remote Indonesian islands where religious rioting 
this week claimed 43 lives and forced thousands of people to flee 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	A curfew was in place to prevent fighting between gangs of  
Christians and Muslims that had ebbed on Ambon, Sanana and Seram 
islands, known in Dutch colonial times as the Spice Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	The islands in eastern Maluku province are the latest site of  
rioting that has plagued Indonesia in the past year. Fresh violence 
was reported today in some neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Wary residents in the provincial capital of Ambon guarded their  
homes today with knives and swords amid reports that gangs of armed 
men were roaming the streets. Gangs of youths brawled on the 
outskirts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said 20,600 villagers who fled the unrest had taken  
shelter in army bases and police stations, where officers gave out 
food and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	In a show of solidarity, Christian youths guarded mosques while  
Muslims inside held midday prayers, the official Antara news agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation is under control now,'' President B.J. Habibie  
said in Jakarta. ``Community leaders in Ambon have agreed to urge 
their followers of the two religions to forgive and forget each 
other for what has happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Karyono S., the provincial police chief, said 19 bodies  
were found today in the village of Batubulang on the outskirts of 
Ambon city, raising the death toll to 43. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the victims were Muslim and police feared more victims  
were buried under the rubble of damaged buildings. Seven mosques, 
nine churches and 189 houses were burned in the violence that 
started Tuesday, Karyono said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia's military commander, Gen. Wiranto, flew to Ambon  
island to assess the situation and distribute 10 tons of rice as 
well as noodles and medicine. Many shops were closed and residents 
walked for several miles to find basic food items. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of about 45 foreigners, mainly American and British  
Christian missionaries, were evacuated by charter plane from Ambon 
to Darwin in neighboring Australia on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambon is 1,400 miles northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian  
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of those who were killed were stabbed, beaten or trapped in  
burning buildings. Some were attacked with rocks, machetes, clubs 
and even bows and arrows. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence was the latest in a series of clashes to hit  
Indonesia as it grapples with its worst economic crisis in three 
decades. Soaring inflation, unemployment and poverty rates have all 
fanned social tensions ahead of general elections scheduled for 
June 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil unrest in this sprawling Southeast Asian nation has  
escalated since student protests and riots forced ex-President 
Suharto to quit last May.

<HEADLINE> Court To Study Voting-Rights Case </HEADLINE>

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court set the stage Friday for a  
voter-rights ruling that will help determine how easy or difficult 
it will be for the federal government to reject election law 
changes detrimental to racial minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices agreed to resolve a dispute over how a Louisiana  
school board's members are elected. Their decision, expected by 
late June, will affect all states and counties covered by the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965.

	The school board in Bossier Parish, La., for years has had one  
member elected to a four-year term from each of 12 districts. About 
20 percent of the parish's population is black, and none of the 12 
districts has a black majority. 
</P>
<P>
	As of 1990, no black ever had been elected to the school board.  
After the 1990 census required a redrawing of the school board 
election map, the local NAACP chapter proposed creating two 
black-majority districts. 
</P>
<P>
	The school board opted instead for a new map in 1992 with no  
such district, the same map that had been adopted by the parish's 
chief governing body, called the police jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the police jury's plan had received the Justice  
Department's approval required by the 1965 law, the school board's 
proposed redistricting plan did not. Justice Department lawyers 
decided that the plan would dilute minorities' voting strength. 
</P>
<P>
	A legal battle ensued, and in 1997 the Supreme Court used the  
Bossier Parish case to make it harder for the Justice Department to 
withhold approval of proposed election changes . 
</P>
<P>
	The Voting Rights Act's Section 5 allows the federal government  
to veto proposed changes if they are deemed to have a 
discriminatory ``purpose or effect.'' The Act's Section 2 is more 
stringent, and prohibits any voting practice that would dilute the 
political clout of racial minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	In its 1997 decision, the nation's highest court said Justice  
Department lawyers cannot refuse to approve a proposal under 
Section 5 by deciding that the change would violate Section 2. The 
court said a proposed change has a prohibited ``effect'' only if it 
left minority voters worse off than they are under a current plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices then sent the case back to a three-judge federal  
court in Louisiana so it could decide whether federal approval can 
be withheld for a discriminatory ``purpose'' other than leaving 
minority voters worse off. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-judge court in Louisiana ruled last May that no  
retrogressive purpose had been proved and refused to consider any 
other purported purpose. It approved the 1992 redistricting plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers say the Bossier Parish school board  
has been allowed ``to entrench a status quo that denies black 
citizens ... an equal opportunity to elect representatives of their 
choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The current election system is being allowed to ``hinder  
improvement in the political position of blacks ... because the 
record did not demonstrate that the board intended to make the 
position of blacks worse than before,'' the government appeal said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ship Sinking in 1918 Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Formerly classified Russian documents show  
that a bomb planted by a German spy, not a mine, sank the U.S.S. 
San Diego off Long Island, N.Y., in 1918, a University of North 
Carolina historian said. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than 80 years, no one has known for certain what sank  
the 503-foot battle cruiser 11 miles off the Long Island coast on 
July 19, 1918, as it steamed toward Europe during World War I. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the 1,114 sailors aboard died.  
</P>
<P>
	Russell Van Wyk, a lecturer in history at UNC-Chapel Hill, said  
Thursday that records obtained through the Moscow State Institute 
of International Relations revealed German agent Kurt Jahnke 
planted a bomb in the San Diego's boiler room. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until now, the U.S. Navy wasn't certain whether a boiler  
exploded and sank the ship by accident, whether it hit a mine or 
whether a bomb was aboard,'' Van Wyk said. 
</P>
<P>
	Raymond Mann, a historian at the Naval Historical Center in  
Washington, D.C., and editor of the Dictionary of American Fighting 
Ships, said Thursday that Van Wyk's findings appeared ``extremely 
apocryphal,'' although he had not seen them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty generally accepted wisdom around here that it was  
a mine laid by U-156 that got her,'' he said. U-156 was a German 
U-boat that is believed to have laid a minefield in the area where 
the San Diego went down. 
</P>
<P>
	Mann questioned whether a saboteur could smuggle aboard a bomb  
big enough to sink a battle cruiser, and he was skeptical about the 
Russian documents' validity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians captured Jahnke, who spied for Germany through the  
1930s, and his wife at their home in Germany in 1945 and turned 
them over to the Soviet counterespionage organization Smersh, which 
means ``Death to Spies,'' said Van Wyk. He said they were 
interrogated, tortured and executed. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Wyk learned three years ago that Russian documents existed  
containing Jahnke's purported admissions to his interrogators. He 
examined them at the Moscow State Institute. Van Wyk said his 
friendship with former KGB Vice General Sergei Kondrashev through a 
student exchange program gave him access denied others. 
</P>
<P>
	Captured German documents mingled with the Russian material  
helped convince him of the material's authenticity, Van Wyk said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jahnke was the central figure, the operational mastermind, of  
German efforts to sabotage the United States' effort during World 
War I,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jahnke was awarded Germany's Iron Cross 2nd Class in 1919 for  
his espionage work, and remained a German spy for another two 
decades, Van Wyk said.

<HEADLINE> Indians Sign Pitcher Ron Villone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Indians avoided salary arbitration with  
left-hander Ron Villone, agreeing Friday to a one-year contract 
worth $462,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Villone, who had a 6.00 ERA last year in 25 games for the  
Indians, was seeking $500,000, more than double his $240,000 salary 
last year. The Indians had offered $425,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians haven't had a player go to an arbitration hearing  
since 1991, when both Greg Swindell and Jerry Browne had their 
cases heard. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Villone walked 22 and allowed 30 hits in just 27  
innings. He was 2-2 with a 2.01 ERA with seven saves at Triple-A 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	Villone has pitched well in Puerto Rico this winter, going 1-0  
with a save and a 1.86 ERA in his first six outings.

<HEADLINE>  Davis Wants Proper Elway Sendoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Last year, the ring was the thing.  
</P>
<P>
	With quarterback John Elway in the twilight of his career,  
running back Terrell Davis and his Denver teammates desperately 
wanted to get Elway a Super Bowl ring that had eluded him in three 
previous attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, it's a proper goodbye. With Elway almost certainly in  
the final season of a brilliant 16-year career, the Broncos are 
using Elway's departure as motivation to send him off with another 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are going to ride that thing this year,'' Davis  
said. ``Last year, we wanted him to get a ring. I think he's going 
to leave this year, and we really want to send him out on a high 
note.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was mainly responsible for Elway's ring, rushing for 157  
yards and three touchdowns in the Broncos' 31-24 victory over Green 
Bay, a performance that earned him Super Bowl MVP honors. 
</P>
<P>
	For several anxious moments, however, the Broncos were without  
the services of their star running back. Davis neglected to take 
his migraine headache medicine and suffered a blinding migraine 
that sidelined him almost the entire second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to emergency treatment on the sideline, he was able to  
return for the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	If, on Super Bowl Sunday in Miami, Davis suddenly sees stars,  
has blurred vision and experiences a searing pain in his head, he 
wants it to be from a hard tackle -- not from another migraine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will make sure it won't happen again,'' Davis said Thursday  
with a sheepish grin. ``I already have a reminder. I will have this 
big sign and put it on my locker. That's the first thing I'm going 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, plagued by migraines since he was a teen-ager, has  
experienced relief from the debilitating symptoms in recent years, 
provided he follows his doctors' orders. In fact, he has proved to 
be much more of a headache for opposing defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	During the regular season, the fourth-year pro rushed for 2,008  
yards, becoming only the fourth player in NFL history to reach the 
2,000-yard plateau, and was named the league's MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	He has topped 100 yards rushing in six straight postseason  
games, including 199 and 167 yards this postseason, the latter 
coming in last week's 23-10 victory over the New York Jets in the 
AFC championship game to advance the Broncos to the Super Bowl on 
Jan. 31 against the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	In four postseason games last season, he rushed for 581 yards,  
and playoff statistics are numbers he cherishes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping for a lot of postseason numbers because people tend  
to measure you by that,'' he said. ``Eric (Dickerson) was the 
greatest back to play the game, but as far as his postseason 
numbers, they're not really up there. That's one thing I'm trying 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``You look at Emmitt Smith, he's really been put in front of a  
lot of running backs because of the championships he's won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's small but mobile offensive line received much of the  
credit for the Broncos' offensive success in 1997, but Davis 
believes this year's revamped line -- with two new starters and a 
third player moving to a different position -- is actually better 
than last year's. 
</P>
<P>
	Since last year, Pro Bowl left tackle Gary Zimmerman retired,  
and right guard Brian Habib signed a free-agent contract with 
Seattle. Then, in the preseason, David Diaz-Infante, who was 
projected to be Habib's replacement, injured his knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Right tackle Tony Jones moved to Zimmerman's vacated spot on the  
left side, second-year pro Dan Neil became the starting right 
guard, and veteran Harry Swayne became the starter at right tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this line is definitely better,'' Davis said. ``We had  
some people move in and change positions, but the continuity has 
been there the entire year. Losing Zim and switching Tony over to 
left tackle, you would think we would lose something. But I think 
Tony is a better left tackle than he is a right tackle, and Harry 
came in and played great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones and center Tom Nalen both are headed to the Pro Bowl.

<HEADLINE> RNC Picks Philly for Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans will return to Philadelphia to  
pick their candidate for the first president of the 21st century, a 
symbol not lost on them as they pledged to reclaim the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican National Committee unanimously decided Friday to  
hold next year's presidential nominating convention in 
Philadelphia, where the party chose its first presidential 
candidate 143 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia Mayor Edward G. Rendell, one of the few Democrats  
in attendance, promised not to disappoint his political rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you could have picked a better spot than the  
place where our nation's history began,'' Rendell said, sporting a 
tie with the GOP's elephant symbol. 
</P>
<P>
	He later presented Republicans with a 6-foot-long Philadelphia  
cheese steak, made with 35 pounds of meat, six pounds of Cheese 
Whiz and 10 pounds of onions. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have narrowed their convention site choices to Los  
Angeles, Boston or Denver. Party officials have identified Los 
Angeles as the leading candidate. An announcement is expected by 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The right to serve as host of the Republican convention is worth  
hundreds of millions of dollars in business to a city that flirted 
with bankruptcy in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	For Republicans, it was a chance to claim a battleground state  
that has picked presidential winners since 1972. Pennsylvania has 
23 electoral votes, one-twelfth of the number needed to win the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine a better place for the next president of the  
United States to be captured at the end of the convention in front 
of the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall,'' said Jan Larimer, head 
of the convention site-selection committee. ``What a great way to 
start the next century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 165 members of the RNC approved the advisory panel's  
recommendation on a voice vote. Delegates cheered as RNC Chairman 
Jim Nicholson declared, ``We are going to Philadelphia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 GOP convention was held in San Diego, which welcomed  
Republicans with beachfront hotels and warm weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia has been the site of eight political conventions,  
including the first Republican convention in 1856, which nominated 
John C. Fremont. The city last served as a convention host in 1948 
when both Republicans and Democrats met there to nominate Thomas 
Dewey and Harry S. Truman.

<HEADLINE> Gun Group Moves Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A gun group that would have brought 30,000  
people to New Orleans has decided to hold its convention elsewhere 
next year because of the city's lawsuit against the nation's 
gunmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Shooting Sports Foundation began notifying hotels  
Thursday that SHOT, its Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Tradeshow, 
will not come to New Orleans in January 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Foundation officials declined to elaborate on the decision, but  
city tourism officials said the group warned them in November that 
it might pull out because many of its members include gun companies 
New Orleans is suing. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, New Orleans sued 15 leading gun makers, alleging  
they knew ``the unreasonable dangers of their guns'' and failed to 
provide safety devices, warnings and other measures which would 
prevent and decrease these dangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago filed a similar suit the following month and Miami's  
county commissioners voted Thursday to do the same. Los Angeles and 
San Francisco are also looking into the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't allow the safety of children to be traded off for a  
single convention, no matter how big the convention is, because 
it's trading money for principle,'' Mayor Marc Morial. 
</P>
<P>
	The convention hadn't come to New Orleans for six years because  
the city's convention center was too small, but an expansion that 
opened this month made enough space. The meeting would have filled 
all 1.1 million square feet of the Ernest N. Morial Convention 
Center, making it one of the city's biggest conventions. 
</P>
<P>
	The group is scheduled to come to New Orleans six more times in  
the next 20 years, and it was unclear Friday whether the group 
plans to cancel those meetings as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Morial also questioned whether the foundation had really  
committed to coming to New Orleans in January, or whether it was 
using the lawsuit controversy to negotiate a better deal in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Morial said the group hadn't signed a contract with the center,  
but tourism officials said there was a commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obvious it's a pretty difficult situation,'' said Phil  
Franco, president of the New Orleans Metropolitan Convention and 
Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	SHOT is the largest firearms convention in the world. Attendees  
were expected to spend about $145 million overall in the city.

<HEADLINE> Flu Victims Pack New York Hospitals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With a bone-rattling cough and a deep sniff, the  
flu virus made its presence known in the metropolitan area this 
week as hundreds of people flooded hospital emergency rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta  
confirmed the nation was having a mild flu season, except in the 
New York City area, where there was a widespread influenza 
outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospitals throughout the city were reporting cases of the flu or  
respiratory viruses with flu-like symptoms, which ranged from 
headaches to muscle aches and head colds to high fevers. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are seeing right now is patients backed up and a lot  
of overtime for our staffs,'' said Kenneth Raske, president of the 
Greater New York Hospital Association. ``We have some of the 
highest occupancy rates under normal circumstances, and now we're 
bumping up against the ceiling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elderly, the very young and those with other illnesses, such  
as diabetes and heart problems, were particularly at risk and 
accounted for the majority of people going to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	``My whole family had the flu for 10 days. I had it last week.  
Before that it was my 3-year-old baby, and she got it from my 
8-year-old daughter,'' said Vijaya Tathineni, who says she caught 
the flu while dispensing prescriptions to customers at a Duane Reed 
pharmacy in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency room waiting times for non-life threatening cases  
varied from 90 minutes to five hours at some hospital emergency 
rooms, and the waiting time to be admitted was ranging between 12 
and 24 hours at some hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's systems overload,'' said Dr. Barbara Richardson, director  
of Mount Sinai Medical Center's emergency department. 
</P>
<P>
	At one time or another this week, six hospitals in the northern  
suburbs have asked dispatchers and ambulance companies to send 
non-critical emergency patients elsewhere if possible because 
emergency rooms were so full of patients with flu-like illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	State Health Department spokeswoman Claire Pospisil said the  
state had granted hospitals emergency approval to add beds if 
needed.

<HEADLINE> Helms Sets Arms Treaty 'Deadline' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., says he will put a  
freeze on treaties the administration wants unless the White House 
submits proposed modifications in the nuclear arms treaty by June. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will consider all of (the treaties) or we will consider  
none of them,'' Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, told a conference of conservative activists on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms wants amendments to the 27-year-old Anti-Ballistic Missile  
Treaty brought to the floor, predicting that the Republican Senate 
would then vote to pull the United States out of the entire treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Among treaties that could become stalled if a standoff develops  
between Helms and the White House is the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear 
Test Ban Treaty, a top administration priority. 
</P>
<P>
	The modifications in the ABM treaty were agreed to by President  
Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin but have not been sent 
to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms and other conservatives consider the pact dead anyway,  
because the Soviet Union with whom it was negotiated no longer 
exists. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms told the Conservative Political Action Conference that the  
entire pact belongs ``in the dustbin of history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty is standing in the way of proceeding on a GOP plan to  
establish a national missile defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a system is prohibited by terms of the existing ABM treaty  
-- and the administration contends that Moscow would have to agree 
to any move by the United States to set up such a system. 
</P>
<P>
	``I say baloney,'' Helms said to renegotiating the treaty with  
the Russians. ``Not on my watch, Mr. President.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helms also demanded the administration submit another treaty  
likely to be rejected: a 1997 environmental pact signed by the 
United States and 37 other industrial nations in Kyoto, Japan, to 
limit gases that contribute to global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms, who is known for holding up measures and nominations,  
opposes that treaty, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Helms single-handedly blocked the nomination of former  
Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, a fellow Republican, to be 
ambassador to Mexico by refusing to hold hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	If that earned him the nickname ``Senator No,'' so be it, Helms  
told the standing-room-only audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saying no is part of the job of being chairman of the Senate  
Foreign Relations Committee,'' he said, ``and I plan to say `no' to 
a few more things this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Helms said he would not criticize recent steps taken by the  
administration to permit more humanitarian aid to reach Cuba, even 
though he strongly supports a continuation of a trade embargo 
against Fidel Castro's regime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll (also) go along with letting the Baltimore Orioles play  
exhibition games against the Cuban national team -- but on one 
condition,'' Helms said. ``I want the Cuban national team to come 
to Baltimore to play the Orioles first and then the Orioles can go 
to Havana. Because when the O's get to Cuba, there will be no one 
to play them.''

<HEADLINE> Newlywed Wins First World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. (AP) -- Newlywed Steve Roxberg of  
Lakeville, Minn., flipped and twisted his way to his first World 
Cup acro skiing victory Friday night despite a steady rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sure is nice. It's been a long time,'' he said after  
receiving 26.40 points from the judges to 26.25 for Antti Inberg of 
Finland on the first night of the Sprint Grand National World Cup 
at Heavenly resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Roxberg led three Americans into the eight-man finals. Ian  
Edmondson of Birmingham, Mich., was fourth with Steve Saulnier of 
Arlington, Mass., sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little surprised I got it,'' Roxberg said, ``but I knew  
on the first day I tried it that if I skied my best, I could win a 
World Cup one day. And here, 11 years later, here it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roxberg, 28, married former British acro-skier Vickie Simpson  
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we got engaged two years ago in Tignes (France), I got  
second the next day and that was my best until now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, does he recommend a round of marriage for everyone? ``That's  
their decision,'' he said, laughing. ``It's worked for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's contest, Elena Batalova, who has won the last  
three World Cup acro titles, led a podium sweep by Russian skiers. 
She had 26.45 points with Oksana Kushenko second (26.30) and 
Natalia Razumovskaya third (25.65). Lara Rosenbaum of Portsmouth, 
R.I., battling the flu all week, was the top American, finishing 
seventh.

<HEADLINE>  43 Dead in Indonesian Rioting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Thousands of police and soldiers today  
patrolled three remote Indonesian islands where religious rioting 
this week claimed 43 lives and forced thousands of people to flee 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	A curfew was in place to prevent fighting between gangs of  
Christians and Muslims that had ebbed on Ambon, Sanana and Seram 
islands, known in Dutch colonial times as the Spice Islands. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  43 Dead in Indonesian Rioting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Thousands of police and soldiers today  
patrolled three remote Indonesian islands where religious rioting 
this week claimed 43 lives and forced thousands of people to flee 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	A curfew was in place to prevent fighting between gangs of  
Christians and Muslims that had ebbed on Ambon, Sanana and Seram 
islands, known in Dutch colonial times as the Spice Islands.

<HEADLINE> Man Executed for Double Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A man was executed by injection Friday for  
shooting to death his adoptive father and a 13-year-old neighbor 
while on parole for killing his brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Atkins, 51, was the sixth inmate executed in the past  
seven weeks in South Carolina. Atkins offered no final statement, 
and no relatives attended. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyers suggested Atkins, a veteran, was having a flashback  
to the Vietnam War during the 1985 killings in North Charleston, 
but his clemency plea was denied by Gov. Jim Hodges. 
</P>
<P>
	Atkins, who lived with his father, was angry with his next-door  
neighbors, according to trial testimony. He got drunk and broke 
into their house armed with a machete, a shotgun and a revolver. 
</P>
<P>
	He shot Karen Patterson with the sawed-off shotgun while she was  
in bed. Then he chased her mother back to his house where he shot 
Benjamin Frank Atkins, 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years earlier, the older Atkins had convinced parole  
officials to release his son from prison. Atkins served 10 years of 
a life sentence for killing his 23-year-old brother, Charles.

<HEADLINE> Woman Freed After 20 Yrs. for Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Jimmy Carter was president and disco was king  
when JeDonna Young got no mercy from an unforgiving Michigan drug 
law: life behind bars and no parole for getting caught with 3 
pounds of heroin she insisted belonged to her boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, just a day after taking her case to the state's  
parole board, the 44-year-old mother learned she would be released, 
making her the first person freed under changes to the law that 
allows parole for lifers after 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``My client couldn't believe her ears,'' said her attorney,  
Stuart Friedman. ``She's had so many false starts over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now she's scared -- it's been 21 years, and the world's  
changed. She's going out there and putting together the pieces and 
restarting her life. It's going to take a lot to get adjusted to 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Young was driving with her boyfriend, James Gulley, in 1978  
when Detroit police stopped her car and found the heroin. Gulley 
said it was his; Ms. Young said she didn't know it was there. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were convicted under a 1978 law that was intended to put  
drug lords in prison for life. Gulley died in prison last year. 
</P>
<P>
	An appeals court reluctantly upheld Ms. Young's conviction in  
1989 but said it was unconvinced she was the kind of drug dealer 
the law was designed for. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the state Legislature amended the lifer law to allow  
parole after 20 years. The change took effect Oct. 1, allowing 
convicts to become eligible after 15 years if they cooperated with 
police and did not have prior felony convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	At her parole hearing Thursday, Ms. Young, who has a 27-year-old  
son, said she hoped for the best. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until I actually walk out the door, that's when I'll believe  
it,'' she said. ``I pray all the time. That's what got me through 
it. It's kept me strong.''

<HEADLINE> States Hang Up on Telemarketers / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- When automated telemarketing machines call Henry  
Arken's residence, there is an automatic click followed by a dial 
tone. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife might allow them one or two words, and then hang up. I  
say to myself, `Time to go,''' said Arken. ``It's really a pain in 
the neck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arken can get some relief from a Florida law that makes it  
illegal for most companies to place unsolicited requests for 
business, or cold calls, to residents on a ``No Sales 
Solicitations'' list. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida is one of several states taking a tougher stance against  
telemarketers. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia has a similar law in place. Oregon and Alaska have  
what's known as ``asterisk laws,'' which allow consumers to 
indicate by an asterisk in the telephone book that they don't want 
sales calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other states, including Mississippi, Illinois, New  
Jersey and Michigan, have tried unsuccessfully to pass statutes 
comparable to Florida and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very, very popular program,'' said Terence McElroy,  
spokesman for Florida's Department of Agriculture and Consumer 
Services, which administers the ``No Sales Solicitations'' program. 
``It spares the intrusion of these calls, which is just a real 
relief, and ... you're protecting yourself from telemarketing 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``(You) basically are able to hang out a `do not disturb' sign  
over your telephone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arken, 83, is president of Century Village East of Deerfield  
Beach, a residential community primarily for people older than 55. 
He's typical of the kind of people most bothered by unsolicited 
sales calls at home -- automated or not. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, he and his wife aren't participating in Florida's  
``No Sales Solicitations'' program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither one of us pays attention to them. We just hang up,''  
said Arken. 
</P>
<P>
	About 110,000 people have signed up for the Florida program  
since its start in 1991. But according to estimates from the U.S. 
Census Bureau, close to 1.3 million people older than 75 live in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is getting the word out, McElroy said.  
</P>
<P>
	The cost is nominal -- consumers pay $10 to get on the list the  
first year and $5 every year thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
	Although state law allows a maximum fine of $10,000 for every  
call made to numbers on the list, companies told about complaints 
against them have settled out of court for an average of $1,250 per 
alleged violation, McElroy said. 
</P>
<P>
	About $320,000 in civil penalties have been collected from 44  
companies since 1992, including some of the largest companies in 
banking, brokerage and retail. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Merrill Lynch and Co., PaineWebber  
Inc., and Smith Barney Inc. shared $33,000 in penalties; a 
telemarketing company for MBNA America agreed to pay $19,500; and 
four telemarketing companies for Citibank shared $15,000 in 
penalties, according to McElroy. 
</P>
<P>
	Those penalties weren't enough to satisfy state Rep. Mark Ogles,  
R-Bradenton, who last year proposed tougher legislation to 
eliminate any exemptions from the law. He plans to reintroduce his 
bill this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies selling newspaper subscriptions and people calling on  
behalf of political candidates or charitable organizations are not 
required to avoid numbers on the list. Companies that previously 
received someone's business also are exempt, though not 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	Other options exist on a national level.  
</P>
<P>
	Since 1985, the Direct Marketing Association has maintained a  
list of people who don't want to receive cold calls, said Chet 
Dalzell, spokesman for the New York-based industry group. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers must write the group to get on the list, which is  
updated quarterly and distributed to national marketers. They stay 
on the list for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no penalties for contacting someone on the national  
list, though Dalzell estimated a 75 percent blocking rate for most 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a foolproof service. Local marketers (usually) would  
not be using our service,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason why (businesses) use this list ... is it saves them  
money in conducting calling campaigns,'' Dalzell said. ``That's why 
marketers themselves founded the service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers also have the option of telling companies themselves  
not to call again. Federal law requires that companies record such 
requests, and not contact those consumers for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	----------	 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers can enroll in the Direct Marketing Association's  
Telephone Preference Service by sending a signed letter with a 
name, address and home telephone number, including area code. Allow 
at least 90 days for processing. The address is: P.O. Box 9014, 
Farmingdale, NY 11735-9014.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Soaring at All-Star Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Clearly, Eric Lindros is the Philadelphia  
Flyers' most valuable player at the All-Star break. No surprise 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	A close second might be someone who hasn't taken a faceoff or  
shot in 15 years -- general manager Bob Clarke. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers, who struggled early this season with the glaring  
weakness of only one strong line, lead the Atlantic Division at the 
All-Star break after a scintillating streak that saw them lose only 
one of the last 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Some seemingly questionable moves by Clarke have worked wonders,  
and the team has embraced coach Roger Neilson's quirky leadership 
and tight defensive system. Though it's only the halfway point, the 
Flyers are feeling like Stanley Cup contenders again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't explain why,'' Lindros said after the Flyers beat the  
Washington Capitals 4-1 Thursday night in their last game before 
the break. ``I think it started in training camp. ... We're having 
a good time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke sent shockwaves through the locker room on Dec. 12 when  
he reacquired Mikael Renberg, Lindros' former linemate on the 
Legion of Doom, from Tampa Bay with Daymond Langkow for Chris 
Gratton and Mike Sillinger. Then, Clarke traded popular veteran 
defenseman Petr Svoboda to the Lightning for another former Flyer, 
Karl Dykhuis. 
</P>
<P>
	With trades for Keith Jones, Valeri Zelepukin and Roman Vopat,  
Clarke reworked one-third of the Flyers' roster in the first three 
months of the season. Many observers wondered what ``Clarkie'' was 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	Not anymore. Philadelphia's 12-1-5 record leading up to the  
All-Star break included a 15-game unbeaten streak. The 10-0-5 mark 
was the fifth-best in Flyers history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the moves have been questioned,'' said goaltender Ron  
Hextall, at a loss to explain why Clarke's tinkering has worked. 
``There's no real reason. There's so many things involved. I think 
everybody has accepted their role. Nobody really knows when you're 
going to have chemistry or why you have chemistry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The eclectic mix of talent and personalities assembled by Clarke  
seems to suit Neilson, who took over for Wayne Cashman late last 
season and was criticized for his conservative style. 
</P>
<P>
	A true journeyman coach who is with his NHL-record seventh team,  
Neilson has won his players' loyalty with a no-nonsense approach 
peppered with dry humor he reveals to them only in private -- on the 
bench, in film sessions or at practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll tell jokes in the room when we're watching video just  
about every day,'' Hextall said. ``There's a lot of laughs in 
there. He's got a way to bring a team together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros said, ``He tells jokes all the time. He tells jokes on  
the bench. He keeps things light, but when it's time to get serious 
he's not one to mess around with that, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With nearly a full season at the helm, his system seems to be  
working. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our team last year didn't seem to be very sound defensively,''  
Neilson said. ``We'd outplay teams and outwork them, and then we'd 
give up breakaways. You never really felt safe. We wanted to play a 
conservative game and be able to protect leads, and we've done 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers, swept by Detroit in the Stanley Cup finals two years  
ago, are getting great goaltending from John Vanbiesbrouck, who has 
four shutouts in five games and a career-high six this season. 
Every player Clarke acquired has contributed. The trio from Tampa -- 
Renberg, Langkow and Dykhuis -- each scored a goal on Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke's bold maneuvering really began last summer, when he  
challenged Lindros to play like the best player in the NHL if he 
wanted to be paid that way. The 25-year-old team captain got off to 
the best start of his career, skating like a man consumed by desire 
to win the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing was said, in my opinion, that was meant to hurt  
anybody,'' Clarke said. ``It was said as reality and as a 
challenge. That's just the way it is in this business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Clarke brushes off suggestions that he's tapped into  
something special. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't do anything,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	So far, he's done enough.

<HEADLINE> More Join Bid To Lure NFL to L.A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The squad of developers and government  
officials working to attract an NFL team to Los Angeles just got a 
powerful new player, billionaire Eli Broad. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad said Thursday he will join the $1 billion effort to  
transform the downtown area into an entertainment, sports and 
cultural mecca by bringing a professional football team to the Los 
Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	With the support of city, county and state officials, Broad is  
joining forces with developer Ed Roski Jr. to persuade NFL owners 
to give the New Coliseum Partnership the next expansion franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ed and I like to win,'' Broad said in a news conference at the  
Convention Center downtown. ``We've got a first-rate financial 
package. We believe it's the kind the NFL is looking for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The estimated $1.1 billion Coliseum proposal breaks down to $750  
million for the franchise and $350 million in improvements for the 
aging stadium, which is jointly owned by the city, county and 
California. The landmark home to the 1932 and 1984 Olympics would 
be gutted, leaving only the historic columns and outer walls. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Broad and Roski would be equal partners, but  
they would welcome other investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're prepared, if necessary, to between us own 100 percent,''  
Broad said, ``But our door is open to others and we're prepared to 
offer 30 to 40 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broad's involvement makes the Coliseum bid more viable by giving  
it the financial muscle it lacked and instantly cranks up the 
competition for an NFL franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood mogul Michael Ovitz already has lined up an all-star  
roster of investors, including actors Tom Cruise and Kevin Costner, 
to build a combined stadium and shopping mall in Carson, 21 miles 
south of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	`It does not affect any of our plans for our bid in Carson,''  
Ovitz spokesman Peter Levin said. ``Although the financial 
situation is important, the NFL will be scrutinizing other elements 
regarding bringing a football franchise back to Los Angeles, 
including locale, access and a state-of-the-art facility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL could grant its 32nd franchise as early as Feb. 18.  
</P>
<P>
	A proposal from Houston is said to be in third place behind the  
two Los Angeles bids because Southern California has a larger 
television audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad, 65, became one of America's richest men last summer when  
he sold his SunAmerica Inc. financial services company. He is said 
to be worth at least $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad has been instrumental in revitalizing downtown Los  
Angeles, including fund-raising for the Los Angeles Museum of 
Contemporary Art, the planned Walt Disney Concert Hall and an 
unfinished Roman Catholic cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
	Roski, 60, an industrial developer and co-owner of the NHL's Los  
Angeles Kings, was a major force behind the development of Staples 
Center downtown. The Kings and the NBA's Lakers and Clippers will 
play there next season.

<HEADLINE> U2 Writes Song With Salman Rushdie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Author Salman Rushdie has contributed lyrics to a  
new song by the Irish rock band U2, The Guardian newspaper reported 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rushdie, who has lived in hiding for nearly a decade since being  
condemned to death by Iran's supreme leader for his 1989 book ``The 
Satanic Verses,'' gave U2 lead singer Bono the lyrics taken from 
his new novel, ``The Ground Beneath Her Feet,'' the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The romantic ballad, also to be called ``The Ground Beneath Her  
Feet,'' will be on U2's next album, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bono and I have been friends for several years, and I sent him  
the novel when I'd finished it, and he responded by coming up with 
this beautiful melody,'' the newspaper quoted Rushdie as saying. 
``Simple as that, but of course very pleasurable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rushdie's literary agency declined to comment on The Guardian's  
report. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said U2 hopes to release the single to coincide  
with the April 13 release of Rushdie's novel. The lyrics for the 
song are included in the novel, which tells the myth of Orpheus and 
Eurydice against a rock 'n' roll background, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The author's collaboration with U2 would not be his first: He  
appeared on stage with the band in London in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Rushdie was condemned to death in 1989 after the late Ayatollah  
Ruhollah Khomeini, the founding spiritual leader of the Islamic 
republic, ruled ``The Satanic Verses'' was blasphemous to Islam. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, the Iranian government said it was distancing itself  
from the edict, but hard-liners insist there's still a price on the 
author's head.

<HEADLINE>  Fossils Suggest Dinosaurs Were Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A well-preserved fossil of a  
110-million-year-old baby dinosaur suggests that the extinct animal 
had the lungs to be a swift and deadly hunter, researchers say in a 
new study. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas Geist, a paleobiologist at Oregon State University,  
said the remains of a specimen called Scipionyx may be the best 
preserved dinosaur fossil ever found and will provide researchers 
with new insights into the extinct animals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The extraordinary condition of the fossils allows us to hang  
some meat on the bones of these animals,'' said Geist, the senior 
author of a study appearing today in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you usually get in fossils is just bones, but in this one  
there are remnants of liver, large intestine, windpipe and 
muscle,'' he said. ``It is like a Rosetta stone for dinosaurs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scipionyx was a theropod, a type of meat-eating dinosaur that  
walked on its hind legs, had a big head with a large mouth and 
teeth, a long tail and small forearms. 
</P>
<P>
	Geist said the soft tissue impressions show that the Scipionyx  
had a two-partition abdominal cavity, with the lungs and heart in 
one section, and the liver and guts in the other. The liver was 
connected by muscle to a pelvic bone, he said, suggesting that the 
animal had a breathing system called a hepatic piston. 
</P>
<P>
	In such a system, muscles pull against the liver, causing the  
breathing cavity to expand slightly. This forces air into the lungs 
at high rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is necessary for sustained activity,'' said Geist.  
``These theropods were exceedingly fast and dangerous animals. They 
were not slow and sluggish like many modern reptiles. They could go 
like hell whenever they wanted to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mammals have a diaphragm muscle that causes the lung cavity to  
expand and draw in air. The ability to rapidly ventilate the lungs 
is essential for moving swiftly for long periods. 
</P>
<P>
	This lung capacity may be one reason that dinosaurs dominated  
mammals for about 150 million years, said Geist. Mammals during 
this period were small and no match for the meat-eating dinosaur. 
</P>
<P>
	``These dinosaurs were fierce animals that could run prey down  
over extended distances and definitely not the sort of sluggish 
movers of many living reptiles,'' Geist said. ``This was like a 
turbo-charged lizard. The mammals couldn't get a foothold and just 
tried to stay out of the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Geist said the hepatic piston works best in a warm, mild climate  
such as the Earth enjoyed during most of the dinosaur era. When the 
climate chilled, the dinosaurs were in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``These animals may have been so specialized for the warm  
climate, that even a minor change over an extended period may have 
helped do them in,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The interpretation of this fossil makes this animal more like  
the popular idea of the dinosaur, such as in the movie 'Jurassic 
Park', that they were fast and agile and able run for some 
distance,'' said Terry D. Jones, a co-author of the study. ``This 
gives some credence to that idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not all experts agree that the Scipionyx fossil gives such  
precise evidence of a hepatic pump breathing system, said Paul 
Soreno, a dinosaur expert at the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``For many in the field, that interpretation is controversial,''  
said Soreno. 
</P>
<P>
	The Scipionyx fossil, the only dinosaur ever found in Italy, is  
small enough to hold in two hands and the animal may have been only 
days old when it died. Geist said it perished in a saltwater marsh 
which preserved its body structure. 
</P>
<P>
	No fossil for an adult Scipionyx has been found and Geist said  
the animal species probably grew to only about the size of a large 
dog.

<HEADLINE> Rosie O'Donnell Bows Out of Tonys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rosie O'Donnell gives her regrets to Broadway.  
</P>
<P>
	The talk show host said Thursday she has decided not to emcee  
this year's Tony Awards in June. 
</P>
<P>
	She has been host for the past two years and has been credited  
with boosting the sagging ratings of the annual awards show. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's solely because of scheduling conflicts,'' spokeswoman  
Jennifer Glaisek said. ``She just can't be in two places at one 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. O'Donnell has already agreed to be host of the Grammy Awards  
in Los Angeles next month and Nickelodeon's Kids Choice awards 
show. She also is taking her daily talk show on the road in May. 
</P>
<P>
	No replacement was immediately named.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're disappointed,'' said Tony Awards spokesman Keith  
Sherman. ``We love Rosie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So do TV audiences. In her 1997 debut as host of the Tonys, she  
helped boost the ratings 48 percent to their highest level in a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Sherman said the possible hosts in June include Nicole Kidman,  
star of Broadway's steamy ``Blue Room,'' and Nathan Lane. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Glaisek said Ms. O'Donnell could be back next year.  
</P>
<P>
	``She loves the Tonys. She loves Broadway,'' Ms. Glaisek said,  
``and if they ask her back and her schedule permits, I know she'd 
love to do it.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Citrus Growers To Get Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore announced Friday  
that 18 California counties hurt by last month's crop-killing 
freeze have been declared federal disaster areas by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	The designation clears the way for loans and other programs for  
farmers and related businesses in the nation's leading agricultural 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to let California farmers know that the federal  
government will not let the hardships beyond their control put them 
out of business,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time in less than two weeks that Gore has used  
the citrus freeze to make his presence felt in voter-rich 
California, a state crucial to his presidential drive. 
</P>
<P>
	With less than 14 months before California's primary, Gore is  
scheduled to visit four cities Saturday to Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten days ago, Gore announced that the U.S. Department of Labor  
would provide nearly $1.8 million in emergency funds to aid 
farmworkers who lost their jobs to the freeze. 
</P>
<P>
	Four days of bitter-cold temperatures in late December caused an  
estimated $656 million in damage. The lemon crop was wiped out and 
oranges are nearly a total loss. Packing houses shut down and 
thousands of workers are out of jobs. Unemployment claims have 
reached 4,471 and counting. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Gray Davis said he has also asked Gore to help secure a  
presidential disaster declaration, which would open the door to 
unemployment insurance for farmworkers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department's declaration will provide emergency  
low-interest loans from the USDA of up to $500,000 and aid to 
farmers who are not covered by federal disaster insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	It also includes funds for a program that pays for vines or  
trees destroyed by a natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	The state had only requested relief in six counties: Fresno,  
Kern, Kings, Madera, Monterey and Tulare. But the USDA is also 
authorized to provide aid to Inyo, Los Angeles, Mariposa, Merced, 
Mono, San Benito, San Bernardino, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, 
Santa Cruz, Tuolumne and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Kranz, a spokesman for the California Farm Bureau  
Federation, which represents more than 75,000 members, said federal 
action was noticeably swifter than in 1990, when it took nearly 
three months for response to a more devastating freeze.

<HEADLINE> Muti Makes N.Y. Philharmonic Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After three decades as a top international  
conductor, Riccardo Muti finally made his New York Philharmonic 
debut with a performance that was both stunning and a bit 
disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
	Muti, 57, has been music director of the La Scala opera house in  
Milan, Italy, since 1986 and is known in the United States 
primarily for his performances with the Philadelphia Orchestra, 
which hired him as its music director from 1980-92. 
</P>
<P>
	His hair is still jet black, and while he is short and slim, he  
remains a giant presence on the podium. As always, the question is 
whether his conducting -- which is technically outstanding and 
brings out polished playing -- would be as cold as the stare in his 
sharklike eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday night's program at Avery Fisher Hall -- it will be  
repeated three more times -- had three vastly different composers, 
starting with Brahms' Serenade No. 1, continuing with four 
orchestra excerpts from Busoni's ``Turandot'' and concluding with 
Ravel's familiar ``Bolero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was in ``Bolero'' where Muti was most effective. The piece --  
one melody that repeats over and over, being passed from woodwinds 
to brass to strings and intensifying as it progresses -- does not 
need much emotion, providing it in the music, much like an opera 
score. 
</P>
<P>
	With Muti, the music flowed from section to section and ended in  
a thunderous chord that brought many in the house leaping to their 
feat immediately following the final note. 
</P>
<P>
	Busoni's ``Turandot'' -- the pieces heard were composed in 1905 --  
is not nearly as well known as Puccini's final opera, written 
nearly 20 years later and a central part of today's standard 
repertory. 
</P>
<P>
	While it was interesting, it also was clear why Muti is  
primarily an opera conductor. His devotion to the original text -- 
some have called it slavish devotion -- leaves a somewhat steely 
interpretation unless voices are there to provide color and warmth. 
</P>
<P>
	All in all, it was a satisfying debut. Guest conducting is a  
difficult chore, with the maestro given little time to rehearse an 
orchestra. With whatever time he did have, Muti managed to impart 
some of his style. Additional programs are needed to determine how 
he and this orchestra mix.

<HEADLINE> Real Killer Gets Death Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Kevin Green spent 16 years in prison  
for a murder he didn't commit. The real killer now has a place on 
death row. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Parker was sentenced Thursday to die for six homicides  
that had terrified women in Orange County in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors last year convicted Parker and recommended the death  
sentence. His victims included five women and a full-term fetus 
being carried by Green's ex-wife, Dianne D'Aiello, whom Parker 
raped. 
</P>
<P>
	Green was sentenced to life in prison for that case and served  
16 years before he was exonerated in 1996. Newly developed DNA 
tests linked Parker to the attack, and he later confessed. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Francisco Briseno told Parker, 43, that just one of the  
six murders would warrant capital punishment: ``That the defendant 
would repeat these acts six different times is beyond belief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. D'Aiello told Briseno that Parker deserved to die, but that  
she still believes Green beat and raped her shortly before Parker 
did. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the two men is being sentenced here today but the other  
is being forgiven,'' she said. ``I feel like I've been raped by the 
system all over again 17 years later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green has remarried and moved to Missouri. He has maintained his  
innocence throughout. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not about me,'' he said Thursday in a telephone  
interview from Jefferson City. Green said his ex-wife's mother 
raised the allegations out of animosity toward him ``at a time when 
Dianne couldn't even remember her name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During sentencing, Parker declined an offer to make a statement  
and stared straight at the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackie Besonnette, whose sister, Debra Lynn Senior, was killed,  
told the judge that ``it's not just the Green case'' and asked him 
to remember Parker's five other victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope you will rule death for him,'' she said. ``It will  
still be too good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other victims were Sandra Kay Fry, 17; Kimberly Rawlins, 21;  
Marolyn Carleton, 31; and Debora Jean Kennedy, 24. Most were alone 
in their homes when they were assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker's sentence may not mean the end of Green's legal odyssey.  
He said he had been sued and had countersued his ex-wife in a civil 
dispute over their baby's wrongful death.

<HEADLINE> US Rep. Chides Intel Over New Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A congressman urged Intel Corp. on Friday to  
reconsider plans to give its upcoming Pentium III computer 
processor the ability to transmit across the Internet unique 
numbers to help identify consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., said that he understood the  
technology's implications for online commerce, where the anonymity 
of the Internet can encourage fraud. But he worried it also will 
help online marketers track consumers on the Web surreptitiously. 
</P>
<P>
	``Intel's new product improves technology for online commerce in  
a way that compromises personal privacy,'' Markey wrote in a letter 
to Intel Chief Executive Officer Craig Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
	Markey, the senior Democrat on the House consumer protection  
subcommittee, urged Intel ``to better balance both commercial and 
privacy objectives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An Intel spokesman, Chuck Mulloy, said Markey ``clearly is  
missing some information here.'' He said the company will contact 
the congressman's staff ``to make sure they understand the entire 
story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel announced its technology earlier this week at a security  
conference in San Jose, Calif. Its new Pentium III chip, to be sold 
early this year, will by default transmit its unique serial number 
internally and across the Internet to help verify the identity of 
users. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers can turn the feature off, but it turns itself back on  
each time the computer is restarted. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel said the technology is needed to encourage trust in online  
sales and can also be used to prevent piracy by preventing a single 
copy of a software program from being installed on several 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
	To mollify privacy advocates, Intel said it will not maintain a  
master database of consumer names matched to Pentium serial 
numbers. Intel also encouraged Web sites and software programmers 
to warn consumers whenever the serial number is retrieved. It 
predicted the first such Internet pages and software will appear 
within months. 
</P>
<P>
	``The flip side of the coin for security is privacy,'' Mulloy  
said. ``... We acknowledge there are certain risks associated with 
that serial number.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Civil libertarians still found fault.  
</P>
<P>
	``The potential harm that this plan could do to privacy is  
pretty large,'' said Stanton McCandlish of the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation, a civil liberties group in San Francisco. ``It's just 
unfathomable they would come up with such an insecure system, 
especially given the vast majority of users who are extremely 
concerned about online privacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The debate over Intel's new technology occurs as Congress  
considers whether to propose new federal privacy laws for the 
Internet. The Federal Trade Commission, which chided the online 
industry for its failure to protect privacy rights, successfully 
pressed last year for a law to prohibit Web sites from collecting 
personal information on children without their parents' permission.

<HEADLINE> Islanders Win After Milbury Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mike Milbury knows the look of a team that has  
quit. He's seen it repeatedly in a quarter-century as a player, 
coach and general manager in hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, he had never seen it in his own team.  
</P>
<P>
	That's what made Milbury's decision to resign as the New York  
Islanders' coach for the second time in two years so easy Thursday: 
The quitters he always despised suddenly were wearing his team's 
uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the team quits on the coach, it's tough to get them  
back,'' Milbury said hours before new coach Bill Stewart directed a 
5-2 victory in Pittsburgh, ending the Islanders' 11-game winless 
streak (0-10-1). 
</P>
<P>
	Milbury, who first stepped down as the Islanders' coach last  
Jan. 24, will remain as general manager. He hadn't really wanted to 
return as coach, but was coaxed back last March, not long after the 
Islanders lost 10 in a row under former coach Rick Bowness. 
</P>
<P>
	Milbury, 46, signed a five-year coaching contract at $750,000  
per year in May, only to keep the job about 10 months before 
turning it over to Stewart, an assistant coach and former NHL 
defenseman. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't get into a streak like we were, it happened to Rick  
last year,'' said Milbury, who decided to quit following a lifeless 
5-2 loss Wednesday to Florida. ``The message our players sent was a 
strong one and not a good one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Islanders (14-29-3) sent a different one Thursday, playing  
with considerably more passion and aggression under Stewart, the 
1997-98 AHL coach of the year with Calder Cup finalist St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Milbury, Stewart is demanding and pragmatic, but puts more  
of an emphasis on defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he felt he was a lousy assistant coach, that he  
couldn't open up the way he wanted to,'' Milbury said. ``He's 
aggressive and straight forward and no-nonsense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Islanders (14-29-3) had won only three times since Nov. 26  
until Claude Lapointe's two goals led them to their first victory 
in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good feeling, but we've got a long way to go,'' Stewart  
said of the Islanders, who have fewer points than any NHL team 
except Tampa Bay. ``We'll use this as a yardstick for character in 
room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he made many changes, Stewart said, ``I didn't have any  
time. It was basically the same thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart wasn't oblivious to the unhappiness that was evident on  
the team, or the grumbling that followed the trading of Bryan 
Berard and the long holdout of star Zigmund Palffy, and will give 
every player a fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that there's a new coach, what happened in the past has  
happened, and we look to the future because that's the only thing 
we can take care of,'' Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	There's certainly not much to look back on recently with a team  
that hasn't made the playoffs since 1994. Now, Stewart becomes the 
fourth coach in three years -- counting Milbury's two stints -- to 
try to change it. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he was hired as associate coach, I thought he could be a  
coach who could handle the team in my absence,'' Milbury said. ``I 
always felt Bill would be the guy. ... He's a fairly 
defensive-minded guy, a batten-down-the-hatches guy and maybe now 
we can win some games by scoring three goals but giving up only 
two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milbury spent 20 years in the Boston Bruins organization as a  
player, coach and front office executive before becoming the 
Islanders' coach on July 5, 1995, a year after New York's last 
appearance in the playoffs. He took over as general manager from 
Don Maloney on Dec. 12, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 56-111-24 as Islanders coach and 90-49-21 with Boston,  
reaching the Stanley Cup finals in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Cos. OK Farmers Trust Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Tobacco farmers struggling to survive in a  
shrinking market would be able to tap into a $5.15 billion trust 
fund approved by the nation's largest cigarette makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris Cos., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Lorillard Tobacco  
Co. and Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. agreed Thursday to pay 
into the fund for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for tobacco is expected to be reduced by recent  
settlements of claims by states that sued tobacco companies to 
recover the costs of treating sick smokers. The settlements, which 
totaled $246 billion, are being financed by higher prices for 
cigarettes and include provisions to limit promotion of tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlements also included a provision in which the companies  
agreed to help farmers hurt by lessened demand for their crop. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will enable a grower to go to a lender and show cash  
flow,'' Graham Boyd, executive vice president of the Tobacco 
Growers Association of North Carolina, said of the fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Boyd said farmers who qualify under yet-to-be-determined rules  
may use the money for operations or to make debt payments. 
</P>
<P>
	``You won't find any growers taking this and buying beachfront  
condos,'' he said. ``Most of them owe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers would apply for assistance to independent boards of  
trustees, but North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt, who hosted the 
negotiations, said many details remain to be worked out before the 
pact is signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt said he hoped that farmers in North Carolina, the largest  
tobacco producer, could get payments from the fund in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies reached the agreement after two days of tense  
negotiations with five tobacco-state governors. R.J. Reynolds had 
been reluctant to pay into the trust and had instead proposed 
buying more American-grown tobacco to provide a stable market for 
growers. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds said last month it will lay off 3,900 employees  
worldwide and is restructuring operations because of lower sales in 
the United States and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Major tobacco states in the talks were Virginia, North Carolina,  
South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee and Kentucky. Others involved 
were Maryland, West Virginia, Indiana, Florida, Alabama and Ohio.

<HEADLINE> Trailblazers, Sabonis in $30M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The Portland Trail Blazers will pay center  
Arvydas Sabonis $30.4 million over three years, his agent said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabonis will be paid $9 million this season, $10.125 million in  
2000-01 and $11.25 million in 2001-02, for a total of $30.375 
million, agent Herb Rudoy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabonis, who spent the first six years of his career in Spain,  
had his best NBA season last year for the Blazers, averaging 16 
points and 10 rebounds. In three seasons with Portland, Sabonis has 
averaged 14.7 points and 8.7 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old Lithuanian also played on the Soviet Union's  
gold medal-winning Olympic team in 1988. He played for Lithuania in 
1992 and 1996, winning the bronze medal.

<HEADLINE> Va. Assistant Jumps to Miss. State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Virginia offensive coordinator  
Sparky Woods moved into that same position Friday at Mississippi 
State, and his former boss, head coach George Welsh, declined to 
say whether Woods resigned or was fired. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not now. I'd rather wait and see what Sparky has to say,''  
Welsh told the Richmond Times-Dispatch. ``I have to talk to 
(athletic director) Terry Holland first. He's the boss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, who took over the Cavaliers' offense two years ago when  
long-time Welsh assistant Tom O'Brien became head coach at Boston 
College, helped build one of the most balanced offenses in the 
country this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavaliers led the Atlantic Coast Conference in rushing with  
213.1 yards per game. They also averaged 213.5 yard passing, 
joining Arizona and Kansas State as the only schools to average 200 
yards both passing and running. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia finished 9-3, including a 35-33 loss to Georgia in the  
Peach Bowl that marked the second time they blew a 21-point lead 
and lost. 
</P>
<P>
	In Starkville, Miss., on Friday., a news conference to introduce  
Woods was delayed, then called off when poor weather conditions 
kept him from arriving. A news release distributed by the school 
quoted Bulldogs head coach Jackie Sherrill as saying he had chosen 
Woods from among 20 candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi State finished 8-4 this season, losing to Tennessee  
in the Southeastern Conference championship game and to Texas in 
the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to joining the Cavaliers, Woods was head coach at South  
Carolina, but was fired after the 1993 season. He spent two seasons 
in Memphis before coming to Virginia in 1997.

<HEADLINE> DNA Tests Link Slain Doctor Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Preliminary DNA tests link a missing  
anti-abortion activist to a strand of hair found near where a 
sniper shot and killed a Buffalo, N.Y., doctor who performed 
abortions, a law enforcement official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The first round of DNA tests on the hair at the FBI Laboratory  
here established a high probability it came from the same person as 
a hair found in a New Jersey home where James C. Kopp, a 
44-year-old anti-abortion protester, lived last year, the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first DNA tests did not exclude a match between the two  
strands. 
</P>
<P>
	Kopp has eluded authorities since they obtained a warrant for  
him as a material witness in the Oct. 23 sniper shooting of Dr. 
Barnett Slepian, a 52-year-old obstetrician-gynecologist who 
performed abortions. The search for Kopp was recently extended to 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, FBI agents and Metropolitan Police officers assigned  
to a joint terrorism task force here scanned the crowd of 
anti-abortion protesters at the annual March for Life on Capitol 
Hill, because Kopp has been either a participant in or arrested at 
this march in each of the last three years, according to another 
law enforcement official, 
</P>
<P>
	Both officials requested anonymity.  
</P>
<P>
	The FBI is conducting further DNA tests of the hair found  
outside Dr. Slepian's home. This more extensive set of tests could 
enable officials to declare an absolute match between the two hair 
strands, the first law enforcement official said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, we would need to have a hair taken directly from  
Kopp himself to establish conclusively the hair from scene is 
his,'' the official added. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said the hair was in a cap that authorities found  
very near the location from which the sniper is thought to have 
fired the rifle bullet that killed Slepian as he stood in the 
kitchen of his home in the Buffalo suburb of Amherst, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	But The Buffalo News reported Friday that the hair was in a  
packet, with at least two bullets, that was found buried in the 
ground more than 50 feet from a tree where police believe the 
sniper stood and fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, FBI Director Louis Freeh, on an official visit to  
Mexico, asked Mexican authorities to join the hunt for Kopp, 
federal officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
	They believe Kopp was driven to Mexico by a female friend after  
the shooting, and have a trail of her credit card receipts leading 
to Mexico, the federal officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a Customs Service videotape from a border crossing  
point shows the woman's car returning from Mexico, these officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities obtained a material-witness arrest warrant for Kopp  
after they said Kopp's car was spotted in Amherst in the weeks 
before Slepian was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Kopp's 1987 Chevrolet Cavalier was discovered last month at  
Newark, N.J., International Airport, the FBI said. The car had been 
in the long-term lot for about two weeks, said Greg Trevor, a 
spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Scandal Spreads to Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The Olympic corruption scandal grew  
dramatically today when an Australian official said he had offered 
$70,000 in inducements to two African IOC members the night before 
Sydney won the 2000 Games by two votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's senior IOC member, who said he was not involved in  
the offer, acknowleged that the inducement could be seen as a bribe 
and bring demands for Sydney to be stripped of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest development in the growing corruption crisis came on  
the same day that a Libyan delegate became the second IOC member to 
resign amid vote-buying allegations in Salt Lake City's selection 
as host of the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi gave his resignation to IOC president  
Juan Antonio Samaranch, one day before a special IOC commission 
concludes its inquiry into the Salt Lake scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch did not rule out other resignations this weekend. He  
said seven other IOC members face possible expulsion in the Salt 
Lake case. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, Samaranch learned of the damaging news from  
Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	John Coates, president of the Australian Olympic Committee and a  
leader of the 2000 Sydney bid, said he had offered the $35,000 
inducements apiece to the national Olympic committees of Kenya and 
Uganda, according to Australian news reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The offers was made to IOC members Charles Mukora of Kenya and  
Maj. Gen. Francis Nyangweso of Uganda at a dinner in Monte Carlo, 
Monaco, on Sept. 22, 1993, the night before Sydney beat Beijing by 
two votes for the right to stage the 2000 Games, according to 
Coates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was necessary for us to show our commitment to  
those NOC's with a view to winning those votes,'' Coates was quoted 
as saying in Saturday's editions of the Sydney Morning Herald. ``My 
view was it might encourage them to consider their votes for 
Sydney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney won 45-43 on the final ballot.  
</P>
<P>
	Coates denied the money was a bribe and said it would go towards  
helping sport in Kenya and Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the offer were contained in a package of previously  
confidential Sydney bid documents released to Australian news media 
by Coates, who was in Australia and not immediately available for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents also disclosed that Coates had written to Mukora  
and Nyangweso a month before the vote, offering to put them up at 
Sydney's expense at the luxury Dorchester Hotel in London on their 
way to Monaco. 
</P>
<P>
	In Lausanne, Kevan Gosper, an IOC executive board member from  
Australia, commented on the reports by saying that the inducements 
offered by Coates went ``beyond good will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear if Gosper had seen the documents.  
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that John's decision was intended to influence the  
IOC members' thinking,'' Gosper told The Associated Press. ``The 
perception may not match John's intention, the event having taken 
place the night before the vote. .... 
</P>
<P>
	``I can see this being viewed as questionable conduct. The  
perception will be quite damaging to Sydney. It's a very serious 
revelation. I think a lot of people will be destabilized.''

<HEADLINE> Sharp Aims for His Own IRL Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- Everything Scott Sharp and Kelley  
Racing have done since the end of last season has been with the 
objective of getting off to a fast start in the Indy Racing 
League's fourth season. 
</P>
<P>
	If Friday's practice speeds are any indication, the work has  
been well worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharp, 30, was co-champion with Buzz Calkins in 1996, the IRL's  
abbreviated inaugural season, winning the title for A.J. Foyt, who 
now fields cars for defending series champion Kenny Brack and Billy 
Boat. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, his first driving for Rich Kelley, Sharp was in the  
hunt for the title until some late-season bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
	``We blew a tire and crashed at Texas, then we had a strange  
gearbox problem at Atlanta,'' Sharp said Friday after topping the 
first official day of practice for the season-opening TransWorld 
Diversified Services Indy 200 at Walt Disney World Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``But those are the kind of things that happen in racing,'' he  
said. ``You can't let them get you down. Now we've got a full year 
in with this team, we know we've got good equipment and we know we 
can win. We just have to go out there and see if we can be the guys 
who set the bar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharp turned the fast lap of 170.132 mph despite missing  
virtually the entire morning practice because of a fuel pressure 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to bag that session,'' he explained. ``It was like  
starting over for us this afternoon. A lot of times when you miss a 
session like that, you spend the rest of the weekend trying to 
catch up and never do. Fortunately, we had a great test here 
(earlier in January) and we were able to get right back up to 
speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharp said he spent some time on the way from his new home in  
Carmel, Ind., a suburb of Indianapolis, to Florida studying the IRL 
roster for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very deep field,'' Sharp said. ``Looking at that  
list, I can see 12 guys that have an honest shot at winning the 
championship. There are going to be a lot of factors that enter 
into it before the end of the season. It's more important than ever 
to get off to a fast start and then keep it going. 
</P>
<P>
	``With so many strong teams, it's going to be tough if you mess  
up even once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Dismore was fastest in the morning practice and wound up  
second overall on Friday with a lap of 168.587, followed by Scott 
Goodyear at 168.445, Greg Ray -- making his first appearance in the 
car fielded by Team Menard -- at 167.747, new Treadway Racing driver 
Sam Schmidt at 167.496 and Brack at 167.325. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray is in the ride previously held by 1997 IRL champ Tony  
Stewart, now a regular in NASCAR's Winston Cup series, while 
Schmidt is in the seat formerly occupied by two-time Indianapolis 
500 winner Arie Luyendyk, who will run only that race this year 
before retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Cheever, who won last year's Indy 500, was seventh fast on  
Friday at 166.736, while Boat, who won six poles in 11 races last 
year, was 10th fast at 166.128. 
</P>
<P>
	Qualifying is scheduled today, with rain in the forecast. The  
time trials were rained out last year and the IRL had to fill the 
field based on the previous year's team owner points and practice 
speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, I'd rather qualifying,'' Sharp said. ``Last year, I had  
to start from the back of the field because we had no car owner 
points. But at least this year we'd start fourth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another rainout would put Brack and Eliseo Salazar on the front  
row of a field of between 26 and 28 cars.

<HEADLINE> Sprewell Reinstated by the NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell was reinstated by the NBA today  
after meeting with commissioner David Stern. 
</P>
<P>
	The newest member of the Knicks, who drew the longest non-drug  
suspension in league history for his attack on Golden State 
Warriors coach P.J. Carlesimo, is free to begin practicing with New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Union director Billy Hunter, deputy commissioner Russ Granik and  
two other officials attended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Latrell has given us assurances that he will be able to  
control his anger both on and off the court in the future,'' Stern 
said. ``Billy and I were both satisfied that he seems sincere in 
that commitment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At their first practice Thursday night, Sprewell's new teammates  
said they were ready to forgive and forget his troubled past. The 
Knicks acquired Sprewell earlier in the day in a trade for John 
Starks, Chris Mills and Terry Cummings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a teammate now and I am a firm believer what's in your  
past stays in your past,'' Chris Childs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell was suspended for 68 games last season and had his  
contract terminated and then reinstated by an arbitrator after he 
choked and threatened to kill Carlesimo at a Golden State practice. 
</P>
<P>
	His history also includes a reckless driving accident, lawsuits  
against his former agent and the NBA and a fight with former 
teammate Jerome Kersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not here to judge him, I'm here to coach him,'' Knicks  
coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``I'm not really thinking about what 
happened in the past. I'm really looking forward to what he can do 
in the future. He's talented, he's a competitor and he's a 
complement to some of the other guys we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will be at least another day before Sprewell gets to play  
with his new teammates. He did not practice today. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Johnson, soaking his right foot in ice after Thursday  
night's two-hour practice, said Sprewell takes the team up a notch. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a guy who can cause havoc on the defensive end for us,  
and he's definitely proven that he can score in this league,'' 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell will be used mostly in a three-guard alignment on  
offense and will be asked to be a defensive stopper against small 
forwards, shooting guards and point guards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks received special permission from the league to speak  
in person with Sprewell before making the trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison Square Garden president David Checketts, general manager  
Ernie Grunfeld and Van Gundy were among a four-man contingent that 
flew to Sprewell's hometown of Milwaukee last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how you can be completely sure about anyone after  
a couple hours in a meeting, but for two hours he looked me face to 
face and answered my questions, even the rough ones, in a real 
straightforward manner,'' Checketts said. ``He wanted another 
chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell will get that chance with the Knicks, who start the  
season without two of their most familiar faces, Starks and Charles 
Oakley, and with only one holdover, Patrick Ewing, from the team 
that went to the NBA Finals in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be strange for them not to be here,'' Ewing said.  
``They will definitely be missed not only as players but as 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still undetermined is which of the six legitimate starters  
(Sprewell, Allan Houston, Ewing, Johnson, Charlie Ward and Marcus 
Camby) will have to come off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``A championship team knows how to sacrifice for each other, and  
if everybody is on the same page, we will be fine,'' Houston said.

<HEADLINE>  Sen. Byrd Wants Charges Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writers    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An influential Senate Democratic elder  
abruptly called for dismissal of charges against President Clinton 
on Friday to ``end this sad and sorry time for our country,'' 
jolting the impeachment trial as defense lawyers and prosecutors 
argued the case under questioning from senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert C. Byrd's statement underscored Clinton's strength  
among Democrats as the Senate moves toward test votes on articles 
of impeachment alleging perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans talked of trying to find an exit strategy from  
the two-week trial, but several predicted any effort to end the 
proceedings early next week, as Byrd urged, would fail in a near 
party-line vote. ``I don't know of any Republicans who will vote to 
dismiss,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans command a 55-45 majority in the Senate, and if  
united, can win any test vote on which a simple majority is 
sufficient to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	But Byrd, who once said his vote on Clinton could go either way,  
said -- and even one House prosecutor agreed -- that the two-thirds 
majority it would take to convict the president did not exist in 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	And Byrd went a step further, saying, ``It is not likely to  
develop.'' The senator, whose words carry special weight given his 
standing as a defender of the Senate's precedents and prerogatives, 
said he will move to dismiss the charges and end the trial next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current rules, a motion to dismiss the proceedings may  
be made after the senators' questioning, which is to continue on 
Saturday. With Sunday off, that means the motion could come as soon 
as Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde, the lead prosecutor, instantly issued his own  
rebuttal to Byrd's announcement: ``We hope and expect that the 
Senate will reject this motion and continue an expeditious search 
for the facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, answering a question in the Senate, Hyde said that  
dismissal would be ``cavalier treatment'' of impeachment, and he 
urged that the trial go on. ``I know what an annoyance we are in 
the bosom of this great body,'' he said. ``But we are a 
constitutional annoyance and I remind you of that fact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd sat in the second row, silent, like his colleagues, as  
Chief Justice William Rehnquist read Republican and Democratic 
questions in turn to lawyers on opposing sides in the impeachment 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	It was essentially a reargument of the opening presentations  
made over six long days, this time with prompting. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans asked the House prosecutors whether they still  
wanted to call witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The House definitely holds to the position that we should call  
witnesses,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	After he spoke, it was time for a Democratic question to  
Clinton's lawyers: What did they think of McCollum's comments? 
</P>
<P>
	``What would the witnesses add?'' asked attorney David Kendall.  
``They would add nothing.'' House prosecutors, he said, are 
``hoping maybe something will turn up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that once witnesses were called, the trial would go  
on and on. ``I think you are looking realistically at a process of 
many months,'' he said, echoing claims made by the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Even newly re-elected GOP national chairman Jim Nicholson  
conceded that impeachment has taken a toll on his party. 
Republicans ``have sustained political damage,'' he said. But he 
also argued that Democrats will suffer more in the long run for 
defending Clinton and ``failing to stand up for basic democratic 
... values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans were divided on whether the case should be dropped  
short of a final impeachment vote if it was clear the votes were 
lacking. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah suggested that some witnesses be  
questioned privately without testifying in the Senate. Then, if 
it's ``absolutely guaranteed'' there aren't 67 votes to convict, he 
said the Senate could pass legislation recognizing the House 
impeachment as ``the highest vote of condemnation and of censure 
for the president's despicable acts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas said there should be a vote on the  
articles of impeachment themselves. ``I think we're going to go the 
distance,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle sought to depict next  
week's test vote as just that. ``We believe a vote to dismiss is a 
vote on the articles,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans declined to say how they would vote on a motion  
to dismiss the trial. One moderate, John Chafee of Rhode Island, is 
leaning against it, according to a spokesman. Conservative Richard 
Shelby of Alabama, who would not commit, told reporters that White 
House lawyers had ``raised a lot of doubts about the articles of 
impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And GOP Sen. Connie Mack of Florida said a handful of Democrats  
were rumored to be ready to vote for witnesses. Clinton is accused 
of perjury and obstruction of justice for attempting to conceal a 
sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House reacted to Byrd's proposal with cautious  
optimism. ``Senator Byrd's statement speaks for itself. Our 
position has been clear. We believe in a fair, bipartisan and 
expeditious resolution of this whole matter,'' spokesman James 
Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	On matters large and small, Byrd has left his impact on the  
second presidential impeachment trial in the nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
	In a closed-door bipartisan caucus more than two weeks ago, he  
urged all senators to put aside partisan differences and produce a 
set of ground rules that would reflect dignity on the Senate, where 
he has served for more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	A few days later, he objected to the placement of a television  
camera that prevented the main doors of the Senate from being 
closed while the trial was in session. The offending camera was 
instantly removed, on orders of Majority Leader Trent Lott. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd had kept Clinton's defenders guessing about his intentions  
on key issues in the trial, and cautioned them publicly not to 
lobby him to vote for acquittal. Democratic officials had said in 
recent days they were fearful he would side with Republicans who 
want to call witnesses to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd said he made made his decision ``not because I believe that  
the president did no wrong, but because ``it is necessary that we 
begin now the process of healing and reconciling the differences'' 
caused by impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of Republicans have suggested in recent days that a way  
be found to end the trial promptly, despite fresh requests from 
House prosecutors for witnesses to be called. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott suggested to reporters earlier in the day that a bipartisan  
caucus might be called next week to allow all senators to attempt 
to fashion guidelines for the remainder of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle said he'd be interested in  
discussing the idea with Lott. But, he added, in a flash of 
annoyance, ``I would appreciate it if he'd talk to me before he 
talks to you, frankly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, one House prosecutor, Rep. George Gekas of  
Pennsylvania, said he did not believe any Democrats have been 
swayed by the evidence of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 12 of the 45 Democrats would have to vote for  
conviction in order to remove Clinton from office.

<HEADLINE>  Sen. Byrd Wants Charges Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writers    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An influential Senate Democratic elder  
abruptly called for dismissal of charges against President Clinton 
on Friday to ``end this sad and sorry time for our country,'' 
jolting the impeachment trial as defense lawyers and prosecutors 
argued the case under questioning from senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert C. Byrd's statement underscored Clinton's strength  
among Democrats as the Senate moves toward test votes on articles 
of impeachment alleging perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans talked of trying to find an exit strategy from  
the two-week trial, but several predicted any effort to end the 
proceedings early next week, as Byrd urged, would fail in a near 
party-line vote. ``I don't know of any Republicans who will vote to 
dismiss,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans command a 55-45 majority in the Senate, and if  
united, can win any test vote on which a simple majority is 
sufficient to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	But Byrd, who once said his vote on Clinton could go either way,  
said -- and even one House prosecutor agreed -- that the two-thirds 
majority it would take to convict the president did not exist in 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	And Byrd went a step further, saying, ``It is not likely to  
develop.'' The senator, whose words carry special weight given his 
standing as a defender of the Senate's precedents and prerogatives, 
said he will move to dismiss the charges and end the trial next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current rules, a motion to dismiss the proceedings may  
be made after the senators' questioning, which is to continue on 
Saturday. With Sunday off, that means the motion could come as soon 
as Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde, the lead prosecutor, instantly issued his own  
rebuttal to Byrd's announcement: ``We hope and expect that the 
Senate will reject this motion and continue an expeditious search 
for the facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, answering a question in the Senate, Hyde said that  
dismissal would be ``cavalier treatment'' of impeachment, and he 
urged that the trial go on. ``I know what an annoyance we are in 
the bosom of this great body,'' he said. ``But we are a 
constitutional annoyance and I remind you of that fact.''

<HEADLINE> Bears Hiring of McGinnis on Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- Dave McGinnis' introduction as the  
Chicago Bears' new coach is on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Bears announced this morning that they'd hired the  
Arizona Cardinals defensive coordinator, and scheduled an afternoon 
news conference to officially introduce him. But an hour after it 
was supposed to start, Bears vice president of operations Ted 
Phillips said there'd been a delay. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a number of issues that still have to be resolved, and  
we don't really have a timetable right now for when it will be 
resolved,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what the problem was, a serious-looking Phillips refused  
to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not at liberty to discuss those,'' he said. ``There's just  
several issues that have to be discussed. That's all I can say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGinnis, who spent 10 years in Chicago as an assistant, would  
replace Dave Wannstedt, who was fired at the end of the season 
after the Bears' second 4-12 finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Team president Michael McCaskey interviewed five candidates, but  
McGinnis was considered a favorite. McCaskey made it clear he 
wanted someone who could restore the Bears' imposing, bruising 
defense of the late 1980s and early 1990s, and McGinnis had the 
credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the linebackers coach when Mike Singletary, Otis Wilson  
and Wilber Marshall were in their prime. The Bears were 95-64 when 
McGinnis was an assistant, and the defense ranked among the top six 
in fewest yards allowed in seven of those 10 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, Chicago's defense allowed a league-low 187 points.  
</P>
<P>
	However, the Cardinals' defense over the past three years has  
ranked 21st, 27th and 21st in total yards allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	After interviewing with McCaskey on Thursday, McGinnis called  
the Bears job ``anyone's dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just an honor to be standing here, even be considered for  
this type of position,'' he said. ``This, to me, is one of the 
premier spots in this business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Bears coach Mike Ditka said McGinnis knows the Bears'  
tradition and how important it is that they build on it ``because 
he's a part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Dave is a good guy to have,'' said Ditka, now coaching the New  
Orleans Saints. ``He's smart. He's got the personality and 
character you need, and he'll be able to do a good job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGinnis said he's impressed with some of the changes the Bears  
have made since he left for Arizona three years ago. Gone is the 
old Halas Hall practice facility. In its place is a 
state-of-the-art center that's been called best in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Having spent 10 years in Chicago, McGinnis said he had a better  
understanding of the job than most. 
</P>
<P>
	``My 10 years here were not just an association with players and  
coaches,'' he said. ``It was an association I felt at a time in a 
city that embraces its sports teams unlike any city in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other candidates interviewed were: Jacksonville defensive  
coordinator Dick Jauron; Kansas City Chiefs defensive coordinator 
Gunther Cunningham; Buffalo offensive coordinator Joe Pendry and 
Green Bay offensive coordinator Sherm Lewis. Earlier today, 
Cunningham was hired as head coach of the Chiefs.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Comments on Disarmament Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The United States laid out its position for the  
world's ``next major'' disarmament treaty on Thursday, urging that 
a ban on the material used to make nuclear bombs target only future 
production rather than the huge amounts already stockpiled. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not agree to any restrictions on existing stocks in a  
`cutoff' treaty,'' John D. Holum, the top U.S. armament-control 
official, told the 61-nation Conference on Disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts are already under way among key nations to eliminate  
their stockpiles of so-called ``fissile material'' -- plutonium and 
highly enriched uranium -- and trying to add the issue to a new 
treaty would only backfire, said Holum, acting undersecretary of 
state for arms control. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference, whose past successes include treaties to ban  
chemical weapons and halt atomic testing, has spent the past two 
years deadlocked over what to do next. Only late in the last 
session did it agree to move toward a Fissile Material Cutoff 
Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Holum said he joined with other negotiators in expecting this to  
be ``the launching of the next major multilateral negotiation'' for 
a disarmament treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	He read a message from President Clinton saying such a treaty  
would move the world ``another step closer to the eventual goal of 
nuclear disarmament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty should provide for international inspection of all  
nuclear enrichment and reprocessing facilities, Holum said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides lacking support from the nuclear powers, there is  
another problem with including stockpiles, he warned. 
</P>
<P>
	``To include existing stocks in any way, even if just  
declarations of existing military stockpiles, could legally codify 
and recognize the right to have such stocks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	This could legitimize the nuclear weapons programs of countries  
outside the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, he said, clearly 
referring to India and Pakistan, which brought their nuclear 
programs into the open with a series of tests last year. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S.-Russian efforts to reduce their own stockpiles show the  
best way to eliminate fissile material, said Holum. Other countries 
also should negotiate with potential rivals to eliminate their 
stockpiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. and Russia have each declared hundreds of tons of  
fissile material in excess of defense needs'' and have agreements 
including commitments to reduce highly enriched uranium and dispose 
of excess plutonium, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two countries are working with the Vienna-based  
International Atomic Energy Agency ``to ensure that such stocks 
will never again be used in weapons,'' Holum said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peru said the countries with nuclear weapons must ``start an  
irreversible process to achieve their total elimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The nuclear powers must commit themselves directly to that  
end,'' said Peruvian Ambassador Jorge Voto Bernales.

<HEADLINE> Satcher Praises Clinton on Tobacco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Surgeon General David Satcher praised  
President Clinton's decision to sue tobacco companies and warned 
that cigarettes, cigars and chewing tobacco are ``toxins'' that 
steal a child's opportunity for a healthy life. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to about 200 people attending a children's health  
conference on Thursday, Satcher said everyone has the 
responsibility to protect children from deadly influences. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need in this country a system that actually promotes  
healthy lifestyles, and that includes avoiding toxins like tobacco, 
excessive use of alcohol and illicit drugs,'' Satcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children don't decide in utero whether they're going to be  
exposed to tobacco, alcohol, or crack cocaine,'' he added. 
``Children don't have those choices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton announced Tuesday in his State of the Union address that  
the Justice Department would sue the tobacco industry in an effort 
to recover federal health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Satcher, who took over as surgeon general in February 1998, also  
said he supports Clinton's proposal to increase cigarette taxes by 
55 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some studies show that for every 10 percent increase in price,  
there's a 7 percent decrease in smoking with children and 4 percent 
decrease in adults,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Satcher also suggested ways to spend the money raised by the  
tax. He'd like to see more research done on how to get teen-agers 
to quit smoking, and what makes them start in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not measured yet the impact of smoking in the movies  
or on TV, where the hero or heroine is smoking,'' he said. ``I 
don't see anything that it has to do with the script, yet we often 
see them with cigarettes in their mouth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smoking is responsible for more than 400,000 deaths each year,  
making it the leading cause of death in the United States, he said.

<HEADLINE> Sugar, Cocoa Fall on Supply Worries  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sugar and cocoa futures fell anew Friday on the Board of Trade  
of the City of New York as market participants continued to fret 
that Brazil's currency devaluation will lead to a flood of exports 
from the Latin American country. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, grain futures advanced, while soybeans  
retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar and cocoa futures prices have fallen nearly in step with  
Brazil's real, whose value has tumbled nearly 30 percent against 
the U.S. dollar in just over a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants expect farmers in Brazil, the world's  
largest sugar grower and fourth-largest cocoa grower, to boost 
exports sharply in coming days since the cheaper real allows them 
to slash prices and get more from dollar-based commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar prices are closing in on 11-year lows of 6.6 cents a pound  
as investors eye weak world demand and a large global sugar crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa farmers also has the misfortune this year to produce large  
harvests, at a time when demand from processors for making 
chocolate unexpectedly declined. U.S. processor demand fell nearly 
2 percent in the last three months of 1998. Investors are hoping 
demand will rebound as processors begin making chocolate for the 
Easter holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Raw sugar for March delivery fell .37 cent, or 5 percent, to  
7.10 cents a pound. March cocoa fell $33, or 2.4 percent, to $1,317 
a ton. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain futures prices rose moderately Friday on the Chicago Board  
of Trade, while soybean futures retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans retreated after influential forecasting firm Spark Cos.  
of Memphis, Tenn., predicted record U.S. soybean plantings this 
spring -- at a time when inventories are expected to remain high 
because of weak export demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Further depressing prices were updated forecasts calling for  
beneficial weather in competing Brazilian growing regions. Amid 
expectations that Brazil will harvest a large crop this year is a 
backdrop in which economic problems may lead to increased exports. 
Most commodities are priced in U.S. dollars, so export sales could 
bring in more hard currency to cash-strapped Brazilian shippers. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures found support on Sparks' forecast for smaller  
acreage planted this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures advanced as market participants worried that heavy  
rains over the past few days and forecasts for even more in the 
next two weeks could flood winter wheat farms. 
</P>
<P>
	March wheat rose 3 1/4 cents to $2.71 1/4 a bushel; March corn rose 1/4  
cent to $2.16 1/4 a bushel; March oats were unchanged at $1.07 1/4 a 
bushel; March soybeans fell 4 3/4 cent s to $5.25 3/4 a bushel.

	The resignation came one day before a special IOC commission  
meets to conclude its inquiry into the Olympics' biggest corruption 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said Attarabulsi, 61, an IOC member since 1977,  
stepped down because of revelations that his son received college 
scholarships at Utah schools from Salt Lake City boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I accepted his resignation and I thanked him for his 22 years  
as a member of the IOC, what he did for sport in his country and 
for us,'' Samaranch said in a telephone interview. ``He's a good 
man. He did (made) a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attarabulsi's son, Suhel, has said he received tuition at  
Brigham Young University and other Utah schools, plus $700 a month 
for expenses. On his application to BYU, the address he listed was 
the Salt Lake bid committee offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Finland's Pirjo Haeggman became the first IOC casualty of the  
scandal when she resigned Tuesday. She was implicated because her 
former husband got jobs through Olympic bidding committees from 
Salt Lake City and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he didn't rule out further resignations this  
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	He said 13 members were implicated in the IOC's investigation  
into cash payments, college scholarships, free medical treatment, 
lavish gifts and other inducements related to Salt Lake's winning 
bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	With two resignations now in hand, Samaranch said seven other  
IOC members face possible expulsion from the committee unless they 
step down. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he did not know what, if any, action would be  
taken against four other members cited for minor violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the implicated members are expected to defend themselves  
in person before IOC vice president Dick Pound's commission 
Saturday. On Sunday, the IOC executive board will recommend 
expulsions of members and propose ways of overhauling the entire 
Olympic bidding and selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tomorrow, the ad-hoc (investigative) commission is meeting and  
will listen to many of the members implicated in the case,'' 
Samaranch said. ``Not all are coming. The day after, the commission 
will present a final report to the executive board and we will take 
decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The six-member inquiry panel, headed by Pound, has found that  
the payments and gifts to members from Salt Lake City boosters 
totaled almost $800,000, with some members receiving more than 
$100,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has called a special IOC assembly for March 17-18 to  
vote on expulsions and ratify new site-selection procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Members who choose not to resign will be suspended pending a  
vote of expulsion by the full assembly, where a two-thirds majority 
vote is required. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can not expel the members,'' Samaranch said. ``We can only  
propose this. The session must take the final decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic officials and press reports have identified the other  
members accused of serious violations meriting possible expulsion 
as Agustin Arroyo (Ecuador), Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gafir 
(Sudan), Jean-Claude Ganga (Republic of Congo), Laime Keita (Mali), 
Charles Mukora (Kenya), Sergio Santander (Chile) and David Sibandze 
(Swaziland). 
</P>
<P>
	The four members cited for lesser infractions have been  
identified as Anton Geesink (Netherlands), Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye 
(Ivory Coast), Kim Un-Yong (South Korea) and Vitaly Smirnov 
(Russia). 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Samaranch confirmed the IOC was ready to  
investigate any documented allegations of corruption during other 
Olympic bid campaigns. Since the Salt Lake City scandal broke last 
month, reports of vote-buying and other misconduct have emerged 
from several other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have on the table some facts regarding some other cities  
and will investigate,'' Samaranch said. ``The Pound commission is 
only for Salt Lake City, but we can appoint another commission with 
the same powers, maybe with the same people. But we have to act on 
facts and not rumors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said his priority is to restore ``the prestige'' of  
the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we lost during these weeks, we have to get back,'' he  
said. ``We have to work hard. Myself, I will do my best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake Olympic Committee spokesman Frank Zang said the  
organizing committee would have no comment until the IOC has 
announced its findings. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who has been president since 1980, reiterated he has  
no intention of resigning, despite calls from outside the IOC for 
him to step down to take responsibility for misconduct that took 
place under his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this moment, I have to be at the head of the International  
Olympic Committee more than ever,'' Samaranch said. `I have to try 
to help to solve these problems.''

<HEADLINE> Postal Service Gets Good Marks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite all the wisecracks and in this age of  
cynicism about government, most Americans say they are satisfied 
with the Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Rates increased this month for the first time in four years,  
raising the cost of sending a first-class letter one penny, to 33 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
	A third of those questioned in an Associated Press poll said the  
stamp costs too much. But the remainder said it was about right or 
a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost three-fourths of Americans believe the Postal Service is  
doing an excellent or good job, said the AP poll by ICR of Media, 
Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Howard, a 42-year-old scientist from the San Francisco  
area, is among those who still considers the cost of sending a 
letter a pretty good deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lady who delivers our mail is a wonderful person,'' he  
said. But Howard's not always as happy with the service at the post 
office, where ``tellers aren't always the most pleasant people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 1,015 adults by ICR was taken Jan. 13-17 and has an  
error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Attitudes about the Postal Service, long the butt of jokes for  
delayed deliveries, bureaucratic boggle and disgruntled workers, 
have improved over the last five years. In 1994, just over six of 
10 said they viewed the Postal Service as excellent or good. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency has worked hard over the last six years to improve  
both its businesslike performance and public perception, officials 
say. Post offices have been modernized, internal procedures 
revamped and the service has actually operated in the black, said 
spokesman Roy Betts. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers seem to have noticed.  
</P>
<P>
	Almost a third of those polled said they think service is better  
now than five years ago. Sixty percent think it's about the same. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked their biggest concern, the leading issue was the  
speed of mail delivery, mentioned by just over a third. The cost of 
stamps was mentioned by about one in 10, as was counter service. 
Forty percent said they had no concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite competition from companies such as Federal Express and  
UPS, almost two-thirds said they use the post office to send 
packages. Postal officials say business users are more likely than 
other people to use the competing services. 
</P>
<P>
	Last March, the Postal Service ranked highest among all federal  
agencies in favorable ratings with the public, according to a 
survey by the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press. The 
independent accounting firm Price Waterhouse found in 1997 that 
overnight first-class mail was delivered on time more than 90 
percent of the time, 10 points higher than in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	That track record is no small accomplishment for an operation  
that handles 41 percent of the world's mail volume, more than 650 
million pieces of mail every day, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Public loyalty to the Postal Service may have much to do with  
the day-to-day contact many people have with its letter carriers, 
said Rep. John McHugh, R-N.Y., head of the House subcommittee on 
the Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``The person who brings the mail is almost a member of the  
family who visits each and every day,'' McHugh said. 
</P>
<P>
	If there's any area the Postal Service, with its 800,000  
employees, acknowledges needing work, it's in labor relations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's clear that conditions on the workroom floor, the  
animosity between management and labor, is amongst the worst in the 
American workplace,'' McHugh said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the final product is generally appreciated.  
</P>
<P>
	Kate Muth of Arlington, Va., who writes an independent trade  
publication called ``Business Mailers' Review,'' said the rate 
increase has caused barely a stir. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't heard too much grousing,'' she said. ``For 33 cents,  
you can get your letter anywhere in the country. And service is 
improving.''

<HEADLINE>  Libyan IOC Member Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee  
delegate from Libya resigned today, the second member of the 
governing body to step down in the wake of Salt Lake City bribery 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch told The Associated Press  
that Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi submitted his resignation in person 
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The resignation came one day before a special IOC commission  
meets to conclude its inquiry into the Olympics' biggest corruption 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said Attarabulsi, 61, an IOC member since 1977,

<HEADLINE> Russia Plans 3 More Years for Mir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov signed a  
decree today to keep the Mir space station in orbit for three more 
years, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is almost certain to disappoint U.S. space officials,  
who want Russia to abandon the Mir in coming months so Moscow can 
spend its limited resources on building the new International Space 
Station. 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov's decree was announced by the government press service.  
No additional details were immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mir has been in orbit for almost 13 years, far longer than  
any other space station. It suffered several serious breakdowns in 
1997, but has been running smoothly for more than a year now. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian space officials are deeply attached to the Mir and have  
repeatedly said that it can continue to house human visitors for 
several years to come. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Russia is chronically short of cash, and critics say it  
can't afford to fund two separate space stations. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and other countries have paid the Russians  
hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years to rent space for 
their astronauts on the Mir. The money has helped keep the Russian 
space program going. 
</P>
<P>
	The new International Space Station includes 16 nations, led by  
the United States and Russia. The first two parts were launched in 
November and December, though no people are expected to start 
living on the station for about one more year. 
</P>
<P>
	The project is already more than a year behind schedule, due to  
large part to Russian delays in constructing a key module. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. space officials fear there will be additional delays -- and  
additional costs to U.S. taxpayers -- if the Russians do not abandon 
the Mir and focus on the new space station. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian cosmonaut Viktor Afanasyev, French astronaut Jean-Pierre  
Heignere and Slovak Ivan Bella, meanwhile, are scheduled to blast 
off to the Mir on Feb. 20 atop a Soyuz rocket from the Baikonur 
cosmodrome in the former Soviet republic of Kazakstan. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 10-day stint on Mir, Bella will return to Earth with  
Mir's current commander Gennady Padalka. Padalka's crewmate Sergei 
Avdeyev will stay aboard with Afanasyev and Heignere through the 
summer, until a scheduled Aug. 21 return.

<HEADLINE> Rockets Still Work on Pippen Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Houston Rockets welcomed their latest  
superstar at their first practice in eight months. 
</P>
<P>
	Then they went home without working out and with Scottie Pippen  
still not officially a member of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	After a delay of nearly four hours in a scheduled announcement,  
Rockets owner Les Alexander called off the celebration late 
Thursday night by announcing there was a problem with the wording 
in the collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take some time.'' Alexander said.  
</P>
<P>
	Alexander stressed that the deal would be done, and Pippen  
already was getting used to his new surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to thank all the fans for being very warm to me  
around the city the little time I've been here,'' Pippen said. 
``I'm looking forward to bringing a champion here. I can see I'm 
going to have a wonderful career here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Sexton, Pippen's agent, said the problem was not with  
Pippen's five-year, $67.2 million contract. The Rockets and Pippen 
declined to define the contract problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing wrong with the contract,'' Sexton said.  
``It's just that with us getting a chance to look at the collective 
bargaining agreement so late today, we have to work through the 
night to get it corrected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have it corrected later tonight. It has nothing to do  
with the trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets must sign Pippen to put themselves over the salary  
cap before they can sign their other players. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the collective bargaining agreement, teams can  
still sign their own free agents even if they are over the salary 
cap. But if the other players signed first, they could not add 
Pippen to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Rudy Tomjanovich canceled the scheduled first practice  
that was supposed to follow the announcement of Pippen's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Bulls signed Pippen, then sent him to the Rockets  
for a second-round draft choice and forward Roy Rogers. Pippen will 
be paid $10.6 million this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets also re-signed free agent Charles Barkley for $1  
million. With typical flare, Barkley signed his contract on the 
10th tee at La Quinta, Calif., where he was playing in the Bob Hope 
Desert Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets started the day with only three players under  
contract, center Hakeem Olajuwon, guard Brent Price and second year 
guard-forward Rodrick Rhodes, who is out 6-8 weeks following 
surgery to repair a torn tendon in his right pectoral muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets called a 6 p.m. EST news conference to announce  
Pippen's signing, but delayed the announcement for one hour to 
complete the deal. That turned into a lengthy wait for the Rockets 
players, who lounged in their locker room at Westside Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, 33, had been with the Bulls since the 1987-88 season  
when he was drafted out of Central Arkansas. He averaged 19.1 
points and 5.2 rebounds last season when the Bulls won their sixth 
NBA championship of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen will form a formidable front line with Barkley and  
Olajuwon following the retirement of Clyde Drexler after last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal gives the Rockets three of the players ranked among the  
top 50 in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets are hoping for the same result as in 1995 when they  
got Drexler from the Portland Trail Blazers and won a second 
straight NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets sent Chucky Brown, Mark Bryant, Sam Cassell and  
Robert Horry to Phoenix in 1996 to bring Barkley on board, but 
another title didn't follow. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50-game schedule might be conducive to the aging Rockets,  
but the condensed time game could cause problems. Barkley is 35, 
Pippen 33, Olajuwon 36 and Eddie Johnson 39. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets have four days to get ready for the first exhibition  
game, on Tuesday against the San Antonio Spurs in Houston. Houston 
opens the regular season Feb. 5 at Los Angeles against Lakers. The 
home opener is Feb. 8 against the Denver Nuggets.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Used Impeachment To Raise Cash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just a few days before he presented the case  
against President Clinton at the Senate impeachment trial, 
Republican Rep. Lindsey Graham mailed letters to his South Carolina 
supporters appealing for political donations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The impeachment hearings were stressful for all of us and the  
upcoming Senate trial will be no less difficult,'' Graham wrote in 
letter seeking donations from $25 to more than $100. He warned in 
the letter that Republicans might face stronger election challenges 
in 2000 for their role in the impeachment saga. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe what I did was right, and I will continue to  
represent you to the best of my ability,'' the letter continues. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham was unopposed for re-election last fall and had $190,929  
in his campaign bank account on Nov. 23, according to his Federal 
Election Commission report. But Graham said in his fund-raising 
letter that his advocacy of impeachment could be costly. 
</P>
<P>
	``As visibility increases for many Republicans due to the  
impeachment process, the likelihood for opposition in the next 
election also increases,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must accumulate the necessary resources to answer critics,  
send a strong signal to potential opponents that we are firmly 
united, and that we will not compromise our conservative 
principles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A member of the House Judiciary Committee, Graham was one of the  
13 House Republicans who presented the case for impeachment. He 
spoke to the Senate on Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund-raising letter obtained by The Associated Press was  
postmarked Jan. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	There is nothing illegal about what Graham did, but critics say  
it was a poor choice for someone directly involved in such a solemn 
proceeding to cite in a campaign money-raising appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people look upon this as a national trauma,'' said Larry  
Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, 
a non-partisan group that studies campaign spending. ``Apparently 
some members of Congress look upon this as a fund-raising 
opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham's spokesman, Kevin Bishop, said the congressman has sent  
a fund-raising letter at the start of every year since he took 
office in 1994 and pointed out that the solicitation also refers to 
issues such as Social Security, health care and tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a letter saying, 'We're impeaching the president. I'm  
asking for money so I can keep it up,''' Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham won accolades for a folksy presentation a week ago at the  
Senate trial in which he argued Clinton needed to be removed to 
restore ``honor and integrity'' to the presidency. ``Impeachment is 
about cleansing the office,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	First elected in 1994 with 60 percent of the vote, Graham played  
a major role in an unsuccessful effort in 1997 to oust Newt 
Gingrich as House speaker. On the Judiciary Committee, he opposed 
one of the four articles of impeachment originally lodged against 
Clinton -- the one alleging perjury in the Paula Jones sexual 
harassment case.

<HEADLINE> Miami Heat's Porter Nears Big Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Terry Porter signed with the Miami Heat to be the  
backup point guard. By the time he joined the team Friday, he was 
facing the prospect of a much bigger role. 
</P>
<P>
	Voshon Lenard's stress fracture has Miami weighing its options  
for another outside shooter, with Porter one of several choices if 
the Heat don't bring in somebody from outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited about that,'' said Porter, who missed Friday's  
first of two workouts while waiting for his contract to go through 
the NBA clearinghouse. ``I have the shot to play the position. I 
think I can bring another dimension to the Heat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lenard was scheduled for a second opinion Friday on the stress  
fracture in his left leg, which turned up during a routine 
pre-training camp exam. Doctors found a chip in his left shin. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgery would sideline Lenard eight to 10 weeks, about  
two-thirds of the NBA's condensed 50-games-in-90-days schedule. He 
also could choose to play but risks more severe injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll try to see how bad it is,'' Lenard said. ``If it's not  
that bad, I'll try to play and help this team. Maybe I can have 
surgery after the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lenard thinks the injury took place a year ago, when he was  
kicked during a game last February. He said that's when a bump 
appeared on his leg. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth-year guard played all but one game last season and  
had been a regular at the Heat's informal workouts while waiting 
for the collective bargaining agreement to be signed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't hurt too much once I got warmed up,'' Lenard said.  
``But once we started going back and forth, back and forth, I 
started feeling it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Lenard has surgery, there is no clear option to replace him.  
Jamal Mashburn could move to the backcourt from small forward or 
Dan Majerle could move into the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Pat Riley didn't appear too concerned Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know it doesn't look like we have scoring punch, but we have  
four guys who can put up the 3,'' Riley said. ``The question is 
whether or not we can make them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Enter Porter. A point guard most of his 13-year career,  
including 10 years in Portland, his 13.4 career scoring average is 
better than Lenard's 11.4. Though he averaged just 9.5 points last 
year in Minnesota, his output the final 49 games was 12.5. 
</P>
<P>
	A Porter-Tim Hardaway pairing would give Miami a versatile duo  
in which either can score or run the point. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a wily veteran,'' Hardaway said of Porter. ``He makes the  
intelligent pass and doesn't make many mistakes. You can't ask for 
a better guy. He'll fit into our system very quickly.''

<HEADLINE> Heat Hurt by Lenard's Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- On the most frenzied day in history for most of the  
NBA, the Miami Heat saw their stability take a hit without a trade 
or losing a big-name free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting guard Voshon Lenard was discovered to have a stress  
fracture in his left leg as training camp opened Thursday, possibly 
putting him out of action for more than half the 50-game regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgery would mean an absence of 8-10 weeks for the fourth-year  
guard. With the condensed schedule brought on by the lockout, that 
could leave as few as 20 games left in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure what I will do,'' Lenard said. ``If it's not that  
serious, I'm going to try to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was an inauspicious note for what was mostly a low-key  
opening for the Heat, who began with eight players under contract 
and brought in seven more, with an eighth on his way. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's only significant move was to come to terms with free  
agent guard Terry Porter, who played the past three seasons in 
Minnesota. Four other free agents -- forwards Mark Strickland and 
Keith Askins, guard Rex Walters and center Marty Conlon -- were 
brought back from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love it,'' center Alonzo Mourning said. ``I've said from day  
one that the most important thing is to keep our core guys 
together. That's the way teams succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami tried to pry guard Latrell Sprewell from Golden State, but  
lost out to New York in the bidding. Lenard's loss exaggerates the 
Heat's need for another scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	Small forward Jamal Mashburn could move into the backcourt, or  
Dan Majerle could move into the starting lineup. Porter also can 
play the off-guard spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we have to win with that, we can,'' guard Tim Hardaway  
said. ``We've got to keep the faith in everybody and play harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also absent Thursday was free-agent guard Brent Barry, acquired  
from the Los Angeles Clippers last year in a trade-deadline deal 
for Isaac Austin. Barry struggled under Riley's system and has 
given all indications he won't wear a Miami uniform again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat could use Barry in a sign-and-trade deal to get help.  
Deals with Chicago for Scott Burrell and Golden State for Clarence 
Weatherspoon have been mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
	But Riley stressed that a sign-and-trade ``doesn't necessarily  
have to happen. If the right team comes along (to offer Barry a 
deal), he doesn't have to wait for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat play exhibition games Jan. 30 and Feb. 1 against  
Orlando, then open the regular season Feb. 5 at home against 
Detroit.

<HEADLINE> Gugliotta Leaves Suns Without Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Tom Gugliotta left Phoenix on Friday without  
reaching a contract agreement with the Suns and has asked for a 
meeting with Minnesota Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	Suns owner Jerry Colangelo said he expects Gugliotta to reach a  
decision by late Saturday. Colangelo said the free agent forward 
apparently is considering re-signing with Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess that's the viable option he has, that or some kind of  
sign-and-trade,'' Colangelo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor said he got a call Friday from Gugliotta's agent, Richard  
Howell, asking for a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``My understanding is that they have an offer from Phoenix and  
they are in the decision-making mode,'' Taylor said. ``I said if 
Tommy wants to meet with me, certainly I would meet with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta was returning to Minneapolis and apparently planned to  
meet with Taylor on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's say they come back and want us to work out a trade and  
have something they want us to help them with, I would sit down and 
talk to them,'' Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he also would be open to signing Gugliotta to a one-year  
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns could offer Gugliotta a six-year deal worth about $60  
million. Minnesota could give him $86 million over seven years, the 
maximum allowed for a team to re-sign one of its players. Phoenix's 
offer presumably would include a clause that would allow Gugliotta 
to opt out after five years and become eligible for a much bigger 
salary as a 10-year veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta arrived in Phoenix late Thursday night, in the midst  
of the bizarre Antonio McDyess situation, and met at America West 
Arena with Colangelo, his son, general manager Bryan Colangelo, and 
coach Danny Ainge. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a lot of positive feedback,'' Ainge joked, ``but, hey,  
I had a year of positive feedback from McDyess, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta reportedly was close to a deal with the Suns on  
Thursday, before word spread that McDyess was reconsidering his 
decision to abandon Phoenix and sign with the Denver Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess finally signed with Denver on Friday, and with Gugliotta  
leaving town without a contract agreement, the Suns faced the 
prospect of winding up without either player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very nervous, no question about it,'' Ainge said.  
</P>
<P>
	If they lose Gugliotta, there were fewer and fewer free agents  
who haven't already committed to a team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking a little bit of a gamble,'' Ainge said. ``We let  
some guys go who are good basketball players but aren't Tom 
Gugliotta. That's why being on Jerry Colangelo's side is a great 
comfort, because he's not afraid. Some people are afraid in this 
business and bailed out on Tom Gugliotta. We're playing a risky a 
business here, but sometimes you've got to take a risk to get a 
break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo declined to say whether he was optimistic that  
Gugliotta would sign with the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll just have to wait and see,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Howell did not return repeated telephone calls to his office on  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Timberwolves agreed to terms with free agent Joe Smith on  
Friday, but he did not sign a contract. Colangelo said that even if 
Smith signed, it wouldn't affect Minnesota's ability to re-sign 
Gugliotta. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, there had been reports that the Los Angeles Lakers were  
interested in a sign-and-trade deal with the Timberwolves that 
would send Eddie Jones, Elden Campbell and Sam Jacobsen to 
Minnesota for Gugliotta. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta's indecision was holding up several other Suns moves,  
including re-signing free agents Rex Chapman and Clifford Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns did sign five lesser players on Friday, including  
second-round draft pick Toby Bailey. The others were Joe Kleine, 
Horacia Llamas, Marko Milik and James Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	Chapman, Jason Kidd and George McCloud all flew by charter to  
Denver Thursday night to talk to McDyess, after the young forward 
held up signing with the Nuggets at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns were awaiting for Chicago general manager Jerry Krause  
to finish a sign-and-trade deal that sends Luc Longley to Phoenix. 
Longley is in Phoenix and is working out informally. He said he was 
confident the deal would be approved. Phoenix is sending Mark 
Bryant, Martin Muursepp and Bubba Wells to the Bulls.

<HEADLINE> IOC VP: Salt Lake Was Out of Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A campaign to ``win friends'' -- and the 2002  
Winter Games -- for Salt Lake City spun out of control into the 
biggest scandal in Olympics history, the IOC's top investigator 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	While his month-old inquiry found no signs of criminal behavior,  
International Olympic Committee Vice President Dick Pound said 
Thursday that Salt Lake's bid went well beyond the rules, with 
six-figure gifts of cash and benefits to IOC members who also 
overstepped their limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Salt Lake folks were out to win friends, and they  
clearly thought friends would be more likely to support them than 
enemies, and did everything they could to strengthen those friendly 
ties,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a day of speeches and interviews prior to leaving for  
Switzerland to deliver his report to the IOC's executive board, 
Pound said rule-breakers in the committee would face expulsion and 
that more investigations and safeguards were needed to prevent a 
recurrence of the Salt Lake scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	He also issued a stirring apology to fans, athletes, sponsors  
and, especially, Salt Lake City, saying the IOC had dropped its 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unfortunate that a community that is so well prepared to  
host an Olympic Winter Games should have its overall integrity 
called into question,'' Pound told an audience of sports-marketing 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Salt Lake won because it had ``the best, most  
comprehensive bid. End of story,'' and probably lost four years 
earlier only because the IOC had just chosen Atlanta for the 1996 
Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound refused to identify the IOC members under investigation or  
say exactly what gifts Salt Lake bidders may have passed their way. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused, however, to deny a Wall Street Journal report that  
the payments totaled almost $800,000, and said they were spread 
fairly evenly among about a dozen of the committee's 114 members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the (implicated) members, but not all, received gifts  
in six figures,'' he said. ``That was in direct cash and 
benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As IOC investigators reviewed books of the Salt Lake City bid  
committee that won the games in 1995 on a fifth try, the amount of 
the gift packages grew, Pound said. He said they started in late 
1991, shortly after the city lost the 1998 Winter Games to Nagano 
by four votes, and continued in a few cases beyond the winning 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC investigators are now ``99.5 percent'' sure they have  
identified the members who broke the rules in Salt Lake, Pound 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other investigations are under way into the scandal,  
including ones by the Justice Department and the Utah attorney 
general. Pound, a Canadian tax lawyer, said his group found nothing 
``with the earmarks of criminal action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But if no direct bribes or vote buying in the secret ballot  
could be documented, Pound said, he had no doubt the payments made 
to win votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said his report deals only with the Salt Lake bid, but  
that broader investigations of how the IOC picks cities for the 
Olympics were needed. Letters would be sent to all committees that 
bid for Summer and Winter Games from 1996 through 2006, asking for 
details of any improprieties in their campaigns or improper 
approaches by members. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't make sense that Salt Lake is the first and only  
time this has happened,'' he said. ``We'll go from here to there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Summer Games in 1996 were the first awarded fully under IOC  
ethics rules limiting gifts from bid cities. The host for the 2006 
Winter Games will be picked by the IOC in June. 
</P>
<P>
	It is vital that those other bid committees tell all they know  
before a special general assembly in March called to deal with the 
corruption issue, according to Pound. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be best for all of us to deal fully, fairly and  
finally with this issue and not have it drag on,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound also said a permanent way to investigate corruption was  
needed by the IOC, both to root out wrongdoers and cement faith of 
sponsors, fans and athletes that the Olympics are clean on all 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has to be an ongoing mechanism to deal with this,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such oversight could come from an extension of his own panel's  
tenure or be a piece of an overall ethics code for the IOC, a 
private club whose main asset has become a billion-dollar sports 
marketing machine over the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about how many members were implicated in the scandal,  
Pound said to ``stick with'' the number of 13 given last week by 
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch. Two members, Pirjo Haeggman 
of Finland and Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi of Lybia, have since 
resigned. The Journal reported that 16 members would be implicated 
in the report. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pound disputed Samaranch's description of the investigation  
as having turned up nine ``serious'' cases worthy of expulsion and 
four other cases with fairly minor offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``A case is a case is a case,'' he said, noting that the only  
penalty provided in the IOC's bylaws was expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The supreme recourse for us is to expel a member, and that is  
what we are prepared to do,'' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound also said Samaranch should ignore calls to resign as IOC  
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Samaranch has an enormous amount of experience in  
managing the IOC through both good and bad times. And right now, we 
need that stability more than ever,'' he said. ``No one is more 
determined to correct this situation than he is. And no one is in a 
better position to manage the organization now.''

<HEADLINE>  Nuggets Finally Land McDyess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- It was a negotiating session with a little bit of  
everything. Celebrities. Espionage. Entertainment. Adventure. 
</P>
<P>
	Antonio McDyess' captivating 24 hours even had a happy ending --  
at least for the Denver Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess, one of the NBA's most sought-after power forwards,  
signed a six-year, $67.5 million contract with the Nuggets on 
Friday, concluding his maiden voyage into the no-holds-barred 
free-agent market. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if it was everything he bargained for, McDyess  
chuckled. ``And more,'' he said. ``I'm just glad to have it over 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure came from every direction after McDyess arrived in  
Denver on Thursday. When a 3 p.m. press conference was canceled, 
word spread that McDyess was having second thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't help matters that three Phoenix players flew to Denver  
and called McDyess from a stretch limousine outside McNichols Arena 
in hopes of convincing him to re-sign with the Suns, who acquired 
McDyess in a trade with Denver on Oct. 1, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuggets counterattacked by asking coaches Mike D'Antoni and  
John Lucas to brave a snowstorm and drive 60 miles from Denver's 
training camp in Colorado Springs to Denver. They brought along 
all-star point guard Nick Van Exel, a close friend of McDyess. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to fight fire with fire, and I knew they had become  
close friends,'' Denver general manager Dan Issel said. ``I know 
what this kid means. If the shoe was on the other foot, I probably 
would have done the same thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Issel and the Nuggets received unsolicited help from hockey  
goaltender Patrick Roy and the Colorado Avalanche, who were 
preparing for their game against Calgary while negotiations were 
taking place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone found out that Patrick Roy was his favorite player,''  
Issel said. ``When Pierre (Avalanche general manager Pierre 
Lacroix) came in and found that out, he said `Let me go see where 
he is.''' 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess later met Roy in the middle of his pregame rubdown, and  
Roy gave him the goaltending stick he was planning to use against 
Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, Antonio later sold it to a collector,'' Issel  
said. ``No, he didn't let go of that stick last night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although no deal was reached by midnight, the sides felt  
confident as they prepared to wrap things up Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought we had a chance to get him back,'' Issel said. ``We  
made our presentation to them. Our whole thing after that was not 
to pressure Antonio. We kind of backed away. In the final analysis, 
that might have helped us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess denied having second thoughts about choosing the  
Nuggets, who won just 11 games last season. He said he wanted to be 
confident about his decision before signing a contract at about 
noon Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phoenix was a great situation. It just didn't seem like I fit  
in like I did my first two years here,'' McDyess said. ``I needed 
that feeling back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Phoenix offered him more money -- seven years, $86  
million -- McDyess likely will make up the difference because his 
Denver contract has an escape clause after five years. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, McDyess will be eligible to re-sign at a higher  
maximum salary and receive a larger pay raise under terms of the 
NBA's new collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, I will finish my career here,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Van Exel, who can become a free agent this summer, might be  
saying the same thing after the lockout-shortened season. He and 
McDyess have become good friends, and Van Exel was instrumental in 
recruiting McDyess to Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wait until you see these guys together,'' said agent James  
Bryant, who represents both players. ``It's going to be the faster 
version of Stockton-Malone.''

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Far From Super for Some </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMARAC, Fla. (AP) -- Cynthia Pearlman doesn't know which teams  
are playing in the Super Bowl, but she's been looking forward to 
Jan. 31 for months. It's the day she gets her husband back. 
</P>
<P>
	During the season, she and women like her complain that their  
husbands or boyfriends put the game -- any football game -- ahead of 
spending time with them. The championship game brings deliverance 
from months of playing second string to a TV set. 
</P>
<P>
	``It starts at the beginning of the week, after the game is over  
on Sunday,'' said Pearlman, 58, a Tamarac resident originally from 
New York. ``Then they run to the paper on Monday morning to find 
out who's playing who, to find out what the point spread is, to 
find out if they can fit their golf game in between the football 
games that are going to be on television. And your life revolves 
around their schedule. And you get fed up with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pearlman won't get her husband, Allen, back until after the big  
game. An avid football fan who played during his high school days, 
Allen Pearlman has volunteered to usher at the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have his shoulder pads some place,'' his wife said.  
``He won't let me throw them out. We've moved five times and it's 
the first thing that goes into the truck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Football has cut into the scant time Susanne Lawson, 35, a golf  
pro at Woodmont Country Club in Tamarac, has to spend with her 
boyfriend, Rob. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll find a reason why each game every week has an importance  
for him to watch it,'' Lawson said. ``My only day off is on Sunday 
... It has gotten to the point now I'm just like, 'Go ahead, watch 
it. I'll find something else to do.''' 
</P>
<P>
	On the Internet, the football widows find companionship from the  
similarly abandoned in a custom-made chat group held during Monday 
night football. 
</P>
<P>
	Web sites, like www.sillysports.com/widow.htm, challenge  
visitors to ``strike out and get a life of your own while your man 
grows roots in front of the TV.'' The site features links to the 
Martha Stewart Living and Just Sports For Women Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, the Miami Dolphins drew 300 women to a  
three-hour, ladies-only demonstration led by coach Jimmy Johnson, 
filled with X's and O's designed to turn the women on to football.

	She said her husband, Ray, has tried to get her to watch  
football, to appreciate the rules and strategy, but it hasn't 
taken. Only once, when she was ``much younger'' and she rode her 
brother's knack for betting on the right point spread, did she 
watch an entire season of football.

her husband's ravenous football appetite by going back to work on

<HEADLINE> Steel Quota Bill Readied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some congressional members sympathetic to the  
plight of struggling steelworkers are preparing to seek quotas on 
foreign steel to pressure the Clinton administration to act. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Peter J. Visclosky, D-Ind., and Sen. Jay Rockefeller,  
D-W.Va., plan to introduce quota legislation early next month to 
restrict imports blamed for thousands of layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Such legislation stands little chance of becoming law and is  
likely to run afoul of international trade agreements, but its 
supporters believe that dire circumstances call for extreme 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Other lawmakers from steel-producing states, however, believe  
the approach is a wrong one, suggesting a fissure among supporters 
of the steelworkers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Rick Santorum, a Pennsylvania Republican who prefers more  
moderate legislation to help the industry, called quotas ``a 
mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It may help steel but it will hurt other companies. You'll  
have a trade war,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said U.S. companies that heavily export to other countries  
could find their markets cut off if those countries raise similar 
trade barriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Steel imports reached record levels in 1998 in the wake of the  
Asian economic crisis and have been blamed for at least 10,000 
layoffs and some U.S. company bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry has filed formal trade complaints seeking to impose  
tariffs on steel from Japan, Russia and Brazil, but those cases 
will not be resolved for several more months. 
</P>
<P>
	Visclosky acknowledged that his bill, which would limit monthly  
imports to the pre-crisis level of July 1997, would be ``very, very 
difficult'' to pass and would likely violate trade agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	But he told reporters that the mere act of proposing a quota  
would signal the administration and the world that ``the numerous 
members who get on this bill are serious about it, and we're not 
going away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Mastel, an economist with the Economic Strategy Institute  
in Washington, agreed that even if no quota legislation passes, 
offering one ``will have the desired political effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America,  
has been vocal about demanding quotas, saying they are needed to 
``stop the bleeding'' of U.S. jobs. Domestic steel producers 
largely have been silent on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Calif. To Try 1st Cyber-Stalk Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In the first case filed under a new state  
cyber-stalking law, prosecutors say a 50-year-old man retaliated 
against a woman who rebuffed his advances by impersonating her on 
the Internet as someone who fantasizes about being raped. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman was not physically harmed, but six men showed up at  
her small North Hollywood apartment between last April and July 
saying they were responding to her online ads. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman didn't even own a computer.  
</P>
<P>
	Gary Steven Dellapenta, a security guard, is charged with  
stalking; using a computer to commit fraud, deceive or extort; and 
solicitation to commit sexual assault, district attorney 
spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said Thursday. He was jailed in lieu of 
$300,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer, Irene G. Nunez, declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Dellapenta met the woman at church. His  
romantic advances were unrelenting, and she asked the church's 
elders to oust him from the congregation, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Dellapenta sent e-mails to men who responded to  
his ads posted on America Online and other Internet sites. They 
said Dellapenta not only told numerous men what the victim looked 
like, her address and phone number, but how to bypass her home 
security system. 
</P>
<P>
	California's cyber-stalking law took effect Jan. 1. The law  
applies to e-mails, faxes, the Internet, pagers or any electronic 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar laws exist in Arizona, Alaska, Connecticut, New York,  
Oklahoma and Wyoming.

<HEADLINE>  Nuggets Finally Land McDyess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- It was a negotiating session with a little bit of  
everything. Celebrities. Espionage. Entertainment. Adventure. 
</P>
<P>
	Antonio McDyess' captivating 24 hours even had a happy ending --  
at least for the Denver Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess, one of the NBA's most sought-after power forwards,  
signed a six-year, $67.5 million contract with the Nuggets on 
Friday, concluding his maiden voyage into the no-holds-barred 
free-agent market. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if it was everything he bargained for, McDyess  
chuckled. ``And more,'' he said. ``I'm just glad to have it over 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure came from every direction after McDyess arrived in  
Denver on Thursday. When a 3 p.m. press conference was canceled, 
word spread that McDyess was having second thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't help matters that three Phoenix players flew to Denver  
and called McDyess from a stretch limousine outside McNichols Arena 
in hopes of convincing him to re-sign with the Suns, who acquired 
McDyess in a trade with Denver on Oct. 1, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuggets counterattacked by asking coaches Mike D'Antoni and  
John Lucas to brave a snowstorm and drive 60 miles from Denver's 
training camp in Colorado Springs to Denver. They brought along 
all-star point guard Nick Van Exel, a close friend of McDyess. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to fight fire with fire, and I knew they had become  
close friends,'' Denver general manager Dan Issel said. ``I know 
what this kid means. If the shoe was on the other foot, I probably 
would have done the same thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Issel and the Nuggets received unsolicited help from hockey  
goaltender Patrick Roy and the Colorado Avalanche, who were 
preparing for their game against Calgary while negotiations were 
taking place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone found out that Patrick Roy was his favorite player,''  
Issel said. ``When Pierre (Avalanche general manager Pierre 
Lacroix) came in and found that out, he said `Let me go see where 
he is.''' 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess later met Roy in the middle of his pregame rubdown, and  
Roy gave him the goaltending stick he was planning to use against 
Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, Antonio later sold it to a collector,'' Issel  
said. ``No, he didn't let go of that stick last night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although no deal was reached by midnight, the sides felt  
confident as they prepared to wrap things up Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought we had a chance to get him back,'' Issel said. ``We  
made our presentation to them. Our whole thing after that was not 
to pressure Antonio. We kind of backed away. In the final analysis, 
that might have helped us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess denied having second thoughts about choosing the  
Nuggets, who won just 11 games last season. He said he wanted to be 
confident about his decision before signing a contract at about 
noon Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phoenix was a great situation. It just didn't seem like I fit  
in like I did my first two years here,'' McDyess said. ``I needed 
that feeling back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Phoenix offered him more money -- seven years, $86  
million -- McDyess likely will make up the difference because his 
Denver contract has an escape clause after five years. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, McDyess will be eligible to re-sign at a higher  
maximum salary and receive a larger pay raise under terms of the 
NBA's new collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, I will finish my career here,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Van Exel, who can become a free agent this summer, might be  
saying the same thing after the lockout-shortened season. He and 
McDyess have become good friends, and Van Exel was instrumental in 
recruiting McDyess to Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wait until you see these guys together,'' said agent James  
Bryant, who represents both players. ``It's going to be the faster 
version of Stockton-Malone.''

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Power Expert Stello Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Victor Stello Jr., a former civilian nuclear  
power regulator who played a key role in the response to the 
accident on Three Mile Island, died Friday at his home in Potomac, 
Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Stello, 64, had cancer.  
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, Stello had served as a principal deputy  
assistant secretary at the Department of Energy, focusing on safety 
and quality in defense programs. He came to the department in 1989, 
and worked in many areas highlighting his expertise in nuclear 
operations safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``He instilled a serious safety culture in everything we do,''  
said Dr. Victor Ries, the department's assistant secretary for 
defense programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Stello also spent nearly a quarter of a century with the Nuclear  
Regulatory Commission and its predecessor, the Atomic Energy 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	He was involved in the response to the nation's worst commercial  
nuclear accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant near 
Harrisburg, Pa., in 1979. Stello later served as the NRC's chief of 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989 Stello was nominated by President Bush to head the  
Energy Department's nuclear weapons production program. Stello 
withdrew his name following a lengthy fight in the Senate to block 
his confirmation after nuclear critics accused him of improprieties 
during his tenure with the NRC. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Nuclear Facility Safety Board recently gave Stello  
an award for his work as a proponent of nuclear safety. The safety 
board will administer the award -- which is named for Stello -- 
annually.

<HEADLINE> Race Is Basis for Most Hate Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Racial prejudice motivated more than half the  
8,049 hate crimes in 1997 that were reported to the FBI, the bureau 
reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	As in 1996, racial prejudice was the most common motivation for  
hate crimes, accounting in 1997 for 4,710 incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	In order of magnitude, other reported motivations were 1,385  
incidents attributed to prejudice about religion, 1,102 sexual 
orientation, 836 ethnic or national origin, 12 to disability and 
four to multiple prejudices, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 data come from 11,211 law enforcement agencies in 48  
states and the District of Columbia, representing 83 percent of the 
population. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, there were 8,759 hate crime incidents, of which 5,396  
were racially motivated. But the 1996 data came from 11,354 law 
enforcement agencies in 49 states and the District of Columbia, 
representing 84 percent of the population. 
</P>
<P>
	There were several hundred more incidents in 1996 than 1997, but  
there were more than 100 more police agencies reporting in the 
earlier year. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the number of agencies reporting varies under the  
voluntary system established by the Hate Crimes Statistics Act of 
1990, officials caution against drawing conclusions about trends in 
hate crime volumes between years. They say the figures provide a 
rough picture of the general nature of hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, crimes against people accounted for 70 percent of the  
offenses, with intimidation the most frequent hate crime at 39 
percent of the total. Vandalism and property destruction accounted 
for 26 percent of the crimes, simple assault for 18 percent and 
aggravated assault for 13 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight people were murdered in 1997 in hate crimes, with five  
attributed to race bias and three to bias against sexual 
orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 10,255 crime victims, 80 percent were people and the  
remainder businesses, religious organizations or other targets. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 60 percent of the victims were targeted because of their  
race, with bias against blacks accounting for 39 percent of all 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 1,586 victims of religious prejudice, 65 percent involved  
crimes against property. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the largest segment of hate crime incidents occurred on  
residential property, 30 percent. Incidents on alleys, streets or 
highways accounted for 21 percent of incidents, and another 11 
percent occurred at schools or colleges. The rest were at varied 
locations.

<HEADLINE> Tampa Bay Relishes All-Star Weekend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- It was Florida as advertised, sunny with the  
temperature in the upper 70s. It's hard to imagine the NHL All-Star 
game getting a warmer reception anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's brightest stars descended on Tampa Friday for a  
weekend of festivities that might have been greeted by indifference 
just a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But since expanding into the Sunshine State in the 1990s, the  
NHL's popularity in the deep south has grown steadily with 
transplanted northerners and native Floridians alike embracing the 
Tampa Bay Lightning and Florida Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of more than 20,000 will pack the Ice Palace Sunday for  
the league's 49th All-Star game. Fans also will get a taste of 
history and what it takes to play at the highest level from 
tonight's Heroes of Hockey game and Skills Challenge, the main 
attractions of All-Star Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Famer Gordie Howe is among the 32 former NHL stars who  
will play in the so-called ``old timers'' game, a characterization 
that many of the players reject. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a heroes game, which is great,'' said former Tampa Bay  
player John Cullen, who retired early this season after overcoming 
a bout with cancer. ``Because these guys all are heroes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star game isn't the first to be held in a warm-weather  
city. Los Angeles had the event in 1981 and San Jose was the site 
two years ago. Despite having the team with the NHL's worst record 
and home attendance numbers at the break, Tampa Bay is excited 
about having the midseason showcase in town. 
</P>
<P>
	The stop in Florida not only rewards the Lightning for building  
the Ice Palace, which opened two seasons ago, but also represents 
an extension of the league's commitment to increase its exposure in 
non-traditional hockey markets. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL FANtasy, a large interactive hockey theme park that took  
more than a week to set up in the Tampa Convention Center, has been 
a hit with youngsters and adults. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the activities the league scheduled as part of the  
festivities were clinics, autograph sessions and a discussion panel 
focusing on the history of black players in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Panelists included Willie O'Ree, Tony McKegney and Herb  
Carnegie, former athletes who related their experiences as pioneers 
in a sport where the overwhelming majority of players are white. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Ree broke the color barrier in 1958, while McKegney played  
junior and pro hockey for nearly 20 years before suiting up with or 
against another black player. Carnegie was a minor league standout 
in the 1940s who never got a tryout with a NHL team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was sickening and heartbreaking because all I wanted was a  
chance,'' Carnegie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's all-star game will feature representatives from each of  
the league's 27 teams, including Tampa Bay's Wendel Clark -- a 
14-year veteran selected for the first time since his rookie 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas and Detroit each had four players selected, although  
injuries have knocked two Red Wings out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Yzerman, the starting center on the North America team,  
broke his nose Thursday night against Carolina, and will be 
replaced on the roster by Luc Robitaille of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman Uwe Krupp, injured previously, will be replaced in  
the World team starting lineup by Teppo Numminen of the Coyotes.

<HEADLINE>  Webber Comes to Kings' Camp Late </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Chris Webber showed up at the  
Sacramento Kings' training camp Friday, a day late, as he worked 
out for the first time with a team his agent had hinted he'd spurn. 
</P>
<P>
	Webber, traded from the Washington Wizards in mid-May for Mitch  
Richmond and Otis Thorpe, skipped the Kings' first workout Thursday 
night. But, after a phone conversation with his father, he got his 
team physical Friday and practiced with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Webber, whose past 12 months have included marijuana offenses,  
traffic violations and accusations of sexual misconduct, was vague 
when asked why he missed the opening practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Where was he Thursday night?  
</P>
<P>
	``My own personal private space,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Why didn't he show up?  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be in a position where I can give my all here, and I  
wasn't in that position yesterday,'' he responded. 
</P>
<P>
	When Webber was traded May 14, his agent, Fallasha Irwin, hinted  
the power forward might protest the trade by refusing to play for 
the Kings. On Friday, Webber hardly sounded like he was happy to be 
in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to stay here?'' he was asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to win,'' he said, not having to mention that the Kings  
have had an NBA-record 15 consecutive losing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Rick Adelman did not know if Webber, who has averaged 20  
points per game in his five-year NBA career, will be fined for 
missing Thursday's workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just happy that he's here,'' Adelman said. ``I don't care  
what happened yesterday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest concern for Adelman was filling out his roster and  
getting first-round draft pick Jason Williams, the seventh overall 
selection, on the court. There were a few snags in Williams' rookie 
contract, preventing him from practicing Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	While his soon-to-be teammates worked out, the point guard sat  
forlornly on a chair -- dribbling a basketball between his legs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to stay in shape if I can't play,'' a frustrated  
Williams said. ``But I'm learning by paying attention.''

<HEADLINE> Walker Signs Record Celtics Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Antoine Walker signed the richest contract  
in Boston Celtics history Friday, a six-year extension for about 
$71 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, Walker took a big step toward fulfilling his wish of  
spending his entire career with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I come from nothing. I come from a family of six and my mom  
raised me,'' he said at a news conference. ``I didn't have much 
growing up. To have the opportunity to make $71 million is 
unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, reported earlier but not finalized until the NBA  
lockout officially ended, was less than Walker could have made 
before the new collective bargaining agreement was adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	The Celtics finished signing their players by getting  
first-round draft choice Paul Pierce and forward Popeye Jones under 
contract. Pierce was the 10th pick, while Jones, a strong 
rebounding forward, joined the team last season in a trade with 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, a 6-foot-9 forward, had a year left on the three-year  
deal he signed as a rookie and could have waited until the end of 
this season before deciding whether to become a free agent or 
remain with the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
	He said continuing to play for coach Rick Pitino, who had been  
his coach for his two seasons at Kentucky, was a major factor in 
his decision to re-sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without coach Pitino, this never would have happened,'' Walker  
said. ``I do owe him a lot. He put me in the situation I'm in now. 
That's one of the main reasons why I chose to stay with the Celtics 
because I've had great success with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, the sixth pick in the 1997 draft and an All-Star last  
season, averaged 20.0 points, 9.6 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game 
in his two NBA seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Walker was fifth in the NBA with 22.4 points per  
game and tied for seventh with 10.2 rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can be the best in our game,'' Pitino said. ``I've always  
believed that, with him, because he loves to play so much, he'll do 
whatever he can to drive himself to be the best. He wants to be he 
best. He wants the limelight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker has ``great potential'' to become a leader and it's  
``really crucial'' that he do that, Pitino said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's good pressure,'' Walker said.  
</P>
<P>
	Celtics vice-chairman of the board Red Auerbach presented one of  
his trademark cigars to Walker and said, ``I told him, `You're the 
captain. Remember. Act like one. Be in control.' His attitude is 
great.''

<HEADLINE> DirecTV Owner Buys Rival Primestar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The owner of DirecTV, the nation's biggest  
direct satellite TV broadcaster, is buying its main rival, 
Primestar Inc., to leave just two major satellite players in the 
battle against cable companies. 
</P>
<P>
	DirecTV would have more than three times as many customers as  
its closest satellite competitor, EchoStar Communications Corp., 
under the $1.82 billion deal announced Friday. But analysts believe 
DirecTV's satellite dominance will not raise antitrust concerns 
because its ultimate competition -- cable -- is still in far more 
American living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with its pending purchase of a movie-channel service, the  
Primestar deal would give DirecTV about 7 million U.S. subscribers 
and more than 370 channels. EchoStar, operator of the Dish Network, 
has about 2 million subscribers and is expanding quickly itself. 
</P>
<P>
	DirecTV and EchoStar would remain the only companies with  
national licenses for high-power satellite broadcasting, which 
offers an alternative to cable by providing huge menus of channels 
and high-quality pictures beamed into homes through pizza-sized 
dishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Primestar, controlled by five major cable companies, was created  
to reach mostly rural customers unable to get cable. But it battled 
regulators and has been struggling since its deal to buy Rupert 
Murdoch's U.S. satellite business was blocked last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the government will approve DirecTV's takeover of  
Primestar because regulators believe the cable companies never 
intended for Primestar to aggressively compete with their own 
industry by offering powerful, innovative satellite services. 
</P>
<P>
	DirecTV and other satellite providers have won millions of  
subscribers since direct satellite broadcasting was introduced in 
1994, but cable still has a huge competitive advantage. According 
to the National Cable Television Association, cable is in 67.4 
percent of U.S. homes with televisions, compared to 10 percent for 
satellite broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the problem for satellite firms is a federal law that  
bars them from broadcasting local TV stations. A number of key 
senators, including Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., have 
offered a bill to let satellite companies carry local stations. A 
hearing on the bill is scheduled for next week. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, DirecTV and other satellite firms are teaming  
with local phone companies to offer packages of phone and satellite 
services with antennae to pick up local channels. 
</P>
<P>
	DirectTV, which has about 4.5 million subscribers, is owned by  
Hughes Electronics Corp., an El Segundo, Calif.-based unit of 
General Motors Corp. Primestar, based in Englewood, Colo., has 
about 2.3 million subscribers to its 160-channel service. 
</P>
<P>
	DirecTV will acquire Primestar's medium-power satellite service,  
which offers fewer channels, and its ownership of high-power 
satellite licenses that are not yet in use. DirecTV will continue 
to offer Primestar's current service for two years before trying to 
switch those customers to DirecTV's more powerful service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Primestar deal marks DirecTV's second aggressive attempt in  
the last month to expand its dominance in satellite broadcasting, 
with its eyes on providing a range of TV, Internet access and data 
services in one package. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, DirecTV announced a $1.3 billion takeover of United  
States Satellite Broadcasting, a programming affiliate that 
provides premium movie channels such as HBO and Showtime and 
pay-per-view programming. Both DirecTV and USSB are pioneers in 
direct broadcast satellite technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Rival EchoStar is also expanding with a pending $1.25 billion  
acquisition of Murdoch's U.S. satellite holdings, the business 
Primestar had unsuccessfully tried to purchase. The deal will allow 
EchoStar to provide 500 channels and interactive services by early 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The DirecTV-Primestar deal is subject to approval by GM's board,  
Primestar's lenders and government regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Primestar is owned by Tele-Communications Inc., Time Warner  
Inc., MediaOne Group, Comcast Corp. and Cox Enterprises Inc.

<HEADLINE> Bulls in for a 'Long' Short Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Ron Harper's highlight-filled video collection  
will be his best reminder of the Chicago Bulls' good old days. Toni 
Kukoc says he can reminisce simply by glancing up at six 
championship banners hanging from the rafters. 
</P>
<P>
	But once they start playing next month, there will be few  
on-floor reminders of the past. And both Kukoc and Harper know it. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Steve Kerr, Luc  
Longley and Jud Buechler are all gone. 
</P>
<P>
	And already there are signs this will be a long season, even if  
it is only 50 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The new era, the rebuilding after Jordan's retirement, got off  
to a slow start Thursday -- the Bulls had to cancel their first 
practice following the lockout because they don't have enough 
players under contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally they got in their first practice this morning. Fourteen  
players were on the court when drills run by assistant coach Tex 
Winter got underway. 
</P>
<P>
	They were Ron Harper, Toni Kukoc, Keith Booth, Bill Wennington,  
Mark Bryant, Rusty LaRue, Dickey Simpkins, Cornell David, Rob 
Werdan, Curtis Staples, Randy Brown, Matt Steigenga, Bubba Wells 
and Martin Muursepp. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Rogers, part of the sign-and-trade deal that sent Pippen to  
the Houston Rockets, was on the side of the floor as were draft 
picks Cory Carr and Corey Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, Muursepp and Bryant were all part of a deal that shipped  
Longley to the Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls have three days before their exhibition opener Sunday  
against Indiana and just more than two weeks before they go back to 
Salt Lake City -- where they won their sixth title last June -- to 
meet the Jazz in the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take some time to get used to each other,''  
Kukoc said as he pedaled a bike, minutes after the practice with 
some of his soon-to-be new teammates was called off Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever happens, it's going to be different. It might be  
difficult at times, but hopefully, things will get better soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls did announce Thursday they had re-signed Wennington --  
to a minimum contract of $1 million for 10-year veterans -- and also 
signed Staples, a 3-point specialist from Virginia. Combined with 
Harper, Kukoc, Brown and Booth, already under contract, that gave 
the Bulls six players for a first-day practice. Impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Another addition, free agent Brent Barry, was at the Berto  
Center for a workout before leaving for dinner with coach Tim Floyd 
still unsigned. 
</P>
<P>
	The tired-of-waiting coach Floyd finally called all assembled  
the center of the floor to say there weren't enough players under 
contract at the time to hold his first practice. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Jerry Krause made a brief appearance. He claimed  
the new player contracts were so different from past ones that 
there was a backlog in the league office, thus the delay in getting 
players signed and to the floor for practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to get them done with the utmost speed,'' Krause  
said, adding he expected to have 20 players signed in the next 
couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen was to signed to a five-year, $67.2 million deal -- with  
an additional $15 million in incentives -- and shipped to Houston 
for Rogers and a second-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr was to get a five-year, $11 million deal before heading to  
San Antonio for draft picks and veteran Chuck Person. And center 
Longley was to receive a five-year, $30 million package before 
being traded to Phoenix for Bryant, Muursepp and Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	With Jordan playing golf in retirement and Rodman as usual  
sending mixed signals about his future, the Bulls will turn to 
Kukoc for leadership, ball handling and scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	He still wasn't sure Thursday in the midst of the chaos what his  
new team would look like or even when it would finally be together. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time is going to show. It's too early to judge what Jerry's  
doing right now,'' Kukoc said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Plenty of teams needed years to rebuild. I guess management  
just felt the situation right now is probably the best point to 
start rebuilding.''

<HEADLINE> New Microbes Posing Health Risks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Previously unknown bacteria and viruses  
blooming in the Earth's warming oceans are killing some marine life 
and threatening human health, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	There are increasing reports of dying coral, diseased shellfish  
and waters infected with human virus as the seas rise in 
temperature and pollution from the land intensifies, researchers 
said Friday in studies presented at the national meeting of the 
American Association for the Advancement of Science. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the cries and whispers beginning to confront us  
about the ecological dangers ahead,'' said James W. Porter, an 
ocean studies specialist at the University of Georgia. ``We are 
finding disturbing new kinds of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 10 percent of the coral worldwide has died, said Porter,  
and if present trends and conditions continue, another 20 to 30 
percent of the coral could be lost. 
</P>
<P>
	In many cases, he said, the pathogens -- viruses, bacteria and  
fungi -- killing the coral had not been previously identified by 
researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Corals are like the canary in the mine,'' said Porter. ``They  
are telling us that the water where they live is becoming 
suboptimal for their existence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There has been a 446 percent increase in disease at 160 coral  
sites being monitored along the Florida coast since 1996. One reef 
experienced a death rate of 62 percent, said Porter, and nearly all 
of the killing pathogens ``are new to science.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know if what we are seeing is a natural cycle or it  
is being caused by what human beings are doing to the planet,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter said the loss of coral is significant because the  
reef-building animal ``is the basis for the health of the tropical 
seas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New studies show that vast colonies of human viruses migrate  
regularly into coastal waters of Florida from the 1.6 million 
septic tanks in the Sunshine State, said Joan B. Rose, a University 
of South Florida researcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people are becoming infected with viruses picked up while  
swimming, windsurfing or boating in infected waters. One study 
found that almost a quarter of the people using marine beaches 
develop ear infections, sore throats and eyes, respiratory or 
gastrointestinal disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the viruses detected in coastal waters are linked with  
heart disease, diabetes, meningitis and hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people who come in contact with these viruses do not get  
ill,'' she said. But of the 20 to 24 percent who do, about one 
percent become chronically infected, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose's research team has traced the migration of viruses from  
septic tanks and found that the pathogens infect coastal waters 
within 24 hours of being flushed down toilets. Storms that churn 
the waters and set up currents can speed the process and cause an 
even wider spread. 
</P>
<P>
	Viruses have been detected in oysters and other shellfish in  
many coastal areas outside of Florida. For instance, some sampling 
in New York waters has found 40 percent of the shellfish infected. 
</P>
<P>
	Wounds infected with waterborne viruses caused two deaths and  
five hospitalizations in 1995 along the Mississippi coast of the 
Gulf of Mexico, Rose said. And more than a third of water samples 
from Waikiki Beach in Hawaii were found in one study to be infected 
with human viruses. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the disease-causing viruses that infect humans directly  
or through eating contaminated shellfish cannot be detected by the 
routine monitoring of water pollution, said Rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter said the increase in pathogens in the world's oceans may  
be linked to a 1.8 degree rise in sea surface temperature detected 
in many areas. He blamed the warming oceans, for instance, for ``a 
very distinctive global pattern of coral bleaching.'' The warmer 
water kills algae living on the coral, weakening the coral and 
making it more susceptible to infection.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Explosion Critically Burns Six </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) -- Six men were critically burned Friday  
when a gas boiler exploded as they were trying to light it, sending 
many of them running down a parking lot ramp in flames. 
</P>
<P>
	The men, three supervisors from the city Department of Public  
Works and three subcontractors from Panetta Oil Co., were trying to 
ignite the boiler to heat the city building, which has office space 
and a garage for sanitation trucks, deputy Fire Chief James Higgins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mechanic Jorge Lau heard a ``big bang'' next door at about 4:30  
p.m. and ran towards the parking ramp with a fire extinguisher. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a fellow on fire on the ramp,'' he said. ``There  
were five others falling on the ground already like in a puddle of 
water. They were trying to put themselves out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lau used the extinguisher to put out the fire on the first man.  
</P>
<P>
	``The one on the ramp asked me to take his coat off,'' Lau said.  
``When I took his coat off, the skin came off, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clothes had been burnt off most of the others, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The six were at the burn unit of Saint Barnabas Medical Center  
in Livingston. Four were in critical condition and two were 
critical but stable, spokeswoman Robin Lally said. She refused to 
describe the severity of their burns. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the explosion was under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Russia Hopes To Sooth U.S. Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia would oppose any U.S. plans to amend the  
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, but wants to maintain good relations 
with the United States despite this and other disputes, Russia's 
foreign minister said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Igor Ivanov said Moscow would discuss the ABM issue -- as well as  
other touchy subjects -- when Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
arrives in Moscow on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials say they may want to modify the 1972 ABM treaty  
so America can build a system of ground-based missiles to protect 
itself against possible nuclear attack. When asked whether Moscow 
might agree with the idea under certain conditions, Ivanov answered 
with a blunt ``no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We proceed from the assumption that it mustn't happen, and  
will actively be trying to convince our American partners,'' Ivanov 
said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian-U.S. relations have become strained recently over  
several issues, including the recent American and British 
airstrikes on Iraq. Russia denounced the bombings and briefly 
recalled its ambassador from Washington in protest. 
</P>
<P>
	There has also been friction over the U.S. move earlier this  
month to impose sanctions on three Russian scientific institutions 
that allegedly provided nuclear and missile information to Iran. 
Russia denied the claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the disagreement, the Russian protests have been  
relatively short-lived. Moscow, meanwhile, is still counting on 
U.S. food aid and hopes that Washington will back its request for 
much-needed loans from the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov took a conciliatory tone today.  
</P>
<P>
	``Irritants in bilateral relations mustn't develop into a more  
serious confrontation, and must be removed,'' he said. ``We mustn't 
view Russian-U.S. relations exclusively through differences over 
Kosovo, Iraq or some other issues,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The essential thing is to prevent sliding from certain  
differences to outward confrontation. That we will not allow,'' 
Ivanov added. 
</P>
<P>
	He voiced hope that Albright's visit would help sort out the  
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very serious visit, and we consider it of the utmost  
importance,'' Ivanov said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov also said it was too early to say whether President Boris  
Yeltsin would be able to meet Albright. The U.S. diplomat asked for 
a meeting before Yeltsin was hospitalized with a bleeding ulcer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such a meeting remains on the agenda, but we will be able to  
give a final, precise answer only next week,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Abortion Clinic Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton announced Friday that  
her husband plans to seek $4.5 million for alarm systems and 
closed-circuit camera systems to protect clinics where abortions 
are performed. Across town, thousands swayed, sang and prayed for 
the government to make abortions illegal again. 
</P>
<P>
	On the 26th anniversary of Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court  
decision legalizing abortion nationwide, Mrs. Clinton told an 
abortion rights group of the administration proposal. Clinics would 
buy security devices -- which also include motion detectors, 
bulletproof windows and improved lighting -- with federal money 
under a White House plan to counter clinic violence. The money also 
would be used determine which clinics were most at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the president will include the plan in his budget  
proposal for the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Violence, harassment and intimidation have no place in our  
health care system or in this debate,'' she told members of the 
National Abortion Rights Action League. NARAL was celebrating its 
30th anniversary at Washington hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also saluted Dr. Barnett Slepian of Amherst, N.Y.,  
an obstetrician who was shot to death by a sniper last October in 
the kitchen of his home in Amherst, N.Y., a Buffalo suburb. 
Investigators suspect he was killed by an anti-abortion protester. 
</P>
<P>
	An appropriate way to honor him is to ``make sure doctors are  
trained and available to provide safe and comprehensive health care 
to women all over our nation,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last 10 years there have been seven murders, 38  
bombings, 146 cases of arson and 733 cases of vandalism,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	When doctors are killed or clinics are bombed, she said, ``this  
is not free expression. This is domestic terrorism and it must 
stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also emphasized the importance of making contraceptives and  
health counseling available to young women and men to avoid teen 
pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
	``After years of moving in the wrong direction, we are finally  
seeing teen pregnancies and teen sexual activities going down,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton praised NARAL and its leader Kate Michelman for  
supporting the right to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should all take heart that despite many attempts to chip  
away at its guarantees, Roe is still the law of the land,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists honored  
Slepian's widow, Lynn, with a plaque honoring her husband's service 
at the NARAL meeting. The crowd in the ballroom gave her a standing 
ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	As Mrs. Clinton spoke, hundreds of anti-abortion activists  
gathered on a muddy park within shouting distance of the White 
House for speeches, songs, prayers and a march to the Supreme Court 
and the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the 26th straight year that the group March for Life  
has organized a massive rally on the Ellipse, just south of the 
White House, to mark the anniversary of Roe vs. Wade. Many 
participants said they'd never tire of returning to Washington year 
after year to demand that the government outlaw abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still here. For 26 years!'' rally organizer Nellie Gray  
said to enthusiastic applause. ``We stay here for personhood, for 
the babies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Public opinion is changing,'' said Richard Miranti, a dentist  
from Toms River, N.J. ``The reality of the cruelty and violence is 
becoming more apparent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters snarled traffic even before they started marching as  
they walked to the Ellipse for the rally. Many came on buses from 
states as far away as Wisconsin, Ohio, Missouri and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants waved dozens of colorful signs -- some hand  
lettered, some professionally printed -- that shouted slogans and 
carried gruesome pictures of aborted fetuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Natural CHOICE is LIFE,'' said one. ``Hey Pres, read that  
Bible,'' said another. 
</P>
<P>
	One couple waived a sign that protested so-called partial-birth  
abortion by featuring a syringe needle jabbed into the back of a 
doll's head against the background of a U.S. flag. 
</P>
<P>
	``Abortion means violent, painful death to little children,''  
Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray said anti-abortion groups would push Congress again this  
year to pass a law against ``partial-birth'' abortions. A measure 
was passed last year but vetoed by the president.

	TOKYO (AP) -- Profit-taking drove down Japanese stocks today,  
capping a rally earlier this week led by bank shares. The dollar 
was higher against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 91.02 points,  
or 0.64 percent, to close the session at 14,154.40. On Thursday, 
the average closed up 217.37 points, or 1.55 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 113.70 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.58  
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo, and above its late New York level 
of 113.68 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, traders took profits and unwound  
positions ahead of the weekend, ending a rebound in which the main 
index gained 474.98 points, or 3.45 percent, over the last two

	``There isn't a sense that the Nikkei average can sustain itself  
close to 15,000,'' said Masaru Arai, general manager of the stock 
division at Ryoko Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices had been higher for most of the session on buying  
by investors expecting that streamlining and mergers in the banking 
industry and other sectors will pave the way to recovery, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The engine of the market's recent rebound, bank shares, closed  
mixed today. Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi Ltd., Sumitomo Bank Ltd. and 
Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp. ended higher, while Sakura Bank 
Ltd., Fuji Bank Ltd. and Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. all fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section lost 7.63 points, or 0.69 percent, to 1,097.29. The 
TOPIX closed up 14.85 points or 1.36 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 514.65 million shares changed hands on the First  
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from 539.61 million 
shares Thursday. Retreats outnumbered advances 708 to 441, while 
153 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar continued to strengthen in  
Tokyo after surging in New York on rumors China was going to 
devalue its currency, which would further harm the struggling 
Japanese economy. 
</P>
<P>
	But the greenback's gains could be capped by worry over trade  
friction between the U.S. and Japan, which tends to weaken the 
dollar, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those concerns were fueled when Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi  
Miyazawa said early today that Japan's soaring exports to the U.S. 
might become a political issue, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 113.50 yen and 114.12 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was traded at 131.92 yen, down from 130.92  
yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government bond  
fell to 1.725 percent from 1.780 percent on Thursday, driving its 
price up to 100.60 yen from 100.16 yen.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Gas Explosion Kills Three </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Ala. (AP) -- Glass shattered, the earth shook and  
three people were killed when a natural gas explosion reduced part 
of this city's tree-lined downtown to rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	The boom could be heard miles away Friday as bloodied victims  
staggered from the site where utility crews had been working. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ran outside and saw it, and the building was just gone,''  
said Misty Flynn, who was shopping in a convenience store. ``A city 
worker came running at me and his face was all bloody. He was 
saying, `It blew my eye out.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The smell of gas lingered for hours. Residents poured into the  
area to see if their relatives who had been working or shopping in 
the district had survived. 
</P>
<P>
	The three killed were utility workers. At least seven others  
were seriously injured, and numerous others suffered cuts and 
bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion occurred around 10:15 a.m. as a Bridgeport  
Utilities crew was digging near a gas line, said police Officer 
Paul Smith. A backhoe was being used at the site. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lights went off and, boom,'' said Louise Matthews, who  
lives a few blocks outside downtown. ``I didn't know what happened. 
I thought the world had ended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A building used for storage, a vacant building and another  
undergoing renovation were destroyed. A physician's office, a 
hardware store, a taxidermy studio and a U.S. Post Office were 
seriously damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast ripped tar from roofs and shattered windows several  
blocks away in this northeast Alabama town of 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt like an earthquake,'' said Tommy Lands, the Stevenson  
police chief who heard the explosion in his city nine miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	The downtown area was evacuated for several hours until workers  
contained the gas leak. But the area was cleared several more times 
into the evening as workers investigated other potential leaks. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for a possible fourth victim was suspended while  
damaged buildings were checked, said sheriff's deputies. The 
Alabama National Guard was called in to prevent looting overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronnie Peacock arrived on the scene after hearing the explosion.  
</P>
<P>
	``One of the men I just saw laying there was my brother-in-law's  
best friend,'' he said. ``They were like brothers. He's going to be 
devastated. It's just unbelievable. Everybody knows everybody 
here.''

<HEADLINE>  Rehnquist More Easygoing Than Usual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist was a bit  
more easygoing Friday than he is in his regular job, giving 
impeachment lawyers a flexible time limit to answer senators' 
questions and declining to police their responses. 
</P>
<P>
	Ordinarily a stickler for time limits at the Supreme Court, the  
nation's top judge signaled a different attitude as senators 
queried lawyers in President Clinton's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chair will operate on a rebuttable assumption that each  
question can be fully and fairly answered in five minutes or 
less,'' Rehnquist instructed the lawyers, drawing chuckles in a 
trial where attorneys' presentations thus far had been measured in 
hours, not minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the first lawyer, Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., took about  
nine minutes to answer a broadly worded question, and the chief 
justice didn't stop him. 
</P>
<P>
	That set the pattern for the day. Sometimes the lawyers stayed  
easily within five minutes. Other times they spoke quickly to avoid 
going too far over the limit and risk becoming the first to draw an 
admonition from Rehnquist. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators submitted their questions in writing to the chief  
justice, who read them in a deliberate near-monotone. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, prosecutor Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., objected  
to a question submitted by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., saying she 
misstated his just-finished response to the previous question. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can the managers object to a question?'' Rehnquist  
interjected, and quickly conferred with the Senate parliamentarian 
at the podium. 
</P>
<P>
	``The parliamentarian says they (the prosecutors) can only  
object to an answer and not a question, which is kind of an unusual 
thing,'' the chief justice said with a smile, drawing laughter from 
the senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist doesn't mind occasional levity on the Supreme Court  
bench but he strictly enforces time limits, often cutting lawyers 
off in mid-sentence when their time is up. He also sternly rebukes 
lawyers who try to avoid answering a question, and sometimes tells 
them a simple ``yes'' or ``no'' will do. 
</P>
<P>
	There was none of that on Friday. The chief justice let the  
lawyers answer the questions as they chose and turned down two 
senators' requests that he press a lawyer on the answers he gave. 
</P>
<P>
	After Hutchinson finished answering one question, Sen. John  
Kerry, D-Mass., stood and asked whether he had responded to the 
entire question. Rehnquist ruled the question out of order because 
it was asked during a ``non-debatable period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes later, when Hutchinson was answering a question from  
Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., the senator interrupted and 
objected that he had sought only a ``yes'' or ``no'' answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chair has not tried to police the responsiveness of the  
answers to the questions, so I'm going to overrule the objection,'' 
Rehnquist said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., asked Rehnquist how  
much time the prosecution and defense lawyers had used up so far, 
the chief justice initially announced the parliamentarian's count 
at 57 minutes for Clinton's lawyers and 54 minutes for the 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rehnquist quickly corrected the prosecutors' speaking time  
to 64 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I trust that means I don't have to sit down, Mr. Chief  
Justice,'' jested Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., who had just come to 
the podium to answer a question. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not retroactive,'' Rehnquist joked in return.  
</P>
<P>
	Until the question-and-answer session, the chief justice's role  
in the impeachment trial involved little more than bringing each 
day's session to order, calling for each lawyer's presentation and 
announcing the adjournment at the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	He issued his only previous ruling of the trial on Jan. 15, when  
Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, objected to House lawyers referring to 
senators as jurors. Rehnquist upheld the objection, saying, ``The 
Senate is not simply a jury, it is a court in this case.''

<HEADLINE> Campus Radicals Jailed for Spying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Hand in hand, two former campus Marxists  
were sentenced to prison Friday for spying for the former East 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Pentagon lawyer Theresa Maria Squillacote, 41, expressed  
her ``profound regret at the conduct that has brought this case to 
bear'' as U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton sentenced her to 21 
years and 10 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, Kurt Alan Stand, 44, a former labor union  
representative, was ordered to serve 17 years and six months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do take responsibility for what we have done,'' Stand told  
the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``These defendants made a choice to betray their country,'' said  
federal prosecutor Randy Bellows in urging the judge to impose long 
prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Squillacote's lawyer, Lawrence Robbins, said the case ``cannot  
responsibly be compared'' to the cases of convicted spies Aldrich 
Ames and Jonathan Pollard, both of whom were sentenced to life in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Stand's lawyer, Richard Sauber, said Stand's actions were hardly  
``real espionage activity.'' He added, ``This is a time period when 
our former enemies are on C-SPAN, not in prison.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had described the Washington, D.C., couple as  
dedicated communists who hated the United States and were willing 
to spy for any country. 
</P>
<P>
	They met as student Marxists at the University of  
Wisconsin-Milwaukee during the 1970s, and prosecutors said they 
worked for East Germany throughout the 1970s and 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Squillacote and Stand were convicted last Oct. 23 of conspiracy,  
attempted espionage and illegally obtaining national defense 
documents. They have been held without bail since their arrest in 
October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	They were found guilty of helping set up a spy ring for the  
former East Germany and of passing classified documents to an FBI 
agent they thought was a South African intelligence officer. The 
two were caught in 1997 after the FBI learned of their attempts to 
contact the Communist Party in South Africa and set up a sting 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying against Squillacote and Stand at their trial was a  
former college friend, James Michael Clark, a former Army paralegal 
who was arrested with them. Clark pleaded guilty last June to 
conspiring to commit espionage and was sentenced in December to 12 
years and seven months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Stand began his spying activities in 1972 when  
he was recruited by East Germany to line up spies in Washington. He 
recruited Clark in 1976 and his wife about the time the couple 
married in 1980, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the early 1990s, Squillacote was hired as a Defense  
Department analyst. Prosecutors said she gave the FBI agent 
Pentagon documents describing arms transactions and assessing U.S. 
troop strength and another document about U.S. nuclear weapons. 
Squillacote left her Pentagon job in January 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers argued that the couple never gave classified  
material to foreign agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Stand was a regional representative of the International Union  
of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and 
Allied Workers' Associations.

<HEADLINE> Mergers Seen for Airline Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- After a period of relative peace, a spurt of  
buyout activity is making the nation's largest airlines look like 
sharks hunting for prey. 
</P>
<P>
	With company alliances showing little effect on the bottom line  
and competition heating up for lucrative business travelers, 
airlines are looking to make money the old-fashioned way: by taking 
it from weaker competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines's parent company this week set off what experts  
predict will be a bidding war to acquire America West Airlines, the 
nation's ninth-largest carrier and an important player on the West 
Coast. It was only the second time this decade a major airline has 
snapped up another player, with the parent of American Airlines 
last year purchasing Reno Air. 
</P>
<P>
	``It only goes to show that we only will have three or four big  
carriers in a few years,'' said Joseph Swieterman, a DePaul 
University economist and expert on airline competition. 
</P>
<P>
	But why the sudden interest in buying airlines after a long  
period in which carriers sought to form national and transatlantic 
links with competitors? 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say it comes down to dollars and cents.  
</P>
<P>
	American carriers for years benefited from corporate largesse,  
as companies flew their employees from one meeting to the next with 
little regard to the cost of travel. Now, an economic crisis that 
began in Asia and has spread to Russia, parts of Africa and Latin 
America has caused many to tighten their belts. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer people are flying more expensive international routes,  
communicating instead by computer or teleconference, said Frank 
Cassell, a transportation expert and professor emeritus at 
Northwestern University. Those who do travel are holding out for 
the best ticket prices with less regard for carrier loyalty, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, that's good for the consumer looking to get a deal on  
travel to large cities both domestically and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Jet fuel prices that remain at their lowest in years have helped  
airlines keep ticket prices down. But other costs, including 
employee salaries have gone up, meaning their profit margins are 
getting slimmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to be merging, no doubt about it,'' Cassell  
said. ``Certainly that would hurt the consumer in the long run 
because it's going to drive up ticket prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interesting twist, aviation experts say United appears to  
be interested in America West not for its route system in the West, 
but because it has a fleet of planes that can be readily 
transferred to the East. 
</P>
<P>
	United, responding to unexpectedly strong competition from  
USAirways out of Washington's Dulles International Airport, has 
said it will sharply expand its operations there. But the 16 planes 
the company plans to purchase for the entire fleet this year still 
would not be enough to meet its goals, and America West has entered 
the picture. 
</P>
<P>
	In the longer term, analysts say the consolidation activity  
points to the increasing globalization of business. 
</P>
<P>
	American's pending broad alliance with British Airways has set  
off a scramble to create similar alliances and ultimately could 
lead to more buyouts of companies that are slow to respond to the 
new realities of a global economy, Cassell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers want seamless service, to be able to get on a plane  
in Chicago and go just about anywhere in the world without having 
to change tickets, schlep luggage, etc.,'' he said. ``And if 
someone will offer it to them, they'll approve it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But federal regulators may not be as accommodating. The Justice  
Department increasingly has expressed concern about such activity 
and skepticism about airlines' assertions that combinations promote 
efficiency that will be passed on to consumers in terms of lower 
ticket prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The monopolist always says efficiencies will make things  
cheaper -- they were making the same arguments in Rockefeller's and 
Carnegie's days,'' Cassell said. But he suggested the larger 
airlines may be able to find the right arguments to convince 
regulators, particularly if consumers are on their side. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Salomon Smith Barney aviation analyst Raymond Neidl notes  
putting two plus two together in the airline industry doesn't 
always equal four. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every merger that has gone through in the past gave the  
surviving company major heartburn,'' Neidl said. ``In mergers, the 
biggest problems you have are integrating the work force, usually 
which has entirely different cultures. The airlines were much wiser 
in doing these alliances.''

<HEADLINE> Markey Chides Intel Over New Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A congressman wants Intel Corp. to reconsider  
plans to give its upcoming Pentium III computer processor the 
ability to transmit across the Internet unique numbers to help 
identify consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., said that he understood the  
technology's implications for online commerce, where the anonymity 
of the Internet can encourage fraud. But he worried it also will 
help online marketers surreptitiously track consumers on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``Intel's new product improves technology for online commerce in  
a way that compromises personal privacy,'' Markey wrote Friday in a 
letter to Intel Chief Executive Officer Craig Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
	Markey, the senior Democrat on the House consumer protection  
subcommittee, urged Intel ``to better balance both commercial and 
privacy objectives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An Intel spokesman, Chuck Mulloy, said Markey ``clearly is  
missing some information here.'' He said the company will contact 
the congressman's staff ``to make sure they understand the entire 
story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel announced its technology earlier this week at a security  
conference in San Jose, Calif. Its new Pentium III chip, to be sold 
early this year, will by default transmit its unique serial number 
internally and across the Internet to help verify the identity of 
users. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers can turn the feature off, but it turns itself back on  
each time the computer is restarted. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel said the technology is needed to encourage trust in online  
sales and also can be used to prevent piracy by preventing a single 
copy of a software program from being installed on several 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
	To mollify privacy advocates, Intel said it will not maintain a  
master database of consumer names matched to Pentium serial 
numbers. Intel also encouraged Web sites and software programmers 
to warn consumers whenever the serial number is retrieved. It 
predicted the first such Internet pages and software will appear 
within months. 
</P>
<P>
	``The flip side of the coin for security is privacy,'' Mulloy  
said. ``We acknowledge there are certain risks associated with that 
serial number.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Civil libertarians still found fault.  
</P>
<P>
	``The potential harm that this plan could do to privacy is  
pretty large,'' said Stanton McCandlish of the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation, a civil liberties group in San Francisco. ``It's just 
unfathomable they would come up with such an insecure system, 
especially given the vast majority of users who are extremely 
concerned about online privacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The debate over Intel's new technology occurs as Congress  
considers whether to propose new federal privacy laws for the 
Internet. The Federal Trade Commission, which chided the online 
industry for its failure to protect privacy rights, successfully 
pressed last year for a law to prohibit Web sites from collecting 
personal information on children without their parents' permission. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore last summer called privacy ``a basic  
American value, in the information age and in every age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William McKiernan, the chairman of Beyond.Com and Cybersource  
Corp., said electronic commerce sites on the Internet clearly need 
better protection from fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	When McKiernan's company first went online selling software in  
1994, he lost more sales to credit-card fraud in one week than he 
sold legitimately. The site now verifies a consumer's identity 
using a technique that he licenses to other companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But McKiernan said the conflict is only beginning between the  
needs for privacy and for positively identifying customers online.

<HEADLINE> Terrell Davis To Take His Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Terrell Davis makes this promise:  
</P>
<P>
	If, on Super Bowl Sunday, he suddenly sees stars and experiences  
blurred vision and searing head pain, he wants it to be from a hard 
tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	It won't be because he forgot to take his migraine medication.  
This time, Davis insists he'll do what he's supposed to. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he skipped his dosage and was stricken with a  
blinding migraine that sidelined him for almost the entire second 
quarter of the Super Bowl in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to emergency treatment on the sideline, the Denver  
Broncos running back was able to return for the second half and 
wound up running for 157 yards and three touchdowns to win Super 
Bowl MVP honors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will make sure it won't happen again,'' Davis said Thursday.  
``I already have a reminder. I will have this big sign and put it 
on my locker. That's the first thing I'm going to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, plagued by migraines since he was a teen-ager, has  
experienced relief in recent years, provided he follows doctors' 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
	During the regular season, the fourth-year pro rushed for 2,008  
yards, becoming only the fourth player in NFL history to reach the 
2,000-yard plateau, and was named the league's MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	He has exceeded 100 yards rushing in six straight postseason  
games, including 199 and 167 yards this postseason, the latter 
coming in last week's 23-10 victory over the New York Jets in the 
AFC championship game to advance the Broncos to the Super Bowl in 
Miami on Jan. 31 against the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	In four postseason games last season, he rushed for 581 yards,  
and playoff statistics are numbers he cherishes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping for a lot of postseason numbers because people tend  
to measure you by that,'' he said. ``Eric (Dickerson) was the 
greatest back to play the game, but as far as his postseason 
numbers, they're not really up there. That's one thing I'm trying 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``You look at Emmitt Smith, he's really been put in front of a  
lot of running backs because of the championships he's won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's small but mobile offensive line received much of the  
credit for the Broncos' offensive success in 1997, but Davis 
believes this year's revamped line -- with two new starters and a 
third player moving to a different position -- is actually better 
than last year's. 
</P>
<P>
	Since last year, Pro Bowl left tackle Gary Zimmerman retired,  
and right guard Brian Habib signed a free-agent contract with 
Seattle. Then, in the preseason, David Diaz-Infante, who was 
projected to be Habib's replacement, injured his knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Right tackle Tony Jones moved to Zimmerman's vacated spot on the  
left side, second-year pro Dan Neil became the starting right 
guard, and veteran Harry Swayne became the starter at right tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this line is definitely better,'' Davis said. ``We had  
some people move in and change positions, but the continuity has 
been there the entire year. Losing Zim and switching Tony over to 
left tackle, you would think we would lose something. But I think 
Tony is a better left tackle than he is a right tackle, and Harry 
came in and played great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones and center Tom Nalen are headed to the Pro Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
	Davis, like most of his teammates, thinks this will be John  
Elway's last game and that the Broncos will use Elway's departure 
as motivation in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are going to ride that thing this year,'' he said.  
``Last year, a lot of people thought it might be Elway's last 
season, and we wanted him to go out with a ring. I think he's going 
to leave this year, and we really want to send him out on a high 
note.''

<HEADLINE> Logging Considered in Grand Canyon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. (AP) -- An experimental plan to  
log parts of Grand Canyon National Park is being considered by park 
officials seeking to prevent catastrophic forest fires. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved following public meetings next month, the proposal  
announced Thursday would mark the first time logging is permitted 
in any of the country's 52 national parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Park officials said two 80-acre ``restoration blocks'' have been  
established for the research project, one about 10 miles east of 
Grand Canyon Village, the main visitor site, and one on the north. 
A third would be located within the Kaibab National Forest south of 
the park. 
</P>
<P>
	Within the blocks, logging would be one of four approaches being  
tested as a means to prevent fires. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists were quick to express concern.  
</P>
<P>
	``Is the public ready to support logging trucks rolling out of  
our national parks?'' said Sharon Galbreath of Flagstaff, a forest 
specialist for the Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, park officials estimate that about 8,000 trees  
would be removed. R.V. Ward, the park's biologist, said the project 
would remove only smaller trees, which compete with larger 
old-growth pines and firs that make up essential habitat for many 
kinds of wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, the park service has deliberately set fires in some  
cases to reduce the amount of fuel available, but ``prescribed 
burning alone is not adequate,'' officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The experimental approach being proposed is based on research by  
Wally Covington, a forestry professor at Northern Arizona 
University. Covington found that natural wildfires occurred every 
few years, burning quickly through the forest grasses and consuming 
excess small trees while bypassing the fire-resistant bark of 
larger old-growth trees.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Try 1st Cyber-Stalk Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In what prosecutors say is the first case  
filed under a new state ``cyberstalking'' law, a man is accused of 
portraying a woman on the Internet as someone with fantasies of 
being raped. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman was not physically harmed, but six men showed up at  
her apartment between April and July saying they were responding to 
her online personal ads that said, ``I am into rape fantasy and 
gang-bang fantasy.'' She didn't even own a computer at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary S. Dellapenta, 50, will be arraigned Feb. 2 on one count of  
computer stalking, one count of using a computer to commit fraud, 
deceive or extort, and three counts of solicitation to commit 
sexual assault, district attorney's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged stalking began after the woman rejected Dellapenta's  
romantic advances, authorities said. They had met at their church. 
The man's unrelenting pursuit allegedly led the woman to ask her 
church's elders to oust Dellapenta from the congregation, which 
they did. 
</P>
<P>
	Dellapenta, who was arrested in November, remains jailed in lieu  
of $300,000 bail. His lawyer, deputy public defender Irene G. 
Nunez, declined to comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Dellapenta, a former security guard, told  
numerous men what the victim looked like, her address and phone 
number, and how to bypass her home security system.

<HEADLINE> McDyess May Go Back to Denver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Antonio McDyess is on his way back to Denver.  
</P>
<P>
	After a news conference was scrapped and a deal seemed to be  
unraveling, McDyess reached an agreement with the Denver Nuggets 
late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Post and Denver Rocky Mountain News reported today  
that the free-agent forward had chosen the Nuggets over the Phoenix 
Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a day after announcing his intention to return to Denver,  
McDyess had asked for a little more time before signing a six-year 
deal with the Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tough decision for this kid,'' agent Tony Dutt said  
Thursday following eight hours of negotiations with the Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a decision that he thought about long and hard, and  
everyone wants to assume that other people are making his decisions 
for him. This is a grown-up kid who's very intelligent. He made 
this decision and now we're trying to basically do what his wishes 
are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess, traded from Denver to Phoenix 15 months ago, was given  
plenty to think about as he agonized over the biggest contract 
decision of his three-year career. The Nuggets deal reportedly is 
worth $65.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	When an afternoon news conference was pushed back and ultimately  
canceled Thursday, word quickly spread that McDyess was getting 
cold feet after turning down Phoenix's seven-year offer in excess 
of $86 million. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the negotiations said several Phoenix players  
called McDyess on Thursday in hopes of changing his mind about 
leaving the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do know there's a lot of confusion out there, a lot of  
stuff flying around,'' Dutt said Thursday. ``We just wanted to 
assure everybody (in Denver) there's not a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For their part, the Nuggets were willing to be patient with  
McDyess, whom they acquired in a draft-day trade in 1995 before a 
bitter separation that sent McDyess to Phoenix two years later. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had an awful lot of stuff to do, and (today), we'll get it  
all wrapped up,'' Denver general manager Dan Issel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Issel's joint press briefing with Dutt and McDyess' other agent,  
James Bryant, marked a fitting end to a bizarre day that began with 
McDyess arriving in a limo and ended with him leaving in a 
snowstorm. 
</P>
<P>
	In between, McDyess held negotiations in the Nuggets locker room  
as the Colorado Avalanche and Calgary Flames played a hockey game 
at McNichols Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The participants later watched part of the game from a luxury  
box, and McDyess was greeted by everyone from Nuggets coach Mike 
D'Antoni to Avalanche general manager Pierre Lacroix, a former 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, McDyess and Issel resumed negotiations, and left  
the room looking a lot less agitated than when talks began eight 
hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Several league sources said part of the breakdown had to do with  
Denver's plan to not re-sign McDyess' friend, free-agent forward 
LaPhonso Ellis, but Dutt said, ``There's no truth to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess, one of the NBA's most sought-after free agents,  
narrowed his choices to Phoenix and Denver this week and seemed 
ready to sign with the Nuggets before Thursday's unexpected delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant said the NBA's new collective bargaining agreement had a  
lot to do with his client's apprehension. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very, very bright. He's a Grant Hill-type of kid, a Mark  
Price-kind of kid,'' Bryant said. ``He likes to study everything 
with painstaking detail and make sure he understands it before he 
does it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess averaged 15.8 points and 7.4 rebounds in two seasons  
with the Nuggets, but was traded to Phoenix for a handful of draft 
picks Oct. 1, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade was made after former Nuggets general manager Allan  
Bristow refused to give in to McDyess' demand for a $100 million 
contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristow explained his decision by saying McDyess wasn't a  
``franchise'' player worthy of a nine-figure salary 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly stung by the comment, McDyess openly criticized Bristow  
and accused the Nuggets of being cheap. Just a month later, he said 
he would not rule out a return to Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	During his one year in Phoenix, McDyess saw diminished playing  
time, but still averaged 15.1 points and 7.6 rebounds in 81 games.

<HEADLINE> Agent: Worm To Decide Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Don't rush Dennis Rodman. It's tough to  
pick the best place to play naked. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's agent, Dwight Manley, said Thursday the mercurial star  
won't sign with any NBA club before next week. Instead, he will 
appear on ``The Tonight Show'' in Los Angeles, where he is expected 
to hint at what teams he would be interested in joining. 
</P>
<P>
	So goes the latest chapter in the flamboyant forward's week of  
confusion, which has included his near-retirement on Tuesday, an 
announcement he wants to return to the game on Wednesday and a 
declaration on his Web site that he wouldn't mind playing overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	His Web site message also included a renewed promise to finish  
his career the way he described it in his bestselling book, ``Bad 
As I Wanna Be'': to run off the court naked after his last game. 
</P>
<P>
	Manley was in Salt Lake on Thursday for a press conference with  
another of his players, Rodman's wrestling opponent, Karl Malone. 
But Manley kept one ear on the Mailman's words and another on his 
constantly ringing cellular phone, fielding what he said were 
inquiries from teams about Rodman's services. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been getting a ton of calls,'' Manley said, though he  
declined to name specific teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Manley wouldn't confirm it, Rodman seems to be waiting to  
see what teams strike out in the free-agent market. The 37-year-old 
would then be a prized commodity for a number of contenders looking 
to improve their rosters. 
</P>
<P>
	Manley flew to Toronto late Thursday to discuss a contract for  
another client, Doug Christie, with Raptors officials. After a 
breakfast meeting in Canada, the agent said he would return to Los 
Angeles today and speak with Rodman after he appeared on ``The 
Tonight Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was learning things about the situation from reading the  
papers this morning,'' said Manley, who said he last spoke with 
Rodman on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been rumored since last season that Rodman would be  
interested in joining the Lakers, and living in Los Angeles would 
obviously suit his style. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Lakers say they aren't interested, and the Knicks  
general manager Ernie Grunfeld said Thursday that any talk of 
Rodman coming to New York was ``wild rumors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manley indicated that interest in Rodman likely will only  
increase after Thursday's free agent-signing derby calms down. The 
Bulls may even want Rodman back in Chicago, but their status as a 
non-contender makes it unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been reviewing my options,'' Rodman wrote in his Web site  
message, ``and those options still include playing in the NBA this 
season with a contender. Chicago, New York and L.A. are all cities 
I'd like to play in. Playing overseas could be pretty cool, too.''

<HEADLINE> Gugliotta Leaves Suns Without Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Tom Gugliotta left Phoenix on Friday without  
reaching a contract agreement with the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	Suns owner Jerry Colangelo said he expects Gugliotta to reach a  
decision by late Saturday. Colangelo said Gugliotta apparently is 
considering re-signing with Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess that's the viable option he has, that or some kind of  
sign-and-trade,'' Colangelo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns could offer Gugliotta a six-year deal worth about $60  
million. Minnesota could give him $86 million over seven years, the 
maximum allowed for a team to re-sign one of its players. Phoenix's 
offer presumably would include a clause that would allow Gugliotta 
to opt out after five years and become eligible for a much bigger 
salary as a 10-year veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta arrived in Phoenix late Thursday night, in the midst  
of the bizarre Antonio McDyess situation, and met at America West 
Arena with Colangelo, his son, general manager Bryan Colangelo, and 
coach Danny Ainge. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta reportedly was close to a deal with the Suns on  
Thursday, before word spread that McDyess was reconsidering his 
decision to abandon Phoenix and sign with the Denver Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess finally signed with Denver on Friday, and with Gugliotta  
leaving town without a contract agreement, the Suns faced the 
prospect of winding up without either player. 
</P>
<P>
	That would leave Vlade Divac and a number of other lesser free  
agents as possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo declined to say whether he was optimistic that  
Gugliotta would sign with the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll just have to wait and see,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta's agent, Richard Howell, did not return repeated  
telephone calls to his office on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Timberwolves agreed to terms with free agent Joe Smith on  
Friday, but Colangelo said that would not affect Minnesota's 
ability to re-sign Gugliotta. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, there had been reports that the Los Angeles Lakers were  
interested in a sign-and-trade deal with the Timberwolves that 
would send Eddie Jones, Elden Campbell and Sam Jacobsen to 
Minnesota for Gugliotta. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta's indecision was holding up several other Suns moves,  
including re-signing free agents Rex Chapman and Clifford Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	Chapman, Jason Kidd and George McCloud all flew by charter to  
Denver Thursday night to talk to McDyess, after the young forward 
held up signing with the Nuggets at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns were awaiting league approval of a sign-and-trade deal  
with Chicago for Luc Longley. Longley said he signed the contract 
on Thursday and took part in an informal workout on Friday. He said 
he was confident the deal would be approved. Phoenix is sending 
Mark Bryant, Martin Muursepp and Bubba Wells to the Bulls.

<HEADLINE> More Thai Bank Losses Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- More Thai financial institutions today  
reported massive net losses for fiscal 1998, blamed largely on 
trying to cover the huge amount of bad loans they are still 
carrying. 
</P>
<P>
	A brisk selloff in financial sector shares pushed the Stock  
Exchange of Thailand index down 2.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Banking analysts said the earnings losses were not surprising,  
given dismal operational income amid the worst recession in decades 
and requirements to set aside more reserves to cover loan losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Problem loans accounted for 46 percent of all loans in the  
commercial banking sector as of October. The figure was even higher 
for non-bank finance companies that escaped closure by the 
government grappling with the Asian economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Krung Thai Bank PCL, the country's second largest bank,  
said net losses had soared from 210 million baht ($5.8 million) in 
1997 to 60 billion baht ($1.6 billion) last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kavee Chukitkasem, banking analyst at Capital Nomura  
Securities, said the losses were accounted for in the 65 billion 
baht ($1.8 billion) Krung Thai had set aside to cover bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's non-performing loan portfolio was sharply raised  
through assuming the bad assets of First Bangkok City as part of 
the government's financial sector restructuring program. 
</P>
<P>
	National Finance PCL, the country's largest finance company  
after 56 were shut down in 1997, said its net losses for 1998 
nearly doubled from 1997 to 4.49 billion baht ($124 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday, Bangkok Bank PCL, the country's largest commercial  
bank, number-three Thai Farmers Bank PCL, fourth-ranked Siam 
Commercial Bank PCL, and the smaller Thai Danu, Nakornthon and 
Bangkok Metropolitan banks all reported huge 1998 losses. 
</P>
<P>
	How large the 1999 losses will be depends on how much Thai banks  
are able to boost reserves, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The faster banks clean up their balance sheets, the sooner they  
will be able to push forward with new lending and return to 
profits. New loans have fallen sharply following the financial 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to restructure debt at lower interest rates should  
enable banks to cut projected 1999 losses, since borrowers would 
more easily be able to pay back their debts. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the central bank, large local banks plan to post a  
lending growth of 4 percent to 8 percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Though analysts said they doubted banks would achieve those  
targets amid recession, they believe Thailand's improving economic 
picture would make banks a little more willing to make new loans.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Taking Chance on Sprewell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) - The New York Knicks are ready to forgive  
and forget about the troubled past of Latrell Sprewell after making 
the trade for the controversial three-time All-Star. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a teammate now and I am a firm believer what's in your  
past stays in your past,'' Chris Childs said after the team's 
opening practice on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell brings a tarnished reputation as the NBA's poster child  
for bad behavior. Sprewell was suspended for 68 games last season 
and had his contract terminated after he choked and threatened to 
kill coach P.J. Carlesimo at a Golden State Warriors practice. 
</P>
<P>
	His checkered past also includes a reckless driving accident,  
numerous lawsuits against his former agent and the NBA and an ugly 
fight with former teammate Jerome Kersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not here to judge him, I'm here to coach him,'' Knicks  
coach Jeff Van Gundy said of Sprewell, who did not practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not really thinking about what happened in the past,'' Van  
Gundy said. ``I'm really looking forward to what he can do in the 
future. He's talented, he's a competitor and he's a complement to 
some of the other guys we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will be at least another day before Sprewell gets to play  
with his new teammates. He is not expected to practice today, Van 
Gundy said. 
</P>
<P>
	In making the deal by sending longtime Knicks favorite John  
Starks and bench players Chris Mills and Terrry Cummings to the 
Warriors, the Knicks immediately became the favorites to win the 
Atlantic Division. 
</P>
<P>
	``He takes us up a a notch,'' said Larry Johnson, soaking his  
right foot in ice after the two-hour practice. ``He's a guy who can 
cause havoc on the defensive end for us, and he's definitely proven 
that he can score in this league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell will be used mostly in a three-guard alignment on  
offense and will be asked to be a defensive stopper against small 
forwards, shooting guards and point guards. 
</P>
<P>
	So worried were the Knicks brass about getting Sprewell that  
they received special permission from the league to speak with him 
in person before making the trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison Square Garden president David Checketts, general manager  
Ernie Grunfeld and Van Gundy were among a four-man contingent that 
flew to Sprewell's hometown of Milwaukee last Sunday to speak to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how you can be completely sure about anyone after  
a couple hours in a meeting, but for two hours he looked me face to 
face and answered my questions, even the rough ones, in a real 
straightforward manner,'' Checketts said. ``He wanted another 
chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell will get that chance with the Knicks, who start the  
season without two of their most familiar faces, Starks and Charles 
Oakley, and with only one holdover, Patrick Ewing, from the team 
that went to the NBA Finals in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be strange for them not to be here,'' Ewing said.  
``They will definitely be missed not only as players but as 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still undetermined is which of the six legitimate starters  
(Sprewell, Allan Houston, Ewing, Johnson, Charlie Ward and Marcus 
Camby) will have to come off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``A championship team knows how to sacrifice for each other, and  
if everybody is on the same page, we will be fine,'' Houston said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Ward ($25 million for five years) and Dudley ($28 million  
for four years) were signed as free agents late Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Senators Prepare Written Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators are preparing written questions for  
White House lawyers and House prosecutors in President Clinton's 
impeachment trial, possibly the last act of bipartisanship before 
the Senate weighs dismissing the case and calling witnesses. One 
prosecutor said today he doesn't believe any Democrats have been 
swayed to remove the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``As of now, no,'' Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., said when asked in  
an interview with The Associated Press whether prosecutors had 
pursuaded any of the Senate's 45 Democrats to vote in favoring of 
convicting Clinton of grand jury perjury or obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, that may change and could change by way of the series of  
questions that need to be asked. And also on the question of 
witnesses,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	At least twelve Democrats would have to vote in favor of  
conviction to remove the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Gekas, who made two presentations to the Senate during the House  
prosecutors' opening trial arguments, said, ``Before the first 
piece of evidence was presented to the Senate, Senate Democrats had 
already pronounced in different ways that there aren't enough votes 
to convict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said a strong ``attack on the evidence by the White House  
counsel could be viewed by the Senate Democrats as, 'Well that's 
it.' And therefore, that the numbers count that they indulged in 
before is substantiated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gekas said he and his 12 Republican prosecutor colleagues had  
not yet given up hope. Their next chance to change minds was today 
as senators submitted their first written questions to Chief 
Justice William Rehnquist to be asked of the lawyers after two 
weeks of evidence presentations. 
</P>
<P>
	Alternating between Republicans and Democrats, the procedure  
will be as awkward for senators as the requirement that they sit 
silently at the trial ``on pain of imprisonment.'' Senators will 
try to narrow the conflicts in the evidence that were highlighted 
by House prosecutors and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Was the job search for former White House intern Monica Lewinsky  
an effort to persuade her to sign a court affidavit denying a 
sexual relationship with Clinton? Who asked the president's 
secretary, Betty Currie, to pick up presidential gifts from Ms. 
Lewinsky -- the president or Ms. Lewinsky herself? Did Clinton try 
to coach Mrs. Currie for possible testimony the day after his 
deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case against him? 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are in a political bind once the question period is  
complete. The president's popularity continues to soar while the 
GOP's call for witnesses could extend the trial that -- according to 
polls -- is widely unpopular. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats were buoyed by Thursday's speeches on the president's  
behalf, but Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said today he is 
counseling fellow party members not to become smug and declare 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we need to give our Republican colleagues a dignified  
retreat out of this case,'' he said on NBC's ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats generally oppose witnesses. Most would likely vote for  
an expected motion to dismiss the case without voting on charges of 
perjury and obstruction of justice regarding Clinton's efforts to 
cover up his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Even some Republicans seemed undecided about the need for  
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more apt to cast a vote, yes, the deposition should be  
held, than I am to cast a vote that witnesses should be called. But 
we'll wait and see,'' Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The motion to dismiss and votes on witnesses, probably Monday,  
probably would end the bipartisanship that has sustained the trial 
inside the Senate, although political unity already has evaporated 
in front of television cameras stationed just outside the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., in a closing White House  
presentation Thursday that was praised for its eloquence by 
Republicans and Democrats alike, asked senators to give the public 
a break. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people are now and for some time have been asking  
to be allowed a good night's sleep. They're asking for an end to 
this nightmare. It is a legitimate request,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Bumpers spoke, not all Republicans were echoing the party  
line on witnesses or the strength of the case presented last week 
by the all-Republican House prosecution team. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., said the White House ``created  
reasonable doubt for me and many of my colleagues'' on a majority 
of the contested issues. ``It doesn't mean they can't be 
reclarified to the comfort of all of us,'' he said, holding open 
his ultimate judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said, ``I don't think we ought to  
hear witnesses unless they will add a lot to the case. I would want 
to know what they would say over and above what they already said'' 
in testimony that is now part of the written record developed by 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Bumpers' folksy, storytelling style contrasted sharply with  
Clinton lawyer David Kendall, who stood before the senators 
Thursday to make strict legal arguments. Kendall recited Ms. 
Lewinsky's testimony that ``no one ever asked me to lie and I was 
never promised a job for my silence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He asked senators: ``Is there something difficult to understand  
here?'' 
</P>
<P>
	As did four White House lawyers before him during the past three  
days, Bumpers contended that the president did not commit perjury 
or obstruction of justice. He characterized the conduct of his 
friend of 25 years as ``indefensible, outrageous, unforgivable, 
shameless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, he told his former colleagues, ``If you vote to acquit, you  
go immediately to the people's agenda.'' And if Clinton is 
convicted, ``He will be gone. You won't. So don't leave a precedent 
from which we may never recover and almost surely will regret.''

<HEADLINE> Texas May Move Death Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Corrections officials are considering moving  
death row inmates to a more modern prison in Texas after 
investigators concluded inadequate facilities contributed to an 
attempted escape by seven killers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly is the highest priority this board, the entire  
department, has at this point in time,'' said Allan Polunsky, 
chairman of the state's prison board. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report released Thursday, investigators found that inmates  
took advantage of poor supervision by guards and inadequate 
lighting and fences at the Ellis Unit near Huntsville when they 
tried to escape in November. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the seven inmates, Martin Gurule, 29, managed to scale  
two 10-foot-tall fences topped with razor wire and flee into the 
darkness. The other six surrendered after guards in towers opened 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Gurule's escape was the first from Texas' death row in 64 years,  
but he didn't get far. He drowned in a 15-foot-deep creek a couple 
of miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	The 448 inmates on Texas' death row could be moved 30 miles away  
to the Terrell Unit, which has a capacity of nearly 3,000 inmates 
and was built in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just going to have to wait and see what the staff does  
with respect to researching the issues involved, examine the cost 
and make a decision based on that,'' Polunsky said.

<HEADLINE> Rosie O'Donnell Bows Out of Tonys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rosie O'Donnell gives her regrets to Broadway.  
</P>
<P>
	The talk show host said Thursday she has decided not to emcee  
this year's Tony Awards in June. 
</P>
<P>
	She has been host for the past two years and has been credited  
with boosting the sagging ratings of the annual awards show. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's solely because of scheduling conflicts,'' spokeswoman  
Jennifer Glaisek said. ``She just can't be in two places at one 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. O'Donnell has already agreed to be host of the Grammy Awards  
in Los Angeles next month and Nickelodeon's Kids Choice awards 
show. She also is taking her daily talk show on the road in May. 
</P>
<P>
	No replacement was immediately named.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're disappointed,'' said Tony Awards spokesman Keith  
Sherman. ``We love Rosie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So do TV audiences. In her 1997 debut as host of the Tonys, she  
helped boost the ratings 48 percent to their highest level in a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Sherman said the possible hosts in June include Nicole Kidman,  
star of Broadway's steamy ``Blue Room,'' and Nathan Lane. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Glaisek said Ms. O'Donnell could be back next year.  
</P>
<P>
	``She loves the Tonys. She loves Broadway,'' Ms. Glaisek said,  
``and if they ask her back and her schedule permits, I know she'd 
love to do it.''

<HEADLINE> Court To Study Voting-Rights Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court set the stage Friday for a  
voter-rights ruling that will help determine how easy or difficult 
it will be for the federal government to reject election law 
changes detrimental to racial minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices agreed to resolve a dispute over how a Louisiana  
school board's members are elected. Their decision, expected by 
late June, will affect all states and counties covered by the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	The school board in Bossier Parish, La., for years has had one  
member elected to a four-year term from each of 12 districts. About 
20 percent of the parish's population is black, and none of the 12 
districts has a black majority. 
</P>
<P>
	As of 1990, no black ever had been elected to the school board.  
After the 1990 census required a redrawing of the school board 
election map, the local NAACP chapter proposed creating two 
black-majority districts. 
</P>
<P>
	The school board opted instead for a new map in 1992 with no  
such district, the same map that had been adopted by the parish's 
chief governing body, called the police jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the police jury's plan had received the Justice  
Department's approval required by the 1965 law, the school board's 
proposed redistricting plan did not. Justice Department lawyers 
decided that the plan would dilute minorities' voting strength. 
</P>
<P>
	A legal battle ensued, and in 1997 the Supreme Court used the  
Bossier Parish case to make it harder for the Justice Department to 
withhold approval of proposed election changes . 
</P>
<P>
	The Voting Rights Act's Section 5 allows the federal government  
to veto proposed changes if they are deemed to have a 
discriminatory ``purpose or effect.'' The Act's Section 2 is more 
stringent, and prohibits any voting practice that would dilute the 
political clout of racial minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	In its 1997 decision, the nation's highest court said Justice  
Department lawyers cannot refuse to approve a proposal under 
Section 5 by deciding that the change would violate Section 2. The 
court said a proposed change has a prohibited ``effect'' only if it 
left minority voters worse off than they are under a current plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices then sent the case back to a three-judge federal  
court in Louisiana so it could decide whether federal approval can 
be withheld for a discriminatory ``purpose'' other than leaving 
minority voters worse off. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-judge court in Louisiana ruled last May that no  
retrogressive purpose had been proved and refused to consider any 
other purported purpose. It approved the 1992 redistricting plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers say the Bossier Parish school board  
has been allowed ``to entrench a status quo that denies black 
citizens ... an equal opportunity to elect representatives of their 
choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The current election system is being allowed to ``hinder  
improvement in the political position of blacks ... because the 
record did not demonstrate that the board intended to make the 
position of blacks worse than before,'' the government appeal said.

<HEADLINE> Truck Rams Mass. Highway Tollbooths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST STOCKBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- A tractor-trailer coming down a  
long hill slammed into a row of highway toll booths early today, 
breaking apart two booths and sending two toll workers to the 
hospital in shock. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck driver was hospitalized following the crash near the  
New York border of the Massachusetts Turnpike, but no one was in 
the booths that were hit. A toll taker had gone on break five 
minutes earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen anything like it,'' said state Trooper Brian  
Paquette, who was the first on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck slammed head-on into a protective concrete barricade  
in front of the booth at about 3:45 a.m., sending it flying into 
the air, Paquette said. The cab then broke apart as the truck 
pushed through, taking out one toll booth and half of the adjoining 
booth. The turnpike remained open. 
</P>
<P>
	It took more than two hours to free the driver, Antonio Marino,  
41, of Quebec, from the mangled truck. His condition at the 
Berkshire Medical Center was not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	The toll taker who had been in the demolished booth was taken to  
the hospital for observation along with another worker, who had 
been in another of the eight booths. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was more shock than anything,'' Paquette said. ``They were  
both traumatized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police were investigating the cause of the crash.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Settles Discrimination Suits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Aerospace giant Boeing Co. announced plans Friday  
to pay $15 million to settle two class-action lawsuits alleging 
discrimination against black workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed settlement was announced at a joint news conference  
by Boeing Chairman Phil Condit, black civil-rights activist Jesse 
Jackson and attorneys for the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any common ground between workers and the company, to give  
workers more security and to heal ancient wounds, is the way to 
building bridges for the future,'' Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we must engage with Boeing in the broader range of unmet  
challenges: the diversity of its infrastructure, its board, its 
procurement practices, its pension-fund management and the broad 
range of opportunities that Boeing has to offer all Americans,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed agreement resolves the dispute fairly without  
extensive litigation, Condit said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This settlement ensures further expansion of our efforts to  
improve our promotion processes, enhance training opportunities and 
ensure employees have avenues available to address their 
concerns,'' Condit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties have filed a motion seeking approval of the  
agreement from U.S. District Judge John Coughenour. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed consent decree, the settlement would be  
distributed among Boeing's approximately 20,000 current and former 
black workers. The aerospace giant employs more than 225,000 people 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing admits no liability under the settlement.  
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits, filed last year on behalf of employees in the  
Seattle and Philadelphia areas, alleged that discrimination was 
common at Boeing plants, especially in selecting people for 
promotion. The lawsuits also said the company allowed conditions in 
which blacks were harassed and retaliated against when they 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaints were originally filed on behalf of 70 plaintiffs,  
with 194 names added during the course of the litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Those 264 named plaintiffs will share $3.8 million, and $3.5  
million will go to other class members. About $3.7 million will be 
used for equal-opportunity and diversity training at Boeing and 
settlement-related costs. About $4 million will go to the plaintiff 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight black employees at Wichita who filed separate lawsuits  
agreed to withdraw them and share in the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhonda Capps, an electrical engineer and one of the Seattle  
plaintiffs, said she's seen a lack of opportunities and promotions 
for blacks in her 13 years at Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was planning on quitting, but as of the other day I changed  
my mind,'' she said. ``I want to see this work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon Williams, another plaintiff and a Boeing machinist for  
22 years, said he had to go to classes and be tested for 
consideration for a promotion, while nine out of 10 white males 
avoided such tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel great,'' he said. ``People know that we were vindicated  
and that there was a problem.''

<HEADLINE> Tennis Rankings May Add Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- As part of an effort to attract the  
top tennis players to the Olympics, ranking points are likely to be 
offered for victories, the president of the International Tennis 
Federation said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The women players have supported the Olympics wholeheartedly and  
in the 1996 games, ``only two or three of the men you might want to 
play'' didn't enter, Brian Tobin said. He mentioned Pete Sampras 
and Boris Becker. 
</P>
<P>
	``If players are not in their own mind convinced that an Olympic  
gold medal is a big deal, then that's their decision,'' he said 
during a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we have tried to take every opportunity to make it easier  
for the players,'' Tobin added. 
</P>
<P>
	The ITF is very close to agreement with the ATP men's tour on  
offering ranking points for both the Olympics and the Davis Cup 
under a new ranking system to be introduced in 2000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that ranking points themselves are going to  
attract Pete Sampras, for example, to play in the Olympics. But I 
think it's fair for all the other players who perhaps give up a 
tournament or two to play in the Olympics, or Davis Cup, that they 
don't suffer at the hands of other players who are winning points 
somewhere else,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras has cited the rigors of the regular tour for his limited  
Davis Cup appearances. He also is skipping the current Australian 
Open, claiming fatigue from efforts late last year to preserve his 
No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobin said the tennis program in the Olympics will be limited to  
10 days, down from 12, so the players won't have to spend too much 
time away from the tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to make it as player-friendly as we can, because  
tennis players are used to the luxuries of life. I think they will 
find ... that the facilities there (Sydney Olympics) will be equal 
to the facilities at major tennis events,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Olympics are important to giving tennis a wider audience,  
and also bringing in revenue to help develop the sport, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennis gained about $3.2 million from the 1996 Olympics at  
Atlanta, money which was passed on to national associations, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important to the smaller nations that tennis is part  
of the Olympics,'' Tobin said. 
</P>
<P>
	He called tennis probably the most international of sports, with  
201 nations represented in the ITF. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said team competition was unlikely to be included in the  
Olympics, because just a few nations would dominate it, and there 
were logistic and scheduling problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Americans Andre Agassi and Lindsay Davenport were the  
Olympic singles champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The recent surveys we have done are very encouraging,'' Tobin  
said. ``All of the players said that representing their country and 
winning a gold medal is very appealing to them.''

<HEADLINE> Tornadoes Kill Eight in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Tornadoes ripped through the South for  
the second time this week, killing eight people, wrecking historic 
neighborhoods and knocking down Chelsea Clinton's childhood 
treehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Little Rock's oldest areas, the 100-year-old Quapaw  
Quarter, was sliced in half by a twister that killed three people 
Thursday night. A tornado also hit the historic district of 
Clarksville, Tenn., early Friday, leaving gaping holes in buildings 
like the 121-year-old courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like somebody walked through with a broom and knocked  
over whatever was loose enough to knock down,'' said Fred Dye, 
photo editor at The Leaf-Chronicle of Clarksville, whose building 
was heavily damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Power was knocked out to more than 100,000 homes in Arkansas and  
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Little Rock storm knocked over trees at the Governor's  
Mansion, where Bill Clinton once lived. He plans to visit Arkansas 
on Sunday. One of the trees blown down contained Chelsea Clinton's 
treehouse from the years when her father was governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that the Governor's Mansion where Hillary and I  
raised Chelsea for 12 years was actually in the path of the storm 
made it all the more real to me,'' Clinton said. ``We are deeply 
committed to doing everything we can to help the people there 
recover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A supermarket near the mansion crumbled beneath the storm's  
winds, killing the pharmacist and leaving residents of the Quapaw 
Quarter without one of the few major businesses remaining in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to affect a lot of people. A lot of people don't  
have transportation or cars to get them where they need,'' Diana 
Howley said. ``My mother is one. If we weren't here, she wouldn't 
be able to get where she needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four other people were killed in White County, outside the  
capital. In hard-hit Beebe, residents were tense as police held 
them back from seeing the damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Underwood, a volunteer at the Church of Christ, was  
embarrassed after asking people how their homes fared during the 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say, `We have no home,'' Underwood said.  
</P>
<P>
	At the Pine Bluff Arsenal, damage to buildings and vehicles was  
estimated at $2 million. Its stockpile of chemical weapons, stored 
underground, was not affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Huckabee declared emergencies in 16 counties.  
</P>
<P>
	The American Red Cross said the nation has had 101 tornadoes  
this month, normally the quietest for tornadoes. The previous mark 
for a January was 52 in 1975. Arkansas alone had 38 tornadoes 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	After pounding Arkansas, the storm moved into Tennessee, killing  
a woman west of Nashville when she went outside to get her dogs. 
The state was still trying to recover from storms that killed nine 
people on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Clarksville, northwest of Nashville, a tornado cut off power  
to 25,000. It ripped apart a five-block area, tore through the 
center of Austin Peay State University and skipped into a 
residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	The university's clock tower was blown over, 100-year-old  
magnolia trees toppled, and the 123-year-old Archwood House, which 
used to be the president's home but now holds offices, was 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I lived in Southern California. I lived through earthquakes.  
I've never seen anything like this,'' President Sal Rivella said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Alexandria, La., an apparent tornado ripped apart businesses  
and downed electrical lines, cutting power to hundreds of 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was something you could just feel it encircling you,''  
Rhonda Baker said as she surveyed the damage to a mall where she 
was working late processing tax loans. ``My ears started popping as 
everything went black I couldn't see nothing -- and I could feel the 
building shaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mobile homes, trees and power lines were also damaged in  
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just like when you watch TV and these big funnel clouds  
pick up every kind of debris,'' said Lori Wilkins, caught in a 
storm at Greenville, Miss. ``It was just like watching something 
like what I see on `National Geographic.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The American Red Cross said the nation has had 101 tornadoes  
this month, normally the quietest for tornadoes. The previous mark 
for a January was 52 in 1975.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Mobster's Conviction Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Genovese crime boss Vincent ``Chin'' Gigante was  
properly convicted of murder conspiracy and racketeering after two 
federal judges concluded he was feigning mental illness, a federal 
appeals court ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals supported  
the way the trial was handled by U.S. District Judge Jack B. 
Weinstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Gigante, 70, who headed the nation's No. 1 crime family, was  
sentenced in December 1997 to 12 years in prison after Weinstein 
determined that the so-called Oddfather had been feigning mental 
illness to avoid prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Weinstein, U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson had  
reached the same conclusion. Nickerson presided over the case until 
Gigante's lawyers said their client had been diagnosed with 
Alzheimer's disease. Nickerson, whose wife suffers from the 
debilitating illness, recused himself from the case and turned it 
over to Weinstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinstein said that Gigante, who had been spotted over the years  
wandering around Greenwich Village in his bathrobe and mumbling to 
himself, had exaggerated what might be a ``slight'' mental illness.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Impeachment Trial-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	``Let's just take a few glimpses, but as we do this, remember  
the big picture. It is the scheme the president is engaged in and 
the whole basis for our discussion here today and each of these two 
articles of impeachment involve the questions of the president's 
trying to thwart the Jones court will, trying to hide evidence from 
the court, and planning not to tell the truth in that deposition in 
January. Whether that's over here on a perjury count or not is 
irrelevant -- it's critical to this case for both obstruction of 
justice and perjury that you accept and understand as I think 
clearly you do, from listening to all of this, that the president 
lied many times in that deposition in the Jones case because he 
didn't want them to get the facts -- the true facts of his 
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.'' -- Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Calling witnesses will add nothing to the record now before  
you. All the major witnesses have testified and their testimony is 
right there. Now, with response to the question of how long it will 
take. I must tell you, we have never had a chance to call witnesses 
ourselves, to examine them, to cross examine them, to subpoena 
documentary evidence at no point in this process. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be malpractice for any lawyer to try even a small  
civil case, let alone represent the president of the United States 
when the issue is his removal from office without an adequate 
opportunity for discovery.'' -- David Kendall, presidential 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Do the managers really anticipate that if Ms. Currie were  
brought into the well of the Senate and looked straight in the eye 
by one of the prosecutors on this team, she would say, you got me. 
I had it wrong. The president really did tell me to do something 
that I have testified straightforwardly and honestly he didn't say. 
As my colleague, Mr. Kendall, indicated, that's wish and hope, and 
it has no basis in reality.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it really likely -- even given the managers perception of  
this matter -- that by giving Ms. Lewinsky the bear that my brief 
but important colleague, Sen. Bumpers, referred to yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
	``And a pin of the New York skyline, and a couple of other  
things, and a Radio City Music Hall scarf. I may have missed a 
couple of others. That some great message was being sent to Ms. 
Lewinsky that this collection of valuable items was the message to 
keep the faith, stay inside the conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think so.'' -- Ruff.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Just remember this. Our past is America's future, in terms of  
law. I would not want my president removed for trivial offenses and 
that is the heart of the matter here. I think I know why he took a 
poll. I think I know very well what he was up to: That his 
political and legal interest are so paramount in his mind, the law 
be dammed and anybody that got in his way, be dammed. Those are 
strong statements, but I think they're borne out by the facts in 
this case.'' -- Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``My belief is that this president did not trust the American  
legal system to vindicate his interest without cheating.'' -- 
Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing trivial should remove my president. We need to try  
this case, ladies and gentlemen, because you need to know who your 
president is.'' -- Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Senate, the president wants  
all of the protections of a criminal trial -- beyond a reasonable 
doubt, standard of proof, strict pleadings -- but yet deny us the 
right call any witnesses.'' -- Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I think by dismissing the articles of impeachment before you  
have a complete trial, you are sending a terrible message to the 
people of the country. You're saying, I guess, perjury is OK if 
it's about sex, obstruction is OK even though it is an effort to 
deny a citizen her right to a fair trial. You're going to say that 
even when judges have been impeached for perjury.'' -- Hyde. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems odd to me, when you come right down to it, that we  
should be accused of failing in our duty with the burden on the 
House Judiciary Committee to make its case and our right to respond 
meaningfully, that the House having determined never to call a 
witness who knew anything firsthand, we should somehow be charged 
with having fit in to this discovery process.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``When the president said he wasn't paying attention, that was  
negated by watching the videotape. The president was paying very 
close attention. And why was he paying such close attention? 
Because the fate of his presidency hung on the answer to that 
question. This is the most important question in the president's 
political life. Is he going to have to disclose information that he 
thought would help destroy his presidency?'' -- Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``There is one critical issue that everyone has to address,  
which is that removal means undoing the will of the people.'' -- 
Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The election is provided for in the Constitution, and so is  
impeachment. They are processes of equal constitutional validity, 
and should the Senate remove the president, Bob Dole will not 
become president, Jack Kemp will not become vice president, but Mr. 
Gore will move up to be president, and the same party, the same 
programs, I daresay will continue.'' -- Hyde.

<HEADLINE> Jim McIlvaine Joins Nets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Jim McIlvaine doesn't mind being  
characterized as the new part-time defensive center for the New 
Jersey Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a role the 7-foot-1 center is used to.  
</P>
<P>
	McIlvaine practiced with the Nets on Friday for the first time  
since being acquired from Seattle in a trade for center Michael 
Cage and forward Don MacLean. 
</P>
<P>
	As he sat answering questions from the media, coach John  
Calipari walked by and let everyone know his new backup did well on 
Day 1. 
</P>
<P>
	In a year in which the Nets and Calipari are stressing defense,  
McIlvaine seems a perfect fit as a backup for Jayson Williams and 
Rony Seikaly. 
</P>
<P>
	While he has never averaged more than 3.8 points in a season,  
McIlvaine has blocked 527 shots since joining the NBA four years 
ago. The former Marquette product has had at least 137 in each of 
the past three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes it easy when you have a well-defined role, and things  
are laid out for you and you have open lines of communication,'' 
McIlvaine said. 
</P>
<P>
	As far as adjusting to the Nets' offense, McIlvaine isn't  
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey likes to run and that's exactly what the SuperSonics  
did in McIlvaine's two seasons in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Signed as a free agent by Seattle in 1996, McIlvaine didn't have  
the best statistics during his stint there. In 160 games, he had 
561 points, 589 rebounds and 301 blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I could have done more. I wanted to do more,''  
McIlvaine said. ``When I got opportunities I tried to make the most 
of them. Statistically, it may not look like I did great out there, 
but I felt I helped us win games and I wasn't concerned with 
individual statistics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McIlvaine expected to be traded once the lockout ended because  
Seattle needed salary cap room. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting in a Hoboken restaurant last summer with a friend,  
McIlvaine felt there was an outside chance the Nets would try to 
acquire him because New Jersey general manager John Nash drafted 
him for Washington in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	McIlvaine felt being a union representative during the long  
lockout had nothing to do with the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there are one or two guys on every team that control  
their own destiny, who can decide where they want to be and where 
they want to go,'' McIlvaine said. ``I'm not one of those guys at 
this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While his playing time could be jeopardized because the Nets  
have three centers, McIlvaine sees the situation as a positive for 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the shortened season, deep benches are going to be a  
necessity,'' he said. ``If you got three games in a row you can't 
expect your starters to go and put out those kind of minutes for 
three games in a row. I've been in situations with three centers 
before, and it's worked out.''

<HEADLINE>  Falcons Hope To Cash In on Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- After 33 years, the Atlanta Falcons finally  
made it to the Super Bowl. Now, it's time to cash in. 
</P>
<P>
	``This town is turned on,'' coach Dan Reeves surmised. ``I think  
they're about as turned on right now as we can get 'em turned on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long one of the NFL's dormant franchises, the Falcons are hoping  
their improbable season will generate some enthusiasm for the rest 
of 1999. The first priority: increasing a season-ticket base that 
didn't even reach 30,000 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a perfect home record and the first NFC West title in 18  
years, Atlanta produced only two sellouts for eight regular-season 
games at the 71,228-seat Georgia Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay, this isn't.  
</P>
<P>
	``We need to lower the bar,'' Rob Jackson, vice president of  
marketing and sales, said Friday. ``You lower the bar by getting 
more season tickets in the house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the field, the Falcons have done their part by coming up with  
a catchy nickname, an arm-flapping end zone dance, an inspirational 
coach and, oh yeah, a trip to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's that magical type season that every franchise dreams  
of,'' Jackson said. ``You can't manufacture the kind of stuff 
that's happening out there. If we tried to contrive a Dirty Bird 
song or a Dirty Bird logo, it couldn't have happened. It happened 
because the fans got excited and the players got into it. These 
guys are having fun with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the burden falls to a marketing department that inherits  
the seemingly easy task of selling this appealing team to a 
once-wary city. 
</P>
<P>
	Falconmania had resulted in a significant boost in sales over  
the past six weeks. The team has taken more than 3,800 refundable 
deposits for the 1999 season, which is nearly double the 2,000 or 
so new season-ticket packages that were sold all last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the team has a long way to go to create the kind of  
demand that exists in cities like Green Bay, where there are long 
waiting lists for season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a totally different situation than any I've ever been  
involved in,'' said Reeves, who previously worked in Dallas, Denver 
and New York, all pro football hotbeds. ``We got a few people 
turned around a little bit at the end of the season (by winning six 
of the last eight games), but we still didn't see a drastic change 
during the offseason as far as ticket sales.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some fans hanging around the team's suburban training complex,  
hoping to snag a few autographs, wondered why the team hasn't 
launched a more aggressive season-ticket campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons have focused their advertising on newspapers so far,  
ignoring the broader appeal of television because local stations 
are devoting so much air time to the team anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been listening on TV, but I haven't heard anything about  
pre-sales,'' said Malcolm Cash, a potential new customer who lives 
less than two miles from the team headquarters. ``I would think 
they'd be talking about it. I guess everybody's concerned about 
getting Super Bowl tickets. But when it's over, people might change 
their minds in a hurry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said the Falcons, who usually begin their season-ticket  
campaign in April, plan to strike at potential buyers as soon as 
the Super Bowl is over. A championship would provide an enticing 
element for the advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've not done a lot of marketing, a lot of advertising at  
this time,'' he said. ``But we'll be aggressive while the 
excitement and momentum is there during the month of February, then 
we'll pick back up around draft time'' in April. 
</P>
<P>
	No advertising campaign could duplicate the marketing that has  
evolved naturally. The players got it started when they nicknamed 
themselves the ``Dirty Birds'' and came up with an infectious dance 
of the same name to celebrate touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, the city was galvanized by the plight of Reeves,  
who underwent heart bypass surgery with two games left in the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons kept on winning while Reeves recovered at home, then  
he made an inspirational return for the divisional playoff victory

Minnesota in the NFC championship game, rallying for a 30-27

history.

<HEADLINE>  Malone Back With Jazz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone made his peace with the Utah  
Jazz -- and his teammates breathed a sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Karl would be back, but I was a little worried, I  
admit it,'' Jeff Hornacek said. ``I look at the Bulls after 
Michael, and that doesn't look like a lot of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After an extended summer of discontent during which Malone  
appeared to be miles away from returning to the Jazz, he was back 
in the fold on Thursday after an emotional press conference with 
team owner Larry Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, Malone joined his Jazz teammates for workouts on  
the first day of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really had no doubt Karl and Larry would work something  
out,'' guard John Stockton said. ``This is Karl's home, and this 
team knows him very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting Karl back doesn't change our plans for the season,''  
coach Jerry Sloan said. ``If it hadn't worked out, then you'd see a 
different look on my face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two months ago, Malone vowed never again to play for the Jazz.  
But in the broader scope of Malone's tumultuous offseason, two 
months is an eternity. 
</P>
<P>
	Things have changed.  
</P>
<P>
	``You say things sometimes that you wish you wouldn't have said.  
It takes a bigger man to admit he was wrong,'' Malone said. ``I 
apologize for a lot of things I said. The stuff that happened this 
summer made me grow up quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the hastily arranged press conference, Malone, Miller and  
Malone's agent, Dwight Manley, all said they intend to keep the 
Mailman in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	They also criticized as untrue an earlier report that they had  
already agreed to a four-year extension. Malone has one year 
remaining on his current contract and will be paid $3.7 million 
during the abbreviated season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always been committed to keeping Karl in a Jazz uniform  
for the rest of his career ... and I am sure that we're going to be 
able to do that,'' the teary-eyed Miller said. ``I'd like to have 
an agreement right now, but that's not possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone and Miller hadn't spoken for weeks before an intense,  
lengthy conversation on Wednesday night. They said they emerged 
from the meeting with a spoken agreement to work out a lucrative, 
long-term deal as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to playing my career out here in Utah,''  
said the 35-year-old Malone. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller and Manley said they lobbied for an addition to the NBA's  
collective bargaining agreement that would allow teams to sign 
players who have been in the league for 12 years and with their 
teams for 10 years to extensions for an unlimited amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Karl is one of the only players like that,'' Manley said.  
</P>
<P>
	The addition wasn't made to the agreement, but the Jazz have  
petitioned the league for a waiver that would allow them to sign 
the 1997 MVP to a similar contract. If the waiver is granted, 
Miller said, the Jazz will be quick to act. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as the agreement allows us to talk about an extension,  
at the first opportunity, we'll do it,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the waiver isn't granted, no deal could be completed until  
next summer, when Malone would become a free agent for the first 
time in his career. Manley said the Jazz ``will obviously have the 
first and best shot'' to sign Malone. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone has dabbled in everything from pro wrestling to talk  
radio since the Jazz lost the NBA Finals to the Chicago Bulls last 
June. But with the lockout over and the Jazz a strong favorite to 
contend for their first NBA title, Malone said he decided the grass 
was greener on his own side of the fence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes a man to admit he was wrong,'' Malone said. ``My  
family and I want to spend the rest of our lives in Utah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gail Miller and Kay Malone, wives of the owner and the player,  
sat together during the press conference. The families live only 
minutes apart in an affluent hillside suburb of Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	``I drive past his house every night and every morning and I  
think about him,'' Larry Miller said. ``Maybe we've got too 
emotionally dependent on each other, I don't know.''

<HEADLINE>  Super Bowl Far From Super for Some </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMARAC, Fla. (AP) -- Cynthia Pearlman doesn't know which teams  
are playing in the Super Bowl, but she's been looking forward to 
Jan. 31 for months. It's the day she gets her husband back. 
</P>
<P>
	During the season, she and women like her complain that their  
husbands or boyfriends put the game -- any football game -- ahead of 
spending time with them. The championship game brings deliverance 
from months of playing second string to a TV set. 
</P>
<P>
	``It starts at the beginning of the week, after the game is over  
on Sunday,'' said Pearlman, 58, a Tamarac resident originally from 
New York. ``Then they run to the paper on Monday morning to find 
out who's playing who, to find out what the point spread is, to 
find out if they can fit their golf game in between the football 
games that are going to be on television. And your life revolves 
around their schedule. And you get fed up with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pearlman won't get her husband, Allen, back until after the big  
game. An avid football fan who played during his high school days, 
Allen Pearlman has volunteered to usher at the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have his shoulder pads some place,'' his wife said.  
``He won't let me throw them out. We've moved five times and it's 
the first thing that goes into the truck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Football has cut into the scant time Susanne Lawson, 35, a golf  
pro at Woodmont Country Club in Tamarac, has to spend with her 
boyfriend, Rob. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll find a reason why each game every week has an importance  
for him to watch it,'' Lawson said. ``My only day off is on Sunday 
... It has gotten to the point now I'm just like, 'Go ahead, watch 
it. I'll find something else to do.''' 
</P>
<P>
	On the Internet, the football widows find companionship from the  
similarly abandoned in a custom-made chat group held during Monday 
night football. 
</P>
<P>
	Web sites, like www.sillysports.com/widow.htm, challenge  
visitors to ``strike out and get a life of your own while your man 
grows roots in front of the TV.'' The site features links to the 
Martha Stewart Living and Just Sports For Women Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, the Miami Dolphins drew 300 women to a  
three-hour, ladies-only demonstration led by coach Jimmy Johnson, 
filled with X's and O's designed to turn the women on to football. 
</P>
<P>
	Hannah Malisoff, 70, doesn't know who Joe Montana is, but has  
heard of a ``Flookie or Flute'' on cereal boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	She said her husband, Ray, has tried to get her to watch  
football, to appreciate the rules and strategy, but it hasn't 
taken. Only once, when she was ``much younger'' and she rode her 
brother's knack for betting on the right point spread, did she 
watch an entire season of football. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't enjoy it otherwise,'' said Malisoff, who coped with  
her husband's ravenous football appetite by going back to work on 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was retired. I'm a realtor now for 10 years because of  
football,'' Malisoff said. ``(He's) on the couch, and I don't want 
to be in the house on the couch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sonia Krupat, 50, of Tamarac, said because of her husband Sy's  
devotion to football, both have paid a price. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't have a social life, you can't go out,'' said Sonia  
Krupat, a New Jersey native. ``I go shopping and spend lots of 
money; figure that will make him see how I feel.''

<P>
	Come Super Bowl Sunday, the women plan to join numerous others  
at a party of their own, where they will dance and sing while their

and our lives back.''

<HEADLINE>  Falcons Hope To Cash In on Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- After 33 years, the Atlanta Falcons finally  
made it to the Super Bowl. Now, it's time to cash in. 
</P>
<P>
	``This town is turned on,'' coach Dan Reeves surmised. ``I think  
they're about as turned on right now as we can get 'em turned on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long one of the NFL's dormant franchises, the Falcons are hoping  
their improbable season will generate some enthusiasm for the rest 
of 1999. The first priority: increasing a season-ticket base that 
didn't even reach 30,000 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a perfect home record and the first NFC West title in 18  
years, Atlanta produced only two sellouts for eight regular-season 
games at the 71,228-seat Georgia Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay, this isn't.  
</P>
<P>
	``We need to lower the bar,'' Rob Jackson, vice president of  
marketing and sales, said Friday. ``You lower the bar by getting 
more season tickets in the house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the field, the Falcons have done their part by coming up with  
a catchy nickname, an arm-flapping end zone dance, an inspirational 
coach and, oh yeah, a trip to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's that magical type season that every franchise dreams  
of,'' Jackson said. ``You can't manufacture the kind of stuff 
that's happening out there. If we tried to contrive a Dirty Bird 
song or a Dirty Bird logo, it couldn't have happened. It happened 
because the fans got excited and the players got into it. These 
guys are having fun with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the burden falls to a marketing department that inherits  
the seemingly easy task of selling this appealing team to a 
once-wary city. 
</P>
<P>
	Falconmania had resulted in a significant boost in sales over  
the past six weeks. The team has taken more than 3,800 refundable 
deposits for the 1999 season, which is nearly double the 2,000 or 
so new season-ticket packages that were sold all last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the team has a long way to go to create the kind of  
demand that exists in cities like Green Bay, where there are long 
waiting lists for season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a totally different situation than any I've ever been  
involved in,'' said Reeves, who previously worked in Dallas, Denver 
and New York, all pro football hotbeds. ``We got a few people 
turned around a little bit at the end of the season (by winning six 
of the last eight games), but we still didn't see a drastic change 
during the offseason as far as ticket sales.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some fans hanging around the team's suburban training complex,  
hoping to snag a few autographs, wondered why the team hasn't 
launched a more aggressive season-ticket campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons have focused their advertising on newspapers so far,  
ignoring the broader appeal of television because local stations 
are devoting so much air time to the team anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been listening on TV, but I haven't heard anything about  
pre-sales,'' said Malcolm Cash, a potential new customer who lives 
less than two miles from the team headquarters. ``I would think 
they'd be talking about it. I guess everybody's concerned about 
getting Super Bowl tickets. But when it's over, people might change 
their minds in a hurry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said the Falcons, who usually begin their season-ticket  
campaign in April, plan to strike at potential buyers as soon as 
the Super Bowl is over. A championship would provide an enticing 
element for the advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've not done a lot of marketing, a lot of advertising at  
this time,'' he said. ``But we'll be aggressive while the 
excitement and momentum is there during the month of February, then 
we'll pick back up around draft time'' in April. 
</P>
<P>
	No advertising campaign could duplicate the marketing that has  
evolved naturally. The players got it started when they nicknamed 
themselves the ``Dirty Birds'' and came up with an infectious dance 
of the same name to celebrate touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, the city was galvanized by the plight of Reeves,  
who underwent heart bypass surgery with two games left in the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons kept on winning while Reeves recovered at home, then  
he made an inspirational return for the divisional playoff victory 
over San Francisco. Last week, Atlanta shocked heavily favored 
Minnesota in the NFC championship game, rallying for a 30-27 
overtime victory in one of the great postseason games in league 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``The personality of the football team has been the catalyst for  
all this,'' Jackson said. ``It's really come together into 
something where fans love what they're seeing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He optimistically hopes to increase the season-ticket base to  
45,000 next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to be easy. It will take a lot of work,''  
Jackson said. ``But this marketplace is excited about this football 
team.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Exec Denies Gov't Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Within the hundreds of pages of legal  
documents that make up the Microsoft antitrust case, a single 
allegation about the company's aggression toward one rival carries 
enormous consequence: that it once promised to ``cut off Netscape's 
air supply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next week, the senior Microsoft executive alleged to have made  
that threat, Paul Maritz, takes the witness stand to defend his 
company. In 160 pages of written testimony made public today, 
Maritz denied ever saying the ``air supply'' comment attributed to 
him during a November 1995 meeting with Intel Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never said, in the presence of Intel personnel or otherwise,  
that Microsoft would 'cut off Netscape's air supply,' or words to 
that effect,'' Maritz wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz also flatly denied other central allegations in the  
government's case, such as charges that Microsoft strong-armed 
Apple Computer Inc. into distributing its Internet browser software 
in 1997 and that it intimidated Intel Corp. into abandoning a rival 
technology earlier in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz accused government lawyers of trying to ``portray  
instances of routine interaction between companies in the computer 
industry, who inevitably must deal with one another, as something 
nefarious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a group vice president, Maritz falls in seniority below only  
Microsoft's billionaire chairman, Bill Gates, and its president, 
Steve Ballmer. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz joined the company in 1986 after working five years at  
Intel, and he is responsible for Microsoft's most important 
products, including its dominant Windows operating system and its 
profitable Office software programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the 11 weeks of trial, Maritz's name appears on  
nearly every controversial e-mail used by the government as 
evidence, either as author or recipient. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz also was a key player in convincing a reluctant Gates to  
include America Online's software within Windows in exchange for 
AOL distributing Microsoft's Internet software. The March 1996 deal 
proved important for Microsoft, whose browser now is used by many 
of AOL's 15 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know Mr. Gates was very, very uncomfortable about shipping  
AOL,'' Microsoft executive Brad Silverberg told government lawyers 
before the trial. ``Maritz ... arranged to try to get Mr. Gates to 
see the benefits of Microsoft working with AOL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another witness, Intel Vice President Steven McGeady, testified  
previously during the trial that Maritz and others from Microsoft 
met with executives in Oregon to discuss technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paul and some of the other attendees made some fairly colorful  
statements that stick out in my memory,'' McGeady testified. ``... 
It was Microsoft's plan to cut off Netscape's air supply. By giving 
away free browsers, Microsoft was going to keep Netscape from 
getting off the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges, in part, that Microsoft decided in 1995  
to include its Internet software free into newer versions of 
Windows to try to ``crush'' rival Netscape, whose own popular 
browser earned tens of millions of dollars. It said Microsoft 
launched its strategy after Netscape rebuffed an illegal offer to 
divide the market for Internet software. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz wrote that he ``never instructed any Microsoft personnel  
to seek a 'division of the market,' nor do I believe that any such 
proposal was ever made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft attorneys confronted McGeady with his own notes about  
the disputed November 1995 meeting, which don't mention Maritz's 
alleged ``air supply'' comment. They also produced notes from two 
other Intel executives, who also didn't include it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The phrase was so far out of bounds with what I consider to be  
an acceptable business practice,'' McGeady testified. ``It stuck 
out clearly in my mind.''

<HEADLINE>  Malone Back With Jazz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone made his peace with the Utah  
Jazz -- and his teammates breathed a sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Karl would be back, but I was a little worried, I  
admit it,'' Jeff Hornacek said. ``I look at the Bulls after 
Michael, and that doesn't look like a lot of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After an extended summer of discontent during which Malone  
appeared to be miles away from returning to the Jazz, he was back 
in the fold on Thursday after an emotional press conference with 
team owner Larry Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, Malone joined his Jazz teammates for workouts on  
the first day of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really had no doubt Karl and Larry would work something  
out,'' guard John Stockton said. ``This is Karl's home, and this 
team knows him very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting Karl back doesn't change our plans for the season,''  
coach Jerry Sloan said. ``If it hadn't worked out, then you'd see a 
different look on my face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two months ago, Malone vowed never again to play for the Jazz.  
But in the broader scope of Malone's tumultuous offseason, two 
months is an eternity. 
</P>
<P>
	Things have changed.  
</P>
<P>
	``You say things sometimes that you wish you wouldn't have said.  
It takes a bigger man to admit he was wrong,'' Malone said. ``I 
apologize for a lot of things I said. The stuff that happened this 
summer made me grow up quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the hastily arranged press conference, Malone, Miller and  
Malone's agent, Dwight Manley, all said they intend to keep the 
Mailman in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	They also criticized as untrue an earlier report that they had  
already agreed to a four-year extension. Malone has one year 
remaining on his current contract and will be paid $3.7 million 
during the abbreviated season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always been committed to keeping Karl in a Jazz uniform  
for the rest of his career ... and I am sure that we're going to be 
able to do that,'' the teary-eyed Miller said. ``I'd like to have 
an agreement right now, but that's not possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone and Miller hadn't spoken for weeks before an intense,  
lengthy conversation on Wednesday night. They said they emerged 
from the meeting with a spoken agreement to work out a lucrative, 
long-term deal as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to playing my career out here in Utah,''  
said the 35-year-old Malone. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller and Manley said they lobbied for an addition to the NBA's  
collective bargaining agreement that would allow teams to sign 
players who have been in the league for 12 years and with their 
teams for 10 years to extensions for an unlimited amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Karl is one of the only players like that,'' Manley said.  
</P>
<P>
	The addition wasn't made to the agreement, but the Jazz have  
petitioned the league for a waiver that would allow them to sign 
the 1997 MVP to a similar contract. If the waiver is granted, 
Miller said, the Jazz will be quick to act. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as the agreement allows us to talk about an extension,  
at the first opportunity, we'll do it,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the waiver isn't granted, no deal could be completed until  
next summer, when Malone would become a free agent for the first 
time in his career. Manley said the Jazz ``will obviously have the 
first and best shot'' to sign Malone. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone has dabbled in everything from pro wrestling to talk  
radio since the Jazz lost the NBA Finals to the Chicago Bulls last 
June. But with the lockout over and the Jazz a strong favorite to 
contend for their first NBA title, Malone said he decided the grass 
was greener on his own side of the fence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes a man to admit he was wrong,'' Malone said. ``My  
family and I want to spend the rest of our lives in Utah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gail Miller and Kay Malone, wives of the owner and the player,  
sat together during the press conference. The families live only 
minutes apart in an affluent hillside suburb of Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	``I drive past his house every night and every morning and I  
think about him,'' Larry Miller said. ``Maybe we've got too 
emotionally dependent on each other, I don't know.''

<HEADLINE> Currency Crisis Hurting Brazilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO BERNARDO DO CAMPO, Brazil (AP) -- Ask Marcilio Barros what he  
thinks of Brazil's economic stabilization plan and he'll say it 
cost him the job he held for 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Barros worked at the Ford Motor Co. plant here until this month.  
At Christmas, he was among 2,800 workers fired to reduce output, as 
auto sales slumped and the country spun toward recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the 1994 anti-inflation program known as the Real Plan  
has collapsed. Inflation that plunged from 2,700 percent to about 2 
percent in 1998 is creeping up again. 
</P>
<P>
	Barros sits under a sweltering sun outside the idle plant and  
ponders his future. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I know is that it's not very bright,'' said Barros,  
preparing for a protest against the latest layoffs. His shirt 
carries a mock Ford logo altered to read ``Fome,'' the Portuguese 
word for hunger. 
</P>
<P>
	The future also looks bleak for much of the economy since Brazil  
abruptly devalued its currency, the real, this month. The real 
quickly fell 30 percent, and analysts say hard times are coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``The country is in a state of emergency. Alarm bells are  
sounding,'' said Carlos Mariani Bittencourt, a director of the Rio 
de Janeiro Federation of Industries. 
</P>
<P>
	The federation predicts that Latin America's largest economy  
will shrink 5 percent this year, compared to a pre-devaluation 
estimate of minus 2 percent. Inflation should rise to up to 10 
percent, and Brazil's 8 percent official unemployment also is 
likely to climb. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices will certainly rise for a wide range of products, from  
bread to drugs, plastic to electronics. Consumers are wary, 
especially with big-ticket items like cars. 
</P>
<P>
	At a large car dealership in an upscale Sao Paulo neighborhood,  
employees wander listlessly among the shiny new cars. Customers are 
scarce -- the devaluation made imported parts more expensive, and 
automakers say price increases are inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	Buyers, already leery about interest rates of more than 30  
percent a year, have simply disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our sales have dropped by about 40 percent and haven't picked  
up since,'' said one sales manager, who asked not to be identified. 
``With the devaluation, only God knows when things will get 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One imported-car dealer strung up a banner saying he was  
charging last week's exchange rate of 1.23 reals to the dollar, 
compared to Friday's rate of around 1.70. 
</P>
<P>
	The crisis in the auto industry, which accounts for 12 percent  
of the country's industrial gross domestic product, began in late 
1997 with the Asian financial turmoil that later spread to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	To protect the economy from currency speculators, the government  
boosted interest rates and issued a hefty increase in an excise tax 
on industrial production, including cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The measures staggered the auto market, where nearly 70 percent  
of sales are made on credit -- often with dollar-pegged 
installments. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, sales hit their lowest level in five years, dipping to  
1.2 million vehicles, down 27.5 percent from the previous year. 
More than 100,000 unsold vehicles sit in factory yards and on 
dealers' lots. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the industry fired 11,000 workers -- nearly 10 percent  
of its labor force -- including the Christmas layoffs at Ford. To 
justify the move, Ford took out a full-page newspaper ad saying it 
was forced to reduce daily output from 1,100 units to 500. 
</P>
<P>
	In protest, many of the dismissed workers staged an  
``anti-strike,'' showing up for work anyway. Ford offered higher 
severance pay but said the layoffs would stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ford surely could go bankrupt if it keeps those 2,800  
workers,'' said Carlos Augusto Marino, head of the company's human 
resources department in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts see little improvement in the short term.  
</P>
<P>
	``Excluding exports, which should rise, the first half of the  
year is going to be very painful for all,'' said Paulo de Tarso 
Petroni, a director for the consulting firm Arthur Andersen. 
``Domestic sales could improve in the second half but not enough to 
increase last year's sales figures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Petroni added that an improvement will be possible only if  
the real stabilizes and interest rates drop. 
</P>
<P>
	Both industry and labor leaders favor a buyer incentive plan  
proposed by the Sao Paulo state government. Under it, anyone who 
turns in a car at least 15 years old can obtain a discount of up to 
$2,000 toward the purchase of a new one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brazil has close to 6 million cars that could be traded in  
under this program,'' said union leader Carlos Alberto Grana. 
``Production could increase by some 400,000 units a year and, more 
important, 25,000 jobs will be guaranteed.''

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the second week of President Clinton's  
impeachment trial wound down, Democratic senators' support for the 
president solidified while some Republicans began wavering on the 
strength of the case or the need to call witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	One Republican, Susan Collins of Maine, said she was having  
difficulty with the evidence supporting the charge that Clinton 
lied before a grand jury, and wasn't sure it met ``the test under 
our perjury laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she hadn't decided whether to vote against the perjury  
charge but ``I think ... the obstruction charge is much stronger.'' 
She proposed that the two articles be voted on separately so that 
senators could make choices on the merit of each. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as House prosecutors moved to rebut the White House  
defense, the number of Democrats who might have voted for 
conviction dwindled. Robert C. Byrd, the party's most senior 
senator, and a colleague from California who had been critical of 
the president both announced they were ready to halt the 
proceedings in Clinton's favor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do think there's a general consensus and growing support in  
favor of dismissal and in opposition to (calling) witnesses,'' 
Minority Leader Tom Daschle said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a show of support, a few Democrats announced they had decided  
to vote to acquit Clinton if the trial went that far. ``I will vote 
for the motion to dismiss. I would vote against witnesses. And if, 
however it comes up, the motion to acquit, I would vote for that,'' 
said Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans continued to insist Friday that the trial be  
carried through to a final vote, but the unpopular proceeding was 
beginning to take a toll on some. ``I think all of us are getting a 
little tired of sitting there unable to talk,'' said Robert Bennett 
of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah suggested that some witnesses be  
questioned privately without testifying in the Senate. Then, if 
it's ``absolutely guaranteed'' there aren't 67 votes to convict, he 
said the Senate could pass legislation recognizing the House 
impeachment as ``the highest vote of condemnation and of censure 
for the president's despicable acts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If all 45 Democrats supported bringing the trial to end, six  
Republicans still would have to cross over to approve a motion. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd surprised Republicans by announcing he would make a motion  
to dismiss the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am convinced that the necessary two-thirds for conviction  
are not there and that they are not likely to develop,'' said Byrd, 
the West Virginian who has served in the chamber for four decades. 
The senator said he was taking his action not because he believed 
Clinton had committed no wrongdoing but because it was best for the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	His announcement sent a small group of Republicans hurrying out  
to the television cameras during a break to deny that the trial was 
over. But one Republican acknowledged that Byrd's name added clout 
to the effort to dismiss the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that he is doing this certainly will have weight,''  
said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., declared she was  
ready to acquit the president, even though she said last year that 
Clinton's behavior had ``shattered'' her trust in him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have come to a conclusion based on the presentation of the  
managers that they have not made a case beyond a reasonable doubt 
that this man has committed a perjury and an obstruction of 
justice,'' Feinstein said.

<HEADLINE> Fund-Raiser Sought in Passport Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Democratic fund-raiser Yah Lin  
``Charlie'' Trie may be headed to jail if prosecutors can prove he 
filed a false police report in order to illegally obtain a new 
passport. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie, a longtime friend of President Clinton, faces charges he  
obstructed a U.S. Senate investigation by ordering an employee to 
get rid of documents that had been subpoenaed. He pleaded innocent 
to those charges and others in Washington and has been free pending 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Now prosecutors are asking for a hearing in Washington at which  
Trie would have to show cause why he should not have his release 
revoked. 
</P>
<P>
	In papers filed in federal court here on Thursday, prosecutors  
said Trie initially reported his home was burglarized last November 
and that $2,200 worth of property -- including his Taiwanese 
passport -- was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	The facts he alleged then are different from those Trie  
presented in court papers in December, prosecutors said, when he 
violated the terms of his release by applying for a substitute 
passport. Trie said he didn't know that was a violation, the papers 
said, though his passport and other travel documents were seized 
when he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, they said, he ``engaged in a scheme that involved the  
making of a false police report to explain the `loss' of his ... 
passport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A condition of Trie's freedom stipulates that he break no laws.

	In court documents filed in December, prosecutors said ``it is  
not necessary'' to know Trie's motive for the alleged passport scam 
for it to be illegal. They did, however, lay out a timeline in the 
papers showing that two days before the Taiwanese government 
received Trie's application for a replacement passport, prosecutors 
had turned over to defense attorneys witness statements that were 
``not helpful'' to Trie. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie, who used to run a Little Rock restaurant and is a longtime  
friend of President Clinton, is accused of instructing an employee 
to get rid of documents sought in the campaign fund-raising 
investigation by the U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Trie is accused of giving illegal political  
contributions to the Democratic National Committee and of arranging 
for other illegal donations.

<HEADLINE> Logging Considered in Grand Canyon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The National Park Service hopes to experiment  
with tree cutting in Grand Canyon National Park to see if it would 
improve the overall health of the forest. 
</P>
<P>
	If allowed this summer, it apparently would be the first time  
one of America's 52 national parks had been logged. But park 
officials stressed Friday that it would not be a timber operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this is, is a very small-scale research project to test  
four methods of restoration,'' Grand Canyon spokeswoman Maureen 
Oltrogge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said the experiment is  
necessary because ``for many years we suppressed naturally 
occurring fire and, without meaning to, created artificial, 
unhealthy and dangerous forests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists agree something must be done but fear too many  
trees will be cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can always cut down more trees, but you can't put them  
back,'' said Sharon Galbreath of the Sierra Club. ``Should we be 
experimenting in a national park, with a method that resembles 
full-scale logging?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Park biologist R.V. Ward said park's plan is to cut about 8,000  
trees. ``More have been cut in road-widening projects,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said there is no other place that looks like a park,  
``so if we take data outside the park, it may not work there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Public hearings have been scheduled in February on the Grand  
Canyon plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Public outrage stopped a similar idea in Yellowstone National  
Park after the fires of 1988, Galbreath said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans To See Tornado Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, saying he was ``very sad to  
learn of the terrible losses'' that Arkansans suffered in Thursday 
night's tornadoes, will return to his home state Sunday for a 
firsthand look. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that the Governor's Mansion, where Hillary and I  
raised Chelsea for 12 years, was actually in the path of the storm 
made it all the more real to me,'' Clinton said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He made plans for the trip to the state capital of Little Rock  
after a briefing from James Lee Witt, director of the Federal 
Emergency Management Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply committed to doing everything we can to help the  
people there recover,'' Clinton said. He consulted by phone with 
Little Rock's mayor and other state and local officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be working with them to get whatever appropriate  
assistance is required,'' Clinton said. ``And our thoughts and 
prayers are with them.''

<HEADLINE> Online Pornography Challenge Feared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The operator of a Web site that contains  
sexual material said he fears he will be prosecuted and forced to 
shut down because of a new federal law designed to keep online 
pornography away from children. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell Tepper's testimony came on Thursday, the second day of  
the American Civil Liberties Union's challenge against the Child 
Online Protection Act, which was signed by President Clinton in 
October but has not been enacted. 
</P>
<P>
	Tepper operates the Sexual Health Network, which provides advice  
and equipment for ill and disabled people who experience sexual 
dysfunction. 
</P>
<P>
	He said many people who use the site are too ashamed and  
embarrassed to talk to their own doctors and would be scared off if 
they had to register to use the site, as the law requires. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a shoestring operation operating out of my house,'' said  
Tepper, a sexuality researcher for the University of Pennsylvania. 
``It would essentially put my home at jeopardy and close my 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Lowell A. Reed temporarily blocked  
enforcement of the law in November. Reed is expected to decide by 
Feb. 1 whether a longer delay should be issued. 
</P>
<P>
	The act is the second major effort by Congress to protect  
children using the Internet. It would require commercial Web sites 
to collect a credit card number or some other access code as proof 
of age before allowing Internet users to view material deemed 
``harmful to minors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Violators would face up to six months in jail and a $50,000  
fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court struck down the first law, the Communications  
Decency Act of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed was expected to rule today on whether to close the  
courtroom for part of the hearing. The ACLU made the request on the 
grounds that some testimony could reveal business trade secrets of 
the plaintiffs. Several news organizations are fighting the 
request.

<HEADLINE> IOC VP: Salt Lake Was Out of Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A campaign to ``win friends'' -- and the 2002  
Winter Games -- for Salt Lake City spun out of control into the 
biggest scandal in Olympics history, the IOC's top investigator 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	While his month-old inquiry found no signs of criminal behavior,  
International Olympic Committee Vice President Dick Pound said 
Thursday that Salt Lake's bid went well beyond the rules, with 
six-figure gifts of cash and benefits to IOC members who also 
overstepped their limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Salt Lake folks were out to win friends, and they  
clearly thought friends would be more likely to support them than 
enemies, and did everything they could to strengthen those friendly 
ties,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a day of speeches and interviews prior to leaving for  
Switzerland to deliver his report to the IOC's executive board, 
Pound said rule-breakers in the committee would face expulsion and 
that more investigations and safeguards were needed to prevent a 
recurrence of the Salt Lake scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	He also issued a stirring apology to fans, athletes, sponsors  
and, especially, Salt Lake City, saying the IOC had dropped its 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unfortunate that a community that is so well prepared to  
host an Olympic Winter Games should have its overall integrity 
called into question,'' Pound told an audience of sports-marketing 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Salt Lake won because it had ``the best, most  
comprehensive bid. End of story,'' and probably lost four years 
earlier only because the IOC had just chosen Atlanta for the 1996 
Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound refused to identify the IOC members under investigation or  
say exactly what gifts Salt Lake bidders may have passed their way. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused, however, to deny a Wall Street Journal report that  
the payments totaled almost $800,000, and said they were spread 
fairly evenly among about a dozen of the committee's 114 members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the (implicated) members, but not all, received gifts  
in six figures,'' he said. ``That was in direct cash and 
benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As IOC investigators reviewed books of the Salt Lake City bid  
committee that won the games in 1995 on a fifth try, the amount of 
the gift packages grew, Pound said. He said they started in late 
1991, shortly after the city lost the 1998 Winter Games to Nagano 
by four votes, and continued in a few cases beyond the winning 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC investigators are now ``99.5 percent'' sure they have  
identified the members who broke the rules in Salt Lake, Pound 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other investigations are under way into the scandal,  
including ones by the Justice Department and the Utah attorney 
general. Pound, a Canadian tax lawyer, said his group found nothing 
``with the earmarks of criminal action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But if no direct bribes or vote buying in the secret ballot  
could be documented, Pound said, he had no doubt the payments made 
to win votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said his report deals only with the Salt Lake bid, but  
that broader investigations of how the IOC picks cities for the 
Olympics were needed. Letters would be sent to all committees that 
bid for Summer and Winter Games from 1996 through 2006, asking for 
details of any improprieties in their campaigns or improper 
approaches by members. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't make sense that Salt Lake is the first and only  
time this has happened,'' he said. ``We'll go from here to there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Summer Games in 1996 were the first awarded fully under IOC  
ethics rules limiting gifts from bid cities. The host for the 2006 
Winter Games will be picked by the IOC in June. 
</P>
<P>
	It is vital that those other bid committees tell all they know  
before a special general assembly in March called to deal with the 
corruption issue, according to Pound. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be best for all of us to deal fully, fairly and  
finally with this issue and not have it drag on,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound also said a permanent way to investigate corruption was  
needed by the IOC, both to root out wrongdoers and cement faith of 
sponsors, fans and athletes that the Olympics are clean on all 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has to be an ongoing mechanism to deal with this,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such oversight could come from an extension of his own panel's  
tenure or be a piece of an overall ethics code for the IOC, a 
private club whose main asset has become a billion-dollar sports 
marketing machine over the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about how many members were implicated in the scandal,  
Pound said to ``stick with'' the number of 13 given last week by 
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch. Two members, Pirjo Haeggman 
of Finland and Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi of Lybia, have since 
resigned. The Journal reported that 16 members would be implicated 
in the report. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pound disputed Samaranch's description of the investigation  
as having turned up nine ``serious'' cases worthy of expulsion and 
four other cases with fairly minor offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``A case is a case is a case,'' he said, noting that the only  
penalty provided in the IOC's bylaws was expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The supreme recourse for us is to expel a member, and that is  
what we are prepared to do,'' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound also said Samaranch should ignore calls to resign as IOC  
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Samaranch has an enormous amount of experience in  
managing the IOC through both good and bad times. And right now, we 
need that stability more than ever,'' he said. ``No one is more 
determined to correct this situation than he is. And no one is in a 
better position to manage the organization now.''

<HEADLINE> Colorado Introduces Coach Barnett </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Gary Barnett, who led a remarkable  
resurrection at Northwestern, returned to his coaching roots today, 
taking over as coach at Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision to come to Colorado was easy because it's home,''  
Barnett said. Still, he said, he was leaving ``a wonderful 
institution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett was formally introduced as Colorado coach at a news  
conference where he was given a leather jacket emblazoned with a 
Colorado ``C.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado athletic director Dick Tharp said he looked for two  
things during his search for a coach -- commitment to teaching 
student-athletes and a passion for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see that in Gary's eyes,'' Tharp said. ``You can see it in  
his background. And you will certainly see it in the way that he 
conducts his program at the U of C.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett, Colorado's third head coach since 1994, replaces Rick  
Neuheisel, who left the Buffs on Jan. 9 to accept a lucrative 
contract offer at Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	During his seven years at Northwestern, Barnett revived a  
program that had been on life support since the '70s. The Wildcats, 
who had not won more than four games since 1971, went 8-0 in the 
Big Ten in 1995 to earn only their second Rose Bowl berth. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett's sparkle has faded in the past two seasons as the  
Wildcats have gone 8-16, including an 0-8 record in the Big Ten 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett, who also was a head coach at Fort Lewis College in  
Durango, has a career coaching record of 43-56-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning percentages aside, Barnett was a clear-cut favorite for  
the Colorado job because of his Rocky Mountain roots. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett, 52, spent nine seasons as the head coach at Air Academy  
High School in Colorado Springs before taking his first collegiate 
head coaching position at Fort Lewis in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett was hired as the running backs coach at Colorado in 1984  
and gradually assumed more responsibilities in eight seasons under 
longtime head coach Bill McCartney. 
</P>
<P>
	In his final year with the Buffs, Barnett served as offensive  
coordinator and helped Colorado to an 8-2-1 record following its 
1990 national championship season. 
</P>
<P>
	CU's success helped Barnett win the job at Northwestern,  
considered one of college football's most challenging rebuilding 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett tackled the challenge head-on, predicting he would take  
the ``Purple to Pasadena,'' and he fulfilled that promise when he 
led Northwestern to the 1996 Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats lost to Southern California, but Barnett's stock  
soared in the wake of his team's 10-2 season. Northwestern went 9-3 
and won a share of the Big Ten title in 1996 before falling on hard 
times in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the recent struggles, Barnett's job security was not an  
issue in Chicago. Following Northwestern's Rose Bowl appearance, 
Barnett agreed to an 11-year contract worth about $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	At Colorado, Barnett has been given a five-year contract with a  
salary package worth $710,000 annually. The contract was approved 
Thursday by the CU board of regents. 
</P>
<P>
	For the team, the switch will mean a major change from the  
laid-back Neuheisel. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive lineman Adam Reed, who played for Barnett one year at  
Northwestern, said, ``This will be a change for the players coming 
back. The whole attitude will change. Coach Barnett is a 
disciplinarian. He lays down guidelines, which players need.''

<HEADLINE> Court To Hear Indian-Amoco Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed Friday to referee a  
big-stakes dispute between Amoco and an Indian tribe in Colorado 
over ownership of methane gas contained in the coal located under 
the tribe's reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices said they will decide whether a pair of 90-year-old  
federal laws that gave the government ownership of the coal applied 
as well to methane gas found with it. A decision is expected by 
late June. 
</P>
<P>
	For most of this century, such gas was viewed only as a  
dangerous element of coal mining, but relatively recent 
technological developments has made coal bed methane commercially 
valuable. 
</P>
<P>
	The Southern Ute Tribe, which undisputably owns the coal under  
its reservation, contends it also owns the methane gas. But Amoco 
Production Co., a subsidiary of Amoco Corp. that has purchased the 
right to drill for natural gas on the reservation, claims the 
methane is a natural gas it is entitled to take. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal trial judge ruled for Amoco. But last July, the entire  
10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision in a 6-3 
vote and ruled for the tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on Friday, lawyers for Amoco said the July  
ruling had upset ``settled expectations of property rights in 
natural gas worth billions of dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amoco's lawyers argued the appeals court ``fundamentally  
misinterpreted'' two laws, the 1909 and 1910 Coal Land Acts that 
reserved federal ownership of coal while allowing the land surface 
to be bought by homesteaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the tribe and the Clinton administration had urged  
the justices to reject Amoco's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress has taken action in response to the court of appeals'  
decision, and it now appears that the decision will directly and 
immediately affect only the parties to this particular 
litigation,'' Justice Department lawyers told the court. 
</P>
<P>
	But that assertion did not deter others in offering the justices  
their unsolicited advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who filed friend-of-the-court briefs supporting Amoco's  
appeal included the National Association of Royalty Owners, 
Independent Petroleum Association of America and five Western 
states -- Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Utah and Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Amoco Production Co. vs. Southern Ute Indian Tribe,  
98-830.

<HEADLINE> USX's Earnings Down 58 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- USX Corp., the nation's top steel maker,  
blamed an influx of cheap imports for driving profits from its 
steel business down 58 percent in the fourth quarter and 24 percent 
throughout 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter income was $59 million, or 63 cents per share, on  
sales of $1.36 billion compared to income of $141 million, or $1.52 
per share, on sales of $1.84 billion in the year-ago period, USX 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's shares fell 81 1/4 cents, or 3 percent, to $26.18 3/4 on  
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	USX chairman Thomas Usher said American steel makers have been  
hurt by steel imports ``at predatory prices'' that are flooding 
U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
	But stock analyst Charles Bradford of Bradford Research Inc. in  
New York said USX's report was better than expected. ``Profits were 
half, but they're still profitable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Iron and Steel Institute said Thursday that imports  
jumped 33 percent through November 1998 and took nearly one-third 
of the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports contributed to USX's drop in profits, Bradford said, but  
so did last year's 54-day General Motors strike. ``The domestic 
market was quite good until the GM strike,'' Bradford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Income for the year was $315 million, or $3.40 per share, on  
sales of $6.3 billion compared to $417 million, or $4.51 per share, 
on sales of $6.9 billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Marathon Group, the petroleum subsidiary, reported a 90 percent  
drop in fourth-quarter net income to $13 million, or 4 cents per 
share, from $131 million, or 45 cents per share, in the same period 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Marathon reported a 49 percent drop in income throughout 1998 to  
$321 million, or $1.09 per share, as compared to $635 million, or 
$2.20 per share, in 1997. Marathon attributed the drop primarily to 
lower prices for oil and gas. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Steel joined an industry labor coalition to file trade  
cases for hot rolled products against Japan, Russia and Brazil in 
September. That prompted the U.S. International Trade Commission to 
initially determine in November that those imports may threaten the 
domestic steel industry and investigate further with the U.S. 
Department of Commerce. A report on that investigation is slated to 
be released next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton Administration this month held out a threat of  
action against Japan if that country does not live up to promises 
to cut steel exports to the United States. But the industry and 
lawmakers from the 16 steel-producing states quickly rejected the 
president's approach as offering too little help.

<HEADLINE> Scottie Pippen Signs With Rockets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Although it took over 24 hours longer than  
anticipated, the Houston Rockets finally got Scottie Pippen's name 
on a five-year, $67.2 million contract Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like tag-team praying,'' delighted coach Rudy  
Tomjanovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd sleep for an hour and the he (vice president Robert Barr)  
would wake me up and I'd pray. This is like a dream come true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement ended a lengthy negotiating session that  
started after the Rockets delayed and then called off a Texas 
welcome for Pippen Thursday night. Owner Les Alexander cited 
problems with wording in the collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll have no problem putting on this jersey,'' said Pippen,  
who had been with the Chicago Bulls throughout his career. ``I'm 
very comfortable with it. In fact, I'm going to sleep in it 
tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's delay caused the Rockets to miss their first two  
scheduled workouts while waiting for Pippen to sign and clear the 
rest of the Rockets free agents to sign their contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Alexander expected to complete the deal overnight, the  
Rockets and agent Jimmy Sexton spent most of Friday hammering out 
the final details -- and the team missed two more workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said the delay centered around new rules governing  
performance bonuses. 
</P>

	``I did a lot of great things in Chicago, but I don't want to  
cut my career short,'' Pippen said. ``I want to come to Houston and 
do some of the same things I did in Chicago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets could not sign their free agent players until Pippen  
signed the contract that put the Rockets over the salary cap. Under 
terms of the contract, teams can re-sign their own players if they 
are over the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakeem Olajuwon, Brent Price, Rodrick Rhodes and Charles  
Barkley, who signed Thursday for $1 million, are the only Rockets 
players under contract. Rhodes is recovering from surgery to repair 
a torn tendon in his chest and Barkley is playing in the Bob Hope 
Desert Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	After getting Pippen's signature, the Rockets also signed Matt  
Bullard, Othella Harrington, Matt Maloney, Eddie Johnson and 
Anthony Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets were anxious to get started with preparations for  
Tuesday's exhibition opener in the Compaq Center against the San 
Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to get started,'' guard Brent Price said. ``I know  
it's frustrating for everyone, especially the coaching staff. 
Meanwhile, most of the other teams are working out and getting 
fined-tuned and going over their stuff. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just a situation we've been put in this year,'' Price  
said. ``We have so many free agents. Once this thing breaks, we've 
got to make the most of our time.''

<HEADLINE> West Virginia Might Tax Chew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- In the state that leads the nation in  
chewing tobacco use, where even children are often given a can of 
their own, the governor is proposing to capitalize on the habit by 
taxing it. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Gov. Cecil Underwood, a former board member of the  
American Cancer Society, sees it as a health issue. He wants $5 
million of the anticipated $7 million revenue from the tax to pay 
the state's share of a program for children without health 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	He's running into opposition on both sides of the legislative  
aisle. Republicans oppose increasing taxes, and many Democrats say 
chewing tobacco is a part of West Virginia's culture, something 
that grew in popularity in part because smoking is banned in the 
coal mines. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father always told me, if you know a person who chews  
tobacco or carries a pocket knife, you'll find he's a pretty good 
fellow,'' said Senate Majority Leader Truman Chafin, a Democrat. 
``And it's true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West Virginia has the nation's highest percentage of men who  
chew tobacco -- 18.4 percent, compared with the national average of 
7.2 percent. In one county, 54 percent of men chew. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegate Greg Butcher, a strip miner, said miners often chew  
tobacco to moisten their mouths in the dusty atmosphere. ``Their 
daddies used it and their granddaddies used it,'' Butcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smokeless tobacco is cheap and has more nicotine than  
cigarettes. Kids tend to get hooked early in West Virginia, said 
Sara Crickenberger, executive director of the state's American Lung 
Association chapter. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people think that it's cute or it's funny'' to give  
it to children, Crickenberger said. ``They laugh about how sick the 
kids get the first time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood has proposed a 25 percent tax, despite the urging of  
anti-tobacco lobbyists, who want it to be 50 percent. Chewing 
tobacco in West Virginia sells for about $2.50 a can. 
</P>
<P>
	Lobbyist John Hodges said the tax would hurt stores in West  
Virginia's border counties -- more than half the state -- because 
only one of the five surrounding states taxes smokeless tobacco. 
Ohio has a 17 percent tax.

<HEADLINE> Girl's 'Miracles' Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) -- Roman Catholic investigators haven't  
been able to establish whether wondrous happenings attributed to a 
disabled girl are definitely miracles. They are satisfied the 
peculiar events are no flimsy hoax. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know,'' Bishop Daniel P. Reilly said Thursday. ``These  
are things you have to live with, even though we don't like to do 
that in this day and age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reilly, who is supervising the investigation, formed a team of  
two psychologists and a theologian 14 months ago to investigate 
claims of miracles at the home of Audrey Santo, 15, of Worcester. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. F. Stephen Pedone, a canon law expert for the diocese,  
said there are only a handful of such investigations under way in 
the entire church. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl has been comatose since she nearly drowned at age 3 in  
a backyard swimming pool. Visitors to her Worcester home say 
statues of Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary appear to weep as they 
inexplicably ooze oil. Hosts -- the wafers representing the body of 
Christ -- are said to bleed. Some visitors say the girl takes on the 
suffering of others and helps rid others of ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference Thursday, the investigators said they  
witnessed the oozing of oily liquid from statues and saw red, 
blood-like stains on hosts. They said laboratory tests identified a 
sample purportedly taken from a host as human blood from someone 
other than a family member. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found nothing we could consider to be trickery,'' said John  
Madonna, a psychologist on the investigation team. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigators said they will continue to study the evidence  
and conduct more laboratory tests of religious objects in the home. 
They have no deadline to complete their work. 
</P>
<P>
	Madonna said they may never be able to explain the happenings as  
either natural or divine. ``In the final analysis, it may simply be 
a matter of faith,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the bishop did speak of a ``special presence of God''  
within the home. ``People are in such need of hope and healing, and 
I think Audrey brings something of that into their lives,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He praised Audrey's parents, Steve and Linda Santo, for having  
cared for their daughter. ``There's something at least in the 
general sense ... miraculous about that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, church officials also denounced some practices  
surrounding the girl. They said Catholics should pray for -- but not 
to -- her. They said sick people should not be anointed with oil 
from the statues, and the bishop said he regretted huge public 
services centered on the girl because ``it turns the girl into a 
spectacle.'' About 8,000 came to such a service in August.

<HEADLINE>  Albright Steps Up Yugoslavia Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says she  
is lining up U.S. allies to push a series of demands on Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic to end ``new and unacceptable violence 
in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If he keeps rejecting the demands, she said Thursday, the  
Serbian leader runs the risk of a NATO bombardment. ``Force is the 
only language he appears to understand,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, President Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony  
Blair confirmed their growing concern with the situation in Kosovo 
in a 30-minute telephone conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	A White House spokesman, David Leavy, said the two leaders had  
agreed ``the Serb actions are clearly unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They consulted on the next steps and reiterated it is  
important for the security of the region that the international 
community insist on Serb compliance, through the use of force if 
necessary,'' Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic, meanwhile, backed down on evicting William Walker, an  
American diplomat who headed an international inspection team. 
Walker had been threatened with expulsion after expressing horror 
on inspecting the results of a massacre last Friday of 45 ethnic 
Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, head of a 750-person international monitoring team, had  
refused to vacate his offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Suspending that expulsion order is not sufficient action on  
Milosevic's part, Clinton's special envoy, Richard Holbrooke, said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problems we are now facing were caused primarily --  
unfortunately, not exclusively -- by the Yugoslav side and they must 
take corrective action,'' Holbrooke said on ABC's ``Good Morning 
America.'' ``We are moving ahead with NATO this morning to prepare 
for military action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in the midst of making it very clear that Milosevic  
can't choose who the head'' of the monitoring group is going to be, 
Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world is confronted by new and unacceptable violence in  
Kosovo,'' Albright said. The massacre at Racak ``has brought 
tensions to a razor's edge,'' she said as she prepared for a trip 
that will involve consultations with British, French and other 
allies as well as the Russians on the crisis in the Serbian 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the Yugoslav  
government's ``freezing'' of the expulsion order did not resolve 
the problems Milosevic had created. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to insist, and NATO continues to insist, that not  
only the verification mission be permitted and allowed to operate 
independently and without interference'' but also that Milosevic 
withdraw troops and police units from Kosovo, as he promised in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	As Albright took aim at Milosevic, it was clear that the Clinton  
administration -- and much of Europe -- still looked to the Serbian 
leader for a solution to the conflict between Serbs and ethnic 
Albanians, many of whom want to separate from Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	But some members of Congress and analysts suggested other  
approaches, including the stationing of NATO forces in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., and a handful of other senators have  
written to Clinton calling for an explicit U.S. statement that 
Milosevic must be replaced with a democratic government. 
</P>
<P>
	``No American policy to promote a stable and peaceful Balkan  
region can succeed if Serbia remains, as it has since the breakup 
of Yugoslavia, under the grip of a regime that depends on crisis 
for its continued hold on power,'' they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morton Abramowitz, a former U.S. ambassador and ex-director of  
the State Department's intelligence office, has suggested the 
administration pursue independence for the ethnic Albanians, who 
make up about 90 percent of the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic has been a central figure in U.S. diplomacy in the  
Balkans for years. He was courted for the negotiations that 
produced an agreement in November 1995 to end an ethnic war in 
Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the crisis in Kosovo, and the stern U.S. approach to the  
Serbian leader, typified by Albright in her speech Thursday to the 
Center for National Policy, has not spilled over to Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dayton agreements, which ended the war, gave Milosevic a  
prominent role in peacemaking in Bosnia ``and enabled him to 
transform his reputation from Balkan troublemaker to Balkans 
peacemaker,'' said James Hooper, executive director of the Balkan 
Action Council, a group that keeps tabs on the troubled region. 
``He has considerable leverage in Bosnia and could disrupt the 
situation any time he wants to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hooper proposed working with Milosevic ``to some extent,'' but  
working also with the democratic opposition. ``We would create new 
and more effective leaders,'' he said. ``This could result in a 
process gradually leading to democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bosnia agreement is holding, and the likelihood of a  
resumption of fighting is minimal, said George Biddle, vice 
president of the International Crisis Group, a private think tank. 
</P>
<P>
	But the conflict could spread to Macedonia, Albania and  
elsewhere, Biddle said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``Must we deal with Milosevic? He obviously is the president of  
Serbia and he is the man you have to deal with,'' Biddle said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Milosevic is not listening to the United States and the  
allies on Kosovo, Biddle said. So, he said, the best approach is to 
issue an ultimate and not talk to him. ``Nothing else is going to 
work now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Dempsey, an analyst with the Cato Institute, takes a far  
different view. He says NATO air strikes could further entrench 
Milosevic by unifying Serbs behind him, while giving the Kosovo 
Liberation Army an incentive to provoke Serb forces even more.

<HEADLINE> Rafter Misses Chance at No. 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Pat Rafter missed an opportunity to  
take over the No. 1 spot from Pete Sampras at the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian, who spent time at No. 2 last year before  
slipping to No. 4, lost 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 to Sweden's Thomas 
Enqvist in a third-round match Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Enqvist stomped on Rafter's second serves and punished him with  
his own. The two-time U.S. Open champion needed to reach the final 
to pass Sampras, who is skipping the year's first Grand Slam 
tournament because of fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	Five players had a chance to take over from Sampras here. Of  
them, only Andre Agassi remains in the tournament. But to reach No. 
1, he would have needed bonus points from beating high seeds 
already gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter said the past year wore him out too, so he plans to play  
about 19 tournaments this year instead of the 26 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to have a lot more breaks than I did last year,''  
Rafter said. ``It's too hard to keep playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter came into the tournament after going 1-2 in three tuneup  
matches. He complained that the pressure of playing at home weighed 
heavily. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to this year,'' Rafter said. ``I feel like  
I want to go back out and train, which is a positive sign for the 
rest of the year. Unfortunately, it's not going to happen here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter has yet to go beyond the fourth round of the Australian  
Open and he was pinned back from the net Friday as Enqvist reeled 
off some stunning groundstrokes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the crucial seventh game of the fourth set, Enqvist kept  
hammering backhand winners off Rafter's serve and got the winning 
break when the Australian had his second double fault. 
</P>
<P>
	Enqvist was considered a dangerous unseeded player before the  
tournament, after winning all eight tuneup matches. 
</P>
<P>
	He goes from playing one local hero to another, having to meet  
Mark Philippoussis in the fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if he can keep it going for five sets,'' Rafter  
said of Enqvist. ``But he's probably in the best shape and hitting 
the ball as well as ever.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Turn Mixed; Dow Down 92.95 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed at midday, with Internet  
shares bouncing back from a steep selloff while blue-chip stocks 
remained under selling pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 92.95 at 9,171.13. The blue-chip index fell as much as 
175-points at mid-morning before bouncing back. 
</P>
<P>
	``This market can't rock and roll day in and day out,'' said  
Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; 
Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ``The Dow was up 900 points in four weeks 
time, and now gravity is getting to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Internet-laden Nasdaq  
composite index, which fell 40 points in early trading and 71 
points Thursday, was up 1.79 at 2,346.51. 
</P>
<P>
	Disappointing fourth-quarter sales at IBM, the world's biggest  
computer maker. IBM, put pressure on blue-chip stocks today. IBM 
was down 13 7/8 at 183 1/8, which accounted for more than 50 points lost 
in the Dow today. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks fell sharply in early trading, but rebounded at  
midday. While investors worry that the Internet stock boom will 
soon end, many couldn't resist the bargains available after 
Thursday's steep selloff. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also kept a close watch on developments in Brazil.  
Latin America's largest economy continues to struggle with its 
ailing economy and weakening real, the Brazilian currency which has 
depreciated by about 31 percent since Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The early decline on Wall Street followed some weakness in  
global trading. In Asian markets, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 
0.64 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 3.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In Europe, Germany's DAX index was down 3 percent, Britain's  
FT-SE 100 was down 2.7 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 3.2 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 354.99 million 
shares, down from 384.99 million shares on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 5.15 at 1,230.01, the  
NYSE composite index was down 2.75 at 585.28, and the American 
Stock Exchange composite index was down 4.40 at 700.59.

<HEADLINE> Train Derails in Upstate New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NELLISTON, N.Y. (AP) -- The derailment of a freight train  
carrying hazardous materials prompted a partial shutdown of the New 
York State Thruway and forced the evacuation of 150 people. 
</P>
<P>
	A 75-mile stretch of the Thruway was closed until 4 a.m. today  
after 31 cars on the Conrail train jumped the tracks Thursday 
evening near Nelliston, 50 miles northwest of Albany. There were no 
passengers on the 141-car train and no one was injured, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A state police spokesman said both sides of Interstate 90 from  
Duanesburg to Utica were shut down. The derailment happened with a 
half-mile of the highway. 
</P>
<P>
	State hazardous materials crews and environmental officials were  
called in because 20 cars were carrying several different types of 
dangerous and flammable chemicals, including propane, sulfuric 
acid, isopropyl alcohol, butane and styrene. No leaks were 
reported.

<P>
	At least 150 people with a half-mile of the derailment were  
ordered from their homes and sent to area schools to spend the 
night.

<P>
	The train was traveling from Niagara Falls to Albany. The cause  
of the accident remains under investigation.

<HEADLINE> How Postal Poll Was Conducted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Associated Press poll on postal service is based on  
telephone interviews with 1,015 randomly selected adults from all 
states except Alaska and Hawaii. The interviewing was conducted 
Jan. 13-17 by ICR, of Media, Pa. The results were weighted to 
represent the population by key demographic factors such as age, 
sex, region and education. 
</P>
<P>
	No more than one time in 20 should chance variations in the  
sample cause the results to vary by more than 3 percentage points 
from the answers that would be obtained if all Americans were 
polled. 
</P>
<P>
	This margin of sampling error is larger for responses of  
subgroups, such as income categories. There are other sources of 
potential error in polls, including the wording and order of 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP poll questions (because of rounding, sums may not total  
100 percent): 
</P>
<P>
	1. Overall, do you think the United States Postal Service is  
doing an excellent job, a fair job, or a poor job? 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent -- 22 percent; good -- 50 percent; fair -- 21 percent;  
poor -- 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	2. Compared to five years ago, do you think the level of service  
provided by the post office is better than it was, worse than it 
was or has it stayed about the same? 
</P>
<P>
	Better -- 29 percent; worse -- 9 percent; about the same -- 60  
percent; don't know -- 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	3. As you may know, the U.S. Postal Service just raised the cost  
of mailing a one-ounce letter by a penny. Do you think the cost of 
a stamp is a bargain, is it too expensive or is the cost about 
right? 
</P>
<P>
	Bargain -- 14 percent; too expensive -- 32 percent; about right --  
51 percent; don't know -- 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	4. When you are sending a package, do you usually use the post  
office or do you use another service such as Federal Express or 
UPS? 
</P>
<P>
	Use post office -- 65 percent; use another service -- 32 percent;  
don't know/refused -- 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Which one item is your biggest concern about the postal  
service? 
</P>
<P>
	Speed of mail delivery -- 37 percent; cost of stamps -- 10  
percent; counter service -- 11 percent; no concerns about post 
office -- 39 percent; don't know/refused 3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Slain Georgia Policeman Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VILLA RICA, Ga. (AP) -- Police Capt. Robbie Bishop was always  
looking for that next big score, the routine traffic stop that 
would turn into a multimillion-dollar drug bust. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those stops cost him his life. Bishop was shot and killed  
Wednesday after pulling over a navy blue Chevrolet Blazer on 
Interstate 20. 
</P>
<P>
	As the mug shot of the suspect hung on the office wall, officers  
from across Georgia streamed through this town's tiny police 
station Thursday to pay tribute to their slain colleague. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knew Robbie and all that he had done in this line of  
work,'' Villa Rica Police Chief Dean Maddox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before Bishop was shot, he issued a warning ticket to  
Jeffrey McGee, a 32-year-old Schenectady, N.Y., man who has been 
charged with murder and assault in Bishop's death. Police believe 
he has fled to the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	McGee had been arrested 10 previous times, according to  
Schenectady police, but none of the arrests were for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	For reasons that weren't clear, Bishop had not alerted the  
dispatcher after the stop, nor did he turn on the video camera to 
document the pullover, police said. Officers are taught to call in 
each traffic stop, including the location, license tag, make and 
color of the vehicle and the number of passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop, a 35-year-old ex-Marine, built a career by hauling in a  
fortune in drug money and illegal drugs from drivers along Georgia 
interstates. He also traveled to other states to teach his 
techniques to other departments. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop was considered one of the lead highway interdiction  
officers in the country, said Brian Sullivan, an agent with 
Georgia's Drug Enforcement Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``For him, a big bust was like getting an eagle or making a  
birdie in golf,'' said Villa Rica City Manager Steve Russell. ``He 
would have done this job for free if he could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop, a married father of two, had been with the Villa Rica  
department in Carroll County west of Atlanta for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	A member of the joint Interstate Crime Enforcement Unit, he  
assisted in the seizure of more than 10,000 pounds of narcotics and 
the confiscation of more than $8 million from drug traffickers over 
the past seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just decided all drugs were evil and wanted to put a dent  
into the drug trade,'' Maddox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop was not without his critics.  
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta defense attorney Herb Shafer, who in 1991 defended a man  
pulled over by Bishop for weaving, described the officer's tactics 
as ``predatory'' and said he was not surprised by the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only was it predictable, it was inevitable,'' Shafer said.  
``Sooner or later, citizens whose constitutional rights are being 
trampled on are going to arm themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Maj. Jimmy Jordan of the Spalding County Sheriff's  
Department said Bishop taught everyone to stay within the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand the objection to what he was doing,''  
Jordan said. ``The ones he stopped were drug dealers and killers.''

<HEADLINE> Discount Retailer Caldor To Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORWALK, Conn. (AP) -- Discount retailer Caldor Corp., which has  
operated under bankruptcy court protection since 1995, announced 
today it was closing its 145 stores for good. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to liquidate the company follows the refusal of a  
group of creditors to agree to a plan of reorganization, Caldor 
management said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	``We accomplished a great deal over the course of the last  
several years,'' Caldor Chairman Warren Feldberg said. ``However, 
given the nature of our capital structure and the shortfall to our 
performance goals, the board had no alternative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Caldor's headquarters, employees streamed from the building  
at noon carrying the contents of their desks in cardboard boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Anna Viera worked in Caldor's purchasing department for six  
years. She said employees were given the news in a series of 
meetings this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really a sad situation. We've been around for 50 years.  
It's sad to see it happen,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Musson, who ran the merchandise presentation department, said  
employees had begun expecting the news, especially after learning 
the company had stopped paying vendors or buying anything new. 
</P>
<P>
	``It happens,'' he said. ``You move on.''  
</P>
<P>
	The $2.5 billion company, with about 20,000 employees, operates  
stores in nine East Coast and Mid-Atlantic states including 
Connecticut and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Going-out-of-business sales will likely begin in several weeks  
and be completed by May, the company said. Caldor will also seek a 
court order allowing it to sell its real estate assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldor sought bankruptcy court protection in September 1995, and  
was aiming to emerge from that protection this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company was unable to come to terms that satisfied  
everyone, particularly a group of secured creditors who opposed 
reorganization plans proposed by the board. The identities of the 
creditors were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	The company was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange last  
year, and announced Jan. 9 that it was no longer ordering or taking 
delivery of new stock from its suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	There were reports last week that Caldor was in negotiation to  
sell 64 of its stores to other retailers -- possibly Kohl's, Target 
and Kmart. But no deal was ever announced, and the status of any 
sale talks was not immediately clear in light of Caldor's decision 
to liquidate.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies Sign Parks, 3 Draft Picks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) -- The Vancouver Grizzlies signed  
free agent Cherokee Parks and three draft picks, including No. 1 
Mike Bibby, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bibby, the former Arizona point guard who the Grizzlies took  
second overall in last June's draft, signed a three-year, $9 
million deal, with Vancouver holding an option for a fourth year. 
</P>
<P>
	He will earn $2.3 million this year, $2.5 million next year and  
$2.7 million in the final year with a 20 percent bonus each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Parks, a forward-center, agreed to a three-year, $6 million  
contract. He spent the past two seasons with the Minnesota 
Timberwolves after being drafted by the Dallas Mavericks 12th 
overall in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Felipe Lopez, a guard from St. John's, agreed to a three-year  
contract worth just over $2 million with Vancouver holding an 
option on a fourth year. Lopez was drafted 24th overall by the San 
Antonio Spurs, then traded along with Carl Herrera, to Vancouver 
for Antonio Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez will receive $600,000, $650,000 and $690,000 with a 20  
percent bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Forward J.R. Henderson from UCLA, taken in the second round,  
agreed to a one-year deal at the NBA rookie minimum salary of 
$275,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The four players we have signed represent an important part of  
the future of the franchise,'' general manager Stu Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies are still trying to reach an agreement to extend  
the contract of forward Shareef Abdur-Rahim. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said he was negotiating with Abdur-Rahim's agent, Aaron  
Goodwin, to try and structure a deal based on the maximum 
seven-year, $85.6 million package allowed by the new collective 
bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Not in camp is former Duke star Bobby Hurley. The Grizzlies are  
trying to trade the guard, who is entering the final year of a $4 
million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Grizzlies can't deal Hurley, they'll be forced to waive  
him and still have to pay his salary.

<HEADLINE>  Rehnquist Displays Tolerant Tone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It is a kinder, gentler Chief Justice William  
H. Rehnquist on display at the Senate impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The time limit for lawyers' statements is flexible. If someone  
gives a long response to a yes-or-no question? No problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chair will operate on a rebuttable assumption that each  
question can be fully and fairly answered in five minutes or 
less,'' Rehnquist announced Friday as senators queried lawyers in 
President Clinton's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lawyer, Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., took about nine  
minutes to answer a broadly worded question, and the chief justice 
did not stop him. Most other lawyers kept fairly close to the 
five-minute limit, and nobody went on long enough to prompt 
Rehnquist to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
	Ordinarily, the nation's top judge strictly enforces time limits  
for lawyers' arguments at the Supreme Court. He also sternly 
rebukes lawyers who try to avoid answering a question, and 
sometimes tells them a simple ``yes'' or ``no'' will do. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., objected that House  
prosecutor Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., was giving an involved answer to 
a question that sought a yes-or-no response, Rehnquist declined to 
step in. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chair has not tried to police the responsiveness of the  
answers to the questions, so I'm going to overrule the objection,'' 
Rehnquist said. Hutchinson finished his answer. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes earlier, Rehnquist ruled out of order a suggestion by  
Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., that Hutchinson did not fully respond to 
another question. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators submitted their questions in writing to the chief  
justice, who read them in a deliberate near-monotone. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist, only the second chief justice to preside at a  
presidential impeachment trial, was comfortable enough to crack a 
joke or two. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Hutchinson objected to a question submitted by  
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., saying she misstated his 
just-finished response to the previous question. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can the managers object to a question?'' Rehnquist  
interjected, and quickly conferred with the Senate parliamentarian 
at the podium. 
</P>
<P>
	``The parliamentarian says they (the prosecutors) can only  
object to an answer and not a question, which is kind of an unusual 
thing,'' the chief justice said with a smile, drawing laughter from 
the senators. 
</P>
<P>
	When Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., asked Rehnquist how  
much time the prosecution and defense lawyers had used up so far, 
the chief justice initially announced the parliamentarian's count 
at 57 minutes for Clinton's lawyers and 54 minutes for the 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rehnquist quickly corrected the prosecutors' speaking time  
to 64 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I trust that means I don't have to sit down, Mr. Chief  
Justice,'' said Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., who had just come to 
the podium to answer a question. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not retroactive,'' Rehnquist joked in return.  
</P>
<P>
	Until the question-and-answer session, the chief justice's role  
in the impeachment trial involved little more than bringing each 
day's session to order, calling for each lawyer's presentation and 
announcing the adjournment at the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	He issued his only previous ruling of the trial on Jan. 15, when  
Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, objected to House lawyers referring to 
senators as jurors. Rehnquist upheld the objection, saying, ``The 
Senate is not simply a jury, it is a court in this case.''

<HEADLINE> Tighter Market Discipliune Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The world faces the threat of ``financial  
collapse'' unless governments impose more discipline on 
free-wheeling markets, an influential Japanese government official 
said on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech that challenged the free market philosophy espoused  
by many U.S. policy-makers, Eisuke Sakakibara, a vice minister at 
the Ministry of Finance, argued for greater government control over 
the flow of money around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a definite risk of a world financial collapse,''  
Sakakibara said. ``The financial system we have today is inherently 
unstable. We need to set up a mechanism to stabilize financial 
markets,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakakibara proposed closer monitoring of capital flows by  
governments and creating common international rules for financial 
markets. He also called for more coordination on economic policy by 
leading countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The basic dilemma lies between free-wheeling global markets  
and sovereign nation-states,'' Sakakibara said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakakibara, known as ``Mr. Yen'' for his influence in foreign  
exchange markets, warned against relying too much on market forces 
-- something he called ``market fundamentalism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He argued instead for some form of government control to keep  
currencies from swinging wildly and to stop investors and 
speculators from pulling funds out of a country too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	The outspoken finance official was more upbeat about his own  
country, predicting that Japan's financial crisis was ``nearing an 
end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tough steps by bank regulators to mend ailing banks and take  
over insolvent ones were beginning to restore confidence in the 
financial system, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan nationalized two major banks last year.

<HEADLINE> Man Pleads Guilty in Boxer's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A man admitted shooting to death Curlie  
Sanders, a bronze medalist as a light-welterweight boxer at the 
1986 U.S. Olympic Sports Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronnie Thaxton Jr., 20, will be sentenced to 10 to 20 years in  
prison next month in exchange for pleading guilty Thursday to 
first-degree manslaughter. He had been charged with second-degree 
murder, which carries a maximum penalty of 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
	Thaxton admitted shooting Sanders, 33, with a .38-caliber  
revolver during a street quarrel over money last May 25. He said he 
intended to seriously injure Sanders, but not to kill him, when he 
shot him in the chest and buttocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors offered the plea mainly because the only witness  
disappeared after claiming that Thaxton's brother threatened to 
kill him if he testified. 
</P>
<P>
	After his boxing career ended, Sanders often helped train  
Charles ``The Natural'' Murray, who won the IBF welterweight title 
in 1993.

<HEADLINE> IOC To Decide on Swiss Tax Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The IOC has discussed giving back a  
Swiss tax concession but has not made a final decision, the 
committee's director general said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee official Francois Carrard said the matter was been  
reviewed in light of the corruption scandal rocking the Olympics 
because the IOC did not want to embarrass Swiss authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to say categorically that no decision has been taken  
over this,'' Carrard told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that experts had told him that the concession, which  
exempts the IOC from paying value-added tax in Switzerland, was 
worth about 300,000 Swiss francs a year, not 2 million francs as 
had been widely reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lausanne-based IOC has been exempt from paying tax in  
Switzerland since 1981, but it had to seek a separate exemption to 
the VAT when the Swiss adopted that form of taxation in 1995. The 
concession was approved by the government last September, four 
years after the IOC requested it. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Hodler, an IOC executive board member and chairman of the  
finance commission, was quoted in a Swiss newspaper Thursday as 
saying the decision to return the money had been taken by himself, 
Carrard and IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	But Carrard said nothing would be decided until the outcome of  
the investigation into alleged bribery of members to obtain their 
votes for Salt Lake City to host the 2002 winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC, which is happy and proud to have its base in  
Switzerland since 1915, realized that there were some doubts and 
questions and all sorts of commentaries,'' said Carrard. ``So we 
said we didn't want the IOC to cause political controversy in 
Switzerland. We said we don't want to embarrass the authorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The VAT exemption is due to be reviewed by a commission of the  
lower house of the Swiss parliament on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said the IOC received tax breaks because all its money  
came from outside the country and was spent outside the country as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	He said all IOC employees were subject to Swiss tax.

<HEADLINE> FB Player Indicted on Mail Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A Canadian football player was indicted on  
mail fraud charges for allegedly applying for and receiving illegal 
disaster relief loans following the Northridge earthquake, a 
federal prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Seymour Stewart, a defensive tackle for the CFL's  
Saskatchewan Roughriders, received $396,100 from the U.S. Small 
Business Administration after he falsely claimed that his business 
sustained considerable damage during the 1994 quake, Assistant U.S. 
Attorney Patricia Beaman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 32, was charged with seven counts of mail fraud and  
could face a maximum sentence of 210 years in prison and a $1.75 
million fine. An arrest warrant was issued for Stewart, believed to 
be living in Toronto, Beaman said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the earthquake, Stewart applied for disaster loans,  
claiming that his business, Business Computers in Artesia, and 
inventory were damaged by the quake and its aftershocks, the 
prosecutor said. He closed his business in September 1994, but then 
requested more federal aid, Beaman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it was an ongoing fraud that went on for the better  
part of a year,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to the league and the Roughriders after business hours  
Thursday were not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The magnitude-6.7 earthquake that struck Jan. 17, 1994, killed  
72 people, injured 9,000 and caused $25 billion in property damage.

<HEADLINE> Gay Discharges in Air Force Climb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Air Force said today it discharged 414  
people last year for being gay, a one-third increase over the 
previous year and the highest yearly total since the Pentagon 
stopped requiring service members to disclose their sexual 
orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force officials said most of those discharged had  
voluntarily acknowledged they are gay and most were new recruits 
undergoing basic training at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	T'jae Gibson, a spokeswoman at Air Force headquarters in the  
Pentagon, said an Air Force review of the situation at Lackland 
last year found that most instructors and trainees there believed 
the acknowledgments of homosexuality were made to escape the Air 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
	In most instances in which trainees at Lackland told their  
instructors of their homosexuality they also asked to be 
discharged, Ms. Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 414 gay discharges last year, 271 were of trainees at  
Lackland, Ms. Gibson said. Others were cases in which an 
investigation was triggered by witness reports of alleged 
homosexual acts, and in one case two female members were discharged 
for announced plans of same-sex marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Figures on 1998 gay discharges in the Army, Navy and Marine  
Corps were not immediately available, although Defense Department 
spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the figures would be released. 
</P>
<P>
	A leading advocacy group for military members asserted today  
that the increase in discharges suggests Air Force commanders are 
openly hostile to gay service members. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon's policy on gays, adopted in 1994 and labeled  
``don't ask, don't tell,'' is not providing relief for gays serving 
in the military but instead ``has been used to target gays even 
more,'' said Dixon Osburn, co-executive director of the 
Servicemembers Legal Defense Network. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in gay discharges in the Air Force was disclosed in  
today's San Antonio Express-News. 
</P>
<P>
	The 414 discharges for homosexuality compare with 309 in 1997  
and 180 in 1994, the year the Pentagon changed its policy. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the newspaper's report, the Air Force released  
figures showing that of the 414 discharges in the fiscal year ended 
last September, 391 were cases in which service members made 
statements that the Air Force calls ``voluntary admissions'' of 
being homosexual, bisexual or engaged in homosexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gibson said Gen. Lloyd Newton, commander of Air Education  
and Training Command at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas, ordered a 
review of the situation at Lackland last year after learning that 
gay discharges were ``disproportionately high'' there. 
</P>
<P>
	Newton's review concluded that Lackland commanders were fully  
complying with the Defense Department's policy on gays, Ms. Gibson 
said.

<HEADLINE>  Rehnquist Displays Tolerant Tone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It is a kinder, gentler Chief Justice William  
H. Rehnquist on display at the Senate impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The time limit for lawyers' statements is flexible. If someone  
gives a long response to a yes-or-no question? No problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chair will operate on a rebuttable assumption that each  
question can be fully and fairly answered in five minutes or 
less,'' Rehnquist announced Friday as senators queried lawyers in 
President Clinton's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lawyer, Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., took about nine  
minutes to answer a broadly worded question, and the chief justice 
did not stop him. Most other lawyers kept fairly close to the 
five-minute limit, and nobody went on long enough to prompt 
Rehnquist to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
	Ordinarily, the nation's top judge strictly enforces time limits  
for lawyers' arguments at the Supreme Court. He also sternly 
rebukes lawyers who try to avoid answering a question, and 
sometimes tells them a simple ``yes'' or ``no'' will do. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., objected that House  
prosecutor Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., was giving an involved answer to 
a question that sought a yes-or-no response, Rehnquist declined to 
step in. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chair has not tried to police the responsiveness of the  
answers to the questions, so I'm going to overrule the objection,'' 
Rehnquist said. Hutchinson finished his answer. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes earlier, Rehnquist ruled out of order a suggestion by  
Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., that Hutchinson did not fully respond to 
another question. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators submitted their questions in writing to the chief  
justice, who read them in a deliberate near-monotone. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist, only the second chief justice to preside at a  
presidential impeachment trial, was comfortable enough to crack a 
joke or two. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Hutchinson objected to a question submitted by  
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., saying she misstated his 
just-finished response to the previous question. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can the managers object to a question?'' Rehnquist  
interjected, and quickly conferred with the Senate parliamentarian 
at the podium. 
</P>
<P>
	``The parliamentarian says they (the prosecutors) can only  
object to an answer and not a question, which is kind of an unusual 
thing,'' the chief justice said with a smile, drawing laughter from 
the senators. 
</P>
<P>
	When Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., asked Rehnquist how  
much time the prosecution and defense lawyers had used up so far, 
the chief justice initially announced the parliamentarian's count 
at 57 minutes for Clinton's lawyers and 54 minutes for the 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rehnquist quickly corrected the prosecutors' speaking time  
to 64 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I trust that means I don't have to sit down, Mr. Chief  
Justice,'' said Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., who had just come to 
the podium to answer a question. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not retroactive,'' Rehnquist joked in return.  
</P>
<P>
	Until the question-and-answer session, the chief justice's role  
in the impeachment trial involved little more than bringing each 
day's session to order, calling for each lawyer's presentation and 
announcing the adjournment at the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	He issued his only previous ruling of the trial on Jan. 15, when  
Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, objected to House lawyers referring to 
senators as jurors. Rehnquist upheld the objection, saying, ``The 
Senate is not simply a jury, it is a court in this case.''

<HEADLINE> Sixers Sign Geiger, Grant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- After the Philadelphia 76ers signed 10  
players and acquired another in a trade, president Pat Croce still 
had to worry about another very important contract -- Allen 
Iverson's. 
</P>
<P>
	Croce said Thursday that he hasn't gotten the go-ahead to  
renegotiate Iverson's deal under the NBA's new collective 
bargaining agreement. Iverson's three-year contract is up after 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how the talks with Iverson are expected to go, Croce went  
to the man himself for answers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey Bubba,'' Croce yelled across the court to Iverson, who was  
working on his shooting before the Sixers' first official team 
practice. ``Tell them how our talks are going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson flashed a rare smile, gave two thumbs up and said,  
``Like Siskel and Ebert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was good for a laugh, and that's because Croce fully expects  
Iverson to sign with the Sixers very soon for a long, long time. 
Asked if he wants to stay in Philadelphia, Iverson said, ``Of 
course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think with this team we have here right now, my goals seem  
more and more accomplishable every day,'' Iverson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sixers were one of the busiest teams as the NBA officially  
opened for business after the long, costly lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, the Sixers signed free-agent center Matt Geiger to  
a reported $51 million, six-year contract, re-signed forward Theo 
Ratliff to a seven-year deal, and also added free agents Harvey 
Grant (two years, $2.1 million) and George Lynch (one year at the 
minimum). 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Philadelphia signed its three draft picks -- Larry Hughes,  
Nazr Mohammed and Casey Shaw -- and acquired 6-foot-8 forward Mirsad 
Turkcan from Houston. Turkcan was the Rockets' first-round pick 
last June who was playing in his homeland of Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	Gone is Derrick Coleman, who signed with the Hornets.  
</P>
<P>
	The schedule released Thursday has Philadelphia opening at  
Charlotte on Feb. 5. The Sixers' first home game is Feb. 6 against 
Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	``The toughest part for me is to get these guys the preparation  
that they need,'' Sixers coach Larry Brown said. ``I don't want to 
punish them because of the lockout, but I've got to work them hard. 
You can't afford not to be ready from the beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Geiger said he signed with the Sixers because, ``I felt the  
opportunities were better here. It's a younger team. And with coach 
Brown, I've just liked some of the things he's always done. 
</P>
<P>
	Geiger said a long dispute with Hornets coach Dave Cowens about  
the extent of a hamstring injury he had late last season didn't 
affect his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had an injury, and coach Cowens said stuff like my leg ought  
to be falling off and severed not to play,'' Geiger said. ``I 
decided I wanted to wait until it was fully healed, and at that 
time he decided not to play me. It just escalated into something, 
but it wasn't that big a deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson spent much of the team's media day working on his  
shooting. He appears to be in great shape and a good frame of mind 
despite mounting personal problems -- again involving cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Mercedes-Benz Credit Corp. sued Iverson for more than  
$28,500 in unpaid lease payments on three late-model cars. The suit 
also asks for the return of the cars and for the total buyout 
amount, about $300,000, on the 24-month lease vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know until the article came out,'' Iverson said. ``It  
was something that my accountant was supposed to handle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever his personal problems, Iverson seems more determined  
than ever to really begin to make his mark this season -- especially 
with Michael Jordan retired. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not one player is going to be able to fill those shoes,''  
Iverson said. ``You could get a group of athletes, maybe 10 or 15, 
and all those feet probably don't fit. I don't think there's going 
to be one guy that does it the way he did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Locked out no more, Iverson gets his chance to try.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to win the most championships,'' he said, ``AND I want  
to be the best player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sixers also signed center Benoit Benjamin to a  
veteran-minimum $1 million and signed Stacey King, Yah Davis and 
Darrin Hancock to one-year, league-minimum contracts.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Accused of Racist Fliers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OXFORD, Ohio (AP) -- Two black students were arrested after their  
fingerprints were found on inflammatory racist fliers posted last 
fall at Miami University, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fliers, found at the university's Center for Black Culture  
and Learning on Oct. 30, attacked blacks and homosexuals and 
prompted two days of student protests that resulted in seven 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials on Thursday accused Nathaniel Snow, 22, and  
Brad Allen, 21, of posting the fliers. Both were charged with 
criminal mischief and criminal trespass and could face up to 90 
days in jail and $750 in fines if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow and Allen withdrew from the university Thursday and  
surrendered at police headquarters, where they were booked and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation  
matched fingerprints found on the fliers with those from Snow and 
Allen, the university said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have not provided any explanation, nor have they admitted  
to being in there or hanging up any fliers,'' said Cathryn House, 
the university's chief of campus police. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of people in the community are going to feel  
betrayed and upset,'' said Miami President James Garland. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that ``most of the students who participated in the  
demonstrations did so because they had legitimate concerns. And we 
need to remember that those concerns need to be taken seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snow was president of the Black Student Action Association,  
which led a protest prompted by the fliers and racist messages 
found on computer screens at the black cultural center. Snow later 
met with Garland and demanded that the university do more to fight 
racism. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen was among a group of seven students arrested for  
disorderly conduct after blocking traffic in protest of the fliers.

<HEADLINE> Abortion-Related Criminals Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- The organizer of a banquet held by  
abortion foes to honor their militant peers defended the event as a 
gathering of the like-minded. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Michael Bray also defended the tactics -- including  
bombing clinics and killing doctors -- that have led to jail time 
for many who attended Thursday's banquet and auction to raise money 
for families of anti-abortion activists in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would call it the use of force to defend the innocent in the  
womb,'' said Bray, jailed for nearly four years for bombing and 
setting fire to seven abortion clinics in the 1980s. ``It's 
defensive force, not retributive force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The banquet came on the eve of today's anniversary of the 1973  
Supreme Court decision in the Roe vs. Wade case that legalized 
abortion. It was similar to events at which critics say posters 
were introduced featuring a ``dirty dozen'' list of physicians who 
provided abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Planned Parenthood and four doctors say the posters amounted to  
a hit list, and are seeking $200 million in an Oregon lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Bray is a danger to society,'' said Margie Kelly,  
spokeswoman for the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy in New 
York. ``It's uncivilized what he's doing and what his organization 
hopes to accomplish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those in attendance was John Brockhoeft, 47, who spent  
seven years in a federal prison for firebombing two Cincinnati 
abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prison is hard,'' said Brockhoeft, who attended the event clad  
in black military fatigues and a black beret. ``The price might be 
high, but I was sure I was doing the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A prison sweat shirt worn by Brockhoeft fetched $125 in an  
auction of keepsakes. Twelve items netted $700 for families of 
people imprisoned for abortion-related crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Other items included a camouflage scarf, hat and baby booties  
made by a woman jailed for shooting a doctor who performed 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	The booties, knitted by Rachelle Shannon of Grants Pass, Ore.,  
sold for $40. Ms. Shannon, convicted of shooting a Wichita, Kan., 
abortion doctor in 1993, is serving a 31-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The scarf and hat went for $70 after auctioneer Don Spitz said  
wearing them would make a strong ``pro-life fashion statement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The auction was ``really just a sideline,'' said Bray, who  
organized the banquet along with members of his Reformation 
Lutheran Church. ``The real purpose is just to bring everybody 
together.''

	Senators Pose Questions at Trial  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators posed their first questions to  
lawyers in President Clinton's impeachment trial today. They also 
gave House prosecutors an opportunity to contest some of the White 
House claims made during their defense presentation. Rep. Ed 
Bryant, R-Tenn., one of the prosecutors, seized the first question 
and tried to rebut White House assertions that the perjury case 
against Clinton was a ``he said-she said'' case. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Seeks Anti-Terrorism Aid  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he will ask  
Congress for $2.8 billion to help the United States guard against 
attacks via computers, viruses or chemicals. ``The enemies of peace 
realize they cannot defeat us with traditional means,'' Clinton 
said in a speech at the National Academy of Sciences. He said the 
United States has to guard against attacks on the nation's computer 
network, banking systems, power grids and other essential services.

	AMMAN, Jordan -- Jordan's King Hussein informed his brother today  
that he was removing him as heir to the throne and moving his sons 
in line for the crown, sources close to the king said. Hussein, 63, 
told Prince Hassan through aides that he will appoint him as his 
deputy -- a new post that appears to entail limited authority. 
Hussein, who is undergoing cancer treatment, became king at age 17. 
Sources say the strongest candidate to become crown prince is 
Hussein's eldest son, Abdullah, 37.

<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Tornadoes ripped across the South for  
the second time in less than a week, killing eight people in two 
states and leaving thousands of people without power early today. 
Twisters hit central Arkansas in waves late yesterday, collapsing 
roofs, knocking down power poles and leaving trees strewn about the 
grounds of the governor's mansion. ``The lights flickered a couple 
times, then it went black,'' said Derrick Stallworth, who was 
shopping in the Harvest Foods grocery when the storm struck. ``I 
decided to hit the floor, then I saw the roof coming down.''

decree today to keep the Mir space station in orbit for three more 
years, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. The move is almost 
certain to disappoint U.S. space officials, who want Russia to 
abandon the Mir in coming months so Moscow can spend its limited

	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A gun group has decided to hold its

against the nation's gunmakers. The National Shooting Sports 
Foundation began notifying hotels yesterday that SHOT, its 
Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Tradeshow in January 2000. Foundation 
officials declined to elaborate on the decision, but city tourism 
officials said the group warned them in November that it might pull 
out because many of its members include gun companies New Orleans 
is suing.

said he was not involved in the offer, acknowleged that the 
inducement could be seen as a bribe and bring demands for Sydney to 
be stripped of the games. Earlier, a Libyan delegate became the 
second IOC member to resign amid vote-buying allegations in Salt 
Lake City's selection as host of the 2002 Winter Games.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Being married to James Cameron was a titanically  
miserable experience. 
</P>
<P>
	So says actress Linda Hamilton, who filed for divorce from the  
director of ``Titanic'' and ``The Terminator'' after nearly eight 
years of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to be the one to do the final destructive act. It's  
an important thing for me personally not to feel like the victim,'' 
Ms. Hamilton said in Friday's USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hamilton said that even at last year's Academy Awards -- when  
Cameron's ``Titanic'' won 11 trophies and he shouted, ``I'm the 
king of the world!'' -- he was still ``an absolutely miserable, 
miserable, unhappy man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the two had nothing in common except their 6-year-old  
daughter.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Lilith Fair may soon be the stuff of  
history.

	``After this summer, we might take a holiday for a year, or four  
years, or permanently,'' said Terry McBride, who co-founded the

<HEADLINE> Utah Pushes Olympic Oversight Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Utah legislators are pushing a bill that  
would increase oversight of Olympic finances. 
</P>
<P>
	``The buck stops in the Legislature,'' said Rep. Jordan Tanner  
of Provo. 
</P>
<P>
	His bill to create an Olympic Coordinating Committee, a panel of  
12 senators and House members, was approved Thursday by the House 
Government Operations Committee and sent to the full House for 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would establish tighter requirements for the governor  
and Salt Lake's mayor to review quarterly budgets of the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation comes amid reports that the Salt Lake City bid  
committee spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on International 
Olympic Committee members to secure the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tanner said his bill is not a reaction to the bribery  
scandal. He said he has been working on it for 18 months because 
legislators need more involvement in Olympic budget decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Sports Advisory Committee that advises the  
Legislature on Olympic matters has ``no meat on its bones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, his bill would preserve and enlarge that advisory  
panel, now made up of city, county and town officials and two 
athletes, by adding all the members of the Olympic Coordinating 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanner said the legislative oversight committee would carry  
enough political weight to prevail on organizers to curtail the 
2002 Games to avert any budget shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanner acknowledged the legislative panel wouldn't have absolute  
control over the Games, but, ``Right now, the Legislature has no 
teeth. I think we will have some teeth if we pass this 
legislation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Leavitt shares legislators' concerns about the state's  
possible liability for any Olympic shortfall, his lawyer, Gary 
Doxey, told the House panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Doxey appeared to give the governor's endorsement for the  
oversight committee, then found himself under sharp questioning 
over whether the state will have to pay any Olympic budget 
shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is Salt Lake City's guarantee protecting the IOC  
against any debts or claims after the 2002 Games. Former Gov. Norm 
Bangerter, in turn, agreed to use the financial power of the state 
to protect Salt Lake City against any losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt reaffirmed Bangerter's agreement in 1994, but recently  
has said the deal might not be constitutional. The city has been 
worried that it could be left holding the bag -- particularly since 
some corporate sponsors have become jittery over the bribery 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, critics of the Olympics threatened to launch a  
petition drive unless the governor and legislature act to protect 
taxpayers from financial disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	In other bribery scandal developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--The IOC delegate from Libya resigned today, the second member  
of the governing body to step down in the wake of Salt Lake City 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch told The Associated Press  
that Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi submitted his resignation in person 
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said Attarabulsi, an IOC member since 1977, stepped  
down because of revelations that his son received college 
scholarships at Utah schools from Salt Lake City boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	Finland's Pirjo Haeggman became the first IOC casualty of the  
scandal when she resigned Tuesday. She was implicated because her 
former husband got jobs through Olympic bidding committees from 
Salt Lake City and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Britain's sports minister said late Thursday the country won't  
bid for the Olympics until the IOC ``cleans up'' its act. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until it's cleaned up, until our own British Olympics  
Association's recommendations are put into place, I would not be in 
favor of this country or any city in this country bidding for any 
Olympic Games,'' Tony Banks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Simon Clegg, chief executive of the British Olympic  
Association, called for Salt Lake City to forfeit the 2002 Winter 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the British Olympic Association called for a  
complete overhaul of the Olympic bidding and site-selection 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf reported today that Brazil's  
Joao Havelange, one of the IOC longest-serving members and a former 
president of international soccer's governing body, accepted lavish 
treatment by Dutch officials trying to bring the 1992 Games to 
Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
	De Telegraaf said Havelange, 82, was among IOC members who were  
wined and dined, given gifts and escorted regularly to exclusive 
brothels in the Dutch capital. The newspaper did not specify the 
treatment Havelange received, but quoted a former Amsterdam 
organizer as saying he ``went overboard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember it very well because he had special wishes -- wishes  
which were in conflict with the IOC laws,'' said Peter Kronenberg, 
who headed the press office of the Amsterdam Olympic Games 1992 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the gifts were diamonds, bicycles, sports articles, Delft  
blue porcelain, paintings and exclusive art books, De Telegraaf 
said, citing former foundation members it did not identify. 
</P>
<P>
	--SLOC chairman Bob Garff was to outline the process for choosing  
a new SLOC leader today. SLOC president Frank Joklik has stepped 
down because of the scandal. Committee board members have said they 
expect the new president will be someone with Utah ties. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt has been pushing for SLOC to define the search process.  
``The governor feels we can't afford to take six months out of the 
planning process,'' Leavitt spokeswoman Vicki Varela said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Organizers of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta say they want  
to stop speculation about what misdeeds may have been done in 
winning that city's bid, even if that means an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some ways I wish they'd just investigate us, because I  
don't think they'd find anything,'' said Charlie Battle, who was in 
charge of international relations in Atlanta's winning bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ain't perfect and we ain't arrogant, but we didn't bribe  
anybody,'' Billy Payne, who was president of the Atlanta Committee 
for the Olympic Games, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Australian Olympic Committee offered to accommodate two IOC  
members from Africa in a luxury London hotel a month before Sydney 
secured the 2000 Summer Games, according to documents released 
today by the AOC. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents revealed that AOC president John Coates wrote to  
Charles Mukora of Kenya and Francis Nyangweso of Uganda in August 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter to Mukora, one of the 13 IOC members who has  
reportedly been sent a ``please explain'' letter in conjunction 
with the Salt Lake City bribery scandal, read: ``If you would like 
to stop off in London en route to Monaco (the venue for the 2000 
Olympics vote) then please let me have your travel details as I 
will be pleased to arrange for you to be met at the airport, 
transported to and from the city and for you to stay at the 
Dorchester Hotel as our guest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney bid officials said they received no response to the hotel  
offer.

<HEADLINE> Sharp is Fastest in IRL's 1st Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- Scott Sharp is off and running to  
what he hopes will be an Indy Racing League championship he won't 
have to share. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharp, 30, was co-champion with Buzz Calkins in 1996, the IRL's  
abbreviated inaugural season, winning the title for then team-owner 
A.J. Foyt. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, his first driving for Rich Kelley, Sharp was in the  
hunt for another title until some late-season bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
	``We blew a tire and crashed at Texas, then we had a strange  
gearbox problem at Atlanta,'' Sharp said Friday after being the 
fastest in the first day of practice for the season-opening Indy 
200 at Walt Disney World Speedway. ``But those are the kind of 
things that happen in racing. You can't let them get you down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we've got a full year in with this team, we know we've got  
good equipment and we know we can win. We just have to go out there 
and see if we can be the guys who set the bar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharp turned a lap of 170.132 mph, the fastest of the day,  
despite missing virtually the entire morning practice with a 
fuel-pressure problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to bag that session,'' he said. ``It was like starting  
over for us this afternoon. A lot of times when you miss a session 
like that, you spend the rest of the weekend trying to catch up and 
never do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sharp said an outstanding tire test earlier this month  
enabled his team to make up for lost time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like starting over for us this afternoon. A lot of  
times when you miss a session like that, you spend the rest of the 
weekend trying to catch up and never do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharp said he spent some time on the way from his new home in  
Carmel, Ind., a suburb of Indianapolis, to Florida studying the IRL 
roster for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very deep field,'' he said. ``Looking at that list,  
I can see 12 guys that have an honest shot at winning the 
championship. There are going to be a lot of factors that enter 
into it before the end of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Dismore was fastest in the morning practice and wound up  
second overall on Friday with a lap of 168.587. He was followed by 
Scott Goodyear at 168.445, Greg Ray -- making his first appearance 
in the car fielded by Team Menard -- at 167.747, new Treadway Racing 
driver Sam Schmidt at 167.496, and defending series champion Kenny 
Brack at 167.325. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray is in the ride previously held by 1997 IRL champ Tony  
Stewart, now a regular in NASCAR's Winston Cup series. Schmidt is 
in the seat formerly occupied by two-time Indianapolis 500 winner 
Arie Luyendyk, who will run only that race this year before 
retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Cheever, who won last year's Indy 500, was seventh fastest  
at 166.736. Billy Boat, who won six poles in 11 races last year, 
was 10th at 166.128. 
</P>
<P>
	Brack and Boat now drive for Foyt.  
</P>
<P>
	The weather was most sunny with temperatures in the 70s on  
Friday. But there was rain in the forecast for Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, qualifying was washed out and the field was set by  
team owner points from the previous year and practice speeds, the 
same formula that would apply if rain comes again on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	That would put Brack and Eliseo Salazar on the front row of a  
field of between 26 and 28 cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, I'd rather be qualifying,'' Sharp said. ``Last year, I  
had to start from the back of the field because we had no car owner 
points. But at least this year we'd start fourth.''

<HEADLINE> Kings Sign Divac for $62.5 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The Sacramento Kings, who began the  
day searching for big men, ended Friday with a solid front line. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings signed free agent center Vlade Divac to a six-year,  
$62.5 million contract and re-signed small forward Corliss 
Williamson to a one-year deal reportedly worth $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Friday, power forward Chris Webber joined the team after  
skipping Thursday night's opening practice. Webber was traded to 
the Kings in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Chris and Corliss, we have one of the best front lines in  
the league,'' said Divac, who spent seven seasons with the Los 
Angeles Lakers and two with the Charlotte Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	Divac, one of just five active NBA players with 8,000 career  
points, 5,000 rebounds, 1,500 assists and 1,000 blocks, said he 
wants to break a streak of 15 consecutive losing seasons by the 
Kings -- a league record. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one of the biggest challenges in my career now, to make  
Sacramento a competitive team,'' he said. ``It's a very big 
challenge, and I like challenges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Divac, 30, has averaged 12.3 points and 8.7 rebounds throughout  
his NBA career. The 7-foot-1 Divac averaged 10.4 points last season 
for Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	While Divac was expected to sign with the Kings and had  
considered playing in Sacramento two years ago, Williamson's 
re-signing was somewhat of a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings had offered Williamson a six-year, $42 million deal  
that he rejected. But as the free agent market became clearer when 
the NBA lockout ended this week, Williamson realized he might be 
left out of a big contract. 
</P>
<P>
	So he chose to take a one-year deal for a much smaller amount,  
hoping he'll get a huge free agent deal from the Kings or another 
team next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked at all his options and the best one was for him to  
stay in Sacramento,'' said Kings vice president Geoff Petrie. 
</P>
<P>
	Williamson, 25, who has spent three years with the Kings,  
averaged 17.7 points last season. The 6-7 forward has increased his 
scoring average by six points in each of the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	In order to make room under the salary cap, the Kings renounced  
the rights to guards Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf and Anthony Johnson, 
forwards Billy Owens and Mark Hendrickson, and centers Olden 
Polynice and Michael Stewart.

<HEADLINE> Feds Want Fortier Sentence Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Michael Fortier knew about the plan to bomb the  
federal building in Oklahoma City and did nothing to prevent it, 
prosecutors argued in urging a federal appeals court to uphold his 
12-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortier, the government's prime witness in the bombing case, has  
asked for a reduction in his sentence and the $200,000 restitution 
he was ordered to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fortier's own lack of murderous intent is no basis for  
ignoring the reality'' of the crime, prosecutor Sean Connelly said 
Thursday in court papers filed in opposition to the request. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortier, who served in the Army with Timothy McVeigh and Terry  
Nichols, pleaded guilty to failing to alert authorities in advance 
about the 1995 plot to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. 
The blast killed 168 people and injured hundreds more. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortier also pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents and  
transporting stolen firearms that prosecutors said were sold to 
help pay for the bomb's ingredients and the living expenses of 
McVeigh and Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
	In his petition to the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,  
Fortier said the judge who sentenced him should have used 
guidelines for involuntary manslaughter instead of felony murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the judge already had reduced the sentence from  
14 years to 12 for his ``substantial assistance,'' but also noted 
that ``Fortier indisputably obstructed justice'' when he first 
claimed no knowledge of the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court has not yet set a date for a hearing on  
Fortier's petition.

<HEADLINE> More Woes May Be Ahead for IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The night before Sydney was awarded  
the 2000 Summer Games, the Australian Olympic chief sat down to 
dinner with two African IOC members in the swank Riviera resort of 
Monte Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
	During the course of the evening, he offered his two guests  
$70,000 in inducements to vote for Sydney, which defeated Beijing 
by two votes the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of that 1993 encounter were disclosed Friday, the latest  
and one of the most dramatic elements of the rapidly growing 
Olympic corruption scandal that threatens the IOC's leadership and 
the stability of the 2000 and 2002 games. 
</P>
<P>
	An Australian IOC member said the reported payments could put  
the Sydney Games in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, a Libyan official became the second International  
Olympic Committee member to resign in the bribery scandal 
surrounding Salt Lake City's selection as host of the 2002 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend promises more drama with possibly more resignations,  
expulsion recommendations and decisions to overhaul the entire 
Olympic bidding and selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch reiterated he has no  
intention of resigning and that he is determined to lead the 
committee out of its worst crisis ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this moment, I have to be at the head of the IOC more than  
ever,'' he told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	That was before the details of the dinner in Monaco surfaced,  
adding a major new element to what was already the biggest 
corruption scandal in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	``The perception will be quite damaging to Sydney,'' said Kevan  
Gosper, Australia's senior IOC executive board member. ``It's a 
very serious revelation. I think a lot of people will be 
destabilized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Australian newspapers reported that John Coates, president of  
the Australian Olympic Committee and a leader of the 2000 Sydney 
bid, said he offered $35,000 each to the national Olympic 
committees of Kenya and Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
	The offers were made to IOC members Charles Mukora of Kenya and  
Maj. Gen. Francis Nyangweso of Uganda on Sept. 22, 1993, the night 
before the vote, according to Coates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was necessary for us to show our commitment to  
those NOCs with a view to winning those votes,'' Coates told 
Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald. ``My view was it might encourage 
them to consider their votes for Sydney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney won 45-43 in the secret balloting in Monaco.  
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference in Sydney Saturday (Friday night EST),  
Coates confirmed the payment plan but again said the money was 
intended to help finance sports in Kenya and Uganda rather than a 
bribe. He said he pledged the money because he felt Sydney's 
chances were ``slipping away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't going to die wondering why we didn't win,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Coates said the payments were within IOC guidelines and were  
similar to plans used by bidding competitors from Beijing and 
Manchester, England. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian reports said the two African committees were paid the  
money between 1994 and 2000 to support Olympic sports projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper, who said he had not seen the bid documents, described  
the reported inducements as going ``beyond good will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that John's decision was intended to influence the  
IOC members' thinking,'' Gosper said. ``The perception may not 
match John's intention, the event having taken place the night 
before the vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said the revelations were serious enough to raise the  
issue of whether Sydney should keep the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't rule it out that some may call for the games not to  
proceed in Sydney,'' he told the AP, indicating that even some IOC 
members may feel that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could see the published material being viewed as  
questionable conduct by the candidate city,'' he said. ``But I 
believe the first step should be to stabilize the situation. The 
executive board should reinforce the Monaco decision that Sydney 
should stage the 2000 games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said the difference between alleged misconduct in Salt  
Lake City and Sydney was the margin of votes. 
</P>
<P>
	While Salt Lake City was an overwhelming favorite and won in a  
landslide, Sydney was considered a slight underdog to Beijing. The 
votes of African members were considered crucial in the 2000 race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Chinese reaction will be important,'' he said.  
``There were really only two cities in the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said the IOC will probably decide to order a full-scale  
investigation into Sydney's bid -- similar to the inquiry into the 
Salt Lake Games. 
</P>
<P>
	He called on Sydney officials to release all documents related  
to the bid and send them to the IOC for its inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gosper dismissed suggestions -- raised by IOC vice president  
Dick Pound -- that the committee should open investigations into 
past bids, including those which awarded the 1996 Summer Games to 
Atlanta and 1998 Winter Games to Nagano, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see no reason in taking investigations back to the games  
which have already been held,'' he said. ``I see no logic in 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the Monte Carlo offer were contained in a package of  
previously confidential bid documents released to Australian news 
media by Coates, who was in Australia and not immediately available 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents also disclosed that Coates wrote to Mukora and  
Nyangweso a month before the vote, offering to put them up -- at 
Sydney's expense -- at the luxury Dorchester Hotel in London on 
their way to Monaco. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents also confirmed that Australia, at the time of  
Sydney's bid, offered more than $1 million to pay for an Olympic 
training center for African athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper was a senior official in the Sydney bid, but he said he  
was unaware of the 1993 dinner offers until a journalist called him 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Coates apparently made the decision to release the  
documents ``entirely by himself'' and later sought approval from 
his committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said he had not yet spoken to Coates, but defended him as  
an ``extremely competent'' and ``first-rate'' Olympic chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said he immediately brought the matter to Samaranch's  
attention, and described Samaranch's reaction as ``one of serious 
concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments Friday:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The son of a prominent IOC member asked Salt Lake bid  
executives for a payment of between $30,000 and $35,000 the day 
before the city lost the 1998 Winter Games to Japan, a source close 
to the bid process told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of Jean-Claude Ganga of The Republic of Congo said he  
might be able to influence four votes, but did not promise them, 
said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake boosters did not pay the money to Jean-Jacques Ganga  
and the next day in Birmingham, England, Salt Lake lost to Nagano 
by four votes. 
</P>
<P>
	-- USOC executive director Dick Schultz said he sensed that a bit  
of a ``palace revolt'' was brewing in the IOC and president Juan 
Antonio Samaranch will survive only if the committee takes quick, 
united action to oust members in the Salt Lake bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his ``gut feeling'' was that Samaranch's 18-year reign  
at the top of the Olympics was threatened by ``some people who 
aren't being as supportive as they could be at this point in time. 
I think that's unfair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the spreading scandal, Gosper insisted the IOC can  
survive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a crisis that's continuing to escalate, but I don't  
consider it's out of control,'' he said. ``We have a responsibility 
to ensure the institution doesn't crumble. This is a tough one. But 
it's not the end of the world. We are not about to go south.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said the entire executive board stands behind Samaranch.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's the most appropriate person to bring us out of the  
problem,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Samaranch accepted the resignation of Libyan member  
Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi. 
</P>
<P>
	The 61-year-old Attarabulsi, an IOC member since 1977, stepped  
down following revelations that his son, Suhel, received tuition to 
attend an English language center at Brigham Young and a community 
college, plus $700 a month for expenses from Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said Attarabulsi was a ``good man'' who made a  
``mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch did not rule out other resignations this weekend. He  
said seven other members face possible expulsion in the Salt Lake 
case. Four others have been cited for minor violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Finland's Pirjo Haeggman resigned Tuesday. She was implicated  
because her former husband got jobs through bid committees in Salt 
Lake and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has said 13 members were implicated in the IOC's  
investigation into cash payments, college scholarships, free 
medical treatment, lavish gifts and other inducements related to 
Salt Lake's winning bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiry, headed by Pound, has found that the payments and  
gifts to members from Salt Lake City boosters totaled almost 
$800,000, with some members receiving more than $100,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the implicated members are expected to defend themselves  
in person before Pound's commission Saturday. On Sunday, the IOC 
executive board will recommend expulsions of members and propose 
ways of overhauling the entire Olympic bidding and selection 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has called a special IOC assembly for March 17-18 to  
vote on expulsions and ratify the new site-selection procedures.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee  
delegate from Libya resigned today, the second member of the 
governing body to step down in the wake of Salt Lake City bribery 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch told The Associated Press  
that Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi submitted his resignation in person 
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The resignation came one day before a special IOC commission  
meets to conclude its inquiry into the Olympics' biggest corruption 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said Attarabulsi, 61, an IOC member since 1977,  
stepped down because of revelations that his son received college 
scholarships at Utah schools from Salt Lake City boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I accepted his resignation and I thanked him for his 22 years  
as a member of the IOC, what he did for sport in his country and 
for us,'' Samaranch said in a telephone interview. ``He's a good 
man. He did (made) a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attarabulsi's son, Suhel, has said he received tuition at  
Brigham Young University and other Utah schools, plus $700 a month 
for expenses. On his application to BYU, the address he listed was 
the Salt Lake bid committee offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Finland's Pirjo Haeggman became the first IOC casualty of the  
scandal when she resigned Tuesday. She was implicated because her 
former husband got jobs through Olympic bidding committees from 
Salt Lake City and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he didn't rule out further resignations this  
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	He said 13 members were implicated in the IOC's investigation  
into cash payments, college scholarships, free medical treatment, 
lavish gifts and other inducements related to Salt Lake's winning 
bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	With two resignations now in hand, Samaranch said seven other  
IOC members face possible expulsion from the committee unless they 
step down. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he did not know what, if any, action would be  
taken against four other members cited for minor violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the implicated members are expected to defend themselves  
in person before IOC vice president Dick Pound's commission 
Saturday. On Sunday, the IOC executive board will recommend 
expulsions of members and propose ways of overhauling the entire 
Olympic bidding and selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tomorrow, the ad-hoc (investigative) commission is meeting and  
will listen to many of the members implicated in the case,'' 
Samaranch said. ``Not all are coming. The day after, the commission 
will present a final report to the executive board and we will take 
decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The six-member inquiry panel, headed by Pound, has found that  
the payments and gifts to members from Salt Lake City boosters 
totaled almost $800,000, with some members receiving more than 
$100,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has called a special IOC assembly for March 17-18 to  
vote on expulsions and ratify new site-selection procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Members who choose not to resign will be suspended pending a  
vote of expulsion by the full assembly, where a two-thirds majority 
vote is required. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can not expel the members,'' Samaranch said. ``We can only  
propose this. The session must take the final decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic officials and press reports have identified the other  
members accused of serious violations meriting possible expulsion 
as Agustin Arroyo (Ecuador), Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gafir 
(Sudan), Jean-Claude Ganga (Republic of Congo), Laime Keita (Mali), 
Charles Mukora (Kenya), Sergio Santander (Chile) and David Sibandze 
(Swaziland). 
</P>
<P>
	The four members cited for lesser infractions have been  
identified as Anton Geesink (Netherlands), Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye 
(Ivory Coast), Kim Un-Yong (South Korea) and Vitaly Smirnov 
(Russia). 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Samaranch confirmed the IOC was ready to  
investigate any documented allegations of corruption during other 
Olympic bid campaigns. Since the Salt Lake City scandal broke last 
month, reports of vote-buying and other misconduct have emerged 
from several other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have on the table some facts regarding some other cities  
and will investigate,'' Samaranch said. ``The Pound commission is 
only for Salt Lake City, but we can appoint another commission with 
the same powers, maybe with the same people. But we have to act on 
facts and not rumors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said his priority is to restore ``the prestige'' of  
the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we lost during these weeks, we have to get back,'' he  
said. ``We have to work hard. Myself, I will do my best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake Olympic Committee spokesman Frank Zang said the  
organizing committee would have no comment until the IOC has 
announced its findings. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who has been president since 1980, reiterated he has  
no intention of resigning, despite calls from outside the IOC for 
him to step down to take responsibility for misconduct that took 
place under his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this moment, I have to be at the head of the International  
Olympic Committee more than ever,'' Samaranch said. `I have to try 
to help to solve these problems.''

<HEADLINE>  Nuggets Finally Land McDyess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- After negotiations that included pleading phone  
calls from a stretch limousine, a trek through a snowstorm and a 
gift from hockey goaltender Patrick Roy, Antonio McDyess finally 
signed with the Denver Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess, one of the NBA's most sought-after power forwards,  
signed a six-year, $67.5 million contract Friday, concluding a wild 
24 hours that introduced the 24-year-old to the wonders of free 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``My thing was not being pressured,'' McDyess said, ``just go  
out and make my own decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure came from every direction after McDyess arrived in  
Denver on Thursday. When a 3 p.m. press conference was canceled, 
word spread that McDyess was having second thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't help matters that three Phoenix players flew to Denver  
and called McDyess from a limo outside McNichols Arena in hopes of 
convincing him to re-sign with the Suns, who acquired McDyess in a 
trade with Denver on Oct. 1, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuggets counterattacked by asking coaches Mike D'Antoni and  
John Lucas to brave a snowstorm and drive 60 miles from Denver's 
training camp in Colorado Springs to Denver. They brought along 
all-star point guard Nick Van Exel, a close friend of McDyess. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to fight fire with fire, and I knew they had become  
close friends,'' Denver general manager Dan Issel said. ``I know 
what this kid means. If the shoe was on the other foot, I probably 
would have done the same thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Issel and the Nuggets received unsolicited help from Roy and the  
Colorado Avalanche, who were preparing for their game against 
Calgary while negotiations were taking place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone found out that Patrick Roy was his favorite player,''  
Issel said. ``When Pierre (Avalanche general manager Pierre 
Lacroix) came in and found that out, he said `Let me go see where 
he is.''' 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess later met Roy in the middle of his pre-game rubdown, and  
Roy gave him the goaltending stick he was planning to use against 
Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, Antonio later sold it to a collector,'' Issel  
said. ``No, he didn't let go of that stick last night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although no deal was reached by midnight, the sides felt  
confident as they prepared to wrap things up Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought we had a chance to get him back,'' Issel said. ``We  
made our presentation to them. Our whole thing after that was not 
to pressure Antonio. We kind of backed away. In the final analysis, 
that might have helped us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess denied having second thoughts about choosing the  
Nuggets, who won just 11 games last season. He said he wanted to be 
confident about his decision before signing a contract at about 
noon Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phoenix was a great situation. It just didn't seem like I fit  
in like I did my first two years here,'' McDyess said. ``I needed 
that feeling back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Phoenix offered him more money -- seven years, $86  
million -- McDyess likely will make up the difference because his 
Denver contract has an escape clause after five years. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, McDyess will be eligible to re-sign at a higher  
maximum salary and receive larger pay raise under terms of the 
NBA's new collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, I will finish my career here,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Van Exel, who can become a free agent this summer, might be  
saying the same thing after the lockout-shortened season. He and 
McDyess have become good friends, and Van Exel was instrumental in 
recruiting McDyess to Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wait until you see these guys together,'' said agent James  
Bryant, who represents both players. ``It's going to be the faster 
version of Stockton-Malone.''

<HEADLINE> Mets Agree to Deal With Duncan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Infielder Mariano Duncan agreed Friday to a  
minor league contract with the New York Mets and was invited to 
spring training as a non-roster player. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan, 36, hit .232 with 10 homers and 34 RBIs last season for  
the Tokyo Yomiuri Giants in Japan's Central League. He has a .267 
career average in the major leagues with 87 homers, 491 RBIs and 
174 steals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mariano is a versatile veteran who can come off the bench and  
contribute in many different ways,'' Mets general manager Steve 
Phillips said. ``He knows how to play and gives us another player 
with World Series rings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan, who also plays the outfield, was on championship teams  
with the Cincinnati Reds in 1990 and the New York Yankees in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	New York also agreed to a one-year contract with infielder Mike  
Kinkade and invited catcher Yohanny Valera to spring training as a 
non-roster player.

<HEADLINE> Scripps, Knight Ridder Profits Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Knight Ridder profit slipped in the fourth quarter, partly as a  
result of the expense of moving its headquarters across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings held steady for Tribune Co., the parent company of the  
Chicago Tribune and Chicago Cubs, but it said growth in revenue 
from newspaper advertising slowed at the end of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	E.W. Scripps Co. missed analysts' earnings expectations, in part  
because of increased spending to build up market share in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	In their reports Friday, all three newspaper groups said that  
results from operations rose in the final quarter of 1998 from a 
year earlier. But shares of all three fell in a declining stock 
market. 

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	The nation's second-largest newspaper group reported profit in  
the fourth quarter was down substantially from a year earlier, when 
earnings were bolstered by a big gain from the sale of four 
newspapers. But if extraordinary gains or charges are not 
considered, earnings from continuing operations were up 16 percent 
in the final three months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight Ridder reported a net profit of $80.3 million, or 83  
cents a share, in the final quarter, compared with $103 million, or 
$1 a share, a year earlier. Earnings from continuing operations 
came to 86 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had predicted earnings of  
85 cents a share from operations, but the company's stock still 
lost ground, slipping 25 cents to close at $47 a share on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight Ridder publishes 31 daily newspapers in 28 U.S. markets  
and has investments in two newsprint mills. 
</P>
<P>
	Results for the quarter and all of 1998 include the costs of  
relocating headquarters from Miami to San Jose, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue was little changed, at $816.0 million, vs. $815.6  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight Ridder said quarterly advertising revenue increased 2.1  
percent to $630 million from $617 million a year earlier. The 
company said ad revenue should grow by 3 percent to 4 percent in 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating costs rose 3.7 percent in the final quarter.  
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Knight Ridder earned $365.9 million, or $3.73 a  
share, compared with $413 million, or $4.08 a share, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Without any special gains or losses, the company would have  
earned $2.78 a share in 1998, an increase of 20.9 percent from 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $3.09 billion from $2.88 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Advertising revenue rose 3.8 percent for the year, but two  
flagship papers saw classified-ad revenue decline. The San Jose 
Mercury News dropped 9.2 percent and The Miami Herald fell 3.9 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Slackened demand for hiring in Silicon Valley was the primary  
reason for the Mercury News' decline -- after three years of 
tremendous gains. In Miami, a weak condominium market and 
consolidation among auto dealers undermined us,'' said chief 
financial officer Ross Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers in Philadelphia, Detroit, Charlotte, N.C., and St.  
Paul, Minn., posted strong increases. 

</P>
<P>
                            *Tribune Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	Revenue and operating earnings improved in the quarter,  
primarily due to acquisitions and higher advertising revenues from 
newspapers and television stations. But Tribune said the pace of 
growth in newspaper advertising revenue slowed to 3 percent in the 
fourth quarter from 6 percent in the same 1997 period. 
</P>
<P>
	It said net profit held at $113 million in the fourth quarter,  
the same as in 1997. But because fewer shares were outstanding in 
1998 than a year earlier, per-share earnings rose to 84 cents from 
81 cents a share in the fourth quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 8 percent to $765.4 million from $710.8 million in  
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	On an operating basis, Tribune earned $97 million, or 72 cents a  
share, up from $88 million, or 62 cents a share, in the year-ago 
period. The results beat Wall Street analysts' average estimates of 
70 cents a share, but Tribune stock fell $2.18 3/4, or 3.3 percent, to 
close at $63.18 3/4 on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribune said it received steady growth from all three of its  
business divisions: publishing, broadcasting and entertainment, and 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating profit in the publishing division, which includes the  
Sun-Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale and The Orlando Sentinel as well as 
the Chicago Tribune, rose 11 percent to $100 million, due mainly to 
advertising revenue gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasting and entertainment operating profit rose 6 percent,  
to $96 million. And the education business saw operating profit 
triple to $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, net income rose to $351 million, or $2.53 a  
share, from $325 million, or $2.30 a share, in 1997. Revenue rose 
10 percent to $2.98 billion from $2.71 billion. 

</P>
<P>
                        *The E.W. Scripps Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	Earnings for the fourth quarter declined 11 percent from the  
same period in 1997, when there was an extraordinary gain from a 
realignment of its newspaper ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Scripps reported earnings of $43.6 million, or 55 cents a share,  
in the final quarter of 1998, compared with $50.5 million, or 62 
cents a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating income for the quarter, however, rose to $85.9 million  
from $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. expected Scripps to earn  
58 cents a share. The company's stock fell $1.56 1/4, or by 3.3 
percent, to $45.93 3/4 on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $397 million from $359 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Scripps operates 19 daily newspapers; nine network-affiliated  
television stations; the Home &AMP; Garden Television and Food Network 
cable channels; Scripps Productions, a television programmer; 
Scripps Howard News Service; United Media, which licenses and 
syndicates news features and comics, and publishes independent 
Yellow Pages directories. 
</P>
<P>
	At Scripps' newspaper division, operating earnings decreased 1.6  
percent, as the company stepped up spending in the Denver market in 
an effort to gain market share. Excluding Denver, operating 
earnings would have been 8.6 percent higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Scripps owns the Daily Camera of Boulder and the Rocky Mountain  
News of Denver, which compete with The Denver Post, owned by 
MediaNews Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Advertising revenue increased 5.4 percent to $172 million for  
newspapers owned at the end of 1998. The gain included a 13 percent 
gain in national advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said revenues in its broadcast division were flat in  
the quarter, but the category television division, which includes 
Home &AMP; Garden Television and the Food Network, grew. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 results were affected by the company's trade of  
newspapers in Monterey and San Luis Obispo, Calif., for the 
newspaper in Boulder, Colo., and the shutdown of Scripps' newspaper 
in El Paso, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1997, Scripps bought six newspapers and a controlling  
interest in the Food Network. In December 1998, the company sold a 
daily newspaper and a group of associated community newspapers in 
suburban Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the one-time gain, Scripps would have earned $37.2  
million, or 46 cents per share, in the final quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Scripps' earnings dropped 16.8 percent, to  
$131.2 million, or $1.62 a share, from $157.7 million, or $1.93 a 
share, in 1997. Excluding the effect of the 1997 transactions, 
Scripps would have earned $133.3 million, or $1.63 a share, that 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Yearly revenue grew to $1.45 billion from $1.24 billion.

<HEADLINE> Nissan, DaimlerChrysler in Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Nissan Motor Co., Japan's second-largest automaker,  
and DaimlerChrysler AG are discussing a possible alliance, 
DaimlerChrysler said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came amid reports that DaimlerChrysler was  
ready to provide an infusion of capital amounting to as much as a 
30-percent stake in the troubled Japanese automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler said in a statement that its co-chairman Juergen  
Schrempp, who arrived in Japan on Thursday, has met with Nissan 
President Yoshikazu Hanawa. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company said that although talks on possible  
``cooperation projects'' with Nissan Motors will continue, no 
decision had been made on what such cooperation might entail. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference today in Tokyo, Schrempp and his  
co-chairman Robert Eaton said that they had ``nothing more to add'' 
to the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	But Schrempp confirmed that his company was hoping to expand in  
Asia, saying he wanted 20 to 25 percent of DaimlerChrysler's total 
revenues to come from Asia within 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we are looking at Asia, more so than in the past,'' said  
Schrempp. ``You could do that in an evolutionary fashion ... and 
you can also do it through other means, like an equity 
participation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two chairmen also declined to say if progress had been made  
in DaimlerChrysler's widely expected plans to buy a stake in Nissan 
Motor's truck-making subsidiary, Nissan Diesel. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan has expressed an interest in forming an alliance with an  
overseas partner in a step to restructure its troubled business. In 
addition to DaimlerChrysler, Renault SA of France and Ford Motor 
Co. of the United States also have been reported to be potential 
suitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Nihon Keizai financial daily today reported that Ford's  
executive vice president John M. Devine denied in an interview that 
his company was considering investing in Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asahi newspaper reported that Nissan will solicit a capital  
investment of $1.76 billion to $2.65 billion from DaimlerChrysler 
AG, the world's third-largest automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be roughly equivalent to a 20 percent to 30 percent  
stake in Nissan on the basis of the company's current stock price, 
the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan officials refused to comment on the report.  
</P>
<P>
	Nissan has been in talks with Daimler-Benz AG, the German  
automaker that engineered a takeover of Chrysler Corp. last year, 
over the sale of an equity stake in Nissan Diesel for more than a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan is struggling to survive under a debt load totaling an  
estimated $22.2 billion. The company has lost money in five of the 
past six years and saw its U.S. sales decline 14 percent last year 
-- the largest drop of any automaker.

<HEADLINE> Rockets Still Work on Pippen Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Houston Rockets welcomed their latest  
superstar at their first practice in eight months. 
</P>
<P>
	Then they went home without working out and with Scottie Pippen  
still not officially a member of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	After a delay of nearly four hours in a scheduled announcement,  
Rockets owner Les Alexander called off the celebration late 
Thursday night by announcing there was a problem with the wording 
in the collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take some time.'' Alexander said.  
</P>
<P>
	Alexander stressed that the deal would be done, and Pippen  
already was getting used to his new surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to thank all the fans for being very warm to me  
around the city the little time I've been here,'' Pippen said. 
``I'm looking forward to bringing a champion here. I can see I'm 
going to have a wonderful career here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Sexton, Pippen's agent, said the problem was not with  
Pippen's five-year, $67.2 million contract. The Rockets and Pippen 
declined to define the contract problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing wrong with the contract,'' Sexton said.  
``It's just that with us getting a chance to look at the collective 
bargaining agreement so late today, we have to work through the 
night to get it corrected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have it corrected later tonight. It has nothing to do  
with the trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets must sign Pippen to put themselves over the salary  
cap before they can sign their other players. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the collective bargaining agreement, teams can  
still sign their own free agents even if they are over the salary 
cap. But if the other players signed first, they could not add 
Pippen to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Rudy Tomjanovich canceled the scheduled first practice  
that was supposed to follow the announcement of Pippen's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Bulls signed Pippen, then sent him to the Rockets  
for a second-round draft choice and forward Roy Rogers. Pippen will 
be paid $10.6 million this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets also re-signed free agent Charles Barkley for $1  
million. With typical flare, Barkley signed his contract on the 
10th tee at La Quinta, Calif., where he was playing in the Bob Hope 
Desert Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets started the day with only three players under  
contract, center Hakeem Olajuwon, guard Brent Price and second year 
guard-forward Rodrick Rhodes, who is out 6-8 weeks following 
surgery to repair a torn tendon in his right pectoral muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets called a 6 p.m. EST news conference to announce  
Pippen's signing, but delayed the announcement for one hour to 
complete the deal. That turned into a lengthy wait for the Rockets 
players, who lounged in their locker room at Westside Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, 33, had been with the Bulls since the 1987-88 season  
when he was drafted out of Central Arkansas. He averaged 19.1 
points and 5.2 rebounds last season when the Bulls won their sixth 
NBA championship of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen will form a formidable front line with Barkley and  
Olajuwon following the retirement of Clyde Drexler after last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal gives the Rockets three of the players ranked among the  
top 50 in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets are hoping for the same result as in 1995 when they  
got Drexler from the Portland Trail Blazers and won a second 
straight NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets sent Chucky Brown, Mark Bryant, Sam Cassell and  
Robert Horry to Phoenix in 1996 to bring Barkley on board, but 
another title didn't follow. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50-game schedule might be conducive to the aging Rockets,  
but the condensed time game could cause problems. Barkley is 35, 
Pippen 33, Olajuwon 36 and Eddie Johnson 39. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets have four days to get ready for the first exhibition  
game, on Tuesday against the San Antonio Spurs in Houston. Houston 
opens the regular season Feb. 5 at Los Angeles against Lakers. The 
home opener is Feb. 8 against the Denver Nuggets.

<HEADLINE> Alabama Gas Explosion Kills Three </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Ala. (AP) -- A natural gas explosion leveled three  
downtown buildings Friday, shattered glass and ripped the tar off 
nearby roofs. Three people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This type of explosion, you just can't imagine it. ... It  
looks like a war zone,'' said Tommy Lands, police chief of 
Stevenson, nine miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	The three killed were utility workers. At least eight people  
were critically injured, and numerous others suffered cuts and 
bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Paul Smith said the late morning blast erupted as  
Bridgeport Utilities employees were working on a gas line. 
Witnesses said the whooshing roar of gas leaving a line could be 
heard after the explosion. The smell of gas lingered in the air for 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ran outside and saw it and the building was just gone,''  
said Misty Flynn, who was shopping in a convenience store. ``A city 
worker came running at me and his face was all bloody. He was 
saying, `It blew my eye out.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The downtown area was evacuated until the leak was contained  
three hours later. Authorities were searching for more possible 
victims as they looked through the damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The flattened structures included a vacant building, one being  
renovated and one used for storage. More than a dozen businesses 
within a two-block radius, including a U.S. Post Office, were 
damaged. The boom of the blast was heard miles away from this 
northeast Alabama town of 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Shattered glass and splintered wood littered streets and  
sidewalks. A utility pole was bent to the left. Bulldozers dug into 
broken glass, scooping up the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical evacuation teams said at least eight critically injured  
victims were taken to area hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Thompson, a car mechanic, said he had spoken with some  
utility workers as they headed to fix the gas line. Thompson saw 
the body of one of the man hundreds of feet away from the site. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the men I just saw laying there was my brother-in-law's  
best friend,'' said Ronnie Peacock, who arrived after hearing the 
explosion. ``They were like brothers. He's going to be devastated. 
It's just unbelievable. Everybody knows everybody here.''

<HEADLINE>  Dennis Rodman Hints at NBA Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Dennis Rodman said Friday he's ``pretty  
much'' sick of basketball, but in the same breath hinted that he'd 
like to continue his rebounding in the warm weather of Miami or 
Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to play somewhere,'' Rodman told Jay Leno during a  
``Tonight Show'' appearance. ``Hopefully, I'll be the first man to 
ever win three championships on three different teams. I was the 
first one to do it on two different teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leno asked the former Chicago Bulls forward if he'd like to play  
for the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``New York is all right, but I'd rather go where it's warm --  
Miami, Orlando,'' Rodman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leno suggested the Los Angeles Lakers, and Rodman said he had  
talked to owner Jerry Buss. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hmm, it's not a possibility. There's no money,'' he said.  
``With the new rules today, you can only make a million dollars. 
After making 10, 12 million the last three years I don't think I 
need to take one million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm better than most guys in the league and who better  
to fill up a stadium than Dennis Rodman?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman suggested a team could pay him $1 million and ``buy me  
some land that's worth about 10, 12 million and give it to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The TV appearance capped a wacky week for Rodman. On Tuesday,  
Rodman's retirement was announced and the next day the news was 
retracted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never left,'' said Rodman, who explained that he wants to do  
other things besides basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	The lockout that delayed the start of the season by three months  
didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you've been gone this long, it's like you don't want to  
go back,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other topics, Rodman said he isn't sorry former Chicago  
teammate Michael Jordan retired, and he confirmed that he's still 
married to actress Carmen Electra. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the girl to death, she's cool, she's beautiful,'' said  
Rodman, dressed in a black pinstripe suit, white shirt with large 
collar and cuffs, a dark feathered floppy hat and sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman declined Leno's invitation to remove the hat and glasses.

<HEADLINE> Suspect's Mental Health in Question </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Jurors began deliberating today whether  
a defendant was legally insane when he beat his elderly neighbor to 
death after she criticized the vulgar lyrics of a rap song he was 
singing. 
</P>
<P>
	Victor Brancaccio, 21, concedes he beat and kicked 81-year-old  
Mollie Mae Frazier to death 5 1/2 years ago. But his defense claims a 
mix of brain damage, depression and a psychiatric drug rendered him 
involuntarily intoxicated -- legally insane -- at the time of the 
slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no excuse for what Victor did, but when you look at  
this you just have to wonder how this could happen,'' said his 
attorney, Roy Black. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors began deliberating this morning in his second murder  
trial. They are considering whether Brancaccio is guilty of 
first-degree murder and kidnapping or, as his defense claims, was 
insane. He beat Mrs. Frazier and left her to die in a vacant lot 
June 11, 1993 -- then returned the next day to spray paint and burn 
her body. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Brancaccio, who was 16 at the time, was a  
rebellious boy with a history of violence who took his anger for 
his mother and vented it on his unsuspecting neighbor. She had 
criticized him for rapping the lyrics of the Dr. Dre song 
``Stranded on Death Row'' as he walked down the street. 
</P>

	Byrd Wants Clinton Charges Dropped  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Key Democratic Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West  
Virginia said he would offer a motion to dismiss the charges 
against President Clinton. The announcement is significant because 
the veteran senator is widely viewed as a fierce defender of the 
Senate's prerogatives. He had publicly cautioned the White House 
not to lobby him to vote for Clinton's acquittal. ``I am convinced 
that the necessary two-thirds for conviction are not there and that 
they are not likely to develop,'' Byrd said. ``I have also become 
convinced that lengthening this trial will only prolong and deepen 
the divisive, bitter and polarizing effect this sorry affair has 
visited upon our nation.''

	Eight Die in Tornadoes in South

<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Tornadoes ripped across the South for  
the second time in less than a week, killing eight people in two 
states and leaving thousands of people without power. Twisters hit 
central Arkansas in waves late yesterday, collapsing roofs, 
knocking down power poles and leaving trees strewn about the 
grounds of the governor's mansion. ``The lights flickered a couple 
times, then it went black,'' said Derrick Stallworth, who was 
shopping in the Harvest Foods grocery when the storm struck. ``I 
decided to hit the floor, then I saw the roof coming down.''

	DNA Links Suspect to Slain Doctor

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Preliminary DNA tests link a missing

sniper shot and killed a Buffalo, N.Y., doctor who performed 
abortions, a law enforcement official said today. The first round 
of DNA tests on the hair at the FBI Laboratory here established a 
high probability it came from the same person as a hair found in a 
New Jersey home where James C. Kopp, a 44-year-old anti-abortion 
protester, lived last year, the official said.

	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- A federal judge indicted seven  
former military officers from Argentina's 1976-83 dictatorship 
today as part of a deepening investigation into the disappearances 
of at least 200 babies during the country's ``dirty war.'' 
Officials are trying to determine if a systematic plan existed to 
illegally adopt children born to jailed dissidents during the 
campaign against suspected leftists and opponents of the military 
regime. A government report says at least 9,000 people disappeared 
during the military's reign. Human rights groups say the figure is 
closer to 30,000.

an intersection within the previous week just as the stoplight was 
turning red. A quarter reported not completely stopping at a stop 
sign. Twenty-three percent said they had driven more than 10 mph 
over the speed limit on an interstate in the previous week. The

woman who had criticized him for singing a rap song with vulgar 
lyrics. Victor Brancaccio, 21, could get life in prison in the 1993 
slaying of Mollie Mae Frazier. Because he was 16 at the time, he 
cannot get the death penalty. Brancaccio conceded he killed the 
woman, but his lawyers argued that brain damage, depression and a 
psychiatric drug rendered him legally insane at the time. Mrs. 
Frazier, a neighbor, had criticized him for rapping the lyrics of 
the Dr. Dre song ``Stranded on Death Row'' as he walked down the

	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Tornadoes and funnel clouds tore across  
Arkansas yesterday, collapsing the front of a downtown grocery 
store and knocking over trees at the governor's mansion. At least 
five people were killed, including a baby in the small town of 
Beebe. More than a dozen were injured statewide and tens of 
thousands were without power. Twisters were also reported in parts 
of Louisiana, where hundreds of people were without power. Tornado 
warnings were issued for more than half of the state's 75 counties

<HEADLINE> More Join Bid To Lure NFL to L.A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The squad of developers and government  
officials working to attract an NFL team to Los Angeles just got a 
powerful new player, billionaire Eli Broad. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad said Thursday he will join the $1 billion effort to  
transform the downtown area into an entertainment, sports and 
cultural mecca by bringing a professional football team to the Los 
Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	With the support of city, county and state officials, Broad is  
joining forces with developer Ed Roski Jr. to persuade NFL owners 
to give the New Coliseum Partnership the next expansion franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ed and I like to win,'' Broad said in a news conference at the  
Convention Center downtown. ``We've got a first-rate financial 
package. We believe it's the kind the NFL is looking for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The estimated $1.1 billion Coliseum proposal breaks down to $750  
million for the franchise and $350 million in improvements for the 
aging stadium, which is jointly owned by the city, county and 
California. The landmark home to the 1932 and 1984 Olympics would 
be gutted, leaving only the historic columns and outer walls. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Broad and Roski would be equal partners, but  
they would welcome other investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're prepared, if necessary, to between us own 100 percent,''  
Broad said, ``But our door is open to others and we're prepared to 
offer 30 to 40 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broad's involvement makes the Coliseum bid more viable by giving  
it the financial muscle it lacked and instantly cranks up the 
competition for an NFL franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood mogul Michael Ovitz already has lined up an all-star  
roster of investors, including actors Tom Cruise and Kevin Costner, 
to build a combined stadium and shopping mall in Carson, 21 miles 
south of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	`It does not affect any of our plans for our bid in Carson,''  
Ovitz spokesman Peter Levin said. ``Although the financial 
situation is important, the NFL will be scrutinizing other elements 
regarding bringing a football franchise back to Los Angeles, 
including locale, access and a state-of-the-art facility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL could grant its 32nd franchise as early as Feb. 18.  
</P>
<P>
	A proposal from Houston is said to be in third place behind the  
two Los Angeles bids because Southern California has a larger 
television audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad, 65, became one of America's richest men last summer when  
he sold his SunAmerica Inc. financial services company. He is said 
to be worth at least $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad has been instrumental in revitalizing downtown Los  
Angeles, including fund-raising for the Los Angeles Museum of 
Contemporary Art, the planned Walt Disney Concert Hall and an 
unfinished Roman Catholic cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
	Roski, 60, an industrial developer and co-owner of the NHL's Los  
Angeles Kings, was a major force behind the development of Staples 
Center downtown. The Kings and the NBA's Lakers and Clippers will 
play there next season.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Might Default on Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Ukraine may default on its foreign debt  
payments this year unless outside donors resume aid to the former 
Soviet republic, the Finance Ministry said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Ukraine must pay $1.17 billion to foreign creditors in 1999, but  
the government is asking for new loans to pay them because it won't 
be able to raise the money on its own, the ministry said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to that sum, the country's National Bank, which only  
has $1 billion in reserves, separately has to pay about $700 
million to the International Monetary Fund to repay earlier loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry's statement was prepared for Friday's government  
meeting, which was convened to discuss ways of improving collection 
of budget revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the debt problem, the government's financial position  
this year will be further complicated by an expected foreign trade 
deficit of $1.6 billion, the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ukraine's economy has shrunk by more than half since the country  
declared independence in 1991. The government has repeatedly 
promised reforms, but has been unable to deliver. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has relied on foreign loans to get by, and has  
now accumulated wage and pension arrears of nearly $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The economic crisis in neighboring Russia has also contributed  
to Ukraine's unstable financial situation, which led foreign 
investors to withdraw from its financial markets and made it 
extremely difficult for the country to borrow abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is currently hoping for the resumption of aid  
from the IMF and World Bank, practically the only sources of 
foreign financial assistance it still can count on. 
</P>
<P>
	An IMF mission is in Kiev this week, analyzing the government's  
recent performance to decide whether Ukraine qualifies for the 
resumption of an earlier agreed-upon $2.2 billion loan package. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was frozen last November after the government failed to  
implement the fund's requirements to improve revenue collection and 
speed up reform in key sectors of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund's mission is expected to announce its conclusions at  
the end of the visit next Tuesday.

	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Little more than a year ago, Andrew  
Ilie was languishing below 450th in the rankings, had no sponsor 
and his lucky bandana was almost worn to shreds. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, he is at No. 64 after one of the biggest rankings jumps  
of 1998, has a career-best berth in the fourth round of a Grand

</P>
<P>
	Just don't ask him what the new sponsor sells.

looking at the stitched acronym on his sleeve. ``No disrespect to 
the sponsors, but I don't know. I'll tell you next time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eager not to offend his new backers, Ilie made a point of  
leaning his patched sleeve toward the TV cameras during a news 
conference. ``This is a first so I'm really excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ilie, 22, who at 5-foot-7 gets extra height by leaping off the  
court to make his strokes, did not have a single double-fault and 
hit 47 winners in a 6-2, 6-2, 6-4 victory today over Norway's 
Christian Ruud in the third round of the Australian Open.

<P>
	The unseeded Ruud upset No. 2 seed Alex Corretja in a five-set  
marathon in the second round.

<P>
	``He hits the ball extremely hard,'' Ruud said of Ilie. ``I

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Anti-Terrorism Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Warning that terrorists are seeking new ways  
to strike, President Clinton said Friday ``we must be ready'' for 
attacks against computer networks and using chemical and germ 
warfare. He urged spending $2.8 billion more to safeguard the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a cause for panic,'' the president said. ``It is a  
cause for serious, deliberate, disciplined, long-term concern.'' He 
said that ``we have a better than good chance of success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke of cyber-era threats in a speech before the  
National Academy of Sciences, dwelling on a subject of deepening 
concern and anxiety in the White House. Four years ago, the world 
was shocked by a nerve gas attack in the Tokyo subway; more 
recently there has been a rash of anthrax hoaxes in the Los Angeles 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not know of any imminent attack being planned in the  
United States using chemical or biological weapons or using cyber 
attack techniques,'' said Richard Clarke, the president's national 
coordinator for anti-terrrorism programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we do want to raise consciousness ... that such attacks  
are growing increasingly likely,'' he said at a White House 
briefing with Attorney General Janet Reno and Health and Human 
Services Secretary Donna Shalala. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that terrorists, recognizing they cannot defeat the  
United States with military force, are seeking ``new tools of 
destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We must be ready -- ready if our adversaries try to use  
computers to disable power grids, banking, communications and 
transportation networks, police, fire and health services of 
military assets,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, Clinton said, ``we have to be ready to detect and  
address a biological attack promptly, before the disease spreads.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's $2.8 billion proposal must be approved by Congress. It  
represents a 40 percent increase for cyber defense over 1997. It 
would double spending for chemical and biological weapons defense 
over two years. The $2.8 billion would be in addition to Clinton's 
$7.2 billion request for conventional counterterrorism security 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The president acknowledged that the United States has been too  
slow to react to new challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	``For too long,'' he said, ``the problem has been that not  
enough has been done to recognize the threat and deal with it. And 
we in government, frankly, weren't as well-organized as we should 
have been for too long.'' He announced a sharp acceleration in the 
government's effort last May in a graduation speech at the U.S. 
Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, Clinton's initiative got a  
better-late-than-never reaction from Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., 
chairman of the House Armed Services subcommittee on research and 
development. ``We have been grossly underfunding programs to 
protect our information assets,'' Weldon said. ``While a late step, 
the president's announcement should help us regain some lost 
ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's initiative earmarks $52 million to continue  
assembling a national stockpile of medicines and vaccines to 
protect the civilian population. It also would set aside $683 
million to train and equip emergency personnel in cities and 
strengthen the public health infrastructure. It would devote $206 
million to protect federal facilities and $381 million for dealing 
with nuclear emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Another major expenditure -- $500 million -- would go toward a  
research initiative to protect the nation's infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Tom Bliley, chairman of the House Commerce Committee,  
complained that Clinton's proposal contains no measures to prevent 
terrorist acts before they occur. 
</P>
<P>
	``...I am concerned about the current state of federal law,''  
Bliley, R-Va., said in a letter to the president. ``For example, it 
is not illegal for anyone, including convicted felons or foreign 
nationals, to possess such dangerous biological agents as anthrax, 
unless the government can prove that the materials were 'for use as 
a weapon' -- a very difficult standard to meet in most cases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bliley also said there are no legal or financial disincentives  
for people who ``falsely report or conduct hoaxes regarding 
biological or chemical attacks -- a growing problem that creates 
unnecessary panic and fear among this nation's citizens.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Anti-Terrorist Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Targeting terrorists' high-tech threats,  
President Clinton is proposing nearly $1.5 billion to help the 
United States guard against attacks via computers, viruses or 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in a speech today at the National Academy of Sciences,  
planned to outline a 10-point plan to counter emerging threats from 
cyberterrorism, biological and chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat that ``keeps me awake at night,'' he told The New  
York Times in an interview, is the possibility of germ attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``A chemical attack would be horrible, but it would be finite,''  
he said, adding that it would not spread. But a biological attack 
could spread, ``kind of like the gift that keeps on giving,'' the 
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the newspaper it is ``highly likely'' that a terrorist  
group would launch or threaten a germ or chemical attack on 
American soil within the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	The president warned that any attack with such would lead to  
``at least a proportionate if not a disproportionate response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan, to be included in his fiscal 2000 budget  
proposal next month, is intended to ensure the United States is 
able to defend against, and ready to respond to, any such terrorist 
attacks, national security spokesman David Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his State of the Union address Tuesday, Clinton told Congress  
that the nation must upgrade its defenses in light of the advent of 
technology and ``increased dangers from outlaw nations and 
terrorism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He cited the bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa, and the  
retaliatory U.S. air strikes on terrorist strongholds in 
Afghanistan and Sudan, as examples. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bombing of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania reminds us  
of the risks faced every day by those who represent America to the 
world,'' Clinton said. ``We will work to keep terrorists from 
disrupting computer networks, to prepare local communities for 
biological and chemical emergencies and to support research into 
vaccines and treatments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wants Congress to approve $1.46 billion for chemical,  
biological or cyber security measures. The total includes funds for 
research and development of vaccines and medicines, and training 
doctors and other medical workers to recognize the symptoms of a 
biological agents, according to a senior White House official 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of the money, $1.3 billion, would fund chemical and  
biological weapons countermeasures, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also would establish a network of ``intrusion  
detection monitors'' that would alert and defend other computer 
networks in case one was stricken by a cyberattack, the official 
said. The monitors would help prevent certain federal agencies, 
such as the State Department, the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, from 
being crippled by such an attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's awareness and fear over terrorism, both at home and  
abroad, have increased dramatically since Clinton took office six 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, there have been the twin embassy bombings as well as  
deadly attacks in Oklahoma City and the World Trade Center in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has been reviewing the issue since the  
Oklahoma City bombing, and renewed its urgency after a national 
security team gained access to unclassified Pentagon computer 
systems during a cyber war game last year. The access they received 
would have allowed them to disrupt troop movements, Pentagon 
officials said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials quickly detected an attempt by a group of U.S. and  
Israeli teen-agers to break into Pentagon computers in February 
1998, but could not determine for several days that the attack was 
an act of vandalism, not foreign aggression.

<HEADLINE> Porsche Sales, Profits Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- German luxury automaker Porsche today  
announced a 65-percent jump in net profit in the first half of its 
business year, paced by the debut of two new models. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary figures show earnings in the six months ending Jan.  
31 climbing to 115 million marks ($68 million), from 69.7 million 
marks a year earlier, Porsche said. 
</P>
<P>
	Group sales were up 27.5 percent to 2.5 billion marks ($1.5  
billion). 
</P>
<P>
	Porsche sold 18,900 cars in the period, about a quarter more  
than a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The first-half surge was due to a considerable degree to the  
startup of production for the new 911 model in Germany and the 
Boxster in Finland, Porsche said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buoyed by the figures, the automaker raised its forecast for  
fiscal 1999 sales above 5.5 billion marks ($3.27 billion) from the 
5 billion marks forecast last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Porsche is the world's most profitable automaker'' at present,  
said George Stuerzer, an analyst at HypoVereinsbank in Munich.

<HEADLINE> Bird Likes 1st Look at His Pacers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Larry Bird put the Indiana Pacers through  
the first workouts of their abbreviated training camp Friday and 
liked what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very satisfied. I thought they did an excellent job of  
keeping themselves focused and keeping their mind on what we want 
to accomplish,'' said Bird, who was the NBA's Coach of the Year 
after guiding Indiana to a franchise-best 58-24 record last season 
in his debut. 
</P>
<P>
	The players also felt the voluntary workouts they have held  
since October paid off. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was good,'' Antonio Davis said after the first of two  
workouts Bird scheduled Friday. ``I didn't think us working out 
beforehand was going to make such a difference. I think it allowed 
the coaches to do what they came here to do, which is to coach us. 
Their job is not to get us in shape. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our job to come to camp in shape. I think the team has  
taken it upon themselves to come out and be ready and not be winded 
all the time. I think we got a lot done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like everyone distinguished themselves,'' said  
Reggie Miller, who along with backcourt mate Mark Jackson, put 
their teammates through the workouts on an almost daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went over our plays, which Jack and I have been going over  
for the last three or four months. I'm encouraged about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Those workouts definitely helped,'' Chris Mullin said. ``We've  
got a long way to go, but the coaches were able to pick up and go 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen players participated in the workouts, although veteran  
Derrick McKey saw limited action because of a series of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	McKey, who missed the team's first 25 games last season while  
rehabilitating from a ruptured Achilles tendon sustained at the end 
of the 1996-97 season, also was impressed with the team's first 
workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good practice, other than being a little rusty,'' he  
said. ``I think it went well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, club president Donnie Walsh was trying to get  
contracts signed and approved by the league for veteran Rik Smits 
and first-round draft pick Al Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've agreed to terms, but the contracts have to be reviewed  
by lawyers and then approved by the league before they can join the 
team for practice,'' Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh did announce two signings -- forwards Mark Pope and Norman  
Nolan. Pope was re-signed after playing with Indiana as a rookie 
last season. Nolan, a rookie from Virginia, was signed to the 
training camp roster as an undrafted free agent. Terms of the 
agreements were not announced.

<HEADLINE> Man Survives Fall Off Steep Cliff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEDONA, Ariz. (AP) -- A man spent three days trapped in a ravine  
near the body of a fellow hiker who died when they tumbled off a 
70-foot cliff, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Damian Freas, 25, was rescued Thursday after a search team  
spotted a fire he had set to alert them. The body of John Kearney, 
23, was found about 20 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
	The men, both medical students from Philadelphia, made a  
sightseeing trip to Sedona on Monday while attending a seminar in 
Phoenix, said Detective Dave Cardinell of the Coconino County 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Kearney's father alerted Phoenix police when the pair did not  
return to Philadelphia as planned Tuesday. Authorities found the 
men's rental car Thursday afternoon, and Freas was spotted about a 
quarter of a mile away, Cardinell said. 
</P>

	Freas suffered a broken leg and other injuries and was listed in  
serious condition at Flagstaff Medical Center.

<HEADLINE> Abortion-Related Criminals Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- The organizer of a banquet held by  
abortion foes to honor their militant peers defended the event as a 
gathering of the like-minded. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Michael Bray also defended the tactics -- including  
bombing clinics and killing doctors -- that have led to jail time 
for many who attended Thursday's banquet and auction to raise money 
for families of anti-abortion activists in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would call it the use of force to defend the innocent in the  
womb,'' said Bray, jailed for nearly four years for bombing and 
setting fire to seven abortion clinics in the 1980s. ``It's 
defensive force, not retributive force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The banquet came on the eve of today's anniversary of the 1973  
Supreme Court decision in the Roe vs. Wade case that legalized 
abortion. It was similar to events at which critics say posters 
were introduced featuring a ``dirty dozen'' list of physicians who 
provided abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Planned Parenthood and four doctors say the posters amounted to  
a hit list, and are seeking $200 million in an Oregon lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Bray is a danger to society,'' said Margie Kelly,  
spokeswoman for the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy in New 
York. ``It's uncivilized what he's doing and what his organization 
hopes to accomplish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those in attendance was John Brockhoeft, 47, who spent  
seven years in a federal prison for firebombing two Cincinnati 
abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prison is hard,'' said Brockhoeft, who attended the event clad  
in black military fatigues and a black beret. ``The price might be 
high, but I was sure I was doing the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A prison sweat shirt worn by Brockhoeft fetched $125 in an  
auction of keepsakes. Twelve items netted $700 for families of 
people imprisoned for abortion-related crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Other items included a camouflage scarf, hat and baby booties  
made by a woman jailed for shooting a doctor who performed 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	The booties, knitted by Rachelle Shannon of Grants Pass, Ore.,  
sold for $40. Ms. Shannon, convicted of shooting a Wichita, Kan., 
abortion doctor in 1993, is serving a 31-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The scarf and hat went for $70 after auctioneer Don Spitz said  
wearing them would make a strong ``pro-life fashion statement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The auction was ``really just a sideline,'' said Bray, who  
organized the banquet along with members of his Reformation 
Lutheran Church. ``The real purpose is just to bring everybody 
together.''

<HEADLINE> Fannie Mae, NAACP Form Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the Rev. Imagene Stewart, who runs a  
homeless shelter in the capital city, it was the first time the 
NAACP ``has reached down to the little people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With great elan, Ms. Stewart interrupted a news conference by  
officials of the civil rights organization and mortgage giant 
Fannie Mae to make that statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason for her excitement was an announcement about a  
partnership between the two groups that will that will provide up 
to $110 million in mortgage financing for black families that can't 
afford big down payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the program, Fannie Mae will provide financing for  
qualified black borrowers who will be able to put down as little as 
3 percent to 5 percent of a home's value. 
</P>
<P>
	The new program also is designed to help at least 20,000 black  
families get information on home ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	While 73 percent of white families own their own home, only  
about 45 percent of black and Hispanic families are homeowners, 
according to the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week Freddie Mac, another government-chartered mortgage  
market company, announced a similar partnership with the NAACP, in 
which Freddie Mac committed to buy up to $500 million in mortgage 
loans for black families. 
</P>
<P>
	Fannie Mae also committed to finance an unlimited amount of  
mortgages for qualified families recommended by the National 
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the nation's 
oldest civil rights organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditional credit requirements will be eased for black families  
whose credit histories were marred by burdensome medical expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came a week after Fannie Mae offered new options making  
mortgage insurance cheaper for all homebuyers who cannot afford big 
down payments. Of the 150,000 borrowers, most of them first-time 
homebuyers who are expected to benefit from that change over the 
next year or so, an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 will be black or 
Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	At the press conference, Kweisi Mfume, NAACP president and chief  
executive officer, spoke of ``the importance of economic 
empowerment in communities of color,'' both urban and rural. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put all of our will and wallet behind it,'' said Franklin  
Raines, Fannie Mae's new chairman and chief executive officer. He 
said the goal is to allow blacks to become homeowners ``without 
discrimination, without exclusion and without needless barriers and 
burdens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fannie Mae has helped the NAACP generate more than $120 million  
of mortgage financing for its clients over the past five years, and 
the new program should help double or triple that amount, Raines 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fannie Mae is a congressionally chartered, publicly traded  
company that buys mortgages from original lenders such as banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The principal lender in the new program is North Carolina-based  
NationsBank, which soon will complete its merger with BankAmerica 
Corp., the country's biggest bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Raines said the changes will make conventional home mortgages  
more competitive with those insured by the Federal Housing 
Administration, part of the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac compete with the FHA. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-year nationwide program will begin in Atlanta; Austin,  
Texas; Baltimore; Charlotte, N.C.; Columbia, S.C.; Ft. Lauderdale, 
Fla.; Gary, Ind.; and Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the program, Fannie Mae also will:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Help the NAACP establish new Community Development Resource  
Centers, which provide information and counseling on home 
ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Examine ways to help the NAACP attract money for down payments  
for eligible borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fannie Mae, which describes itself as the world's biggest  
financial services company that is not a bank, retains some of the 
mortgages in its portfolio and packages others into securities for 
resale to investors. The company reported last week that its 
profits rose to a record $3.4 billion last year from $3.05 billion 
in 1997, boosted by continued growth in its mortgage business.

<HEADLINE>  Bulls in for a 'Long' Short Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Ron Harper's highlight-filled video collection  
will be his best reminder of the Chicago Bulls' good old days. Toni 
Kukoc says he can reminisce simply by glancing up at six 
championship banners hanging from the rafters. 
</P>
<P>
	But once they start playing next month, there will be few  
on-floor reminders of the past. And both Kukoc and Harper know it. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Steve Kerr, Luc  
Longley and Jud Buechler are all gone. 
</P>
<P>
	And already there are signs this will be a long season, even if  
it is only 50 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The new era, the rebuilding after Jordan's retirement, got off  
to a slow start Thursday -- the Bulls had to cancel their first 
practice following the lockout because they don't have enough 
players under contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally they got in their first practice this morning. Fourteen  
players were on the court when drills run by assistant coach Tex 
Winter got underway. 
</P>
<P>
	They were Ron Harper, Toni Kukoc, Keith Booth, Bill Wennington,  
Mark Bryant, Rusty LaRue, Dickey Simpkins, Cornell David, Rob 
Werdan, Curtis Staples, Randy Brown, Matt Steigenga, Bubba Wells 
and Martin Muursepp. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Rogers, part of the sign-and-trade deal that sent Pippen to  
the Houston Rockets, was on the side of the floor as were draft 
picks Cory Carr and Corey Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, Muursepp and Bryant were all part of a deal that shipped  
Longley to the Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls have three days before their exhibition opener Sunday  
against Indiana and just more than two weeks before they go back to 
Salt Lake City -- where they won their sixth title last June -- to 
meet the Jazz in the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take some time to get used to each other,''  
Kukoc said as he pedaled a bike, minutes after the practice with 
some of his soon-to-be new teammates was called off Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever happens, it's going to be different. It might be  
difficult at times, but hopefully, things will get better soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls did announce Thursday they had re-signed Wennington --  
to a minimum contract of $1 million for 10-year veterans -- and also 
signed Staples, a 3-point specialist from Virginia. Combined with 
Harper, Kukoc, Brown and Booth, already under contract, that gave 
the Bulls six players for a first-day practice. Impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Another addition, free agent Brent Barry, was at the Berto  
Center for a workout before leaving for dinner with coach Tim Floyd 
still unsigned. 
</P>
<P>
	The tired-of-waiting coach Floyd finally called all assembled  
the center of the floor to say there weren't enough players under 
contract at the time to hold his first practice. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Jerry Krause made a brief appearance. He claimed  
the new player contracts were so different from past ones that 
there was a backlog in the league office, thus the delay in getting 
players signed and to the floor for practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to get them done with the utmost speed,'' Krause  
said, adding he expected to have 20 players signed in the next 
couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen was to signed to a five-year, $67.2 million deal -- with  
an additional $15 million in incentives -- and shipped to Houston 
for Rogers and a second-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr was to get a five-year, $11 million deal before heading to  
San Antonio for draft picks and veteran Chuck Person. And center 
Longley was to receive a five-year, $30 million package before 
being traded to Phoenix for Bryant, Muursepp and Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	With Jordan playing golf in retirement and Rodman as usual  
sending mixed signals about his future, the Bulls will turn to 
Kukoc for leadership, ball handling and scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	He still wasn't sure Thursday in the midst of the chaos what his  
new team would look like or even when it would finally be together. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time is going to show. It's too early to judge what Jerry's  
doing right now,'' Kukoc said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Plenty of teams needed years to rebuild. I guess management  
just felt the situation right now is probably the best point to 
start rebuilding.''

<HEADLINE>  Bulls in for a 'Long' Short Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Ron Harper's highlight-filled video collection  
will be his best reminder of the Chicago Bulls' good old days. Toni 
Kukoc says he can reminisce simply by glancing up at six 
championship banners hanging from the rafters. 
</P>
<P>
	But once they start playing next month, there will be few  
on-floor reminders of the past. And both Kukoc and Harper know it. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Steve Kerr, Luc  
Longley and Jud Buechler are all gone. 
</P>
<P>
	And already there are signs this will be a long season, even if  
it is only 50 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The new era, the rebuilding after Jordan's retirement, got off  
to a slow start Thursday -- the Bulls had to cancel their first 
practice following the lockout because they don't have enough 
players under contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally they got in their first practice this morning. Fourteen  
players were on the court when drills run by assistant coach Tex 
Winter got underway. 
</P>
<P>
	They were Ron Harper, Toni Kukoc, Keith Booth, Bill Wennington,  
Mark Bryant, Rusty LaRue, Dickey Simpkins, Cornell David, Rob 
Werdan, Curtis Staples, Randy Brown, Matt Steigenga, Bubba Wells 
and Martin Muursepp. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Rogers, part of the sign-and-trade deal that sent Pippen to  
the Houston Rockets, was on the side of the floor as were draft 
picks Cory Carr and Corey Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, Muursepp and Bryant were all part of a deal that shipped  
Longley to the Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls have three days before their exhibition opener Sunday  
against Indiana and just more than two weeks before they go back to 
Salt Lake City -- where they won their sixth title last June -- to 
meet the Jazz in the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take some time to get used to each other,''  
Kukoc said as he pedaled a bike, minutes after the practice with 
some of his soon-to-be new teammates was called off Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks $4.5M for Clinics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Abortion clinics could use federal funds for  
alarm systems, bulletproof windows and closed-circuit camera 
systems, under a White House plan to counter clinic violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is seeking $4.5 million to enable clinics to  
bolster security measures and pay for security assessments to 
determine which clinics are most at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was expected to make the  
announcement today in a speech to the National Abortion Rights 
Action League on the 26th anniversary of the Supreme Court's 
landmark Roe vs. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The money, to be included in the president's budget proposal for  
fiscal 2000, also will help clinics purchase motion detectors and 
improved lighting, according to a senior administration official, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think with the escalation of violence waged against abortion  
provider clinics, this is good news,'' said Belle Taylor-McGhee, 
spokeswoman for NARAL. She stressed the need for doctors, abortion 
providers and women to all have safe access to clinics, which 
provide a variety of health services. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good first step, and it's important that the  
administration is taking domestic terrorism seriously,'' said 
Jacquelyn Lendsey, vice president of public policy for Planned 
Parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time as the announcement, thousands of abortion  
opponents were expected to march on the Capitol and Supreme Court 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, Attorney General Janet Reno set up a national task  
force to prosecute and prevent attacks and threats against abortion 
providers. The announcement was made a month after abortion Dr. 
Barnett Slepian, an abortion provider, was killed by a rifle shot 
fired into his suburban Buffalo, N.Y., home. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force plans to train local law enforcement and abortion  
providers in how to respond to and prevent such attacks and 
establish a national database with all information on clinic 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey released Thursday by the Feminist Majority Foundation  
showed that in the first seven months of 1998, 22 percent of 
clinics experienced one or more forms of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	These included blockades, invasions, bomb threats and bombings,  
arson threats and arsons, chemical attacks, death threats and 
stalking. This was a slight decrease from 25 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But the foundation's president, Eleanor Smeal, said even the  
current percentage of clinics that ``are battered day after day 
with violence is unconscionable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also found clinics that reported law enforcement  
response as ``excellent'' experienced lower levels of violence than 
those that characterized local law enforcement as ``poor.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Against Yen, Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen Friday,  
maintaining slim gains amid a tumbling U.S. stock market and 
ongoing concerns about the currency crisis in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said some of the dollar's improvement against the  
Japanese currency may be due to suspicions that Brazil's financial 
woes will hurt Asian markets as much as U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 114.54  
Japanese yen, up from 113.68 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar withstood a second straight selloff of stocks, as the  
Dow Jones industrial average fell 143 points. The index fell 71.83 
points Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brazil, meanwhile, the Central Bank sold dollars to support  
the real, which continued its slide. The slipped to 1.72 against 
the dollar, compared to 1.70 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also rose slightly against the euro, as the European  
currency stayed within the narrow range it has traded in since its 
debut. In New York, the euro was quoted at $1.1580, down from 
$1.1595 late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 1.3830 Swiss francs, down from 1.3839,  
and 1.5184 Canadian dollars, up from 1.5187. The British pound rose 
to $1.6554 from $1.6534. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.6889 German 
marks, up from 1.6869; 5.6657 French francs, up from 5.6561; and 
1,672.24 Italian lire, up from 1,669.45.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Reliever Terry Adams, who had filed for salary  
arbitration, and the Chicago Cubs agreed Friday on a one-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams, 25, was 7-7 with a 4.33 ERA in 63 relief outings for the  
Cubs last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams had asked for $895,000 and the Cubs offered $615,000. He  
made $295,000 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the contract with Adams were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	In 224 major league relief appearances, the right-hander has  
gone 13-23 with 24 saves and a 4.03 ERA. 
</P>

	The Cubs' lone unsigned arbitration-eligible player is pitcher  
Matt Karchner.

<HEADLINE> National Basketball Assoc. Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tim Floyd was booed in Chicago, Tom Gugliotta left 'em hanging  
in Phoenix and Minneapolis and Latrell Sprewell asked for a second 
chance in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Changes were taking place all around the NBA on Friday, the  
second day the league was officially open for business. A few more 
trades took place, legions of players signed contracts and the 
league continued gearing up for the start of a season that is now 
less than two weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
	The new and not improved Chicago Bulls held a public scrimmage  
before 14,000 non-paying fans at the United Center, and the boos 
for Floyd were loud enough for everyone to notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was fine,'' Floyd said of the reaction.  
</P>
<P>
	After he was introduced, the coach stayed at midcourt and, using  
a microphone, spoke to the fans about bridging ``the gap between 
the future and the past. I hope everybody will hang with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns weren't sure who'd be hanging out in their own locker  
room after they lost a last-ditch push for Antonio McDyess and then 
watched Gugliotta leave town. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta requested a meeting with Timberwolves owner Glen  
Taylor, which could take place today in Mankato, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, who had triple-bypass surgery 10 days ago and was  
mystified by Gugliotta's refusal to accept his $87 million offer -- 
the most the Wolves could offer under the new labor deal -- 
speculated that Gugliotta's most likely request would be a 
sign-and-trade arrangement. Such a move had been rumored earlier 
this week with the Los Angeles Lakers involving center Elden 
Campbell and shooting guard Eddie Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have told the agent that if they can work out a deal, we're  
open to it,'' Taylor said. ``The Lakers know our concerns and our 
problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolves' basketball decision-makers, Kevin McHale and Flip  
Saunders, almost certainly wouldn't agree to that trade with the 
Lakers. They are skeptical about both Campbell and Jones, and don't 
want to help a Western Conference rival by sending them an All-Star 
caliber player like Gugliotta. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm interested in improving MY team,'' said McHale, the vice  
president of basketball operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Waiting to see what Gugliotta will do is Joe Smith, the former  
overall No. 1 pick who agreed to a $1.75 million, one-year deal 
with Minnesota but held off signing it upon hearing of the 
Gugliotta situation. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, Sprewell met with commissioner David Stern and was  
reinstated. His new team, the Knicks, held a news conference at 
which Sprewell repeatedly said he was sorry, declared himself a 
changed man and asked to be given another chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a bad day,'' Sprewell said of his attack on Golden State  
coach P.J. Carlesimo, which led to the longest non-drug related 
suspension in league history, 68 games. Sprewell also lost about 
$10 million in salary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry. We all make mistakes. I'm not the person I've been  
portrayed to be,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Free agent Vlade Divac signed with the Sacramento Kings for  
$62.5 million, and Rod Strickland remained a no-show Friday as the 
Washington Wizards started three-a-day workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The point guard and the Wizards remain far apart on a new  
contract. Strickland and agent David Falk originally demanded $65 
million over five years but reportedly lowered that to $55 million 
Thursday. The Wizards have offered about $30 million over three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington executive vice president and general manager Wes  
Unseld said both sides will continue talking. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the trades that were cleared:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Scottie Pippen went from Chicago to Houston for Roy Rogers and  
a second-round pick, allowing the Rockets to then re-sign five of 
their own free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Atlanta re-signed Christian Laettner and dealt him to Detroit  
for Scott Pollard and a draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Chicago re-signed Steve Kerr and traded him to San Antonio for  
Chuck Person and a conditional first-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Detroit traded the draft rights to Bonzi Wells to the Portland  
Trail Blazers for a future first-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit re-signed two of its own free agents, Jerry Stackhouse  
and Joe Dumars, and added free agents Loy Vaught and Jud Buechler. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacramento not only signed Divac, but also welcomed Chris Webber  
to camp and re-signed Corliss Williamson, who had turned down $40 
million, for $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana Pacers re-signed Rik Smits, giving him a contract  
that will average a reported $14 million, the Dallas Mavericks 
signed Suns free agent center Hot Rod Williams and the Milwaukee 
Bucks signed the last member of the original Charlotte Hornets, 
Dell Curry. 
</P>
<P>
	In other free agent moves, Seattle signed free agent forward  
Billy Owens, San Antonio signed forwards Mario Elie and Jerome 
Kersey, the Trail Blazers signed point guard Greg Anthony, 
Minnesota signed guard Malik Sealy, the Knicks signed forward Kurt 
Thomas, Vancouver signed center Cherokee Parks and Utah brought 
back Thurl Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets announced that Glen Rice had undergone successful  
surgery to remove bone chips from his elbow. He will be out 6-8 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Heat brought veteran shooting guard Terry Porter into  
camp, and he immediately found himself a possible starter after it 
was learned that last season's starter, Voshon Lenard, will be out 
8-10 weeks with a stress fracture in his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami got one small piece of good news -- word from the league  
office that Alonzo Mourning will not have to serve the second game 
of his two-game suspension for fighting with New York's Larry 
Johnson during last year's playoffs.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Will Barely Be on National TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The mystery team from Chicago will not be seen  
on national television. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign of how different this NBA season will be, the new  
television schedule was released Thursday, along with the new 
regular season schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Every team will play 50 games, six of them non-conference games,  
and NBC and Turner Sports will televise 89 of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago will appear only once as a regional telecast Feb. 21 in  
an NBC tripleheader, and no Bulls games will be on TNT or TBS -- not 
even a finals rematch between Chicago and the Utah Jazz on opening 
night Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't look at that as a rematch of the NBA Finals because  
of the complete overhaul of the Bulls' roster,'' TNT spokesman Greg 
Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of Bulls-Jazz, TNT will broadcast an opening-night  
doubleheader of New York at Orlando and Houston at the Los Angeles 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC will begin its schedule with a doubleheader on Sunday, Feb.  
7, with regional telecasts featuring the Miami Heat at New York and 
Indiana at the Detroit Pistons, followed by Utah at the L.A. 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be no All-Star game, and there also won't be any  
nights devoid of NBA games. 
</P>
<P>
	The slowest night of the season will be Saturday, Feb. 13, when  
only two games are scheduled. There are just five nights when four 
or fewer games are played. 
</P>
<P>
	The season will last until May 5, and the playoffs will begin  
Saturday, May 8. The NBA Finals will conclude no later than 
Tuesday, June 29. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in more than a decade, teams will play games  
on three consecutive nights. 
</P>
<P>
	Each team will have a couple of back-to-back-to-back stretches,  
and the schedule will be grueling. The Knicks, for example, will 
play seven games in nine nights from March 14-22. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers have a stretch in which they play three road games in  
three nights at Seattle, Denver and Vancouver before returning to 
Los Angeles for a day off and then a home-and-home series with the 
Clippers -- a total of five games in six nights, four of them road 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Toronto Raptors will find themselves with four straight days  
off in mid-February, but then will have four road games in five 
nights in late March -- at New Jersey, Chicago, Houston and San 
Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers will have the most appearances on cable television,  
12 games on TNT or TBS, and the Knicks will have 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastern Conference teams will play each conference opponent  
three times, two conference opponents one additional time apiece 
and six non-conference teams (three home, three away). 
</P>
<P>
	Western Conference teams will play each conference opponent  
three times, five conference opponents one additional time and six 
non-conference teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the imbalance of teams in the Eastern and Western  
Conferences, six Eastern Conference teams will play five 
non-conference games and one additional conference game.

<HEADLINE> Paula Zahn Leaving CBS for Fox News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Paula Zahn is leaving CBS News to anchor a  
one-hour nightly newscast on Fox News Channel, beginning March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Zahn, 42, has most recently anchored the ``CBS Evening News''  
Saturday edition and filled in for Dan Rather during the week. She 
was co-host of ``CBS This Morning'' for six years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fox Report,'' the network's evening newscast, was anchored  
by Catherine Crier and Jon Scott until they left to host a 
newsmagazine for the Fox network. Zahn will take over, and she also 
will anchor another hour of Fox News Channel programming on 
weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
	Zahn was underutilized at CBS and attracted by the prospect of  
being involved in breaking news, said Roger Ailes, chairman and 
chief executive of Fox News. She also has young children and wanted 
to get off weekend work, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zahn worked for local news broadcasts in Chicago, Houston,  
Dallas, Los Angeles, San Diego and Boston before joining ABC News 
in 1987. She jumped to CBS in 1990.

<P>
	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Romania's president threatened today  
to impose a state of emergency if coal miners ignore appeals to end 
a destructive rampage that has left more than 100 people injured. 
</P>
<P>
	President Emil Constantinescu warned he would impose the order

</P>
<P>
	``In the last 24 hours, the illegal strike ... has generated

<P>
	Under a state of emergency, the police and the army could use  
greater force against protesters. A curfew would be imposed, and 
people in more than groups of three could be stopped at random by 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Radu Vasile said he was ready to negotiate with  
miners' leaders and announced talks in the central village of 
Cozia, some 110 miles northwest of Romania. He will be accompanied 
by the finance minister and an Orthodox bishop who knows the 
miners. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate word from the miners, who previously have  
demanded that Vasile be present at talks. 
</P>
<P>
	National television, citing the Health Ministry, reported a  
total of 138 people injured on Thursday in clashes between miners 
and troops. Of the injured, 130 were police. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty police officers were reported taken hostage, but they were  
later released. One police officer, earlier mistakenly reported 
dead, was in a coma today after being beaten in the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Constantinescu made the announcement after the Supreme Council  
met through the night. The crisis body includes the ministers of 
defense and interior and the heads of Romania's intelligence 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	The government fired two interior ministry generals during the  
all-night meeting. Interior Minister Gavril Dejeu was fired for 
failing to stop the miners' advance and was replaced by Constantin 
Dudu Ionescu, a former deputy defense minister. 
</P>
<P>
	In a desperate efforts to keep the miners from Bucharest, the  
government cut all rail ties between the central city of Ramnicu 
Valcea and the capital, and set up barriers manned by riot police 
on roads connecting the two cities. About 5,000 police crowded the 
main roadblock, some 25 miles northwest of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of miners camped the night in Ramnicu Valcea, some 100  
miles northwest of Bucharest and were waiting for orders from their 
leaders whether to take to the protest to Bucharest. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, miners forced their way through 3,400 troops who  
responded with smoke bombs and tear gas in clashes that lasted two 
hours. Buoyed by their success, miners shouted ``Down with the 
government!'' and then boarded buses for Bucharest, some 110 miles 
southeast of Costesti. 
</P>
<P>
	Miners are on the 17th day of a strike, pressing for a 35  
percent wages hikes, and the equivalent of $10,000 if they are laid 
off. The government has said it cannot afford their demands and 
argues the miners already make more than twice the national average 
salary of $100 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	In two previous visits to the capital in 1990 and 1991, miners  
went on the rampage leaving at least nine people dead, dozens 
injured and forcing one government to resign.

<HEADLINE>  Super Bowl Far From Super for Some </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMARAC, Fla. (AP) -- Cynthia Pearlman doesn't know which teams  
are playing in the Super Bowl, but she's been looking forward to 
Jan. 31 for months. It's the day she gets her husband back. 
</P>
<P>
	During the season, she and women like her complain that their  
husbands or boyfriends put the game -- any football game -- ahead of 
spending time with them. The championship game brings deliverance 
from months of playing second string to a TV set. 
</P>
<P>
	``It starts at the beginning of the week, after the game is over  
on Sunday,'' said Pearlman, 58, a Tamarac resident originally from 
New York. ``Then they run to the paper on Monday morning to find 
out who's playing who, to find out what the point spread is, to 
find out if they can fit their golf game in between the football 
games that are going to be on television. And your life revolves 
around their schedule. And you get fed up with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pearlman won't get her husband, Allen, back until after the big  
game. An avid football fan who played during his high school days, 
Allen Pearlman has volunteered to usher at the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have his shoulder pads some place,'' his wife said.  
``He won't let me throw them out. We've moved five times and it's 
the first thing that goes into the truck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Football has cut into the scant time Susanne Lawson, 35, a golf  
pro at Woodmont Country Club in Tamarac, has to spend with her 
boyfriend, Rob. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll find a reason why each game every week has an importance  
for him to watch it,'' Lawson said. ``My only day off is on Sunday 
... It has gotten to the point now I'm just like, 'Go ahead, watch 
it. I'll find something else to do.''' 
</P>
<P>
	On the Internet, the football widows find companionship from the  
similarly abandoned in a custom-made chat group held during Monday 
night football. 
</P>
<P>
	Web sites, like www.sillysports.com/widow.htm, challenge  
visitors to ``strike out and get a life of your own while your man 
grows roots in front of the TV.'' The site features links to the 
Martha Stewart Living and Just Sports For Women Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, the Miami Dolphins drew 300 women to a  
three-hour, ladies-only demonstration led by coach Jimmy Johnson, 
filled with X's and O's designed to turn the women on to football. 
</P>
<P>
	Hannah Malisoff, 70, doesn't know who Joe Montana is, but has  
heard of a ``Flookie or Flute'' on cereal boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	She said her husband, Ray, has tried to get her to watch  
football, to appreciate the rules and strategy, but it hasn't 
taken. Only once, when she was ``much younger'' and she rode her 
brother's knack for betting on the right point spread, did she 
watch an entire season of football. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't enjoy it otherwise,'' said Malisoff, who coped with  
her husband's ravenous football appetite by going back to work on 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was retired. I'm a realtor now for 10 years because of  
football,'' Malisoff said. ``(He's) on the couch, and I don't want 
to be in the house on the couch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sonia Krupat, 50, of Tamarac, said because of her husband Sy's  
devotion to football, both have paid a price. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't have a social life, you can't go out,'' said Sonia  
Krupat, a New Jersey native. ``I go shopping and spend lots of 
money; figure that will make him see how I feel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Come Super Bowl Sunday, the women plan to join numerous others  
at a party of their own, where they will dance and sing while their 
significant others watch the game. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll celebrate, as Pearlman puts it, ``getting our choices  
and our lives back.''

<HEADLINE> Fewest U.S. Oil Rigs Since '40s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- With oil prices at their lowest in more than a  
decade, domestic oil drilling and exploration has plunged to its 
lowest level in more than half a century. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of oil and gas rigs operating in the United States  
dropped to 588 this week -- the lowest count since a well-known 
industry watcher began keeping score in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline below the previous record low of 596 set in June  
1992 was a new danger signal for an industry that has been walloped 
by a sharp decline in the price for crude. During the same week 
last year, 996 rigs were operating. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it's as low as it is now, we're a pretty anemic  
industry,'' said John Bell, owner of a small independent oil 
company in the West Texas town of Kermit. ``We're about as 
unhealthy as we can get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston-based toolmaker Baker Hughes Inc. has kept track of the  
count since 1944. The tally peaked at 4,530 on Dec. 28, 1981, 
during the height of the oil boom. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony McAloon, director of market research at Baker Hughes, said  
there are probably fewer rigs looking for oil and gas in the 
country now than at any time since the heady oil boom town days of 
the early 1900s, when accurate counts were not available. 
</P>
<P>
	McAloon said he expects the U.S. oil industry to bottom out some  
time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``To find oil in the United States is more expensive than to  
find it in various international markets, and so although 
international locations can survive with low oil prices, many U.S. 
producers cannot,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, the second-largest oil producer after  
Saudi Arabia, the crisis has prompted companies to lay off workers, 
slash expenses and cut back or completely eliminate drilling 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Houston area alone, about 4,200 oil industry workers lost  
their jobs in 1998, including 2,500 positions in exploration and 
production, Texas Workforce Commission data shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the service industries -- people selling pipe, mud,  
engineers, geologists -- all of these people are working when the 
rigs are running and they're not when the rigs stop,'' said Morris 
Burns, executive vice president of the Permian Basin Petroleum 
Association.

<HEADLINE>  Floyd Ready To Get Bulls on Floor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- As Tim Floyd walked to center court, the  
basketballs stopped bouncing and his new players gathered around 
him, eager to hear what the Chicago Bulls' new coach had in store 
for his first day of practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Free day!  
</P>
<P>
	No, he wasn't trying to win over his players like a new teacher  
letting class out early. After six months in limbo, Floyd wanted to 
practice Thursday worse than possibly anyone in the NBA. But you 
need players to practice, and that's something the Bulls don't 
have. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm numb at this point, and just ready to get to the floor,''  
he said. ``There is a frustration level, but no more so than what 
our players are going through as well. There was a scowl or frown 
or two just from the standpoint that I think these guys were 
looking forward to getting to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA officially opened for business Thursday, and teams got  
the go-ahead to open training camps. But with only six players 
under contract by midafternoon, the Bulls had two options: run some 
really tame 3-on-3 drills or cancel practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't rightly hold a practice with four players,'' said  
veteran center Bill Wennington, who signed a one-year, $1 million 
deal earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't the way Floyd wanted to start his NBA rookie season.  
He spent six months in limbo as Chicago's director of basketball 
operations until Phil Jackson said again after the lockout ended 
that he wasn't coming back. Floyd was officially named the head 
coach last Friday, only to have training camps pushed back three 
days while lawyers haggled over the final details of the labor 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	When training camp finally opened, 14 players took the floor.  
About 45 minutes later, Floyd broke the bad news. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was wishful thinking,'' he said. ``Our guys were really  
anxious, the coaching staff was anxious and our practice plans were 
in place. We've had six months to work on the practice plan and it 
was ready to go, but unfortunately, no practice today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today will be different, though. Even if there still weren't  
enough players for the morning practice, Floyd said there was no 
way the Bulls were canceling tonight's practice-scrimmage at the 
United Center. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll even press assistant coach Bill Cartwright, a member of  
Chicago's first three championship teams, into service if he has 
to. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be ready to go,'' Floyd promised. ``If Cartwright has  
to go, we'll be ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The one good thing about canceling practice was it gave Floyd  
more time to meet his players. He'd been barred from any contact 
with players during the lockout, so he was meeting many for the 
first time Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	When he walked onto the floor for the first time, he said hello  
to Ron Harper, who gave his new coach a friendly slap on the 
shoulder as the two talked and laughed. Then he headed over to 
shake hands with Randy Brown, who playfully patted the coach on the 
stomach. 
</P>
<P>
	``He seems like a very nice guy so far,'' Harper said. ``When I  
walked in today, we talked. He had a very good friendly talk. He 
told me to go out and lead this team, show guys how our old team 
was. I told him I was happy to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd isn't the only one who needs introductions. Of last year's  
championship team, only four players -- Harper, Brown, Toni Kukoc 
and Keith Booth -- had contracts for this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely need some name tags,'' Harper said, laughing.  
``It will take me a week or two to find out who's on my team.''

<HEADLINE> Actress Susan Strasberg Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Susan Strasberg, the daughter of acting coach  
Lee Strasberg, a close friend of Marilyn Monroe and an actress in 
her own right, died at age 60. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Strasberg, who lived in San Francisco, died of cancer in New  
York, said Victoria Krane, president of the Lee Strasberg Theatre 
Institute in West Hollywood, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	After making her Broadway debut playing Anne Frank in 1955, Ms.  
Strasberg also starred in ``Time Remembered,'' with Richard Burton 
and Helen Hayes in 1957. She also appeared in films, including 
``Picnic,'' with William Holden and Kim Novak, in 1954, and ``Stage 
Struck'' with Henry Fonda in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the actress appeared in at least 23 films and television  
productions, including ``Frankenstein,'' a 1973 television version 
of the horror classic, and in the 1988 ``Prime Suspect'' with Frank 
Stallone. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Strasberg and her family were close confidantes of Miss  
Monroe, and her father coached the star through hit movies 
including ``Bus Stop,'' ``The Prince and the Show Girl'' and ``Some 
Like it Hot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Strasberg, who died in 1982, was well-known for teaching the  
``method'' approach to acting at the famous school the Actors 
Studio. The teachings were based on the teachings of Konstantin 
Stanislavsky and stressed the actor's use of life experiences. 
</P>
<P>
	In her memoir: ``Marilyn and Me, Sisters, Rivals and Friends,''  
Ms. Strasberg recalled her close relationship with Miss Monroe. She 
also wrote about the troubled actress in an earlier autobiography, 
``Bitter Sweet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Strasberg was born and raised in Manhattan. She married  
actor Chris Jones in 1965, a union that ended a year later. The 
couple had a daughter, Jennifer, Krane said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in a state of absolute shock,'' said Krane. ``We knew  
that she had cancer but we were told that it was in remission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides her daughter, Ms. Strasberg is survived by a brother, a  
stepmother and two half brothers.

<HEADLINE> Bears Hiring of McGinnis on Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- Oops.  
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Bears wanted Dave McGinnis to bring the black and  
blue back to their defense. What they got instead was a red face on 
one of the most embarrassing days in their long history. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of meeting the press, McGinnis left the building. And  
the Bears were left to explain why they announced they had a coach 
when it wasn't a completed deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The matter has not been resolved,'' team spokesman Bryan  
Harlan said. ``There will not be an announcement today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a colossal blunder for the Bears, already under fire for  
bungling their search to replace Dave Wannstedt, who was fired 
three weeks ago. The Bears refused to say why talks broke down, but 
McGinnis, the Arizona Cardinals defensive coordinator and a former 
Bears assistant, reportedly was unhappy in part because the team 
announced he was the coach before he had a contract. 
</P>
<P>
	McGinnis could not be reached for comment. Team president  
Michael McCaskey refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a press conference scheduled. It was agreed on in  
principle,'' Harlan said of why the announcement was made. ``But 
there were obviously some parts of the contract talks that weren't 
resolved and didn't get finalized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGinnis and McCaskey plan to talk again, Harlan said. But  
McGinnis left the Bears' practice facility Friday afternoon with 
Mark Hatley, the team's vice president of player personnel who 
conducted the first part of the search process, and Hatley later 
returned without him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have a timetable right now for when it will be  
resolved,'' said Ted Phillips, the Bears vice president of 
operations. ``There's just several issues that have to be 
discussed. That's all I can say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was the last thing the Bears expected, especially with  
McGinnis. He'd spent 10 years as Chicago's linebackers coach, and 
he was a frontrunner for the job as soon as it opened. He was the 
last of five candidates interviewed, and he called the job 
``anyone's dream'' after meeting with McCaskey. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaskey wanted a coach with ties to the Bears' past and one who  
could restore the bruising, imposing defense that defined Chicago 
in the 1980s and early 1990s. McGinnis looked like the perfect fit. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the linebackers coach when Mike Singletary, Otis Wilson  
and Wilber Marshall were in their prime. The Bears were 95-64 when 
McGinnis was an assistant, and the defense ranked among the top six 
in fewest yards allowed in seven of those 10 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	So when the Bears sent out a release Friday saying McGinnis was  
the new coach, the only surprise was that they made the 
announcement before the press conference. 
</P>
<P>
	But things began going awry when the scheduled start of the news  
conference came and went. About an hour later, Phillips announced 
the delay. After another 90 minutes, Harlan said talks were off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't really say anything else about it right now,'' Harlan  
said. ``I'm very sorry about what everyone's been put through 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This disaster was months in the making. McCaskey, a grandson of  
Bears founder George Halas, refused to give an indication until the 
season ended of whether Wannstedt would be fired or retained. On 
the morning he fired Wannstedt, McCaskey surprised Hatley by 
telling him to come up with a list of candidates and conduct 
initial interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Screening coaching candidates wasn't in Hatley's job  
description, and this would take up valuable time during the prime 
scouting period. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Bears did finally put their list together, they were  
woefully behind other teams. Including the expansion Cleveland 
Browns, nine NFL teams had coaching vacancies and the Bears are the 
only team still with an opening. Kansas City hired Gunther 
Cunningham -- also a finalist for the Bears job -- about the same 
time Chicago was supposed to be introducing McGinnis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears didn't contact George Seifert until he was finalizing  
details of a contract with the Carolina Panthers. They got 
permission to interview Minnesota Vikings offensive coordinator 
Brian Billick as Billick was getting on a plane to Baltimore to 
accept the Ravens job. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the five candidates interviewed, Buffalo offensive  
coordinator Joe Pendry was the only one with head coaching 
experience. The other candidates were Jacksonville defensive 
coordinator Dick Jauron and Green Bay offensive coordinator Sherm 
Lewis.

<HEADLINE> Libyan IOC Member Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee  
delegate from Libya resigned today, the second member of the 
governing body to step down in the wake of Salt Lake City bribery 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch told The Associated Press  
that Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi submitted his resignation in person 
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The resignation came one day before a special IOC commission  
meets to conclude its inquiry into the Olympics' biggest corruption 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said Attarabulsi, 61, an IOC member since 1977,  
stepped down because of revelations that his son received college 
scholarships at Utah schools from Salt Lake City boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I accepted his resignation and I thanked him for his 22 years  
as a member of the IOC, what he did for sport in his country and 
for us,'' Samaranch said in a telephone interview. ``He's a good 
man. He did (made) a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attarabulsi's son, Suhel, has said he received tuition at  
Brigham Young University and other Utah schools, plus $700 a month 
for expenses. On his application to BYU, the address he listed was 
the Salt Lake bid committee offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Finland's Pirjo Haeggman became the first IOC casualty of the  
scandal when she resigned Tuesday. She was implicated because her 
former husband got jobs through Olympic bidding committees from 
Salt Lake City and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he didn't rule out further resignations this  
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	He said 13 members were implicated in the IOC's investigation  
into cash payments, college scholarships, free medical treatment, 
lavish gifts and other inducements related to Salt Lake's winning 
bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	With two resignations now in hand, Samaranch said seven other  
IOC members face possible expulsion from the committee unless they 
step down. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he did not know what, if any, action would be  
taken against four other members cited for minor violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the implicated members are expected to defend themselves  
in person before IOC vice president Dick Pound's commission 
Saturday. On Sunday, the IOC executive board will recommend 
expulsions of members and propose ways of overhauling the entire 
Olympic bidding and selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tomorrow, the ad-hoc (investigative) commission is meeting and  
will listen to many of the members implicated in the case,'' 
Samaranch said. ``Not all are coming. The day after, the commission 
will present a final report to the executive board and we will take 
decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The six-member inquiry panel, headed by Pound, has found that  
the payments and gifts to members from Salt Lake City boosters 
totaled almost $800,000, with some members receiving more than 
$100,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has called a special IOC assembly for March 17-18 to  
vote on expulsions and ratify new site-selection procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Members who choose not to resign will be suspended pending a  
vote of expulsion by the full assembly, where a two-thirds majority 
vote is required. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can not expel the members,'' Samaranch said. ``We can only  
propose this. The session must take the final decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic officials and press reports have identified the other  
members accused of serious violations meriting possible expulsion 
as Agustin Arroyo (Ecuador), Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gafir 
(Sudan), Jean-Claude Ganga (Republic of Congo), Laime Keita (Mali), 
Charles Mukora (Kenya), Sergio Santander (Chile) and David Sibandze 
(Swaziland). 
</P>
<P>
	The four members cited for lesser infractions have been  
identified as Anton Geesink (Netherlands), Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye 
(Ivory Coast), Kim Un-Yong (South Korea) and Vitaly Smirnov 
(Russia). 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Samaranch confirmed the IOC was ready to  
investigate any documented allegations of corruption during other 
Olympic bid campaigns. Since the Salt Lake City scandal broke last 
month, reports of vote-buying and other misconduct have emerged 
from several other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have on the table some facts regarding some other cities  
and will investigate,'' Samaranch said. ``The Pound commission is 
only for Salt Lake City, but we can appoint another commission with 
the same powers, maybe with the same people. But we have to act on 
facts and not rumors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said his priority is to restore ``the prestige'' of  
the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we lost during these weeks, we have to get back,'' he  
said. ``We have to work hard. Myself, I will do my best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake Olympic Committee spokesman Frank Zang said the  
organizing committee would have no comment until the IOC has 
announced its findings. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who has been president since 1980, reiterated he has  
no intention of resigning, despite calls from outside the IOC for 
him to step down to take responsibility for misconduct that took 
place under his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this moment, I have to be at the head of the International  
Olympic Committee more than ever,'' Samaranch said. `I have to try 
to help to solve these problems.''

<HEADLINE> Michigan Woman Freed After 20 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Michigan officials unanimously agreed Friday to  
release a woman sent to prison for life without parole in a 1978 
heroin case, making her the first person freed under a new law that 
allows parole for lifers after 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	JeDonna Young, 44, plans to live with her mother, perhaps  
working at a law firm to make use of the college degree she earned 
while in Scott Regional Correctional Facility, where she works as a 
paralegal. Parole officials must approve those plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``My client couldn't believe her ears,'' said her attorney,  
Stuart Friedman. ``She's had so many false starts over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now she's scared -- it's been 21 years, and the world's  
changed. She's going out there and putting together the pieces and 
restarting her life. It's going to take a lot to get adjusted to 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Young was driving with her boyfriend James Gulley in 1978  
when Detroit police stopped her car and found nearly 3 pounds of 
heroin. Gulley said it was his; Ms. Young said she didn't know it 
was there. They were both convicted under a new, unforgiving 
anti-drug law. Gulley died in prison last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reluctantly upheld Ms. Young's  
conviction in 1989 but said it was unconvinced she was the kind of 
drug dealer the law was designed for. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Legislature amended the lifer law to allow parole  
after 20 years. The change took effect Oct. 1, allowing convicts to 
become eligible after 15 years if they cooperated with police and 
did not have prior felony convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	At a parole hearing Thursday, Ms. Young, who has a 27-year-old  
son, said she hoped for the best. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until I actually walk out the door, that's when I'll believe  
it,'' she said. ``I pray all the time. That's what got me through 
it. It's kept me strong.''

<HEADLINE> Highlights From Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Highlights from Friday's impeachment trial in the Senate against  
President Clinton: 
</P>
<P>
	--An influential senior Democrat, Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West  
Virginia, announced he will introduce a motion to dismiss the 
charges because he does not believe the necessary 67 votes to 
convict will materialize and ``lengthening this trial will only 
prolong and deepen the divisive, bitter and polarizing effect'' on 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	--After two weeks of quiet observation, senators posed their  
first questions through Chief Justice William Rehnquist and 
transformed the proceeding into a seesaw debate between prosecutors 
and presidential lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott suggested that a bipartisan  
meeting of all senators, similar to the one earlier this month that 
led to an agreement on the start of the trial, be called next week 
to consider guidelines for the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	--House prosecutors continued to press for witnesses but conceded  
they hadn't swayed any Democrats in favor of conviction. ``So far 
we have none. That's OK. Let the process play itself out,'' Rep. 
Henry Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
	--White House Counsel Charles Ruff rebuked the House managers for  
asking for witnesses now when their own body never sought to call 
such witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	--House prosecutors used the question-and-answer period to rebut  
the White House defense presentation earlier this week as ``legal 
schizophrenia'' and ``defense fudge-making.''

<HEADLINE> St. Louis Is a Roman Catholic City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- John Paul II may be the first pope to visit St.  
Louis, but the city's connection to the Roman Catholic Church dates 
to the days when it was an outpost of European settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Catholics started St. Louis,'' said the Rev. William B.  
Faherty, a historian and author of a book that outlines the history 
of Roman Catholics in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Archbishop Justin Rigali, who was instrumental in arranging the  
pope's visit, said the city's Catholic background was a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The St. Louis area is rich in Catholic history and has had a  
splendid role to carry in the history of the United States,'' 
Rigali said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the earliest explorers of the Mississippi Valley were  
French priests, many of whom made their way to the area from Quebec 
or traveled up the Mississippi River from New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	The city of St. Louis was founded in 1764 by Pierre Laclede, a  
fur trader sent up the Mississippi from New Orleans to establish a 
trading post. He named it after Louis IX, the king of France and 
the patron of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, the Rev. Sebastian Meurin, the last of the  
French colonial priests in the area, came across the river from the 
Kaskaskia settlement in the Illinois country to perform the first 
baptism west of the Mississippi ``in a tent for want of a Church,'' 
according to early writings. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly all the early settlers were French and Roman Catholic.  
</P>
<P>
	``When St. Louis became American at the time of the Louisiana  
Purchase (1804), individuals of other religious affiliations 
arrived,'' Faherty noted. ``Since then, Catholics have always 
numbered close to half the populace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1818, Bishop William Louis Valentine DuBourg of the Diocese  
of Louisiana, came to St. Louis to visit, liked what he found, and 
stayed. St. Louis became his headquarters, from which he 
administered church operations in the entire Louisiana Purchase, 
stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as a promoter of the area, DuBourg was personally  
responsible for drawing many orders of priests and nuns to the 
area. St. Louis rapidly became known as the most important Catholic 
city in the young nation, surpassing even Boston and Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	On just his second day in town, DuBourg had called residents of  
the city to a meeting to plan a church on the riverbank. That 
church, which reached its present form in 1834, was then called Our 
Basilica of St. Louis. Located on the grounds of the Gateway Arch, 
the church is now more commonly known as The Old Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
	The mother diocese of St. Louis would later be broken up to form  
45 dioceses, from Chicago and Milwaukee in the northeastern corner, 
to Great Falls, Mont., in the northwest, Denver in the west, and 
Little Rock, Ark., and Oklahoma City, Okla., in the south. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the St. Louis Archdiocese has 235 parishes and missions,  
158 elementary schools, 29 high schools, seven seminaries and two 
universities. There are nearly 100,000 students under Catholic 
instruction here. 
</P>
<P>
	On his trip, the pope will close a middle entrance door at the  
St. Louis Cathedral, sealing it until Christmas. It will be opened 
to welcome the faithful for year 2000 celebrations. The tradition 
dates back centuries in Rome, where sealed doors are opened every 
25 years for jubilee or holy years.

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted in Rap Singing Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Victor Brancaccio claimed he was insane  
when he kicked and stomped an 81-year-old woman to death after she 
criticized him for singing vulgar lyrics from a rap song. 
</P>
<P>
	But jurors rejected his defense Friday, convicting the  
21-year-old of murder in the killing of Mollie Mae Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
	Brancaccio's lawyers conceded that he beat and kicked Ms.  
Frazier after she scolded him for rapping the Dr. Dre song 
``Stranded on Death Row.'' But, the attorneys argued, Brancaccio 
was legally insane at the time due to depression and his use of a 
psychiatric drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Brancaccio's parents had won $2.7 million in the Florida lottery  
and used the money to bankroll a defense team that included 
prominent Miami lawyer Roy Black, who has defended William Kennedy 
Smith and Marv Albert. 
</P>
<P>
	``It bought him a really good lawyer,'' said prosecutor Lynn  
Park. ``It didn't buy his freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Frazier's daughter, Evelyn Johnston of Parisburg, Va., held  
back tears as she left the courtroom with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother was a very loving person. She was a quiet person,''  
Ms. Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brancaccio, who plans to appeal, could face a sentence of life  
in prison. Under the maximum sentence, he would be eligible for 
release by age 43, prosecutors said.

<HEADLINE> Funk Took Long Way to PGA Tour  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LA QUINTA, Calif. (AP) -- A former assistant club pro, college  
coach and newspaper circulation supervisor, Fred Funk seemed a long 
shot to succeed on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Funk, who didn't make it onto the tour until he was 32 and lost  
his card at the end of that year, has become one of the game's 
steadier players. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking his sixth career victory, Funk shot a 6-under-par 66  
Friday to remain in the lead at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	He has earned almost $5 million over the past 10 years,  
including $1.1 million in 1998. The Hope winner will collect 
$540,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``My expectations are to try to improve each year and so far I  
have been able to do it,'' said Funk, 42. ``There is no question 
that I'm a late bloomer. I wasn't that good when I was in my 20s. 
As a college player (at Maryland, where he later coached), and as a 
junior player, I just wasn't that good. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weakness of my game is that I don't hit it that far,'' the  
5-foot-8, 165-pounder added. ``But I have to give myself a lot of 
opportunities and hope my putter is working, and I have been able 
to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big hurdle for me was to realize that when my game is  
good, it is good enough to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Funk's short, down-the-middle game seems tailored for the Hope,  
which is played on four courses that are tight and reward accuracy. 
His third round in the 60s put him at 17-under. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hits it far enough, he hits it very straight and he is a  
super, super iron player and has a great short game. You put that 
combination together, that's why he is so consistent year in and 
year out,'' said John Daly, whose second consecutive 66 tied him 
for third with Tom Pernice, two shots off the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Pernice also shot 66 Friday. Steve Pate, with a 64, was alone in  
second, one shot behind Funk. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving into contention was David Duval, whose 64 pulled him  
within six shots of the lead with 36 holes to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval, who won four times in 1998 on his way to setting an  
earnings record of $2,591,031, began this season with a victory in 
the Mercedes Championships, then took a break to go skiing before 
coming back for the Hope. 
</P>
<P>
	He began the tournament quietly, shooting 70 and 71 the first  
two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the mix near the top after 54 holes were Bob Estes, with  
a 65 that put him 12-under, and Scott Verplank, who had a 67 to tie 
Duval for sixth. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  New Knick Sprewell Apologizes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RYE, N.Y. (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell apologized to the  
commissioner, declared himself a changed man and asked to be given 
another chance. 
</P>
<P>
	He got one.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm out to start all over and show people the real me,''  
Sprewell said Friday. ``P.J. is not a bad guy, and I'm here to show 
you guys that I'm not, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newest member of the New York Knicks was reinstated by the  
NBA after a short meeting with commissioner David Stern. He 
apologized for choking Golden State coach P.J. Carlesimo -- an 
action that earned him one of the longest suspensions in league 
history -- and promised to control his anger in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he asked the public for a second chance, especially Knicks  
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry. We all make mistakes. I'm not the person I've been  
portrayed to be,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, acquired Thursday in exchange for John Starks, Chris  
Mills and Terry Cummings, repeatedly used the words ``sorry,'' 
``apologize,'' ``mistake'' and ``second chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also repeatedly referred to the attack on Carlesimo by  
saying, ``I had a bad day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On this day, Sprewell did not come off as the surly, thuggish  
bad boy the public perceives him to be. He spoke in a relaxed 
manner, was quick to smile and seemed genuinely ready to get back 
to basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened in December of '97 will never happen again with  
me, and hopefully not with any other players ever again. I'm 
looking for a fresh new start, and I'm going to be a positive 
person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proof, of course, won't come until Sprewell starts playing  
and makes it through some challenges from a new coach, who might 
set him off by saying something as innocuous as ``put a little more 
mustard on those passes'' -- as Carlesimo did. 
</P>
<P>
	Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy didn't seem to be the least bit  
worried, saying he only wants to coach Sprewell, not judge him. 
</P>
<P>
	Still uncertain is the reception he'll receive from a skeptical  
public. 
</P>
<P>
	New York fans have traditionally been eager to give sports  
figures a second chance, from Billy Martin and Darryl Strawberry in 
baseball to Lawrence Taylor in football and Marv Albert in 
broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
	Few Knicks fans probably remember Sprewell scoring a then  
career-high 41 points against the Knicks at Madison Square Garden 
on Feb. 10, 1994, and many of them only know him for his attack on 
his coach during practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the past 14 months I've talked to my mom and have had  
conversations with numerous people who gave me advice on how to 
handle situations when I'm frustrated, and I think that was my 
biggest problem,'' Sprewell said. ``The lesson is that you make 
mistakes, but you also have to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell was suspended for 68 games last season. His contract  
was terminated but later reinstated by an arbitrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell has also been involved in a reckless driving accident,  
lawsuits against his former agent and the NBA and a fight with 
former teammate Jerome Kersey. 
</P>
<P>
	If Sprewell can lead New York to its first title since 1973, he  
may get the royal treatment yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team already has a good nucleus, hopefully I'll be the  
extra added piece that you all have been looking for,'' he said. 
``Defensively, that's going to be my main role -- to be a stopper. 
Obviously, I have scoring potential, the ability to score points, 
and I want to do that as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Union director Billy Hunter, deputy commissioner Russ Granik and  
two other officials attended Sprewell's meeting with Stern. It was 
the first time they were together since nearly a year ago, when 
Sprewell was fighting the severity of his punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Latrell has given us assurances that he will be able to  
control his anger both on and off the court in the future,'' Stern 
said. ``Billy and I were both satisfied that he seems sincere in 
that commitment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell can begin practicing with the Knicks on Saturday, and  
will play his first exhibition game next Wednesday against New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	New York made two more moves Friday, signing Mavericks free  
agent power forward Kurt Thomas to a two-year contract by using the 
$1.75 million exception and re-signing 40-year-old center Herb 
Williams.

<HEADLINE> Utah Pushes Olympic Oversight Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Utah legislators are pushing a bill that  
would increase oversight of Olympic finances. 
</P>
<P>
	``The buck stops in the Legislature,'' said Rep. Jordan Tanner  
of Provo. 
</P>
<P>
	His bill to create an Olympic Coordinating Committee, a panel of  
12 senators and House members, was approved Thursday by the House 
Government Operations Committee and sent to the full House for 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would establish tighter requirements for the governor  
and Salt Lake's mayor to review quarterly budgets of the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation comes amid reports that the Salt Lake City bid  
committee spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on International 
Olympic Committee members to secure the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tanner said his bill is not a reaction to the bribery  
scandal. He said he has been working on it for 18 months because 
legislators need more involvement in Olympic budget decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Sports Advisory Committee that advises the  
Legislature on Olympic matters has ``no meat on its bones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, his bill would preserve and enlarge that advisory  
panel, now made up of city, county and town officials and two 
athletes, by adding all the members of the Olympic Coordinating 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanner said the legislative oversight committee would carry  
enough political weight to prevail on organizers to curtail the 
2002 Games to avert any budget shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanner acknowledged the legislative panel wouldn't have absolute  
control over the Games, but, ``Right now, the Legislature has no 
teeth. I think we will have some teeth if we pass this 
legislation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Leavitt shares legislators' concerns about the state's  
possible liability for any Olympic shortfall, his lawyer, Gary 
Doxey, told the House panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Doxey appeared to give the governor's endorsement for the  
oversight committee, then found himself under sharp questioning 
over whether the state will have to pay any Olympic budget 
shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is Salt Lake City's guarantee protecting the IOC  
against any debts or claims after the 2002 Games. Former Gov. Norm 
Bangerter, in turn, agreed to use the financial power of the state 
to protect Salt Lake City against any losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt reaffirmed Bangerter's agreement in 1994, but recently  
has said the deal might not be constitutional. The city has been 
worried that it could be left holding the bag -- particularly since 
some corporate sponsors have become jittery over the bribery 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, critics of the Olympics threatened to launch a  
petition drive unless the governor and legislature act to protect 
taxpayers from financial disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	In other bribery scandal developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--The IOC delegate from Libya resigned today, the second member  
of the governing body to step down in the wake of Salt Lake City 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch told The Associated Press  
that Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi submitted his resignation in person 
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said Attarabulsi, an IOC member since 1977, stepped  
down because of revelations that his son received college 
scholarships at Utah schools from Salt Lake City boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	Finland's Pirjo Haeggman became the first IOC casualty of the  
scandal when she resigned Tuesday. She was implicated because her 
former husband got jobs through Olympic bidding committees from 
Salt Lake City and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Britain's sports minister said late Thursday the country won't  
bid for the Olympics until the IOC ``cleans up'' its act. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until it's cleaned up, until our own British Olympics  
Association's recommendations are put into place, I would not be in 
favor of this country or any city in this country bidding for any 
Olympic Games,'' Tony Banks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Simon Clegg, chief executive of the British Olympic  
Association, called for Salt Lake City to forfeit the 2002 Winter 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the British Olympic Association called for a  
complete overhaul of the Olympic bidding and site-selection 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf reported today that Brazil's  
Joao Havelange, one of the IOC longest-serving members and a former 
president of international soccer's governing body, accepted lavish 
treatment by Dutch officials trying to bring the 1992 Games to 
Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
	De Telegraaf said Havelange, 82, was among IOC members who were  
wined and dined, given gifts and escorted regularly to exclusive 
brothels in the Dutch capital. The newspaper did not specify the 
treatment Havelange received, but quoted a former Amsterdam 
organizer as saying he ``went overboard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember it very well because he had special wishes -- wishes  
which were in conflict with the IOC laws,'' said Peter Kronenberg, 
who headed the press office of the Amsterdam Olympic Games 1992 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the gifts were diamonds, bicycles, sports articles, Delft  
blue porcelain, paintings and exclusive art books, De Telegraaf 
said, citing former foundation members it did not identify. 
</P>
<P>
	--SLOC chairman Bob Garff was to outline the process for choosing  
a new SLOC leader today. SLOC president Frank Joklik has stepped 
down because of the scandal. Committee board members have said they 
expect the new president will be someone with Utah ties. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt has been pushing for SLOC to define the search process.  
``The governor feels we can't afford to take six months out of the 
planning process,'' Leavitt spokeswoman Vicki Varela said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Organizers of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta say they want  
to stop speculation about what misdeeds may have been done in 
winning that city's bid, even if that means an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some ways I wish they'd just investigate us, because I  
don't think they'd find anything,'' said Charlie Battle, who was in 
charge of international relations in Atlanta's winning bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ain't perfect and we ain't arrogant, but we didn't bribe  
anybody,'' Billy Payne, who was president of the Atlanta Committee 
for the Olympic Games, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Australian Olympic Committee offered to accommodate two IOC  
members from Africa in a luxury London hotel a month before Sydney 
secured the 2000 Summer Games, according to documents released 
today by the AOC. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents revealed that AOC president John Coates wrote to  
Charles Mukora of Kenya and Francis Nyangweso of Uganda in August 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter to Mukora, one of the 13 IOC members who has  
reportedly been sent a ``please explain'' letter in conjunction 
with the Salt Lake City bribery scandal, read: ``If you would like 
to stop off in London en route to Monaco (the venue for the 2000 
Olympics vote) then please let me have your travel details as I 
will be pleased to arrange for you to be met at the airport, 
transported to and from the city and for you to stay at the 
Dorchester Hotel as our guest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney bid officials said they received no response to the hotel  
offer.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Exec Denies Gov't Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first Microsoft executive to testify in  
the company's antitrust case denied uttering an often-quoted phrase 
about his company's aggression toward a software rival, that he 
once promised to ``cut off Netscape's air supply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Maritz, the senior Microsoft executive alleged to have made  
that threat, takes the witness stand Monday to defend his company. 
Throughout the 11 weeks of trial, Maritz's name appears on nearly 
every controversial e-mail used as evidence by the government, 
either as author or recipient. 
</P>
<P>
	But in 160 pages of written testimony made public Friday, Maritz  
denied ever saying the words attributed to him by one witness 
during a November 1995 meeting with Intel Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never said, in the presence of Intel personnel or otherwise,  
that Microsoft would 'cut off Netscape's air supply,' or words to 
that effect,'' Maritz wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz also flatly denied other central allegations in the  
government's case, such as charges that Microsoft strong-armed 
Apple Computer Inc. into distributing its Internet browser software 
in 1997 and that it intimidated Intel into abandoning a rival 
technology earlier in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz accused government lawyers of trying to ``portray  
instances of routine interaction between companies in the computer 
industry, who inevitably must deal with one another, as something 
nefarious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a group vice president, Maritz falls in seniority below only  
Microsoft's billionaire chairman, Bill Gates, and its president, 
Steve Ballmer. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz joined the company in 1986 after working five years at  
Intel, and he is responsible for Microsoft's most important 
products, including its dominant Windows operating system and its 
profitable Office software programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz also was a key player in convincing a reluctant Gates to  
include America Online's software within Windows in exchange for 
AOL distributing Microsoft's Internet software. The March 1996 deal 
proved important for Microsoft, whose browser is used by many of 
AOL's 15 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL buying Netscape for $4.2 billion. The judge on Friday  
ordered the Justice Department to turn over to Microsoft's outside 
lawyers some documents submitted by AOL and Netscape related to the 
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft requested the paperwork to investigate whether the  
deal might rejuvenate the market because AOL can distribute 
Netscape's browser to all its subscribers, dramatically boosting 
its popularity.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Says Gay Discharges Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Air Force and Army on Friday reported big  
increases in gay discharges last year, and the total for the 
military as a whole was the largest in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force officials said they believe many of their discharges  
were cases of young recruits declaring themselves homosexual as a 
way of securing a quick and penalty-free exit from the service. The 
Army had no immediate comment on that except to say its records 
showed that most of those being discharged were young recruits or 
still in their first year of service. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half the Air Force's 414 discharges were at Lackland  
Air Force Base in Texas, where new recruits do their six weeks of 
basic training. In the vast majority of cases throughout the Air 
Force the person voluntarily stated that he or she was gay, Air 
Force officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In virtually every self-initiated disclosure, the second  
statement made is, 'I'd also like to be discharged,''' said David 
Smith, an Air Force spokesman at Air Education and Training Command 
at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas. He said this led officials to 
conclude that a growing number of recruits are using a gay 
declaration to escape the service. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said commanders are legally prohibited from questioning  
Air Force members about such voluntary statements. ``You kind of 
have to take them at their word,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to news coverage of the Air Force record on gay  
discharges, the Pentagon released figures late Friday for the other 
services. The Army reported a 50 percent increase last year, to 
310; the Navy said its number fell by nearly a quarter to 345, and 
the Marine Corps had a slight drop to 76. Most were reported as 
voluntary statements of homosexuality, although only the Air Force 
expressed a belief they were excuses for getting out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department official most directly responsible for  
policy on gays, Rudy de Leon, issued a brief statement saying the 
1998 gay discharge totals ``align with those of previous years.'' 
His figures showed gay discharges for the military as a whole rose 
to 1,145 from 997 the year before. The 1998 total was the highest 
since 1987, before the Pentagon instituted its policy of not 
forcing service members to declare their sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	De Leon did not address the issue of service members using gay  
declarations as a way out of the service. 
</P>
<P>
	T'jae Gibson, an Air Force spokeswoman at the Pentagon, said an  
official review of discharges and personnel policies at Lackland 
last year found that most instructors and trainees there believed 
the acknowledgments of homosexuality were made to escape the 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	A watchdog of the Pentagon's controversial policy on gays in the  
military, the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, on Friday 
disputed the Air Force's suggestion that some people are using the 
gay prohibition as an excuse to get out of their contractual 
obligation to the service. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're just trying to make excuses to sweep under the carpet  
what's going on there,'' said Dixon Osburn, co-executive director 
of the watchdog group. He said the Air Force has failed to produce 
hard evidence that false declarations of homosexuality are being 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	Those dismissed for homosexuality receive an administrative  
discharge, which does not carry a bad-conduct stigma. It is one of 
the few circumstances in which a recruit may get out without 
penalty; other cases are those in which a serious medical problem 
surfaces after entering basic training or in some instances of 
false enlistment statements. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, the Pentagon adopted a gay policy -- known as ``don't  
ask, don't tell'' -- that is supposed to allow gays to serve if they 
keep their sexual orientation private. It punishes those who engage 
in homosexual acts or take actions that call attention to their 
orientation. The Pentagon had been accused of hunting down gays and 
driving them out of the service. 
</P>
<P>
	If a service member voluntarily states his or her homosexuality,  
discharge is automatic. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, the spokesman for the Air Force's training command, said  
Gen. Lloyd Newton, chief of the command, has made recommendations 
to Air Force headquarters and to the Defense Department on ways to 
deal with the growing number of voluntary statements of 
homosexuality. Smith would not discuss any aspect of Newton's 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	Last April, the Pentagon released a report on enforcement of its  
gay policy. It said early discharges based on voluntary statements 
of homosexuality occurred most often in the Air Force, where 212 of 
the 309 Air Force gay discharges in 1997 occurred in basic 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	In that report, the Pentagon said ``the reasons for this  
increase are not known and would be difficult to ascertain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, 271 of the 414 gay discharges in the Air Force were at  
Lackland's basic training site. And of the 414 cases, 391 were 
based on voluntary statements, the Air Force said. Twenty-two cases 
last year were initiated by witness reports of homosexual acts, and 
there was one case in which two female Air Force members were 
discharged for declaring marriage plans.

<HEADLINE> Barnett's Heart Is in Colorado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Gary Barnett had plenty of suitors trying  
to lure him from Northwestern the past seven years, and one by one 
he turned them down. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA. Texas. Notre Dame. Georgia. None made the grade.  
</P>
<P>
	The University of Colorado finally offered Barnett something the  
others couldn't -- the chance to come home. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision to come to Colorado was easy because it's home,''  
Barnett said Friday as he was introduced as Colorado's football 
coach. ``It is where my roots are, it is where Mary and I started. 
It is where our children were born, and it has been a dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett, 52, replaces Rick Neuheisel, who left Colorado this  
month when Washington offered to pay him more than $1 million a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	News of Neuheisel's departure made Mary Barnett think about a  
possible return to Colorado, where and she and her husband lived 
from 1971-91. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a phone call from Gary, and I must admit my heart leaped  
a little bit,'' Mary Barnett said, ``but in this profession, 
there's so many things that go on, you never really know what's 
really real and what's not. Until things are done, I try real hard 
to stay calm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Barnetts' resolve was tested as initial negotiations with  
Colorado athletic director Dick Tharp broke down, and the Buffs 
turned their attention to Denver Broncos offensive coordinator Gary 
Kubiak. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubiak withdrew from consideration last Sunday, returning the  
focus to the Barnetts in Evanston, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the first thing that came to my mind was how much I  
really did want this job,'' Barnett said when asked about seeing 
Colorado pursue Kubiak. ``It brought it into very, very clear 
perspective to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Colorado law prevents state employees from signing  
multiyear contracts, Barnett was one of six exemptions allowed at 
the university. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Board of Regents unanimously approved Barnett's  
five-year contract that will pay him $710,000 per season. Barnett's 
salary at Northwestern was about $480,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Because he had an 11-year contract with the Wildcats, Barnett  
will have to cover the school's $250,000 buyout clause. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a significant financial sacrifice -- a significant  
financial sacrifice for me to do this,'' Barnett said. ``It 
probably wasn't one that my financial adviser would tell me to do. 
It was just one of those things that's right in your heart, and you 
do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Northwestern, Barnett promised to take the ``Purple to  
Pasadena'' -- a reference to the Wildcats' four-decade absence from 
the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	He fulfilled that promise in 1995, completing a remarkable  
resurrection at Northwestern. Though the task is not as daunting at 
Colorado, Barnett's goal in Boulder is to ``Return to Dominance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I brought that up to our players yesterday, and I asked them  
if they knew what `RTD' meant, and they said it was the bus that 
went downtown,'' Barnett said. ``RTD is going to be the return to 
dominance of the Colorado football program. I want to play my part 
in doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After being presented with a leather Colorado letterman's  
jacket, Barnett said his top priority is meeting recruits who have 
committed to Colorado and visiting the home of each player 
returning next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is going to take me between now and June to get done,''  
Barnett said. ``But that relationship that they had with the coach 
that recruited them and the head coach that was here at the time 
has been lost. That is a very sensitive item.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In seven seasons at Northwestern, Barnett compiled a 35-45-1  
record and took the Wildcats to two bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, Barnett was a Colorado assistant under Bill

<HEADLINE>  New Knick Sprewell Apologizes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RYE, N.Y. (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell apologized to the  
commissioner, declared himself a changed man and asked to be given 
another chance. 
</P>
<P>
	He got one.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm out to start all over and show people the real me,''  
Sprewell said Friday. ``P.J. is not a bad guy, and I'm here to show 
you guys that I'm not, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newest member of the New York Knicks was reinstated by the  
NBA after a short meeting with commissioner David Stern. He 
apologized for choking Golden State coach P.J. Carlesimo -- an 
action that earned him one of the longest suspensions in league 
history -- and promised to control his anger in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he asked the public for a second chance, especially Knicks  
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry. We all make mistakes. I'm not the person I've been  
portrayed to be,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, acquired Thursday in exchange for John Starks, Chris  
Mills and Terry Cummings, repeatedly used the words ``sorry,'' 
``apologize,'' ``mistake'' and ``second chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also repeatedly referred to the attack on Carlesimo by  
saying, ``I had a bad day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On this day, Sprewell did not come off as the surly, thuggish  
bad boy the public perceives him to be. He spoke in a relaxed 
manner, was quick to smile and seemed genuinely ready to get back 
to basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened in December of '97 will never happen again with  
me, and hopefully not with any other players ever again. I'm 
looking for a fresh new start, and I'm going to be a positive 
person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proof, of course, won't come until Sprewell starts playing  
and makes it through some challenges from a new coach, who might 
set him off by saying something as innocuous as ``put a little more 
mustard on those passes'' -- as Carlesimo did. 
</P>
<P>
	Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy didn't seem to be the least bit  
worried, saying he only wants to coach Sprewell, not judge him. 
</P>
<P>
	Still uncertain is the reception he'll receive from a skeptical  
public. 
</P>
<P>
	New York fans have traditionally been eager to give sports  
figures a second chance, from Billy Martin and Darryl Strawberry in 
baseball to Lawrence Taylor in football and Marv Albert in 
broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
	Few Knicks fans probably remember Sprewell scoring a then  
career-high 41 points against the Knicks at Madison Square Garden 
on Feb. 10, 1994, and many of them only know him for his attack on 
his coach during practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the past 14 months I've talked to my mom and have had  
conversations with numerous people who gave me advice on how to 
handle situations when I'm frustrated, and I think that was my 
biggest problem,'' Sprewell said. ``The lesson is that you make 
mistakes, but you also have to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell was suspended for 68 games last season. His contract  
was terminated but later reinstated by an arbitrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell has also been involved in a reckless driving accident,  
lawsuits against his former agent and the NBA and a fight with 
former teammate Jerome Kersey. 
</P>
<P>
	If Sprewell can lead New York to its first title since 1973, he  
may get the royal treatment yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team already has a good nucleus, hopefully I'll be the  
extra added piece that you all have been looking for,'' he said. 
``Defensively, that's going to be my main role -- to be a stopper. 
Obviously, I have scoring potential, the ability to score points, 
and I want to do that as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Union director Billy Hunter, deputy commissioner Russ Granik and  
two other officials attended Sprewell's meeting with Stern. It was 
the first time they were together since nearly a year ago, when 
Sprewell was fighting the severity of his punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Latrell has given us assurances that he will be able to  
control his anger both on and off the court in the future,'' Stern 
said. ``Billy and I were both satisfied that he seems sincere in 
that commitment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell can begin practicing with the Knicks on Saturday, and  
will play his first exhibition game next Wednesday against New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	New York made two more moves Friday, signing Mavericks free  
agent power forward Kurt Thomas to a two-year contract by using the 
$1.75 million exception and re-signing 40-year-old center Herb 
Williams.

<HEADLINE> Second Arrest in Boy's Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Connecticut authorities want to question  
a fugitive arrested here about the killings of a woman and her 
8-year-old son, who was a witness in the murder trial of the 
fugitive's brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Adrian Peeler, 22, was arrested Thursday at a hotel in Charlotte  
on a fugitive from justice warrant from Connecticut. He was 
arraigned this morning and agreed to be extradited to Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Peeler, who escaped from a Hartford, Conn., halfway house in  
April, is wanted for questioning in the Jan. 7 shooting deaths of 
Leroy ``B.J.'' Brown Jr. and his mother, Karen Clarke, 29. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were found in their Bridgeport, Conn., home. Police said  
it appeared they ran up the stairs to get away from the killer, who 
apparently was waiting for them when they returned home from 
grocery shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy was expected to be a key witness for prosecutors in the  
upcoming murder trial of Peeler's brother, Russell Peeler, 27, who 
is charged with killing Clarke's fiance, Rudolph Snead Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have called Russell Peeler a ``possible suspect'' in the  
mother and son killings, but will not say whether Adrian Peeler is 
a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Peeler is already being held on $750,000 cash-only bond  
after he was arrested last week when police found him in his 
father's house with a stolen shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been out on bond and was being monitored by an electronic  
bracelet at the time of Leroy's killing. 
</P>
<P>
	Leroy was an eyewitness to an attempt by Peeler to kill Snead in  
a drive-by shooting on Sept. 2, 1997, according to authorities. 
Nearly nine months later, Snead was shot to death in a Bridgeport 
barber shop. Peeler was later charged with murder and attempted 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Adrian Peeler was serving a 30-month sentence for sale of  
narcotics, reckless endangerment and risk of injury to minors when 
he escaped in April.

<HEADLINE>  Webber Missing in Sacramento </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- For the third straight season, the  
Sacramento Kings started training camp without their best player. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Kings continued to negotiate with free-agent center  
Vlade Divac, power forward Chris Webber was conspicuously absent 
Thursday night as new coach Rick Adelman conducted his first 
post-lockout practice with 18 veterans and free agents present. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives the appearance that he is trying to force a trade,''  
said Geoff Petrie, the Kings' vice president of operations. ``But 
I've been instructed by the owners, present and future, not to 
pursue that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings began the previous two seasons without Mitch Richmond,  
the team's six-time All-Star guard and seven-time leading scorer. 
Richmond, who sought a renegotiated contract, was traded last May 
to the Washington Wizards with veteran forward Otis Thorpe for 
Webber. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials said they did not know the whereabouts of Webber,  
the high-scoring but troubled player the Kings hope to built their 
future around. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings were also expected to renounce the rights to  
free-agent small forward Corliss Williamson. But the team said 
Williamson, the team's second-leading scorer last season, remains 
in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know as much as you know,'' Adelman said. ``We expected him  
today; we contacted his agent and we believe he knew the schedule. 
I really don't know any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Jason Williams, the team's No. 1 draft choice last summer,  
and center Jerome James, the team's second-round pick, attended 
practice. But they did not participate because they've yet to sign 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Webber, who has averaged 20.0 points and 9.5 rebounds in his  
five NBA seasons, told a national radio talk show host last weekend 
he was ready to play for the Kings. But until earlier this week, he 
had not been to Sacramento since the trade. 
</P>
<P>
	But after visiting and working out in Sacramento with his close  
friend Billy Owens, the Kings' starting power forward last season, 
Webber remained aloof. The team said he has not yet taken his 
required physical examination. 
</P>
<P>
	Divac, beginning his 10th NBA season, played for seven seasons  
with the Los Angeles Lakers and the past two seasons for the 
Charlotte Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrie said the team expects to announce the signing of Divac to  
a multiyear contract today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're working on it; it's a big contract,'' Petrie said. ``But  
I think we'll be OK with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Petrie threatened to resign. The following day,  
managing general partner Jim Thomas announced he was selling the 
majority of his interest to the Maloof family of Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maloof family, who previously owned 25 percent of the  
franchise and were the former owners of the Houston Rockets, are 
officially to assume majority ownership July 1. But it was the 
Maloof family brothers who reportedly flew to Arkansas on Wednesday 
night to meet with Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings didn't announce an official training camp roster, but  
the team will likely begin the season with only four or five 
players remaining from their 1997-98 season-ending roster. 
</P>
<P>
	The expected returning team members are swingman Tariq  
Abdul-Wahad, the team's No. 1 pick last season; reserve shooting 
guards Terry Dehere and Chris Robinson and second-year forward 
Lawrence Funderburke. Williamson would increase the returning 
roster to five.

<HEADLINE> Libyan Resigns in IOC Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee  
lost its second member today in the widening Salt Lake City bribery 
scandal, with more resignations expected this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch told The Associated Press  
that Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi of Libya resigned in person, one 
day before an IOC panel ends its investigation into the worst 
ethics scandal in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said Attarabulsi, 61, an IOC member since 1977, quit  
because of revelations his son received college scholarships at 
Utah schools from Salt Lake City boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I accepted his resignation and I thanked him for his 22 years  
as a member of the IOC, what he did for sport in his country and 
for us,'' Samaranch said. ``He's a good man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said Attarabulsi made ``a mistake.''  
</P>
<P>
	Attarabulsi's son, Suhel, has said he received tuition to attend  
an English language center based at Brigham Young and a community 
college, plus $700 a month for expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Finland's Pirjo Haeggman resigned Tuesday. She was implicated  
because her former husband got jobs through bid committees from 
Salt Lake and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Salt Lake folks were out to win friends, and they  
clearly thought friends would be more likely to support them than 
enemies, and did everything they could to strengthen those friendly 
ties,'' IOC vice president Dick Pound told marketing executives in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unfortunate that a community that is so well prepared to  
host an Olympic Winter Games should have its overall integrity 
called into question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC director general Francois Carrard said Attarabulsi and  
Haeggman resigned in the ``higher interest of the Olympic 
movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch didn't rule out further resignations this weekend. He  
said 13 members were implicated in the IOC's investigation into 
cash payments, scholarships, medical treatment, gifts and other 
inducements related to Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 
Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic officials have identified other members accused of  
serious violations meriting possible expulsion: Agustin Arroyo 
(Ecuador), Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gafir (Sudan), Jean-Claude 
Ganga (Republic of Congo), Laime Keita (Mali), Charles Mukora 
(Kenya), Sergio Santander (Chile) and David Sibandze (Swaziland). 
</P>
<P>
	Four members cited for lesser infractions are: Anton Geesink  
(Netherlands), Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye (Ivory Coast), Kim Un-Yong 
(South Korea) and Vitaly Smirnov (Russia). 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Carrard said the IOC has discussed giving back a Swiss tax  
concession. He said the matter was reviewed because the IOC did not 
want to embarrass Swiss authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--British sports minister Tony Banks said today his country won't  
bid for the Olympics until the IOC ``cleans up.'' Simon Clegg, 
chief executive of the British Olympic Association, called for Salt 
Lake to forfeit the 2002 Winter Olympics. His organization wants 
the bid process overhauled. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf reported today that Brazil's  
Joao Havelange, a longstanding IOC member and former president of 
soccer's governing body, accepted lavish treatment by Dutch 
officials trying to bring the 1992 Games to Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
	De Telegraaf said Havelange, 82, was among those IOC members  
wined and dined, given gifts and escorted regularly to exclusive 
brothels in the Dutch capital. The newspaper did not specify the 
treatment Havelange received, but quoted a former Amsterdam 
organizer as saying he ``went overboard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember it very well because he had special wishes -- wishes  
which were in conflict with the IOC laws,'' said Peter Kronenberg, 
who headed the press office of the Amsterdam Olympic Games 1992 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the gifts were diamonds, bicycles, sports articles,  
porcelain, paintings and exclusive art books, De Telegraaf said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sweden's Laenstidningen newspaper reported today that Ganga,  
the IOC member from the Republic of Congo, asked the Ostersund, 
Sweden, bid committee for the 1994 Winter Games to build a handball 
arena in the Congo, and that Sibandze sought money for a plane 
ticket. Laenstidningen quoted bid committee member Stig Hedlund. 
</P>
<P>
	--Utah legislators want to tighten oversight of Olympic finances  
for the 2002 Winter Games. State Rep. Jordan Tanner's bill to 
create a panel of 12 senators and state House members was approved 
Thursday in committee and sent to the full House for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Salt Lake Organizing Committee chairman Bob Garff was to  
outline the process for choosing a new SLOC leader today. SLOC 
president Frank Joklik has quit because of the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Australian Olympic Committee offered to put up two IOC  
members in a luxury London hotel a month before Sydney secured the 
2000 Summer Games, according to documents released today by the 
AOC. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents revealed that AOC president John Coates wrote to  
Mukora, the Kenyan IOC member, and Uganda's Francis Nyangweso in 
August 1993.

	Scripps, Knight Ridder Profits Down  
</P>
<P>
	Knight Ridder profit slipped in the fourth quarter, partly as a  
result of the expense of moving its headquarters across the nation.	
E.W. Scripps' earnings missed analysts' expectations for the fourth	
quarter of 1998, in part because of increased spending to build up	
market share in Denver. But both newspaper groups said today that	
results from operations rose in the final quarter of 1998 from a	
newspaper ownership. Scripps reported earnings of $43.6 million, or	
55 cents a share, in the final quarter of 1998, compared with $50.5	
million, or 62 cents a share, a year earlier.

	DirecTV Owner Buys Rival Primestar  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The owner of DirecTV, the nation's biggest  
direct satellite TV broadcaster, is buying its main rival, 
Primestar Inc., to leave just two major satellite players in the 
battle against cable companies. DirecTV would have more than three 
times as many customers as its closest satellite competitor, 
EchoStar Communications Corp., under the $1.82 billion deal 
announced today. But analysts believe DirecTV's satellite dominance 
will not raise antitrust concerns because its ultimate competition 
-- cable -- is still in far more American living rooms. DirecTV and 
EchoStar would remain the only companies with national licenses for 
high-power satellite broadcasting, which offers an alternative to 
cable by providing huge menus of channels and high-quality pictures 
beamed into homes through pizza-sized dishes.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Jules Lederer, founder of Budget Rent-A-Car and  
former husband of columnist Ann Landers, has died of a heart 
attack. He was 81. Lederer died at his home near London yesterday. 
Lederer dropped out of school in the ninth grade and sold 
everything from pens and hats to logs and newspapers before 
starting Budget, which grew into one of the nation's largest rental 
car companies. ``He lived in the lingo of business,'' said his and 
Landers' daughter, Margo Lederer. She described her father as a 
street-smart, lifelong salesman.

	Discount Retailer Caldor To Close  
</P>
<P>
	NORWALK, Conn. (AP) -- Discount retailer Caldor Corp., which has  
operated under bankruptcy court protection since 1995, announced 
today it was closing its 145 stores for good. The decision to 
liquidate the company follows the refusal of a group of creditors 
to agree to a plan of reorganization, Caldor management said in a 
news release. The $2.5 billion company, with about 20,000 
employees, operates stores in nine East Coast states including 
Connecticut and New York. Going-out-of-business sales will likely 
begin in several weeks and be completed by May, the company said.

	Duck Head Pants Eyes Expansion  
</P>
<P>
	WINDER, Ga. (AP) -- In some circles, Duck Head pants are as much  
a Southern tradition as iced tea, grits or college football 
Saturdays. But because Duck Head is primarily a regional label, and 
unknown to many consumers in other parts of the United States, the 
company has struggled in recent years. Management considered 
selling the firm until recently. Now Duck Head, hoping to increase 
its exposure and sales, is trying to flap its way into the thick of 
the highly competitive national apparel market, partly through the 
creation of an online store (www.duckhead.com).

come-back in battered Internet stocks failed, and blue-chip stocks 
came under selling pressure from a disappointing earnings report by 
IBM. At the close the Dow Jones industrial average was down 143.41 
points, or 1.55 percent, at 9,120.67. The blue-chip index fell as 
much as 175 points this morning before trimming its losses. Broader 
stock indexes ended lower after an attempted come-back in Internet 
shares fizzled in the final 90 minutes. The Nasdaq ended down 5.84 
at 2,338.88, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index declined 9.82 to

	Brazilian Currency Falls Again  
</P>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's week-old decision to let  
its currency float against the dollar hasn't by any means calmed 
investor nerves about Latin America's largest economy. The 
Brazilian real fell again in trading today, ending the day at 1.72 
against the dollar versus 1.70 at yesterday's close. The Central 
Bank sold dollars to support the real. The Sao Paulo stock 
exchange's Bovespa index declined 2.3 percent in trading.

	Russia's Foreign Trade Down 16 Pct.  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's foreign trade, which had been one of the  
battered economy's few bright spots, dropped in value by 16 percent 
for the first 11 months of last year, officials said today. Foreign 
trade had been growing steadily until an economic crisis hit last 
summer. The figure does not fully reflect the even sharper downturn 
of recent months. After the crisis began in August, demand for 
imports declined -- due partly to a devaluation in the ruble -- and 
foreign trade became one of the areas hardest hit.

	Postal Service Gets Good Marks  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite all the wisecracks and in this age of  
cynicism about government, most Americans say they are satisfied 
with the Postal Service. Rates increased this month for the first 
time in four years, raising the cost of sending a first-class 
letter one penny, to 33 cents. A third of those questioned in an 
Associated Press poll said the stamp costs too much. But the 
remainder said it was about right or a bargain. Almost 
three-fourths of Americans believe the Postal Service is doing an 
excellent or good job, said the AP poll by ICR of Media, Pa.

	GOP Selects Philadelphia As Site

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican National Committee formally  
chose Philadelphia today as the site of next year's presidential 
nominating convention, marking the party's first return there in 52 
years. City political and business leaders pledged more than $50 
million to cover convention costs. As a prelude to the event, the 
RNC will hold its summer meeting in Philadelphia this July. Serving 
as host for a convention is worth millions of dollars for the 
region's restaurants, hotels and other businesses and comes with 
priceless media spotlight. Philadelphia has been the site of eight 
political conventions, including both the Republican and Democratic 
conventions in 1948, when Thomas Dewey and Harry S. Truman were 
nominated. .

the tribe's reservation. The justices said they will decide whether 
a pair of 90-year-old federal laws that gave the government 
ownership of the coal applied as well to methane gas found with it. 
A decision is expected by late June.

<HEADLINE> Online Pornography Case Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A businessman who sells access codes to  
enter pornographic Web sites opened the government's defense Friday 
of a law aimed at keeping sexual material on the Internet away from 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Laith Alsarraf runs AdultCheck, an age verification service that  
requires adults to input credit card numbers and other 
identification for free access to pornographic sites. He said 3 
million people pay $16.95 a year for the service, with about half 
the money going to Web site owners. 
</P>
<P>
	As for worries that customers' personal data could be exposed in  
cyberspace, Alsarraf said: ``That information is never released, 
given out, sold, or disclosed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The disputed law, in fact, prohibits adult Web sites from  
disclosing personal data they collect to verify ages without the 
consumer's consent. The clause was added to mollify privacy 
advocates when the legislation was being debated in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union is challenging the Child  
Online Protection Act, which was signed by President Clinton in 
October but put on hold by a judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The law would require commercial Web sites to collect a credit  
card number or some other access code as proof of age before 
allowing Internet users to view material deemed ``harmful to 
minors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Violators would face up to six months in jail and a $50,000  
fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the law is a sensible way to keep Internet  
pornography away from children. The ACLU contends the law violates 
the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	Alsarraf said most of the 46,000 sites offering links to  
AdultCheck offer pornography, with names like ``True Confessions of 
Housewives'' and ``West Coast Teens.'' Such businesses are becoming 
more aware ``they need to be responsible to keep adult material 
away from children,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	ACLU attorney Ann Beeson suggested Alsarraf had another  
motivation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wouldn't you agree you stand to make a large amount of money  
if this law goes into effect?'' she asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping for a lot of things,'' he said. ``That could be one  
of them.''

<HEADLINE> Helms Discusses Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman  
Jesse Helms set a June 1 deadline Friday for President Clinton ``or 
his successor'' to submit amendments to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic 
Missile Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	He told conservative activists the entire pact belongs ``in the  
dustbin of history'' and suggested that the administration is 
stalling on the modifications -- agreed to by Clinton and Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin -- for fear that the Senate would vote to 
rescind the full treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Carolina Republican also demanded the administration  
submit another treaty likely to be rejected -- a 1997 environmental 
pact signed by the United States and 37 other industrial nations in 
Kyoto, Japan, to limit gases that contribute to global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms threatened to delay action on all other treaties until  
Clinton submits both for Senate approval or rejection. ``We will 
consider all of them, or we will consider none of them,'' he told 
cheering conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Among treaties that could get blocked: the 1996 Comprehensive  
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, a top administration priority. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms got a standing ovation as he spoke to the Conservative  
Political Action Conference in suburban Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	He is known for holding up measures and nominations before. In  
1997 Helms single-handedly blocked the nomination of former 
Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, a fellow Republican, to be 
ambassador to Mexico by refusing to hold hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	If that earned him the nickname ``Senator No,'' so be it, Helms  
told the standing-room-only audience. ``Saying no is part of the 
job of being chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
And I plan to say `no' to a few more things this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helms contends the ABM pact is no longer valid because the  
Soviet Union no longer exists. 
</P>
<P>
	But he wants the Senate to formally rescind it to open the way  
for a national missile defense system, first proposed by President 
Reagan in the early 1980s. Helms called missile defense ``the 
single-most important foreign policy issue before the U.S. Senate 
this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such a system is prohibited by terms of the existing ABM treaty  
-- and the administration contends that Moscow would have to agree 
to any modifications. 
</P>
<P>
	``I say baloney,'' Helms said to renegotiating the treaty with  
the Russians. ``Not on my watch, Mr. President.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helms drew cheers when he referred, indirectly, to the  
impeachment trial under way in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	In insisting his June 1 deadline be met, Helms said, ``If the  
president or his successor -- we can be hopeful, can't we? -- fails 
to do so, then the administration alone will be responsible for the 
consequences of its own mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Helms praised the administration for rejecting  
a proposed bipartisan commission on U.S.-Cuba policy, a panel he 
said would have opened the way to lifting the trade embargo on 
Castro's Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms said he wouldn't criticize steps taken by the  
administration to permit more humanitarian aid to reach Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll (also) go along with letting the Baltimore Orioles play  
exhibition games against the Cuban national team -- but on one 
condition,'' Helms said. ``I want the Cuban national team to come 
to Baltimore to play the Orioles first and then the Orioles can go 
to Havana. Because when the O's get to to Cuba, there will be no 
one to play them.''

<HEADLINE> Bulls: Rebuilding Starts Slowly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Ron Harper's highlight-filled video collection  
will be his best reminder of the Chicago Bulls' good old days. Toni 
Kukoc says he can reminisce simply by glancing up at six 
championship banners hanging from the rafters. 
</P>
<P>
	But once they start playing next month, there will be few  
on-floor reminders of the past. And both Kukoc and Harper know it. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Steve Kerr, Luc  
Longley and Jud Buechler are all gone. 
</P>
<P>
	And already there are signs this will be a long season, even if  
it is only 50 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The new era, the rebuilding after Jordan's retirement, got off  
to a slow start Thursday -- the Bulls had to cancel their first 
practice following the lockout because they don't have enough 
players under contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not frustrated. Not yet anyway,'' Harper said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm numb,'' rookie coach Tim Floyd said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls have three days before their exhibition opener Sunday  
against Indiana and just more than two weeks before they go back to 
Salt Lake City -- where they won their sixth title last June -- to 
meet the Jazz in the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take some time to get used to each other,''  
Kukoc said as he pedaled a bike, minutes after the practice with 
some of his soon-to-be new teammates was called off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever happens, it's going to be different. It might be  
difficult at times, but hopefully, things will get better soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls did announce they had re-signed center Bill Wennington  
-- to a minimum contract of $1 million for 10-year veterans -- and 
also signed free agent Curtis Staples, a 3-point specialist from 
Virginia. Combined with Harper, Kukoc, Randy Brown and Keith Booth, 
already under contract, that gave the Bulls six players. 
</P>
<P>
	Another addition, free agent Brent Barry, was at the Berto  
Center for a workout before leaving for dinner with Floyd still 
unsigned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls are supposed to pick up at least four players in  
sign-and-trade deals, but the only one to show was Mark Bryant, 
part of a deal with Phoenix for Luc Longley. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no sight of Roy Rogers, acquired in the swap with  
Houston for Pippen. Martin Muursepp and Bubba Wells, part of the 
Suns deal for Longley, weren't there, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Among 14 players shooting baskets and limbering up were Matt  
Steigenga, Rob Werdan, Cornell David, former draft pick Jeff 
Sanders, Rusty LaRue and draft picks Cory Carr and Corey Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
	The tired-of-waiting coach Floyd finally called all assembled  
the center of the floor to say there weren't enough players under 
contract at the time to hold his first practice. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Jerry Krause made a brief appearance. He claimed  
the new player contracts were so different from past ones that 
there was a backlog in the league office, thus the delay in getting 
players signed and to the floor for practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to get them done with the utmost speed,'' Krause  
said, adding he expected to have 20 players signed in the next 
couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen was to sign a five-year, $67.2 million deal -- with an  
additional $15 million in incentives -- and then be shipped to 
Houston for Rogers and a second-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr was to get a five-year, $11 million deal before heading to  
San Antonio for draft picks and veteran Chuck Person. And center 
Longley was to receive a five-year, $30 million package before 
being traded to Phoenix for Bryant, Muursepp and Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	With Jordan playing golf in retirement and Rodman as usual  
sending mixed signals about his future, the Bulls will turn to 
Kukoc for leadership, ball handling and scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	He still wasn't sure Thursday in the midst of the chaos what his  
new team would look like or even when it would finally be together. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time is going to show. It's too early to judge what Jerry's  
doing right now,'' Kukoc said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Plenty of teams needed years to rebuild. I guess management  
just felt the situation right now is probably the best point to 
start rebuilding.''

<HEADLINE>  Brazilian Currency Falls Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's week-old decision to let  
its currency float against the dollar hasn't by any means calmed 
investor nerves about Latin America's largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian real fell again in trading, ending the day at 1.72  
against the dollar versus 1.70 at Thursday's close. The Central 
Bank sold dollars to support the real. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sao Paulo stock exchange's Bovespa index declined 2.3  
percent in trading. On Thursday, jitters over the plunging real 
sent the Bovespa down by 4.6 percent after a euphoric 52-percent 
rise the four previous days. 
</P>
<P>
	Market analysts had expected a brighter scenario after good news  
from Brazil's Congress, where the lower house passed a key bill on 
Wednesday that aimed to reduce the government's budget deficit and 
instill new investor confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	But the weakening real has depreciated by about 30 percent since  
Jan. 12, apparently keeping investors skeptical about Brazil's 
ability to strengthen its shaky economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this isn't enough to attract inflows and kick-start  
exports, things will only get worse,'' a currency dealer in Rio de 
Janeiro said when the value of the real to the dollar plunged to 
1.73 on Thursday. He spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said the  
government did not intend to dump its free-float policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has decided what course the real will take, and  
we'll continue in the same way,'' said George Lamaziere in an 
interview with CBN radio station. 
</P>
<P>
	He attributed instability to markets' finding their  
``equilibrium'' after the real's depreciation. 
</P>
<P>
	The government hopes its new currency policy will lure back  
foreign investors with a cheaper real. It follows a six-month 
period in which the Central Bank spent some $45 billion in foreign 
reserves in a failed effort to support the real. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's biggest worry remains an outflow of dollars. Despite  
the currency depreciation, some $1.7 billion has left the country 
since Friday. Markets estimate that reserves have dipped below $30 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, the Chamber of Deputies passed a bill  
reducing pensions for retired federal employees, which could save 
the government $2.5 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more important than the savings, the vote sent a signal  
that Cardoso has the support needed to reduce the swollen budget 
deficit. The pension bill had failed four times earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has promised to reduce its estimated $65 billion  
public deficit this year by about $16.4 billion. The pledge was a 
condition for approval of a $41.5 billion loan package assembled by 
the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate, which must approve the pension tax for the measure  
to take effect, decided Thursday to make the matter an urgent 
priority, meaning it could come to a vote as early as Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Attorney Charged in Capital Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- A Georgia attorney faces up to 20 years  
in prison after pleading guilty in what is believed to be the 
biggest non-drug, money-laundering case ever investigated by the 
U.S. Customs Service. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hearing Thursday, Ronald A. Cohen, of Thomasville, Ga.,  
changed his plea to guilty to a charge of money laundering and 
agreed to cooperate with the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, 55, is scheduled to be sentenced April 16 by Senior U.S.  
District Judge Maurice Paul. His cooperation will be a factor in 
his sentencing, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is already helping,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Lyndia  
Padgett told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 400 people in nine countries lost more than $60  
million in the scheme to launder money through banks on the 
Caribbean island of Antigua. 
</P>
<P>
	A network of self-styled brokers and syndicators collected  
up-front fees ranging from $40,000 to $2 million from entertainers, 
athletes, surgeons, attorneys and others seeking money to start or 
expand businesses, prosecutors charged. 
</P>
<P>
	No venture capital was ever distributed, though.  
</P>
<P>
	Applicants, including singer Dionne Warwick, later were informed  
that they had failed to meet terms of the contracts and that their 
processing fees were forfeited. 
</P>
<P>
	Warwick lost $100,000 to the scheme in late 1995 and early 1996,  
court records show. She had tried to get a $2.5 million loan for a 
company called the Dionne Warwick Design Group and needed to pay 
off an IRS debt totaling $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The entertainer's attorney received a letter in February 1996  
claiming she had failed to meet the deal's requirement. She never 
received the loan -- and did not get her own fee back. 
</P>
<P>
	Another victim was Barry Brown, once a top long-distance runner  
who committed suicide in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said Cohen agreed to be the escrow agent for the  
money-laundering group in 1995, setting up a separate office in 
Coolidge, Ga., to process the escrow transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen handled 38 transactions, totaling $6 million. He received  
$109,000 in fees, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Litchman of Plantation, Fla., another of the eight  
defendants, is expected to enter a guilty plea during a Jan. 29 
court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen and Litchman had been scheduled to go on trial Feb. 1.

<HEADLINE> Agent: Worm To Decide Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Don't rush Dennis Rodman. It's tough to  
pick the best place to play naked. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's agent, Dwight Manley, said Thursday the mercurial star  
won't sign with any NBA club before next week. Instead, he will 
appear on ``The Tonight Show'' in Los Angeles, where he is expected 
to hint at what teams he would be interested in joining. 
</P>
<P>
	So goes the latest chapter in the flamboyant forward's week of  
confusion, which has included his near-retirement on Tuesday, an 
announcement he wants to return to the game on Wednesday and a 
declaration on his Web site that he wouldn't mind playing overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	His Web site message also included a renewed promise to finish  
his career the way he described it in his bestselling book, ``Bad 
As I Wanna Be'': to run off the court naked after his last game. 
</P>
<P>
	Manley was in Salt Lake on Thursday for a press conference with  
another of his players, Rodman's wrestling opponent, Karl Malone. 
But Manley kept one ear on the Mailman's words and another on his 
constantly ringing cellular phone, fielding what he said were 
inquiries from teams about Rodman's services. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been getting a ton of calls,'' Manley said, though he  
declined to name specific teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Manley wouldn't confirm it, Rodman seems to be waiting to  
see what teams strike out in the free-agent market. The 37-year-old 
would then be a prized commodity for a number of contenders looking 
to improve their rosters. 
</P>
<P>
	Manley flew to Toronto late Thursday to discuss a contract for  
another client, Doug Christie, with Raptors officials. After a 
breakfast meeting in Canada, the agent said he would return to Los 
Angeles today and speak with Rodman after he appeared on ``The 
Tonight Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was learning things about the situation from reading the  
papers this morning,'' said Manley, who said he last spoke with 
Rodman on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been rumored since last season that Rodman would be  
interested in joining the Lakers, and living in Los Angeles would 
obviously suit his style. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Lakers say they aren't interested, and the Knicks  
general manager Ernie Grunfeld said Thursday that any talk of 
Rodman coming to New York was ``wild rumors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manley indicated that interest in Rodman likely will only  
increase after Thursday's free agent-signing derby calms down. The 
Bulls may even want Rodman back in Chicago, but their status as a 
non-contender makes it unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been reviewing my options,'' Rodman wrote in his Web site  
message, ``and those options still include playing in the NBA this 
season with a contender. Chicago, New York and L.A. are all cities 
I'd like to play in. Playing overseas could be pretty cool, too.''

<HEADLINE> Democratic Fund-Raiser Fined by FEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Election Commission has fined  
Democratic fund-raiser Howard Glicken $40,000 for soliciting 
campaign donations from a foreigner and arranging a contribution in 
a phony name. 
</P>
<P>
	Glicken, a Miami business executive and friend of Vice President  
Al Gore, agreed to the civil penalty in November. The FEC fine was 
announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors July 20 in a deal with the  
Justice Department's campaign finance task force. U.S. District 
Judge Henry Kennedy fined him another $80,000, put him on 18 months 
probation and ordered him to do 500 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	Both of Glicken's crimes involved an April 1993 contribution of  
$20,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. When he 
pleaded guilty, Glicken said he knew at the time he was soliciting 
money from a foreign national, German developer Thomas Kramer, and 
that it was illegal for foreign nationals to contribute to U.S. 
political campaigns. He also admitted telling the contributor to 
have another person make out the check and reimburse that person. 
</P>
<P>
	The FEC fined Kramer a record $323,000 for making $418,600 in  
illegal campaign contributions to Republican and Democratic 
federal, state and local parties and candidates in 1993 and 1994.

<HEADLINE> Police: Prank Led to Strip Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FARGO, N.D. (AP) -- A caller claiming to be a police officer  
talked a male restaurant manager into strip-searching a 17-year-old 
female worker, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The male caller told the Burger King manager that the worker was  
a theft suspect, gave a description of her and persuaded the 
manager to perform the search, police Lt. Scott Gilman said. 
</P>
<P>
	After finding no evidence of a theft, the manager became  
suspicious and tried to trace the call. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilman said the trace, and one of a similar call made to another  
business, produced an unidentified out-of-state origin. He said 
prank calls were made to several Fargo businesses Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Miller, a spokeswoman for Miami-based Burger King, said the  
restaurant's owner notified the company of the incident Thursday 
and will review it. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the company can't dictate personnel policy to  
franchisees and has no regulations on how workers suspected of 
crimes should be searched. But Gilman said ``no manager of any 
business should decide it's necessary to strip-search any 
employee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cass County prosecutor Mark Boening said he was unfamiliar with  
the case and wasn't sure if the manager would face charges.

<HEADLINE> Chiefs Hire Cunningham As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Gunther Cunningham, the defensive  
coordinator behind Kansas City's usually tough defense, was 
promoted to head coach today. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham replaces Marty Schottenheimer, who won 101 games in  
10 years with the Chiefs but resigned unexpectedly on Jan. 11 
following a troubled 7-9 campaign, his first losing season in 15 
years as a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gunther has an unbelievable worth ethic,'' Chiefs  
president-general manager Carl Peterson said at a news conference. 
``Gunther is a player's coach, they listen to him and they respect 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will get in their face when they need it, he will get them  
to respond ... he does it for one reason, he wants them to be the 
best they can be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham thanked Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt and then said, ``the  
last 24 hours have probably been the most interesting 24 hours I've 
spent in my life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this last season the Chiefs lost their way a little.  
It's like walking in a forest, and the Chiefs took the wrong 
path.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham has been an NFL assistant for 17 seasons, the past  
four with the Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City's defense had been a strength during Cunningham's  
tenure until this year's 7-9 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called Marty this morning,'' Peterson said. ``Marty was  
ecstatic with this decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham said he naturally would concentrate on the defense,  
but knew that the Chiefs would be able to move the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have spent these many years concentrating on how to stop  
them,'' Cunningham said. ``But there is no doubt in my mind that I 
know how to move the football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham began his coaching career at Oregon, his alma mater,  
in 1969 and became a pro coach with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the 
Canadian Football League in 1981. He was an assistant with the 
Colts, San Diego Chargers and Los Angeles Raiders before joining 
Schottenheimer's staff in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham also had interviewed for the Chicago Bears' job.  
</P>
<P>
	Under Cunningham, the Chiefs' defense led the NFL in fewest  
points allowed in 1995 and 1997 but slipped last season amid an 
epidemic of injuries and poor play that doomed the Chiefs to their 
first losing season since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham is one of the most popular assistant coaches in the  
10-year Schottenheimer/Peterson era. He can be gruff; when he 
becomes impatient, his voice can be heard from one end of the 
practice field to another. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Germany, Cunningham came to the United States as a  
youngster after his mother married an American serviceman. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham will be taking over a troubled team that set an NFL  
record for penalties and penalty yardage and was also plagued with 
obvious disciplinary problems. The low point in a year when many 
expected the Chiefs to challenge for the AFC championship came on 
Nov. 16 and got star linebacker/defensive end Derrick Thomas 
suspended for one game. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 30-7 Monday night loss to Denver, the Chiefs had an  
emotional and mental meltdown and committed five personal fouls on 
the Broncos' final TD drive. The next day, linebacker Wayne Simmons 
was waived and Thomas, a nine-time Pro Bowl selection, was 
suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt called the entire episode ``a disgrace'' and Schottenheimer  
said he had never been so embarrassed in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	That game, however, seemed to personify the entire season for a  
character-deficient team that started out 4-1 but then lost eight 
of its last 11, including a six-game losing streak.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Oil Rig Count at 55-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- In another bad sign for the struggling oil  
business, the number of oil and gas rigs operating in the United 
States has fallen to the lowest level since a well-known industry 
watcher began keeping count in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline in the number of rigs to 588 this week, below the  
previous record low of 596 set in June 1992, was a new danger 
signal for an industry that has been walloped by a sharp decline in 
price for crude. During the same week last year, a total of 996 
rigs were operating. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it's as low as it is now, we're a pretty anemic  
industry,'' said John Bell, owner of a small independent oil 
company in the West Texas town of Kermit. ``We're about as 
unhealthy as we can get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston-based toolmaker Baker Hughes Inc. has kept track of the  
count since 1944. The tally peaked at 4,530 on Dec. 28, 1981, 
during the height of the oil boom. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony McAloon, director of market research at Baker Hughes, said  
there are probably fewer rigs looking for oil and gas in the 
country now than at any time since the heady oil boom town days of 
the early 1900s, when accurate counts were not available. 
</P>
<P>
	McAloon said he expects the U.S. oil industry to bottom out some  
time this year. ``To find oil in the United States is more 
expensive than to find it in various international markets, and so 
although international locations can survive with low oil prices, 
many U.S. producers cannot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for oil have plunged to their lowest levels in more than  
a decade as demand withers from suffering Asian economies and 
oil-producing nations continue to churn out crude despite a huge 
oversupply in world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, the world's second-largest oil producer  
after Saudi Arabia, the crisis has prompted companies to lay off 
workers, slash expenses and cut back or completely eliminate 
drilling projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil has always been a cyclical industry for workers and this  
bust cycle is actually not as bad as some others because many oil 
states have diversified their economies. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, in the Houston area alone, about 4,200 oil industry  
workers lost their jobs in 1998, including 2,500 positions in 
exploration and production, Texas Workforce Commission data show. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, the number of rigs is directly linked to the  
number of jobs in the oil patch,'' said Morris Burns, executive 
vice president of the Permian Basin Petroleum Association, with 
1,200 members in Texas and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the service industries -- people selling pipe, mud,  
engineers, geologists -- all of these people are working when the 
rigs are running and they're not when the rigs stop,'' Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
	Larger oil companies -- most notably Exxon and Mobil -- are  
merging to help them weather the storm. But for the country's 
smaller producers, cutting back is the only answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've cut every cost except laying people off, and I'm not  
saying that won't happen,'' said oilman E.W. Carter, who has 10 
employees at his tiny company in Osage County, Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just adding to a bleeding ulcer,'' Carter said of the  
record-low rig count. ``It's another story of how bad it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All this does little to faze gasoline buyers who are enjoying  
the low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the devil was delivering the gasoline in a pickup truck,  
people wouldn't care as long as it's cheap,'' said Randy Morgan of 
Dallas at a gas station offering regular unleaded at 99 cents a 
gallon. ``We don't care until it goes up to $1.40.''

<HEADLINE> Why Is Trade Deficit So High? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the U.S. economy sailing through its  
longest peacetime expansion ever, economists are agonizing over a 
rapid growth in the nation's trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans, who last year benefited from the lowest unemployment  
rate since 1969, 4.5 percent, may well wonder what's going on and 
whether it matters. Here, in question-and-answer form, is a look at 
the U.S. trade situation: 
</P>
<P>
	Q: How big is the deficit?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Based on the first 11 months of last year, it should total a  
record $168 billion, up from $110 billion in 1997. Economists 
predict it will rise to between $220 billion and $230 billion this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Why is the trade deficit so high?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Because, in the words of Commerce Undersecretary David Aaron:  
``The United States economy is very strong in a world which tends 
to be a lot less strong.'' In short, American consumers have money 
to satisfy their appetites for imported goods ranging from cars to 
shoes. Foreign buyers, particularly in Asia and Latin America, 
don't. For example, airlines in Asia have had to cancel orders with 
Boeing Co. because Asians are traveling less. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Why else?  
</P>
<P>
	A: The dollar is strong. Other currencies, from Thailand's baht  
to Brazil's real, are not. That means foreigners are selling their 
goods at bargain prices, in dollars. American-made goods, in their 
currencies, are costly. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What does that mean for the U.S. economy?  
</P>
<P>
	A: In the short run, it helps keep inflation under control, and  
that, in turn, helps keep interest rates low. Rates on home 
mortgages have held under 7 percent for seven months. It also means 
Americans can buy all the goods they want without putting so much 
pressure on labor markets that wage increases accelerate to 
inflationary levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Any other benefits?  
</P>
<P>
	A: It's about the only bright spot for many struggling  
economies. Think of it as a way for the United States to keep its 
allies afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What happens to the dollars Americans spend on imports?  
</P>
<P>
	A: They come back to the United States in the form of  
investment. Foreigners purchase U.S. securities such as corporate 
stocks and Treasury bills. That, too, keeps interest rates low and 
supports stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: So what's the problem?  
</P>
<P>
	A: A rapidly growing trade deficit hurts Americans who depend on  
export sales for their livelihood, such as soybean farmers, or who 
compete against foreign imports, such as steelworkers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a steel producer, of course you're unhappy. You're  
losing your job,'' said economist Robert Dederick of Northern Trust 
Co. in Chicago. ``If you're a steel consumer, you're happy because 
the price is lower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 10,000 steelworkers have lost their jobs. Job cuts last  
year totaled more than 200,000 in all manufacturing industries. 
Their loss of income and subsequent drop in spending eventually 
could hurt workers in businesses that have little or nothing to do 
with foreign trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Is that all?  
</P>
<P>
	A: No. Growing foreign ownership of U.S. securities means  
profits on those securities -- interest, dividends, capital gains -- 
benefit foreigners. That means a growing share of the income on 
what Americans produce goes overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, foreigners' appetite for dollars isn't inexhaustible.  
Sooner or later, when the U.S. economy weakens or their economies 
strengthen, or both, they won't be so eager to invest in U.S. 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What happens then?  
</P>
<P>
	A: The value of the dollar could dip, even plummet. If so, it  
could touch off a vicious cycle: U.S. interest rates would rise 
sharply, slowing or killing the economic expansion, and the 
American stock market could crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the short run, there doesn't seem to be a problem. But,  
certainly, in the long run this cannot continue indefinitely,'' 
said economist Sung Won Sohn of Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. in Minneapolis. 
``At some point it will be a burden on our children and 
grandchildren.''

<HEADLINE> Muti Makes N.Y. Philharmonic Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After three decades as a top international  
conductor, Riccardo Muti finally made his New York Philharmonic 
debut with a performance that was both stunning and a bit 
disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
	Muti, 57, has been music director of the La Scala opera house in  
Milan, Italy, since 1986 and is known in the United States 
primarily for his performances with the Philadelphia Orchestra, 
which hired him as its music director from 1980-92. 
</P>
<P>
	His hair is still jet black, and while he is short and slim, he  
remains a giant presence on the podium. As always, the question is 
whether his conducting -- which is technically outstanding and 
brings out polished playing -- would be as cold as the stare in his 
sharklike eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday night's program at Avery Fisher Hall -- it will be  
repeated three more times -- had three vastly different composers, 
starting with Brahms' Serenade No. 1, continuing with four 
orchestra excerpts from Busoni's ``Turandot'' and concluding with 
Ravel's familiar ``Bolero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was in ``Bolero'' where Muti was most effective. The piece --  
one melody that repeats over and over, being passed from woodwinds 
to brass to strings and intensifying as it progresses -- does not 
need much emotion, providing it in the music, much like an opera 
score. 
</P>
<P>
	With Muti, the music flowed from section to section and ended in  
a thunderous chord that brought many in the house leaping to their 
feat immediately following the final note. 
</P>
<P>
	Busoni's ``Turandot'' -- the pieces heard were composed in 1905 --  
is not nearly as well known as Puccini's final opera, written 
nearly 20 years later and a central part of today's standard 
repertory. 
</P>
<P>
	While it was interesting, it also was clear why Muti is  
primarily an opera conductor. His devotion to the original text -- 
some have called it slavish devotion -- leaves a somewhat steely 
interpretation unless voices are there to provide color and warmth. 
</P>
<P>
	All in all, it was a satisfying debut. Guest conducting is a  
difficult chore, with the maestro given little time to rehearse an 
orchestra. With whatever time he did have, Muti managed to impart 
some of his style. Additional programs are needed to determine how 
he and this orchestra mix.

<HEADLINE> Nilsson Gets Brewers and Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- David Nilsson would be able to play in the 2000  
Olympic games in his native Australia under terms of a contract 
reached with the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal allows the Brewers to spread the money they owe Nilsson  
over three years. In exchange, the team exercised the buyout of his 
contract for 2000 at his request. 
</P>
<P>
	``David will be free to make a decision as to whether he plays  
for Australia in the Olympics,'' agent Alan Nero said Thursday. 
``David is a very complex person with a lot of agendas, and this is 
one of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nilsson, 29, a catcher-first baseman, signed a contract before  
the 1997 season that would have paid him $4.7 million this season 
with a club option for $5.5 million in 2000, protected by a $1.5 
million buyout, according to a report today in the Milwaukee 
Journal Sentinel. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers exercised the buyout in advance, which brought the  
total they owe Nilsson to $6.2 million. The sum will be paid over a 
three-year period, reducing the team's payment this year to just 
over $2 million instead of $4.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The timing was perfect for us,'' Brewers general manager Sal  
Bando said. ``It helped our cash flow and allowed David to be a 
free agent in 2000. They were the ones who approached us with the 
idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nero said Nilsson wants to keep open the option to play in the  
2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. He might have to sit out the 2000 
season because the Olympics are in September of that year and teams 
might be reluctant to let a player take time off during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	After undergoing double knee surgery, Nilsson was limited to 102  
games last year. He hit .269 in 309 at-bats with 12 home runs and 
56 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Nilsson unveiled plans to purchase the struggling  
Australian Baseball League, a professional circuit that plays games 
from October to February. Nilsson would reduce the league from 
eight to six teams and add two Asian teams to begin play next 
October as the International Baseball League Australia.

<HEADLINE> Is There Etiquette for Cell Phones? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The bbrrrrring! during a play at Ford's  
Theatre wasn't part of the script. It was a cell phone call to a 
woman down front. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hello,'' the woman answered, and to the audience's chagrin,  
kept on yakking. ``Hang up!'' a child shouted. Instead, the woman 
got up and chatted all the way up the aisle. 
</P>
<P>
	As the number of cell phone customers in the United States has  
grown -- it's now at 66 million -- so has annoyance at people who use 
their cell phones at movies, in restaurants, at the gym, hair 
salons -- even at church. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really is very thoughtless of people,'' said etiquette  
doyen Letitia Baldridge. ``It's just an invasion of other people's 
privacy and quiet time. What's sad is that people don't realize 
they are being rude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that's a manners no-no, etiquette experts say.  
</P>
<P>
	Even when people talk on cell phones in the privacy of their  
cars -- which can be dangerous -- it annoys etiquette experts. They 
think most of the incessant chatter is a status thing and could 
just as easily take place on home or office phones. They do make 
two exceptions: for emergencies and for brief calls to apologize if 
running late. 
</P>
<P>
	But a man in a Bethesda, Md., hair salon was doing neither  
recently as he talked away while his hair was being washed and cut, 
said Lynn McReynolds, a customer. ``I felt sorry for the poor woman 
trying to cut his hair,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baldridge was appalled when a man's cell phone went off at  
church. But the priest saw it differently: ``He said, `I'd rather 
have that young man here on his cell than not attending.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, people should turn off their phones before  
entering churches, movie houses or restaurants, etiquette experts 
say -- or at the very least, excuse themselves and take the call in 
the cloakroom, lobby or near public phones. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorothea Johnson of The Protocol School of Washington said an  
outing with a friend at an upscale restaurant was recently spoiled 
when a woman at the next table talked incessantly -- and loudly -- on 
her phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Many other customers turned around and glared, but that didn't  
stop the woman from taking two more calls. ``There was no regard 
whatsoever for anybody else in that room,'' Johnson says. 
</P>
<P>
	She suggests complaining to a waiter or a theater usher rather  
than confronting the caller directly. 
</P>
<P>
	Baldridge offers different advice. ``I would lean over and  
whisper, 'Would you be terribly nice, incredibly kind and finish 
that conversation so we can hear the play or the movie?' If you 
just use a lot of sugar sweetness, you'll disarm the person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Whittington, who manages a Washington movie theater, says  
that when customers complain about cell phone users, managers will 
ask the person to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have kids, it's a status kind of thing,'' said Whittington.  
``Last year when we had the `Star Wars' trilogy, we had long lines 
and people were calling when they got in the theater and said: 
`Hey, I'm in the theater.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In one case, though, moviegoers at a different theater benefited  
from a man with a cell phone: When the film was out of focus, he 
called management. 
</P>
<P>
	At gyms, fitness buffs chat on cell phones while on treadmills,  
Stairmasters, even doing weights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how important these people really are, but they  
make themselves seem really important,'' said Petr Speight, program 
director for a Gold's Gym here. 
</P>
<P>
	Even President Clinton is not immune.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, as he stood to give his official toast at a  
White House state dinner for Argentine President Carlos Menem, it 
happened: Bbrrrrring!

<HEADLINE> Hastert Has Close Inner Circle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The new House speaker, Dennis Hastert, is  
breaking tradition in one important respect: He has a relatively 
small circle of trusted advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends say the Illinois Republican's inner circle differs from  
that of predecessors like Newt Gingrich because it involves people 
who have been at his side since the early days of his seven-term 
congressional career. 
</P>
<P>
	He even shares a Washington apartment with his two top aides.  
Hastert's wife, Jean, has remained in Illinois to continue teaching 
elementary school, although she was in Washington this week for 
President Clinton's State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	At the top of any list of Hastert's kitchen cabinet is Scott  
Palmer, his longtime chief of staff, and deputy chief of staff Mike 
Stokke. John Feehery, a former aide who is returning, called the 
Hastert-Palmer alliance ``almost a brother-type relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert's other top allies are fellow Rep. Tom Ewing, R-Ill.;  
his mentor, former House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill.; former 
Rep. Bill Paxon, R-N.Y.; and Paxon's top aide, Maria Cino. Paxon 
and Cino are both lobbyists. Also on the list are Susan Hirschmann, 
chief of staff to Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas and BellSouth 
Corp. lobbyist Daniel Mattoon. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth and its employees were Hastert's most generous  
contributors over the past three elections. Mattoon's wife, Jane, 
is the treasurer of Hastert's leadership political action 
committee, Keep Our Majority PAC. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the Beltway, perhaps Hastert's closest pal is Tom  
Jarman, a fellow 1960s graduate of Wheaton College, a Christian 
liberal arts school in the Chicago suburbs, who is athletic 
director for Manchester College in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Paxon forged his friendship with Hastert soon after he entered  
Congress 10 years ago, and Hastert helped him get a seat on the 
House Commerce Committee. But it was their shared passion for 
antique cars, more than similar legislative goals or their vision 
for a Republican majority, that cemented their friendship and is a 
frequent dinner topic still. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of all of the major political leaders I know, Denny has the  
healthiest situation,'' Paxon said. ``He has a small group of true 
confidants, staff and outside friends, but he also has an 
incredible capacity to count a wide number of people as his 
friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A common thread among Hastert's inner circle is that friendship  
counts more than politics, the result of Hastert's Midwestern, 
no-frills roots and his desire to maintain balance between the 
personal and the professional. That definitely sets Hastert apart 
from most fellow members of the powerful set in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Hastert built a reputation as a mild-mannered  
consensus-builder through four years as the House Republicans' No. 
2 vote-counter. This means he also knows a diverse group of people 
to consult if wants to go outside the inner circle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Denny is somewhat unique as a speaker in that he brings a  
broader aquaintanceship with him,'' said Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., 
who managed Hastert's campaign for speaker. ``You can't just box 
him in with a few names.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert's speakership is expected to return to a heavy reliance  
on committee chairmen, deepening the already strong relationships 
he has with many of them, and on Republican lawmakers of all 
stripes -- from telegenic conservative firebrand Steve Largent of 
Oklahoma to low-key Fred Upton of Michigan, a member of a group of 
Republican moderates known as the Tuesday Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert will, of course, look to other members of the GOP  
leadership team -- especially DeLay, with whom he shared staff, 
office space and history as the manager of the combative Texan's 
1994 leadership campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends say Hastert will not hesitate to listen to a broad range  
of people, ``constantly databanking information,'' as Paxon put it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the circumstances and the situation, he turns to those  
who have the most knowledge on the subject,'' said Hastert's 
spokesman Pete Jeffries.

<HEADLINE>  Barnett's Heart Is in Colorado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Gary Barnett had plenty of suitors trying  
to lure him from Northwestern the past seven years, and one by one 
he turned them down. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA. Texas. Notre Dame. Georgia. None made the grade.  
</P>
<P>
	The University of Colorado finally offered Barnett something the  
others couldn't -- the chance to come home. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision to come to Colorado was easy because it's home,''  
Barnett said Friday as he was introduced as Colorado's football 
coach. ``It is where my roots are, it is where Mary and I started. 
It is where our children were born, and it has been a dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett, 52, replaces Rick Neuheisel, who left Colorado this  
month when Washington offered to pay him more than $1 million a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	News of Neuheisel's departure made Mary Barnett think about a  
possible return to Colorado, where and she and her husband lived 
from 1971-91. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a phone call from Gary, and I must admit my heart leaped  
a little bit,'' Mary Barnett said, ``but in this profession, 
there's so many things that go on, you never really know what's 
really real and what's not. Until things are done, I try real hard 
to stay calm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Barnetts' resolve was tested as initial negotiations with  
Colorado athletic director Dick Tharp broke down, and the Buffs 
turned their attention to Denver Broncos offensive coordinator Gary 
Kubiak. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubiak withdrew from consideration last Sunday, returning the  
focus to the Barnetts in Evanston, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the first thing that came to my mind was how much I  
really did want this job,'' Barnett said when asked about seeing 
Colorado pursue Kubiak. ``It brought it into very, very clear 
perspective to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Colorado law prevents state employees from signing  
multiyear contracts, Barnett was one of six exemptions allowed at 
the university. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Board of Regents unanimously approved Barnett's  
five-year contract that will pay him $710,000 per season. Barnett's 
salary at Northwestern was about $480,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Because he had an 11-year contract with the Wildcats, Barnett  
will have to cover the school's $250,000 buyout clause. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a significant financial sacrifice -- a significant  
financial sacrifice for me to do this,'' Barnett said. ``It 
probably wasn't one that my financial adviser would tell me to do. 
It was just one of those things that's right in your heart, and you 
do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Northwestern, Barnett promised to take the ``Purple to  
Pasadena'' -- a reference to the Wildcats' four-decade absence from 
the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	He fulfilled that promise in 1995, completing a remarkable  
resurrection at Northwestern. Though the task is not as daunting at 
Colorado, Barnett's goal in Boulder is to ``Return to Dominance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I brought that up to our players yesterday, and I asked them  
if they knew what `RTD' meant, and they said it was the bus that 
went downtown,'' Barnett said. ``RTD is going to be the return to 
dominance of the Colorado football program. I want to play my part 
in doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After being presented with a leather Colorado letterman's  
jacket, Barnett said his top priority is meeting recruits who have 
committed to Colorado and visiting the home of each player 
returning next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is going to take me between now and June to get done,''  
Barnett said. ``But that relationship that they had with the coach 
that recruited them and the head coach that was here at the time 
has been lost. That is a very sensitive item.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In seven seasons at Northwestern, Barnett compiled a 35-45-1  
record and took the Wildcats to two bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, Barnett was a Colorado assistant under Bill  
McCartney from 1984-91, serving as the quarterbacks coach for the 
Buffs team that went 11-1-1 to earn a share of the 1990 national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett had an 8-11-1 record in two seasons as coach at Fort  
Lewis College in Durango, and he spent 11 seasons as an assistant 
and head coach at Air Academy High School in Colorado Springs.

It is where our children were born, and it has been a dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett, 52, replaces Rick Neuheisel, who left Colorado this  
month when Washington offered to pay him more than $1 million a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	News of Neuheisel's departure made Mary Barnett think about a  
possible return to Colorado, where and she and her husband lived 
from 1971-91. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a phone call from Gary, and I must admit my heart leaped  
a little bit,'' Mary Barnett said, ``but in this profession, 
there's so many things that go on, you never really know what's 
really real and what's not. Until things are done, I try real hard 
to stay calm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Barnetts' resolve was tested as initial negotiations with  
Colorado athletic director Dick Tharp broke down, and the Buffs 
turned their attention to Denver Broncos offensive coordinator Gary 
Kubiak. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubiak withdrew from consideration last Sunday, returning the  
focus to the Barnetts in Evanston, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the first thing that came to my mind was how much I  
really did want this job,'' Barnett said when asked about seeing 
Colorado pursue Kubiak. ``It brought it into very, very clear 
perspective to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Colorado law prevents state employees from signing  
multiyear contracts, Barnett was one of six exemptions allowed at 
the university. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Board of Regents unanimously approved Barnett's  
five-year contract that will pay him $710,000 per season. Barnett's 
salary at Northwestern was about $480,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Because he had an 11-year contract with the Wildcats, Barnett  
will have to cover the school's $250,000 buyout clause. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a significant financial sacrifice -- a significant  
financial sacrifice for me to do this,'' Barnett said. ``It 
probably wasn't one that my financial adviser would tell me to do. 
It was just one of those things that's right in your heart, and you 
do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Northwestern, Barnett promised to take the ``Purple to  
Pasadena'' -- a reference to the Wildcats' four-decade absence from 
the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	He fulfilled that promise in 1995, completing a remarkable  
resurrection at Northwestern. Though the task is not as daunting at 
Colorado, Barnett's goal in Boulder is to ``Return to Dominance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I brought that up to our players yesterday, and I asked them  
if they knew what `RTD' meant, and they said it was the bus that 
went downtown,'' Barnett said. ``RTD is going to be the return to 
dominance of the Colorado football program. I want to play my part 
in doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After being presented with a leather Colorado letterman's  
jacket, Barnett said his top priority is meeting recruits who have 
committed to Colorado and visiting the home of each player 
returning next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is going to take me between now and June to get done,''  
Barnett said. ``But that relationship that they had with the coach 
that recruited them and the head coach that was here at the time 
has been lost. That is a very sensitive item.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In seven seasons at Northwestern, Barnett compiled a 35-45-1  
record and took the Wildcats to two bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, Barnett was a Colorado assistant under Bill  
McCartney from 1984-91, serving as the quarterbacks coach for the 
Buffs team that went 11-1-1 to earn a share of the 1990 national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett had an 8-11-1 record in two seasons as coach at Fort  
Lewis College in Durango, and he spent 11 seasons as an assistant 
and head coach at Air Academy High School in Colorado Springs.

<HEADLINE> Legal Immigration Drops 13 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of foreigners granted legal  
residence in the United States dropped by 13 percent to 800,000 
during the government's 1997 fiscal year, the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop was attributable to the agency's inability to keep pace  
with legal residency applications. The INS, whose resources have 
been taxed on many fronts, has been struggling to deal with a green 
card surge prompted by a 1994 federal amnesty law allowing certain 
illegal immigrants already here to legalize their status. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 700,000 illegal immigrants filed for legal permanent  
residence in 1997 -- up from 121,000 just three years earlier -- 
under terms of that amnesty program. Last year, Congress decided 
against renewing it. 
</P>
<P>
	INS estimated that it would have granted as many as 150,000  
additional green cards had it been able to keep pace with its 
paperwork. For fiscal 1997, which ended Sept. 30, 1997, INS granted 
legal residence to 798,378 people, down from 915,900 a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no change in the high level of immigration,'' said  
Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies, a 
Washington-based think tank that favors reduced rates of 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
	``That just reinforces the point that we've been making all  
along: That there are 900,000 or 1 million immigrants coming in 
every year -- and the 1990s is on track to be the highest 
immigration decade in history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krikorian's group recently issued a study, based on Census  
Bureau data, finding that the number of immigrants living here has 
almost tripled since 1970, rising from 9.6 million to 26.3 million 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigrants accounted for 9.8 percent of the U.S. population last  
year, double the 4.8 percent registered in 1970, the study found. 
Although at a high not seen since 1930, the percentage remains well 
short of the 14.7 percent attained in 1910. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's immigration policy is geared toward family  
reunification. 
</P>
<P>
	INS said 322,440 of the people granted permanent residence in  
1997 were immediate relatives of U.S. citizens; another 213,331 
came in under other family preferences. Refugees and asylees 
accounted for 112,158 green cards, while 90,607 came in under work 
preferences. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico was the largest source country for immigrants in 1997,  
accounting for 18 percent of all those admitted during the year. 
When other North American countries were added, the continent 
accounted for 39 percent of the total, followed by Asia, with 33 
percent; and Europe, with 15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The vast majority of the newcomers concentrate in just a handful  
of states: California, New York, Florida, Texas, New Jersey and 
Illinois.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Oil Rig Count at 55-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- In another bad sign for the struggling oil  
business, the number of oil and gas rigs operating in the United 
States has fallen to the lowest level since a well-known industry 
watcher began keeping count in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline in the number of rigs to 588 this week, below the  
previous record low of 596 set in June 1992, was a new danger 
signal for an industry that has been walloped by a sharp decline in 
price for crude. During the same week last year, a total of 996 
rigs were operating. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it's as low as it is now, we're a pretty anemic  
industry,'' said John Bell, owner of a small independent oil 
company in the West Texas town of Kermit. ``We're about as 
unhealthy as we can get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston-based toolmaker Baker Hughes Inc. has kept track of the  
count since 1944. The tally peaked at 4,530 on Dec. 28, 1981, 
during the height of the oil boom. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony McAloon, director of market research at Baker Hughes, said  
there are probably fewer rigs looking for oil and gas in the 
country now than at any time since the heady oil boom town days of 
the early 1900s, when accurate counts were not available. 
</P>
<P>
	McAloon said he expects the U.S. oil industry to bottom out some  
time this year. ``To find oil in the United States is more 
expensive than to find it in various international markets, and so 
although international locations can survive with low oil prices, 
many U.S. producers cannot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for oil have plunged to their lowest levels in more than  
a decade as demand withers from suffering Asian economies and 
oil-producing nations continue to churn out crude despite a huge 
oversupply in world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, the world's second-largest oil producer  
after Saudi Arabia, the crisis has prompted companies to lay off 
workers, slash expenses and cut back or completely eliminate 
drilling projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil has always been a cyclical industry for workers and this  
bust cycle is actually not as bad as some others because many oil 
states have diversified their economies. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, in the Houston area alone, about 4,200 oil industry  
workers lost their jobs in 1998, including 2,500 positions in 
exploration and production, Texas Workforce Commission data show. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, the number of rigs is directly linked to the  
number of jobs in the oil patch,'' said Morris Burns, executive 
vice president of the Permian Basin Petroleum Association, with 
1,200 members in Texas and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the service industries -- people selling pipe, mud,  
engineers, geologists -- all of these people are working when the 
rigs are running and they're not when the rigs stop,'' Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
	Larger oil companies -- most notably Exxon and Mobil -- are  
merging to help them weather the storm. But for the country's 
smaller producers, cutting back is the only answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've cut every cost except laying people off, and I'm not  
saying that won't happen,'' said oilman E.W. Carter, who has 10 
employees at his tiny company in Osage County, Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just adding to a bleeding ulcer,'' Carter said of the  
record-low rig count. ``It's another story of how bad it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All this does little to faze gasoline buyers who are enjoying  
the low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the devil was delivering the gasoline in a pickup truck,  
people wouldn't care as long as it's cheap,'' said Randy Morgan of 
Dallas at a gas station offering regular unleaded at 99 cents a 
gallon. ``We don't care until it goes up to $1.40.''

<HEADLINE> Sonics Sign Owens to 3-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Free agent Billy Owens, a 6-foot-9 forward who  
averaged 10.5 points and 7.3 rebounds for Sacramento last season, 
signed a three-year contract with the Seattle SuperSonics on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens, a seven-year NBA veteran, joins the Sonics with former  
Kings teammate Olden Polynice, a free agent center who signed a 
one-year deal on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens, 29, spent the past two seasons with the Kings.  
</P>
<P>
	Originally from Syracuse, Owens will be playing with his fourth  
NBA team in eight seasons. He also has been with Golden State and 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sonics on Friday requested waivers on forward-center Michael  
Cage, who was acquired Thursday in a trade with the New Jersey Nets 
with forward Don MacLean for center Jim McIlvaine. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the team signed two draft choices; 6-10 forward  
Rashard Lewis, from Elsik High School in Texas, and 7-foot center 
Vladimir Stepania, who has played the last five years in Slovenia. 
Stepania, a member of four Slovenian title teams, was the 27th pick 
in the first round, while Lewis was the 32nd selection in the 
second round. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sonics said they have renounced Greg Anthony, Stephen  
Howard, Nate McMillan and David Wingate, who were on their roster 
last season. Anthony signed as a free agent in Portland Friday and 
McMillan has retired and now is an assistant coach on new coach 
Paul Westphal's staff.

<HEADLINE> Goetschl Goes for Repeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORTINA D'AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) -- For Renate Goetschl, this win  
came at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Austrian skier won Friday's World Cup super-G and was aiming  
for a repeat Saturday. But she faced tough competition from a 
handful of contenders, all of whom consider the final super-G prior 
to the Vail world championships an ideal ``confidence-boosting'' 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really needed this result after having some bad days in the  
past few weeks,'' the 23-year-old Goetschl said after clinching her 
first super-G in four years. ``Now I feel more relaxed before the 
world championships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martina Ertl of Germany, who finished second on Friday, and  
Regine Cavagnoud of France, who came in third, echoed Goetschl's 
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	``My confidence arrived at the right moment,'' said Cavagnoud.  
``Now that I have had some top results I am aiming for a big 
objective: A medal at the worlds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goetschl, the World Cup downhill leader, won back-to-back  
downhills in Lake Louise, Canada, in November. But she hadn't 
triumphed in super-G since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``My confidence is back now,'' said Goetschl.  
</P>
<P>
	She posted posted a time of one minute, 13.25 seconds,  
relegating Ertl to second place for the fifth time this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The German ace, winner of 12 races in her career, has yet to win  
this season. On Friday, she finished just four-hundredths of a 
second behind Goetschl. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always nice to be second. But winning is much better,''  
said Ertl. ``I am going to attack tomorrow and Sunday to try to 
score a good result before the worlds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goetschl skied aggressively down the steep and winding upper  
portion of the course, but she won the race in the flatter lower 
portion where she let her skis glide and picked up more speed than 
her rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a really good run and really fast skis,'' said Goetschl,  
winner of the combined -- downhill and slalom -- event at the 1997 
worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	Cavagnoud is on the rise after clinching her first career  
victory Thursday, eight years after joining the World Cup tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today wasn't a big surprise for me,'' said Cavagnoud. ``When  
you score a good result, then everything comes easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexandra Meissnitzer of Austria appears on the decline after  
winning five races at the start of the season. She finished a 
distant 18th in Thursday's downhill and then sixth Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meissnitzer last triumphed Dec. 19 when she was fastest in a  
downhill in Veysonnaz, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Austrian, however, maintains a comfortable 244-point lead  
over Germany's Hilde Gerg in the overall standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Isolde Kostner of Italy, who has claimed four of her five career  
wins in Cortina and was a big favorite Friday, also had a bad day, 
finishing seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Catherine Borghi of Switzerland broke her left shin bone in a  
terrifying crash Friday just yards from the finish line and is out 
for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old was being flown by helicopter to Geneva for  
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	After Saturday's super-G, the women race in a giant slalom  
Sunday, the last women's race prior to the start of the world 
championships Jan. 31.

<HEADLINE> Maier Expects To Lose Overall Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KITZBUEHEL, Austria (AP) -- Double Olympic champion Hermann Maier  
knows he'll likely lose the lead in the overall World Cup standings 
before the weekend is out, but has no intention of losing his title 
at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier let his already tenuous advantage atop the overall World  
Cup rankings slip on Friday, when he crashed out of a men's two-run 
sprint, allowing winner Lasse Kjus to gain another 100 points on 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	While Maier still clings to his overall lead with 1,021 points,  
Kjus is just 69 behind, and a repeat of last week's performance 
could catapult the Norwegian past him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll probably lose the World Cup lead at the end of the  
weekend which will be a very tough thing to take,'' said Maier, the 
reigning World Cup overall, super-G and giant slalom champion. 
``But we'll see how motivated Lasse Kjus is after the worlds 
because I intend to give him a fierce fight for the overall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Norwegian, who won last week's downhill on the another  
classic in Wengen, Switzerland, also clinched the combined on the 
strength of a third place in the slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	As well as threatening Maier's position in the overall, Kjus has  
a firm grip on the downhill rankings, which he leads with 480 
points, 190 ahead of Austria's Werner Franz. On Friday, Maier 
dropped from second to third, where he is 220 behind Kjus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd also like to win the downhill title but Lasse seems to be  
in a very good position,'' said Maier, who was competing on the 
notorious Streif, on home snow, for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus continued to insist he is not in the chase for the overall  
crown this year -- with recurring illness preventing him from being 
consistent enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think about it. It's too early,'' said Kjus, who  
finished 10th in the overall last season, continually interrupted 
by illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I have to stay focused on the many races still to come in  
order to conserve my energy,'' Kjus said. ``In order to win the day 
after, you have to be fit, relaxed and spare your energy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Kjetil Andre Aamodt also improved his shot at the  
overall crystal globe, his third place finish in Friday's downhill 
earning him 60 points, for a total of 889, just 132 behind Maier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect anything going into today's race,'' said  
Aamodt, the 1994 overall World Cup champion. ``I am very surprised 
to finish second. 
</P>
<P>
	``I only trained downhill two days last summer but lots of  
super-G and giant slalom,'' Aamodt said. ``My first win this season 
will probably be in the downhill because when you ski a lot of 
downhills you start to lose your ability to race in the technical 
disciplines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus's downhill victory Friday, his second in a row, solidified  
his position as a top favorite in the coming world championships, 
which run from Jan. 30 to Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout his 10 years on the national team, Kjus has won just  
one world championship title, in the combined in 1993. He has four 
silver medals. 
</P>
<P>
	While the 26-year-old Maier has three World Cup titles, as well  
as two Olympic gold medals, in the super-G and giant slalom, he has 
not yet competed in a world championship.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Flying High After Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Eric Lindros is still skating like a man  
consumed by desire to win the Stanley Cup. That much hasn't changed 
for the Philadelphia Flyers since the start of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost everything else has.  
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers, who struggled early in the season with the glaring  
weakness of only one strong line, lead the Atlantic Division at the 
All-Star break after a scintillating streak that saw them lose only 
one of the last 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Some seemingly questionable moves by general manager Bob Clarke  
have worked wonders, and the team has embraced coach Roger 
Neilson's quirky leadership and tight defensive system. Though it's 
only the halfway point, the Flyers are feeling like Stanley Cup 
contenders again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't explain why,'' Lindros said after the Flyers beat the  
Washington Capitals 4-1 Thursday night in their last game before 
the All-Star break. ``I think it started in training camp. ... 
We're having a good time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No matter how hard or brilliantly Lindros has played in the  
past, it never seemed like enough. It appeared that Lindros would 
never be truly happy in Philadelphia until he led the Flyers to a 
Stanley Cup championship. After last year's first-round playoff 
loss to Buffalo and an inconsistent start to this season, Lindros 
was in danger of running out of time. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, Clarke challenged Lindros to play like the best  
player in the NHL if he wanted to be paid that way. The 25-year-old 
team captain got off to the best start of his career, but Clarke 
still struggled to find the right mix of talent to build around 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing was said, in my opinion, that was meant to hurt  
anybody,'' Clarke said. ``It was said as reality and as a 
challenge. That's just the way it is in this business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke started an early season overhaul on Dec. 12 when he  
reacquired Mikael Renberg, Lindros' former linemate on the Legion 
of Doom, from Tampa Bay with Daymond Langkow for Chris Gratton and 
Mike Sillinger. Then, Clarke traded popular veteran defenseman Petr 
Svoboda to the Lightning for another former Flyer, Karl Dykhuis. 
</P>
<P>
	With trades for Keith Jones, Valeri Zelepukin and Roman Vopat,  
Clarke reworked one-third of the Flyers' roster in the first three 
months of the season. Many observers wondered what ``Clarkie'' was 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	Not anymore. Philadelphia's 12-1-5 record leading up to the  
All-Star break included a 15-game unbeaten streak. The 10-0-5 mark 
was the fifth-best in Flyers history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the moves have been questioned,'' said goaltender Ron  
Hextall, at a loss to explain why Clarke's tinkering has worked. 
``There's no real reason. There's so many things involved. I think 
everybody has accepted their role. Nobody really knows when you're 
going to have chemistry or why you have chemistry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many players point to Neilson, who took over for Wayne Cashman  
late last season and was criticized for a conservative style that 
didn't seem conducive to the electrifying offensive talent of 
Lindros and John LeClair. 
</P>
<P>
	With nearly a full season under Neilson, the Flyers have  
embraced him and his tight-checking approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our team last year didn't seem to be very sound defensively,''  
Neilson said. ``We'd outplay teams and outwork them, and then we'd 
give up breakaways. You never really felt safe. We wanted to play a 
conservative game and be able to protect leads, and we've done 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The eclectic mix of talent and personalities assembled by Clarke  
seems to suit Neilson. A true journeyman coach who is with his 
NHL-record seventh team, Neilson has won his players' loyalty with 
a no-nonsense approach peppered with dry humor he reveals to them 
only in private -- on the bench, in film sessions or at practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll tell jokes in the room when we're watching video just  
about every day,'' Hextall said. ``There's a lot of laughs in 
there. He's got a way to bring a team together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros said, ``He tells jokes all the time. He tells jokes on  
the bench. He keeps things light, but when it's time to get serious 
he's not one to mess around with that, either.''

	The Flyers, swept by Detroit in the Stanley Cup finals two years  
ago, are getting great goaltending from John Vanbiesbrouck -- who 
has four shutouts in five games and a career-high six this season. 
Every player Clarke acquired has contributed. The trio from Tampa, 
Renberg, Langkow and Dykhuis, each scored a goal on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Clarke brushes off suggestions that he's tapped into  
something special. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't do anything,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	So far, he's done enough.

<HEADLINE> Man Gets Death for Triple Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHEATON, Ill. (AP) -- The last of three defendants convicted of  
murdering two children and their mother, whose full-term fetus was 
cut from her womb, was sentenced to death Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fedell Caffey, convicted last November of murder and kidnapping,  
repeatedly proclaimed his innocence before he was sentenced. His 
attorneys had argued he was not present during the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	``How I got messed up in this I do not know,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Caffey participated in the gruesome crime at  
the bidding of his girlfriend, Jacqueline Williams, who wanted the 
unborn child of Debra Evans, her cousin and his ex-girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans, 28, and her daughter Samantha, 10, were murdered in their  
apartment in Addison on Nov. 16, 1995. Evans' 7-year-old son, 
Joshua, was abducted and later stabbed to death by Caffey, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her son Jordan, 2, was left unharmed, but Evans' womb was  
slashed and her nearly full-term son removed. He survived, and the 
two boys are being cared for by Evans' father. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was sentenced to death. Her cousin Levern Ward was  
sentenced to life in prison.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Anti-Terrorism Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Warning that terrorists are seeking new tools  
of destruction, President Clinton said today he will ask Congress 
for $2.8 billion to help the United States guard against attacks 
via computers, viruses or chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The enemies of peace realize they cannot defeat us with  
traditional means,'' Clinton said in a speech at the National 
Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the United States has to guard against attacks on the  
nation's computer network, banking systems, power grids and other 
essential services. Similarly, he said the government must 
accelerate research and development into defenses against germ 
warfare and chemical attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing everything we can in ways that I can -- and ways  
that I cannot -- discuss to try to stop people who would misuse 
chemical and biological capacity from getting that capacity,'' the 
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a cause for panic,'' he added. ``It is a cause for  
serious, deliberate, disciplined, long-term concern. And I am 
absolutely convinced that if we maintain our clear purpose and our 
strength of will, we will prevail here. We have better than a good 
chance of success but we must be deliberate and we must be 
aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat that ``keeps me awake at night,'' he told The New  
York Times in an interview, is the possibility of germ attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``A chemical attack would be horrible, but it would be finite,''  
he said, adding that it would not spread. But a biological attack 
could spread, ``kind of like the gift that keeps on giving,'' the 
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the newspaper it is ``highly likely'' that a terrorist  
group would launch or threaten a germ or chemical attack on 
American soil within the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	The president warned that any attack would lead to ``at least a  
proportionate if not a disproportionate response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan, to be included in his fiscal 2000 budget  
proposal next month, is intended to ensure the United States is 
able to defend against, and ready to respond to, any such terrorist 
attacks, national security spokesman David Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's plan earmarks $52 million to continue purchasing  
a national stockpile of medicine and vaccines to protect the 
civilian population. It also envisions $683 million to train and 
equip emergency personnel in U.S. cities and strengthen the public 
health infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	The president proposed $206 million to protect government  
facilities and $381 million for research and development. 
</P>
<P>
	In his State of the Union address Tuesday, Clinton told Congress  
that the nation must upgrade its defenses in light of the advent of 
technology and ``increased dangers from outlaw nations and 
terrorism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He cited the bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa and the  
retaliatory U.S. airstrikes strikes on terrorist strongholds in 
Afghanistan and Sudan as examples. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bombing of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania reminds us  
of the risks faced every day by those who represent America to the 
world,'' Clinton said. ``We will work to keep terrorists from 
disrupting computer networks, to prepare local communities for 
biological and chemical emergencies and to support research into 
vaccines and treatments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wants Congress to approve $1.46 billion to improve computer  
security and protect the nation's critical infrastructure, such as 
power-generation plants, telecommunications, banking, 
transportation and emergency services. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also proposed spending $1.3 billion to combat a  
germ or chemical weapon attack against Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's initiative would establish a network of  
``intrusion detection monitors'' that would alert and defend other 
computer networks in case one was stricken by a cyberattack, the 
official said. The monitors would help prevent certain federal 
agencies, such as the State Department, the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency and the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration, from being crippled by such an attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's awareness and fear over terrorism, both at home and  
abroad, have increased dramatically since Clinton took office six 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, there have been the two embassy bombings as well as  
deadly attacks in Oklahoma City and the World Trade Center in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has been reviewing the issue since the  
Oklahoma City bombing, and renewed its urgency after national 
security experts gained access to unclassified Pentagon computer 
systems during a cyberwar game last year. The access would have 
allowed them to disrupt troop movements, Pentagon officials said at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials quickly detected an attempt by a group of U.S. and  
Israeli teen-agers to break into Pentagon computers in February 
1998, but could not determine for several days that the attack was 
an act of vandalism, not foreign aggression.

<HEADLINE> Suns Still on Track for Gugliotta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Phoenix Suns, already reeling from the loss  
of Antonio McDyess, nervously awaited word today on whether they 
could land Tom Gugliotta as the consolation prize. 
</P>
<P>
	Chances are, they will.  
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the situation said the Suns remain the clear  
front-runner in the race for Gugliotta's services. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta, the last remaining big-name free agent unsigned and  
uncommitted, left Phoenix on Friday without agreeing to a contract 
and reportedly had asked to speak with Minnesota Timberwolves owner 
Glen Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	Suns owner Jerry Colangelo said he expects Gugliotta to reach a  
decision by tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns' anxiety undoubtedly grew after Taylor said he got a  
call Friday from Gugliotta's agent, Richard Howell, asking for a 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``My understanding is that they have an offer from Phoenix and  
they are in the decision-making mode,'' Taylor said. ``I said if 
Tommy wants to meet with me, certainly I would meet with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howell would not confirm that he had called Taylor, but he said  
he and Gugliotta had gone from Phoenix to Atlanta, where the agent 
lives, and had not gone to Minneapolis. Howell also said 
Gugliotta's meeting in Phoenix, which went into the wee hours of 
the morning Friday, was a good one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phoenix has a great organization. It was a very impressive  
meeting,'' Howell said. ``Tom really felt like it went well. But 
you never want to make a decision at 3 a.m.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor said he was willing to discuss a sign-and-trade deal with  
Gugliotta, or a one-year contract. But Howell indicated Gugliotta 
still was leaning toward signing with a team other than Minnesota 
as a free agent. Denver and Detroit were earlier candidates, but 
have dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns could offer Gugliotta a six-year deal worth about $60  
million. Minnesota could give him $86 million over seven years, the 
maximum allowed for a team to re-sign one of its players. Phoenix's 
offer includes a clause that would allow Gugliotta to opt out after 
five years and become eligible for a much bigger salary as a 
10-year veteran. When the two offers are compared after five years, 
and the prospect of a big raise is considered, they aren't that far 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta arrived in Phoenix late Thursday night, in the midst  
of the bizarre McDyess situation, and met at America West Arena 
with Colangelo, his son, general manager Bryan Colangelo, and coach 
Danny Ainge. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a lot of positive feedback,'' Ainge joked, ``but, hey,  
I had a year of positive feedback from McDyess, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta reportedly was close to a deal with the Suns on  
Thursday, before word spread that McDyess was reconsidering his 
decision to abandon Phoenix and sign with the Denver Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess finally signed with Denver on Friday, and with Gugliotta  
leaving town without a contract agreement, the Suns faced the 
prospect of winding up without either player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very nervous, no question about it,'' Ainge said.  
</P>
<P>
	If they lose Gugliotta, there were few free agents remaining.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking a little bit of a gamble,'' Ainge said. ``We let  
some guys go who are good basketball players but aren't Tom 
Gugliotta. That's why being on Jerry Colangelo's side is a great 
comfort, because he's not afraid. Some people are afraid in this 
business and bailed out on Tom Gugliotta. We're playing a risky a 
business here, but sometimes you've got to take a risk to get a 
break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Timberwolves agreed to terms with free agent Joe Smith on  
Friday, and it's not likely Smith and Gugliotta could coexist on 
the same team. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, there had been reports that the Los Angeles Lakers were  
interested in a sign-and-trade deal with the Timberwolves that 
would send Eddie Jones, Elden Campbell and Sam Jacobsen to 
Minnesota for Gugliotta. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta's indecision was holding up several other Suns moves,  
including re-signing free agents Rex Chapman and Clifford Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns did sign five lesser players on Friday, including  
second-round draft pick Toby Bailey. The others were Joe Kleine, 
Horacia Llamas, Marko Milik and James Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	Chapman, Jason Kidd and George McCloud all flew by charter to  
Denver Thursday night to talk to McDyess, after the young forward 
held up signing with the Nuggets at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns were awaiting for NBA approval of a sign-and-trade deal  
that sends Luc Longley to Phoenix. Longley is in Phoenix and is 
working out informally. He said he was confident the deal would be 
approved. Phoenix is sending Mark Bryant, Martin Muursepp and Bubba 
Wells to the Bulls.
