<HEADLINE> Fires Keep N.C. Town Residents Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILKESBORO, N.C. (AP) -- A forest fire in the Appalachian  
foothills kept dozens of residents out of their homes Saturday as 
firefighters battled the flames. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire had charred about 400 acres of forest, mostly on  
private land, in the area 60 miles west of Winston-Salem. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 50 homes were ordered evacuated Friday, most of them  
in Pumpkin Run, a subdivision built in the past four years in a 
heavily wooded section. Residents were allowed to return Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters continued battling the fire into the night, and  
officials said they hoped to have the blaze contained by Sunday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our forest service crews and volunteer fire departments did a  
remarkable job protecting the homes,'' said Roger Miller, a 
spokesman for the North Carolina Forest Service. ``There is black 
burned vegetation right up to many homes in this area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one had been hurt and no homes were damaged, Miller said.  
</P>
<P>
	More than 150 firefighters from volunteer departments and the  
state forest service were on the scene in very steep terrain in 
southwestern Wilkes County. They were helped by an airplane bombing 
the fire with water scooped from a nearby reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather on Saturday was sunny and dry but calm, a break from  
the 20 to 25 mph wind that fanned the fire after it started Friday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses reported seeing flames as high as 70 feet on Friday,  
said Wilkes County emergency services spokesman Neal Triplett. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, firefighters in southern Florida worked Saturday to  
contain a fire that burned through 600 acres near the edge of the 
Everglades. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's smoldering right now,'' said Wayne Luebe, with the fire  
prevention strike team for the state Division of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of that and four other fires, the Florida Highway Patrol  
had closed more than 15 miles of a rural road from Friday afternoon 
into early Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Mariners' Shortstop Carlos Guillen Hurt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) - Seattle Mariners rookie shortstop Carlos Guillen  
was helped off the field in the third inning Saturday, after 
spraining his right knee in a home plate collision with Oakland's 
Tony Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen, 23, was taken for precautionary X-rays after Charles  
Gipson replaced him. Guillen sustained a season-ending injury to 
his left knee last Sept. 17 at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen became Seattle's second injured shortstop. All-Star Alex  
Rodriguez is sidelined 4-6 weeks following surgery on his left 
knee.

<HEADLINE> Evel Knievel Admitted to Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Evel Knievel, admitted to a hospital amid  
concerns that his body was rejecting his new liver, was released 
after doctors determined he was battling hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
	The 60-year-old former daredevil had a lifesaving liver  
transplant two months ago. He said he had been waiting for a new 
liver to replace one wracked by hepatitis C he says was caused by 
years of blood transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think my body is rejecting the liver or my hepatitis C is  
coming back and overtaking my liver,'' Knievel said earlier Friday 
from his bed at Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center. ``I've been 
feeling weak and dizzy and tired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital spokeswoman Ann Lynch said doctors determined the liver  
had not been rejected but Knievel's body was ``just being attacked 
by hepatitis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was released from the hospital late in the day.

<HEADLINE> Scorer Changes Call for Red Sox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- A scoring change announced Saturday  
credited Boston's Brian Daubach with a triple and two RBIs in the 
third inning of Friday night's 4-1 victory over the Tampa Bay Devil 
Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	The play, breaking a scoreless tie, originally was ruled a  
three-base error when Devil Rays right fielder Dave Martinez 
appeared to allow a fly ball to drop as center fielder Randy Winn 
passed behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	Winn said after the game that he couldn't see the ball because  
of smoke lingering from a pregame fireworks show. Martinez said he 
never lost sight of the ball, but thought Winn was going to make 
the play. 
</P>
<P>
	When he realized the center fielder wasn't in position to make  
the catch, Martinez lunged for the ball but did not touch it. Two 
runs scored, giving Boston a 2-0 lead against Rolando Arrojo. 
</P>
<P>
	The scoring change means Arrojo allowed seven hits and that all  
three of the runs Boston scored against him were earned.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Visits Denver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, disappointed by the  
failure of trade talks in Washington, said Saturday that pressure 
from China's opponents had merely delayed its entry into the World 
Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu, speaking during a luncheon given by Denver Mayor Wellington  
Webb, said that after a meeting with a U.S. Congressional 
delegation ``one member whispered, `I am very sorry. Just wait 
another two months. I guarantee you that we will ratify that.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope we don't have to wait that long,'' Zhu said. He did not  
identify the member of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu was greeted at the airport by about 150 Chinese-Americans  
waving U.S. and Chinese flags. 
</P>
<P>
	In downtown Denver, about 100 people protesting China's  
treatment of Tibet banged drums and shouted ``Free Tibet before 
free trade.'' Police arrested 23 people for failing to obey their 
orders, and TV reports showed handcuffed protesters being loaded 
onto buses. All were cited and released, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the protesters was former Chinese political prisoner Harry  
Wu, who told the crowd: ``The Chinese come over here with a smiling 
face, but they have bloody hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu also met with Gov. Bill Owens.  
</P>
<P>
	The premier last week met with President Clinton and spent four  
days in negotiations, hoping to win China entry into the World 
Trade Organization. He offered to lower tariff barriers for 
American financial service firms, telecommunication companies and 
other U.S. industries hoping to gain entry to China's market. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, faced with congressional anger over  
allegations of Chinese nuclear espionage and human rights 
violations, demanded more concessions. In the end, Clinton vetoed a 
final deal.

<HEADLINE> Raptors Suddenly Lose Their Bite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Regarding those big footprints the  
Toronto Raptors were leaving around the NBA, they're now threatened 
with extinction. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few days after six straight wins made them the hottest  
team in the East, three straight losses have brought them back to 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden, beating Toronto has become important to other  
teams,'' coach Butch Carter said. ``We snuck up on some people, 
booby-trapped them, but right now our intensity is not what it 
takes to win these kind of games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest loss was 106-99 Friday night against the New Jersey  
Nets, the team with the worst record in the Eastern Conference. It 
was preceded by losses at home to the Boston Celtics and the Miami 
Heat. 
</P>
<P>
	And after owning the sixth-best record in the East, the Raptors  
now have dropped back into ninth place in the conference, a 
half-game behind the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a difficult time out there,'' Charles Oakley said. ``When  
we were four games over .500, everything was lovey-dovey. It ain't 
over until the fat lady sings, but we've got to make things happen 
and start playing hard again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Raptors have undergone a major overhaul in the past 14  
months, bringing in three veterans -- Oakley, Kevin Willis and Dee 
Brown -- and asking them to mesh with a kiddie corps long on 
athletic ability but woefully short of winning experiences at the 
professional level. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakley and Willis have helped solve Toronto's rebounding  
problems, while Brown has been a sparkplug off the bench with a 
league-leading 91 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined with the exceptional play of rookie Vince Carter and  
the bench contributions of 19-year-old Tracy McGrady, the Raptors 
have become fiercely competitive while turning into a legitimate 
phenomenon in hockey-mad Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the league has taken notice, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've brought in veteran leadership, and they have learned  
to accept their roles,'' said Cavaliers coach Mike Fratello, whose 
team was run over by the Raptors late last month when they were 
building their six-game winning streak -- the longest in franchise 
history -- with home wins over Chicago, Indiana, Washington and 
Philadelphia and road wins against San Antonio and Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The bubble began to burst Tuesday when Pat Riley brought a  
fired-up Heat team to Toronto and won by 22. Two nights later, the 
lowly Boston Celtics beat the Raptors by 12 at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	The common theme in the two latest defeats was an inability to  
stop the opposition's backcourt. It's a matter of hustle and 
quickness, with the Raptors unable to recover after moving over to 
double-team. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Boston, Kenny Anderson scored a season-high 23. Against  
the Nets, Lucious Harris was left wide open and scored four 
consecutive times after Toronto had pulled within three. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teams scout you and know your stuff,'' Oakley said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Teams respect us now,'' Willis said. ``They know we're serious  
and they're not going to come in and see us roll over. They're 
ready for us now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of Toronto's remaining 15 games, all are against Eastern  
Conference opponents and only two are against teams that are out of 
the playoff picture. 
</P>
<P>
	And after this weekend, the Raptors won't have another two-day  
break until May 2-3 -- 48 games into the 50-game schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people might be down on us or starting to write us off  
again, but it's just minor adjustments that will give us back that 
winning feeling,'' said Carter, the rookie. ``People are bringing 
their `A-game' now, and we have to be ready for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In order to make the playoffs, Toronto will need to win at least  
eight of those 15 games -- and maybe as many as 10 or 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight will be against Philadelphia, New York, Cleveland and  
Milwaukee -- the teams bunched up along with Toronto fighting for 
the lowest three seeds in the East. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have the experience of being in a situation like  
this,'' Oakley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just like in the Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis fight, we're  
losing the rounds waiting for a decision. But we don't have the 
belt, so we're not going to win the decision like Evander did. 
We've got to keep fighting.''

<HEADLINE> Refugees Feel Sense of Loss in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Most refugees can tell a harrowing tale of how they came to  
America, and Pahoua Yang is no exception. She was just a baby, 
strapped to her mother's back, when her family fled war-scarred 
Laos in 1975, stealing through the jungle and rafting across the 
Mekong River into Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	Yang remembers none of those defining moments of her life. What  
she recalls, and what she would rather talk about, is being touched 
by an angel. 
</P>
<P>
	Her family, Hmong villagers from the highlands of Laos,  
resettled in Gahanna, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus. They spoke no 
English and knew nobody, but a woman named Louise Blankenship took 
them under her wing. 
</P>
<P>
	``My family still remembers her as an angel,'' says Yang, now 25  
and a senior at the University of Minnesota. ``It was Louise, not 
my mom, who went with me on my first day of kindergarten. She 
taught my mom about grocery shopping and how to write a check. It's 
amazing what she did for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1975, more than 2 million refugees have settled in the  
United States, the State Department says. 
</P>
<P>
	Their changing faces reflect the world's trouble spots. More  
than a million came from Southeast Asia following the Vietnam War. 
The crumbling of the Soviet Union brought more than 350,000 
refugees. In recent years, refugees have arrived by the tens of 
thousands from Somalia, Ethiopia and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	And now there may be more from Kosovo.  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government last week offered to grant temporary asylum  
to 20,000 ethnic Albanians forced out of Yugoslavia by Slobodan 
Milosevic's forces. Whether or not the plan will go forward is now 
uncertain, government officials say, because conditions for 
refugees have become more stable in camps in Macedonia and Albania 
and because many expressed reluctance to go to the designated site, 
the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	If Kosovo refugees do make the trip, history suggests some will  
eventually become permanent refugees in the United States. What 
would they face here? History provides a guide for that, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Listen to America's adopted refugees, whether from Laos,  
Kurdistan, Cuba or Bosnia, and a common thread emerges. Even among 
those who have adapted to life in the United States -- and most do -- 
there is a lingering sense of loss of what they left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the U.S. reputation as an immigration magnet, most  
refugees ``don't want to come to America,'' says Karen Johnson 
Elshazly, director of international programs for the 
Minneapolis-based American Refugee Committee. ``All they want is to 
go home.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, Mithat and Senada Sadovic were corporate lawyers in  
Mostar, Bosnia's second-largest city. They lived in a plush 
apartment with a big piano. They took their three children on 
month-long seashore vacations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were so happy,'' Senada said. ``We thought we would never  
move anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But they were Muslims, and so they fell into the maw of civil  
war as Serbians sought control of the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Senada and the children went to a refugee camp. In May 1993,  
Mithat was forced into a concentration camp, where soldiers one 
night roused him and took him outside. A soldier placed a gun in 
Mithat's mouth and taunted: ``We will play a little. We will 
slaughter a little.'' Then they let him go back inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months later, they came to America. They settled in Utica,  
N.Y., drawn there by the presence of other Bosnians and help 
offered by the Mohawk Valley Resource Center for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	After a difficult year trying to learn a new language and legal  
system, Senada gave up hope of being a paralegal and now is 
training to become an immigration counselor. 
</P>
<P>
	Mithat, a county planner on a public bus project, often feels  
stifled by his imprecise English. ``I think my education is higher 
than my language can express,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	They have done well, considering they started with nothing.  
Together they make between $40,000 and $60,000 a year, and they 
bought a $60,000 house with a swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
	Their best friends are other refugees, and they get together  
weekly with other Bosnians. Their 16-year-old daughter, Emina, has 
thrived in school; her two younger brothers have had trouble with 
schoolwork from the beginning and still haven't caught up. 
</P>
<P>
	Mithat can discuss the war calmly, but his wife grows more  
emotional. 
</P>
<P>
	``My husband was lucky to survive,'' she says. ``Even though  
they didn't kill him, I can't forget that.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Lledes clambered aboard a makeshift raft in 1994, joining  
an exodus of Cuban refugees aiming for Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Her raft soon began sinking, so she and her fellow travelers  
climbed onto a passing boat to save themselves. A Coast Guard ship 
eventually picked them up and took them to Guantanamo. 
</P>
<P>
	With more than 20,000 refugees at the military camp, it took  
Lledes a month to track down her husband, Federico Falcon, who had 
arrived a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government was reluctant to accept the Cubans as  
refugees, saying most appeared to be seeking a better life rather 
than fleeing persecution. But after several months, amid complaints 
that the Guantanamo encampment had become less like a humanitarian 
gesture and more like punishment, the doors were opened. Most of 
the refugees eventually were allowed in to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Lledes and her husband flew to Homestead Air Force Base south of  
Miami on Dec. 16, 1994. Like many of the Cubans, they had relatives 
waiting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone helped us a lot,'' Lledes said. Her husband found a  
job for a company that sells aviation equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 37, Lledes works at the Human Rights Institute at St. Thomas  
University in suburban Miami, helping immigrants apply to become 
legal U.S. residents. 
</P>
<P>
	She and her husband have two cars. They bought a home on more  
than an acre with avocado, coconut and mango trees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to begin from zero,'' she said. ``I tell you this is  
the best country in the world, because from zero you can have 
whatever you want. There is no limit.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Just as soon as Saddam Hussein is out of power, 35-year-old  
Rebwar is going back home to Kurdistan in northern Iraq. Until 
then, he is afraid to give his last name for publication even 
though he is thousands of miles away in America. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want trouble,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	He and his wife arrived in the United States two years ago,  
fleeing Iraqi soldiers in Kurdistan, where Rebwar had helped United 
Nations personnel build irrigation systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they live with their two young children near Boulder, Colo.,  
where Rebwar works as a car mechanic. He can earn up to $3,000 a 
month, compared to about $250 back in Kurdistan. But he felt richer 
there, where life's necessities are far cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had an excellent life there: a car and a house and a shop,''  
he says. ``Here, I make more money, but I have to pay more for 
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't want to appear ungrateful. ``Many things are nice  
here,'' he says. ``And the best thing is, we're safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rebwar has faith that Saddam Hussein will be forced from  
power. And then, he says, ``I don't stay one more day here.''

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Reservation Will Be Refuge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department will announce today that  
it wants to preserve as a wildlife refuge 90,000 acres once used as 
part of the top-secret project to build the atomic bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency later this month will formally propose designating  
the land in Washington state to be managed by the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The area was a security buffer for the Hanford nuclear  
reservation, constructed in 1943 for the Manhattan Project to build 
the bomb during World War II. Hanford made plutonium for the 
nation's nuclear arsenal until the 1980s and is now being cleaned 
up as the most contaminated nuclear site in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	But much of the land in the security buffer has been untouched  
for decades and is considered to be in near pristine condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to come to terms with our past,'' Energy Secretary  
Bill Richardson said Friday. ``We created a mess there, we're 
cleaning it up, but now for future generations we want to pay back 
Washington state and that community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson plans to announce the wildlife refuge proposal at a  
news conference Saturday in Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	If the proposal clears all state and federal administrative  
hurdles, the area could become a refuge in November, thus 
protecting the land from future development or agricultural uses. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, one-third of the slope is being managed as a federal  
wildlife refuge and the other two-thirds is being managed by the 
state as a recreation area. Washington Gov. Gary Locke, a Democrat, 
said he supports managing all the land as a federal refuge. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservation groups consider the land, known as the Wahluke  
Slope, home to more than 200 species of birds and more than 40 rare 
plants and animals, such as the long-billed curlew bird and the 
White Bluffs bladder-pod, a bright yellow flower that blooms each 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	The environmentalists have been working for more than a decade  
to preserve what they consider one of the last large chunks of 
high-quality shrub-steppe habitat in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this is just a giant step forward,'' said Rick  
Leaumont of the Lower Columbia Basin Audubon Society. ``For many 
years now there's been this uncertainty of what was going to happen 
with the land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The local congressman, Rep. Doc Hastings, R-Wash., has proposed  
studying the land for development, recreation and other uses. Farm 
advocates wanted to irrigate and plant crops in 20,000 to 30,000 
acres of the slope. 
</P>
<P>
	Now with the slope moving toward protection, environmentalists  
want to try to keep 51 miles of the Columbia adjacent to the slope 
off-limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hanford Reach is the last free-flowing stretch of the  
Columbia and a critical spawning ground for salmon. It was, like 
the slope, left untouched because of the nuclear reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Patty Murray and Rep. Norm Dicks, both Washington  
Democrats, have proposed bills that would designate the Hanford 
Reach as a wild and scenic river and place it under federal 
protection.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Candidate Withdraws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen's choice to be  
Air Force secretary withdrew his name over concern his confirmation 
would focus on lax security at the Energy Department's nuclear 
weapons labs, the Pentagon said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Curtis, a former acting and deputy secretary of energy,  
had been going through final background checks, but the White House 
had not formally submitted his nomination as Air Force secretary to 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked Friday about the status of Curtis' nomination, Pentagon  
spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Curtis had recently withdrawn his 
name. A Washington lawyer, Curtis was a classmate of Cohen at 
Boston University's law school. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Curtis' record at the Energy Department was good, Bacon  
said he was involved in security matters as a leader of the agency. 
As a result, Curtis was concerned that his confirmation would 
result in ``a lengthy hearing'' on nuclear lab security and not on 
his requirements to become secretary of the Air Force, Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in Congress have strongly criticized the Clinton  
administration for not acting quickly enough to tighten security 
after learning of allegations that nuclear secrets leaked to the 
Chinese from the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The alleged leaks 
may have occurred during the 1980s, but weren't suspected until 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	When the General Accounting Office issued a scathing report in  
1977 about the need to tighten security at three weapons labs, the 
Energy Department said in its formal response that Curtis had 
``made the issue of `what the Department should strive to protect' 
a priority to investigate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics, however, contend too little was done on tightening  
security until 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second recent Air Force secretary candidate to be  
set aside. President Clinton's first choice, Daryl Jones, failed to 
win approval of the Senate Armed Services Committee in July because 
of questions about his record as a reserve fighter pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	The job has been vacant since Sheila Widnall resigned in October  
1997 to return to teaching at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. The acting secretary is F. Whitten Peters.

<HEADLINE> New Russian Scandal Targets Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Secret sex videos. Hints of Kremlin corruption.  
Money laundering allegations. A presidential impeachment debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is once again ensnarled in a messy political soap opera,  
and this time Boris Yeltsin's weakened administration is battling 
on several fronts to preserve the president's eroding authority 
from an emboldened group of rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the allegations involve high-level corruption, which has  
bedeviled Russian efforts to build a democracy and a market 
economy. The media reports it, parliament debates it, and ordinary 
citizens curse it. But few are ever punished, producing a deep 
cynicism toward the political and business elite. 
</P>
<P>
	Will there be a different outcome this time?  
</P>
<P>
	``Russia has had a lot of political scandals that haven't  
amounted to much, but I think the outcome could be different this 
time,'' said political analyst Viktor Kremenyuk. ``The days of Mr. 
Yeltsin are numbered, and this time his troubles might evolve into 
something that could end his rule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin slapped down such threats in the past, but now, with his  
fragile health and barely a year left in his term, his opponents 
believe they have enough ammunition to attack the president 
head-on. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has not been accused of corruption, but he does  
face an April 15 impeachment debate in the Communist-led 
parliament. Yeltsin is favored to win this fight, though it's 
likely to chip away at his stature, already diminished by his 
frequent illnesses and long absences from the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin is used to such confrontations with the Communists. But  
the man who makes his blood boil these days is Prosecutor General 
Yuri Skuratov. 
</P>
<P>
	Skuratov offered to resign back in February and seemed headed  
for political oblivion until he began leveling a series of 
potentially explosive allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Skuratov, who has been investigating possible bribe-taking in  
the Kremlin, announced that Russia's Central Bank hid billions of 
dollars in an obscure account on Britain's Channel Islands. And 
this past week his office ordered the arrest of two leading 
business tycoons, Boris Berezovsky and Alexander Smolensky, both 
closely linked to the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Skuratov has compiled enough evidence to cause a lot of  
trouble,'' said Kremenyuk. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin has sought to oust Skuratov, but the clumsy efforts have  
only highlighted the president's weakness and heightened suspicions 
the Kremlin is trying to cover up wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	When state television aired a video that appeared to star  
Skuratov having sex with two women, few expected the film to boost 
Skuratov's standing. But that's exactly what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was seen as a crude, ham-handed attempt to drive him  
from office, with the orders presumably coming from the upper ranks 
of the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin has suspended Skuratov, but only parliament can dismiss  
him. Last month, lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to keep him on the 
job. They are expected to take up the question again on April 21, 
and if they reinstate him once more -- the most likely scenario -- it 
will be another blow to the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone knew how powerful Yeltsin was in the past, and very  
few dared to take him on,'' said Ivan Safrantchouk, a political 
analyst at the Center for Policy Studies. ``Now people know he is 
vulnerable and they are willing to test the limits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two business leaders, Berezovsky and Smolensky, whose  
fortunes were built through close Kremlin contacts, also find their 
positions imperiled. 
</P>
<P>
	The brash Berezovsky previously boasted of his access to  
Yeltsin's family. Now he appears abandoned, fair game for his many 
enemies. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he has a sprawling business empire to manage, Berezovsky  
sought Kremlin access through low-paying government posts. Yeltsin 
hired and fired him twice in the past two years, most recently in 
March, and now apparently sees the controversial Berezovsky as a 
liability. 
</P>
<P>
	Berezovsky says the charges against him are part of a political  
vendetta, but acknowledges that he can't expect much help from the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the moment, President Yeltsin is losing power and the  
opposition is gaining ground,'' Berezovsky said in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Berezovsky said he plans to return to Russia to fight the  
charges that he was behind the illegal transfer of $250 million 
from Russia's largest airline, Aeroflot, to the Swiss company 
Andava. Smolensky is also abroad, recovering from an illness in 
Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hunting season is on for the oligarchs,'' said Kremenyuk,  
the analyst. ``The country has tremendous economic problems and 
they are obvious targets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The business elite did not use their fortunes to invest in  
Russia and restructure the economy, ``they just pumped their money 
abroad, and as a result, people see them as the enemy,'' Kremenyuk 
added.

<HEADLINE> US, China Open Agricultural Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After days of haggling over a deal that would  
lower Chinese trade barriers for American farmers, the United 
States and China finally signed an agreement Saturday that opens 
Chinese markets to American wheat, beef and citrus. 
</P>
<P>
	``This agreement addresses a long-standing concern of American  
farmers and I was proud to make their case directly,'' Vice 
President Al Gore said in a statement issued through a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	A tentative agreement had been announced on Thursday but hit a  
snag when it became clear broader issues concerning China's entry 
into the World Trade Organization would not be resolved during a 
visit to Washington by Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji. 
</P>
<P>
	The freeze began to thaw during a Friday meeting between Gore  
and Zhu that had been scheduled to last about a half hour, but 
stretched into well over an hour, administration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vice president really pushed the issue and essentially  
reopened the discussion,'' a White House source, who asked not to 
be identified, said Saturday. ``Early this morning they put pen to 
paper. It's a done deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, China agreed to lift its bans on shipments  
of wheat from the Pacific Northwest and citrus from Florida, Texas 
and California. 
</P>
<P>
	China had imposed long-standing bans on those products on the  
grounds of worries about plant diseases. U.S. producers complained 
the bans were not based on sound science but were hidden trade 
barriers. The Chinese also agreed to eliminate burdensome 
inspection requirements that had severely restricted the amount of 
U.S. beef that could be sold in China. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal brings a sigh of relief from the U.S. farm industry as  
well as many on Capitol Hill, who viewed the opened markets as a 
boon for an agricultural economy that has been severely impacted in 
the last year by lagging imports and low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The citrus portion alone is expected to be worth $1.2 billion in  
trade for one year. 
</P>
<P>
	When the initial agreement was announced during the week, Senate  
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said it marked ``important 
progress in the fight to level the playing field in international 
trade so our producers have a fair chance to compete and market 
their products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China initially agreed to the deal on the assumption it would  
get U.S. approval for an overall package that would have allowed 
China to enter the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	China had already signed separate deals earlier in the week  
covering aviation and opening up its vast telecommunications and 
insurance markets to U.S. companies. China agreed to double the 
frequency of flights between the United States and China under the 
aviation deal.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Tours Broncos' HQ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- When asked what he wanted to do during his visit  
to Colorado, China premier Zhu Rongji had only one request: He 
wanted to visit the home of the two-time Super Bowl champion Denver 
Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu showed no disappointment when neither quarterback John Elway  
nor any other members of the Broncos failed to show up for his 
visit to their training camp Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't really start next season's program until July, so not  
many players are around these days,'' Broncos owner Pat Bowlen 
said, explaining the absence of his players. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway did attend a dinner for Zhu on Saturday evening.  
</P>
<P>
	At the training facility, members of the Chinese delegation  
laughed as they took turns trying to throw the football with some 
former Broncos, and the premier joked as he got a few pointers of 
his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just use one hand,'' he was told after lobbing the football  
with both hands to former Bronco Steve Sewell. 
</P>
<P>
	After Zhu threw the football toward Sewell but hit a nearby  
television camera instead, Sewell gently tossed it back to the 
premier. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not throwing it as hard as he can because he's being  
polite to me,'' Zhu said with a laugh. ``It's because I am a 
guest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his visit to the Denver area, which included a luncheon  
hosted by Mayor Wellington Webb, a trip to Red Rocks Amphitheater, 
a tour of the Storage Technology facilities and dinner with Gov. 
Bill Owens, Zhu received numerous gifts. Among them were two 
footballs signed by the Super Bowl champs and several glass 
souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
	The premier said he was particularly pleased with the Broncos  
jersey Bowlen gave him, with Elway's No. 7 and his own name -- 
``ZHU'' -- printed on the back. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu and his delegation were given a tour of the Broncos training  
center and the premier called the facilities ``purely first 
class.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu was also told about the types of injuries that befall  
football players and shown the pads and other protective gear worn 
on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like what ancient combat warriors would wear,'' Zhu said  
as he declined an offer to try on some pads. ``I don't think I 
could handle it. I would just fall down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The premier also invited the Super Bowl champions to visit China  
when they travel to Australia for an exhibition game next year.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Chill Triggers Whine Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Southern Californians, their closets full of  
tank tops and shorts, are whining about the big chill. 
</P>
<P>
	A relatively frigid spring had residents bundled up in  
sweatshirts, jackets and gloves, and talking about temperatures 
Friday even colder than some spots in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	The thin-skinned populace in a region synonymous with sun joined  
in the question: Where's spring? 
</P>
<P>
	``I know we have weird weather here but this is too much. I like  
it hot,'' said Sharon Armstrong as she munched a taco downtown. 
``Now, I say forget about the beach. I just want to get home and 
get under my blanket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cold yes, but unbearable?  
</P>
<P>
	``Shut up and deal with it,'' said Billy Neal, 45, of suburban  
Tujunga. ``In Detroit when its 30 or 40 degrees they think it's a 
nice day. Trouble is, that's why we live in Southern California. 
It's so nice all the time. 
</P>
<P>
	A mantle of fresh snow coated the San Gabriel and San Bernardino  
mountains, where high-country dwellers were forced to install tire 
chains for trips to higher elevations. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest spring rainstorm, with another due this weekend,  
swept east into Arizona during the night leaving clear skies and 
sunrise lows in the upper 30s and 40s in most areas. Downtown Los 
Angeles reported 45 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxnard, 60 miles west of Los Angeles, set a new record low of 36  
degrees. The previous low for the date was 37 in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not THAT cold,'' said Susie Shellabarger, a receptionist  
at the Endless Summer tanning salon in Ventura County. ``But I'm 
pregnant, so I'm always hot anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just before dawn, it was 18 degrees -- a record -- atop snowcapped  
Mt. Wilson, 21 miles northeast of Los Angeles, where the wind-chill 
was 11 below zero. At the same hour in Fairbanks, Alaska, it was a 
balmy 19 with a 2-degree wind-chill.

<HEADLINE> Jerry Brown Mulls Tighter Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Mayor Jerry Brown is considering tighter  
security measures after a pie-bearing protester burst into his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jerry's very famous, he's more highly publicized than previous  
mayors,'' said Gilda Gonzalez, the mayor's chief of staff. 
``Frankly, we have been lax. Most mayors' offices have a lot more 
security than we do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a man protesting training exercises by the U.S.  
Marine Corps walked into Brown's office bearing a pie. This week, 
the same protester confronted the mayor and had to be ushered out 
by an adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	Stacey Wells, Brown's press secretary, said the former  
California governor and presidential candidate wants to remain 
accessible, and several security measures are being considered. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does want to keep the doors as open as possible,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Browns Call Couch Workout Important </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Top officials of the Cleveland Browns are  
flying to Kentucky in owner Al Lerner's jet to take a second look 
at Tim Couch and see if he's worthy of being their No. 1 pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Lerner will make the trip, along with coach Chris Palmer,  
football operations director Dwight Clark, president Carmen Policy 
and at least eight other members of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure appears to be on Couch, the Kentucky quarterback  
whom the Browns said earlier this week was in a three-man race to 
be their top pick along with Oregon quarterback Akili Smith and 
Texas running back Ricky Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't think it's a make or break day for him,'' Clark  
said. ``But it's very important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the second time the Browns have observed Couch work  
out, but unlike his session last month attended by other NFL teams, 
only the Browns will be on hand. 
</P>
<P>
	And unlike his previous workout when Couch scripted his passing  
drills, the Browns will conduct the two-hour practice session. 
Palmer wants to have Couch do everything Smith did in his workout 
with the Browns in Eugene, Ore., so he can judge the two 
quarterbacks equally. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like everything on the same table so we can evaluate them  
from there,'' Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said he plans to have Couch throw 75 passes, run a  
40-yard dash and perform a shuttle run. The Browns are also 
interested in seeing how Couch has adjusted to a new grip that 
Palmer asked the quarterback to work on. 
</P>
<P>
	``How does he feel gripping the ball, and how is it coming off  
his hand?'' Clark said. ``And from my point of view, can he endure 
this workout that Coach is going to put him through?'' 
</P>
<P>
	After reviewing hours of film on Couch and seeing him once  
before, Palmer said he isn't expecting any surprises. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there will be anything we didn't see,'' Palmer  
said. ``It will be us confirming in what we think and what we 
believe. We're going down there and we're going to get the whole 
package and go from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns have just six days to decide what to do with the top  
pick. Palmer and Clark said not to read too much into both Policy 
and Lerner going on the trip. The two got a chance to meet with 
Smith last month during the Browns' first mini-camp, and want to do 
the same with Couch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Plus, it's tough getting connections to Lexington, and I  
thought if we could get Mr. Lerner along, we could use his plane,'' 
Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, there were reports that the New Orleans Saints were  
going to call the Browns on Saturday to open negotiations about 
trading for the No. 1 pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Saints coach Mike Ditka recently said he was willing to trade  
all his 1999 draft picks to Cleveland for a chance at selecting 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Browns spokesman Alex Martins said Saturday the team hadn't  
received any word from the Saints.

<HEADLINE> Quarterbacks Big Draw of NFL Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- So much for the ``best available athletes,'' the  
players every coach says he'll draft regardless of position. 
</P>
<P>
	When the NFL draft begins Saturday, those players -- Ricky  
Williams, Champ Bailey, Chris Claiborne, Torry Holt and Jevon 
Kearse -- will wait while Tim Couch, Akili Smith, Donovan McNabb and 
Daunte Culpepper are chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because Couch and his co-stars are quarterbacks, and this  
is the best draft for QBs since 1983, when six went in the first 
round. Two of those six, John Elway and Dan Marino, are sure Hall 
of Famers, and a third, Jim Kelly, has a good shot. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand ...  
</P>
<P>
	``You're not going to look five years from now and say, `Boy,  
all these guys are great.' Down the road it might be just two of 
them,'' said Indianapolis Colts coach Jim Mora, who made a good 
choice last season by drafting Peyton Manning over Ryan Leaf at No. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	History says Mora's right.  
</P>
<P>
	Of the three other first-round QBs in '83, Ken O'Brien and Tony  
Eason, had ordinary careers, and Todd Blackledge, the second 
quarterback taken (after Elway), was a bust. 
</P>
<P>
	So while Williams, who set an NCAA rushing record at Texas and  
won the Heisman Trophy, is an obvious No. 1, he'll probably have to 
wait a few minutes at the draft, just as friend and new Hall of 
Famer Eric Dickerson did when he was taken No. 2 behind Elway in 
'83. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's draft could also be socially historic.  
</P>
<P>
	The probable first-round quarterbacks are Couch of Kentucky,  
Smith of Oregon, McNabb of Syracuse, Culpepper of Central Florida 
and Cade McNown of UCLA. Smith, Culpepper and McNabb are black, as 
is another possible first rounder, Shaun King of Tulane. 
</P>
<P>
	For whatever reason, only three black quarterbacks have been  
taken in the first round -- Doug Williams in 1978, Andre Ware in 
1990 and Steve McNair in 1995. Warren Moon, third behind Marino and 
Elway in career yards passing, went undrafted in 1978 and had to go 
to Canada to prove himself. 
</P>
<P>
	While times have changed, so have styles. Of the top group, only  
Couch is the prototypical dropback passer NFL scouts have liked for 
so long. 
</P>
<P>
	If Couch, Smith and McNabb go 1-2-3 to Cleveland, Philadelphia  
and Cincinnati, the teams behind them benefit. Indianapolis, for 
example, picks fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts, who have Manning, need defense, like Bailey, the  
Georgia cornerback; Kearse, the Florida linebacker, and Claiborne, 
the Southern Cal linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	They also could take Williams and trade Marshall Faulk for more  
picks. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion Browns get the first pick and have narrowed it  
down to Couch, Smith or Williams. Figure Couch or Smith -- coach 
Chris Palmer is a quarterback guru and it's easier to build around 
a QB. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia probably will use the second pick on a QB. The  
Eagles love McNabb and Williams, but most likely will take Smith or 
Couch, whoever doesn't go to Cleveland. Cincinnati would then take 
McNabb, although Bailey is an option. 
</P>
<P>
	Culpepper could go to Chicago at No. 7 or Baltimore at No. 10,  
and McNown, rated fifth among quarterbacks by most teams, could go 
as high as 12th to New Orleans, which has offered its entire draft 
and part of next year's for Williams. If McNown gets by the Saints, 
he probably won't get by Tampa Bay, No. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	King could go at the end of the first and so could Ohio State  
quarterback Joe Germaine. Either might go to San Francisco, which 
made a major mistake two years ago by taking Jim Druckenmiller 
instead of Jake Plummer as Steve Young's eventual successor. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is quality and there is depth, which is unusual,'' said  
Tom Modrak, director of player personnel for the Eagles. ``Most 
years, you see a choice between two quarterbacks. There's a choice 
between more now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, a lot of offensive linemen will go high -- many  
drafters believe in the ``Save the Whales'' philosophy expounded by 
George Young, the former New York Giants general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest whale is 6-foot-7 Aaron Gibson of Wisconsin, who  
entered college at 427 pounds and is leaving at about 375. The best 
may be John Tait of Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond Williams and Edgerrin James of Miami, there aren't many  
first-round running backs, although Rob Konrad of Syracuse is a 
fullback who can run like Tampa Bay's Mike Alstott and blocks 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	The best wide receiver is North Carolina State's Holt, a  
top-five pick in most years. He's followed by David Boston of Ohio 
State, with Louisiana Tech's Troy Edwards coming up quickly. 
(Boston's father, Byron, is an NFL official who won't be allowed to 
work his son's games). 
</P>
<P>
	The most intriguing prospect may be troubled running back Cecil  
Collins, who on Thursday pleaded guilty to charges that he fondled 
two women. He will be on supervised parole for four years but will 
still be able to play in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in a total of only six college games at LSU and McNeese  
State, in part because of his run-ins with the law. He never ran 
for fewer than 172 yards in three starts for the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami is interested -- Jimmy Johnson has a history of working  
with troubled players. And although Collins probably won't go in 
the first round, he could go in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	But this year nobody moves up like the quarterbacks.  
</P>
<P>
	Should they?  
</P>
<P>
	I'm always amused,'' Johnson said. ``On the surface you'd say,  
`Well, this is a strong draft for quarterbacks.' Well, if these 
first five or six quarterbacks turn into duds, then it's a horrible 
draft for quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only a good draft if you pick good players and they play  
good.''

<HEADLINE> Chevrolet Pulls Plug on '99 Monte </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRISTOL, Tenn. (AP) -- Chevrolet's struggles to get its new Monte  
Carlo on the track during the 1999 Winston Cup season ended 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp. announced that it was halting its bid to  
win NASCAR's approval of the new car in time to get it on the track 
this year, and that the 2000 Monte Carlo's Winston Cup debut would 
wait until next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Since most Chevrolet teams had been operating for several weeks  
on the assumption that the new car would not be ready this year, 
Saturday's announcement was a mere formality. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevrolet marketing general manager Kurt Ritter said that even  
if NASCAR were to approve the car immediately, Monte Carlo teams 
don't think they could get a car ready this year without 
jeopardizing their 1999 title chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot ask them to take such a risk,'' Ritter said.  
</P>
<P>
	Chevrolet's 12-month quest to get the Monte Carlo approved by  
the sport's sanctioning body has resulted in a car that, according 
to Ritter, would be ``uncompetitive on the race track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR officials elected against responding to Ritter's  
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	GM said the decision to delay the introduction of the race car  
would not affect the street version of the 2000 Monte Carlo, which 
remains on schedule for retail delivery late this summer. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WALTRIP'S LAMENT:* Darrell Waltrip leads all drivers with 12  
victories at Bristol Motor Speedway, but he isn't terribly fond of 
racing on the .533-mile, high-banked oval. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason? When Waltrip was younger, the starting fields at  
Bristol generally were limited to 34 or 36 cars. Now the fields are 
43, a number that Waltrip feels cramps an already tight track. 
</P>
<P>
	``The leader takes the green flag and the 43rd guy is in the  
middle of the back straightaway,'' he said. ``In 20 laps the leader 
is lapping the back of the field. That's not good racing.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TIME TRIALS:* John Andretti led Saturday's second-round  
qualifying for the Food City 500 with a fast lap of 123.905 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Had Andretti gone that fast in Friday's opening round of time  
trials when the top 25 starting spots were set, he would have 
earned the 12th position. Instead, he will start 26th on Sunday's 
43-car grid. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven drivers failed to earn one of the top 36 spots available  
to the fastest qualifiers and had to take provisional starting 
spots. They were Johnny Benson, Ward Burton, Ernie Irvan, Chad 
Little, Jeremy Mayfield, Steve Park and Michael Waltrip. 
</P>
<P>
	Failing to make the field were Stanton Barrett, Rich Bickle,  
Derrike Cope and Carl Long. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *EARNHARDT WRECK:* Seven-time Winston Cup champion Dale  
Earnhardt crashed his Chevrolet in Saturday's final practice 
session. Earnhardt was not injured, but he will have to switch to a 
backup car for Sunday's race, forcing him to start from the rear of 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Television replays showed Earnhardt appeared to lose control of  
his car as he went down the frontstretch, setting off a long slide 
that ended when the front end of his car slammed into the concrete 
retaining wall near the first turn. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was loose up off the corner,'' Earnhardt said. ``We kept  
working on it, but it just got out from under me. We'll unload the 
backup car and see if we can get it ready. We can come back and win 
from where we're at.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *C'EST LA VIE:* Michael Waltrip tried to be philosophical about  
damaging the right rear end of his car in a crash during 
qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're all going to look like this sooner or later at Bristol  
anyway,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Crawford Doesn't Know Baby's Sex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cindy Crawford is keeping the mystery in her  
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	The supermodel doesn't want to know if she's having a boy or a  
girl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have an inkling, don't care and don't know,'' Crawford  
says in the May issue of US magazine. ``I thought, what would I do 
differently if I knew? I'm not decorating the nursery in blue or 
pink, anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five months into her pregnancy, Crawford says morning sickness  
has helped her avoid gaining a lot of weight. So far, the 
33-year-old beauty has put on just 10 additional pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sick all day long for three months,'' she said. ``It was  
awful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, she wonders whether the experience will alter her figure  
permanently. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, I prefer nonpregnant bodies,'' she said. ``I look at  
myself now and think, I hope the best isn't over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford, once married to Richard Gere, is now married to former  
model Rande Gerber, 36, who runs chic saloons on both coasts, 
Skybar in Los Angeles and New York's Whiskey Park.

<HEADLINE> USOC Unveils Plan To Bounce Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The U.S. Olympic Committee unveiled a $9  
million plan Saturday to bounce back from the scandal of Salt Lake 
and restore public trust in the games. 
</P>
<P>
	A combination of image-building and concrete safeguards against  
corruption, the plan was announced by executive director Dick 
Schultz at the USOC's first meeting since the $1 million bribery 
scandal in Utah broke late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	From his opening reference to an Oscar night joke by Whoopi  
Goldberg concerning the perception that Olympic officials had their 
price, Schultz made it clear the games' community faced 
unprecedented problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know you've reached a new low when they're telling jokes  
about you on the world's stage,'' he said. ``It is hard to 
exaggerate the seriousness of the challenge we face and have been 
facing since the scandal began to unfold in Salt Lake City last 
November.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz noted that USOC polls had found a drop in public  
confidence in the Olympics, from 36 percent in January to 32 
percent last month, although support for the athletes and sponsors 
of the games remained high. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the new program, to be launched on a national Olympic  
Day June 23, would be aimed at restoring ``a trust between the 
people of the world and the Olympic movement, a trust that is now 
held up to ridicule by our most popular entertainers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC, Schultz said, would focus on past triumphs and future  
gold medalists to present the best image of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the heart of the Olympic dream, you discover the American  
dream -- the chance for any individual to rise above their 
circumstances and fulfill their destiny,'' the executive director 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he said, the committee would ask the  
consulting company of McKinsey &AMP; Co. to help analyze its rules and 
structure and make ``changes necessary to ensure that the USOC is a 
model of ethical and management efficiency in the next 
millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through the first half of the two-day meeting, the Salt Lake  
scandal -- a scheme to buy votes of International Olympic Committee 
members in the Utah capital's successful bid for the 2002 Winter 
Games -- was the dominant theme. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually every speaker made some reference to the case that had  
led to the expulsion of six IOC members, changes in the rules for 
Olympic site selection and creation of two elite panels to 
restructure the international committee and oversee its members 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a difficult time, an extraordinary time, and I  
hope a time that won't be repeated,'' IOC vice president Anita 
DeFrantz told the board meeting. ``It's part of our history and it 
won't go away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Garff, the chairman of the Salt Lake Organizing  
Committee, said the operators of the games were having trouble 
raising the final $300 million in their $1.7 billion budget, and 
were making contingency plans in case they came up short. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was all the fault of a couple of overzealous bidders  
almost a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I apologize for the actions of a few that have embarrassed so  
many,'' Garff said. ``I am chagrined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the USOC's budget, vibrant with $104.3 million income last  
year and an unexpected $6.8 million cash surplus, took a hit. It 
included $1 million in unexpected legal fees resulting from the 
Salt Lake scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	They also included legal counsel to help collect information for  
an independent ethics investigation headed by former Senate 
Majority Leader George Mitchell and a Justice Department 
investigation into possible federal law violations in the Salt Lake 
case. The USOC turned over more than 200,000 documents to those two 
inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, whose report placed most of the blame for the Salt  
Lake scandal on the IOC, is scheduled to brief the USOC on his 
investigation Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maine Democrat, who helped broker the Northern Ireland peace  
plan, also is scheduled to testify Wednesday before the Senate 
Commerce Committee on the Olympic scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be joined by members of his commission; USOC president  
Bill Hybl; and the IOC's two U.S. members, DeFrantz and Jim Easton. 
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch declined an invitation to 
testify. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Sen. John McCain, the Commerce Committee chairman,  
has called for testimony from one of the Olympic community's 
harshest critics -- Andrew Jennings, whose 1992 book, ``The Lords of 
the Rings,'' painted a picture of corruption and influence 
peddling. 
</P>
<P>
	The book also detailed Samaranch's role as an official in the  
regime of former Spanish dictator Francisco Franco. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl and DeFrantz have been appointed to a commission, IOC 2000,  
to recommend sweeping changes in the international committee's 
membership and structure. Also on that panel are former Secretary 
of State Henry Kissinger and Los Angeles Olympic organizer Peter 
Ueberroth. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, hoping to prove that the IOC is serious about  
changing the clubby practices it has followed for the last 105 
years, also announced Friday an eight-member ethics commission, 
including former United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de 
Cuellar and former Senate Majority Leader and White House Chief of 
Staff Howard Baker. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz said such actions, taken at ``warp speed,'' proved the  
IOC took reform to heart. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we will do the things we must do to preserve the  
Olympic ideal,'' she said. ``I believe we will do the things it 
takes to make sure the games flourish.''

<HEADLINE> Student Reunion Floods Fla. Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The road to this resort city turned  
to gridlock as thousands of black students converged for a weekend 
of partying amid controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials had predicted the traffic jam during ``Black College  
Reunion'' and had hoped to restrict access by requiring passes to 
drive to the beach. But U.S. District Judge Patricia Fawcett ruled 
Thursday that the plan unfairly singled out the Black College 
Reunion. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's reunion weekend erupted in violence when a man was  
killed and four police officers wounded during a shootout. Police 
complained that traffic was so congested that reinforcements and 
medical help had great difficulty reaching the shooting scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Black College Reunion started in 1984 as a small gathering of  
students from Florida A&AMP;M University in Tallahassee and from nearby 
Bethune-Cookman College. It now competes with Atlanta's Freaknik as 
the place to go for a ``black spring break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cruising, partying and ogling members of the opposite sex are  
the primary activities of the event, which is expected to bring in 
more than 100,000 students today. 
</P>
<P>
	Police officers, stationed Friday on about every corner and  
throughout the beach corridor, said they had made 143 arrests as of 
5 a.m. today, mainly for misdemeanors but four for gun violations. 
About 400 citations have been written so far. Last year, 329 
arrests were made and 926 citations written over the three-day 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said that so far it has been no different than the recent  
Bike Week, a motorcycle festival. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was absolutely nothing serious. We're not complaining,''  
said police spokeswoman Cherri Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everybody was thrilled with the police presence, though.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't stand all these police,'' said Brian Green, 25, a  
Miami-area resident and graduate of the University of Alabama. 
``We're just out here to have a good time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the few white people at the beach was Angel Byrd, an  
18-year-old from Orlando. Some celebrants gathered around her as 
she walked with a friend and nearly succeeded in removing her 
bikini top. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all just fun and games,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The city lost out in its effort to restrict traffic after the  
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and 
three residents sued the city.

<HEADLINE> Purdue Clinches Inefficiency Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Trying to make the simple  
ridiculously complicated, a team of student engineers built a 
contraption that puts a golf ball on a tee by way of a crashing 
miniature skier, a crossbow and a toy boat. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the machine took 54 mechanical, electrical and fluid  
dynamic steps to tee up a regulation golf ball. It won first place 
in the 11th annual National Rube Goldberg Machine contest at Purdue 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	The event gets its name from the famous cartoonist known for  
drawing vastly complicated machines that performed simple tasks. 
</P>
<P>
	Every year, student teams from schools across the country keep  
Goldberg's spirit alive by designing well-oiled models of immense 
inefficiency. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's winners were the Purdue student chapter of the  
Society of Manufacturing Engineers, who beat five other teams as 
500 spectators watched. 
</P>
<P>
	The machines were judged based on the completion of the task,  
creativity, number of steps involved, and Rube Goldberg spirit. 
</P>
<P>
	The winning machine began when a toy gopher was hit on the head  
in a nod to the irreverent golf film ``Caddyshack.'' That closed a 
switch that energized a solenoid that released a miniature downhill 
skier, who promptly crashed into a tree and knocked it over. That 
released a weight that raised the Purdue flag. 
</P>
<P>
	As the flag rose, it pulled a pin that released a ramp, which  
moved into position, causing an eight-ball to roll down and fall 
into a pocket. That turned a set of gears that pulled a lever, 
which then pulled a pin on a small catapult, launching a miniature 
basketball up a ramp into a plastic cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Then a crossbow fired, toy boats raced across a pan of water, a  
hockey player shot a goal and finally, mercifully, a tee was put in 
place and a ball plopped on top of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-place went to the two-time defending champion team from  
the University of Texas at Austin with a Texas-themed machine that 
portrayed a round of golf that Rube Goldberg might have played in 
the Lone Star state. 
</P>
<P>
	A team from Oakland University in Rochester, Mich., claimed the  
third prize, while the People's Choice Award went to Hofstra 
University of Hempstead, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanderbilt University and the University of Toledo also  
competed.

<HEADLINE> New Russian Scandal Targets Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Secret sex videos. Hints of Kremlin corruption.  
Money laundering allegations. A presidential impeachment debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is once again ensnarled in a messy political soap opera,  
and this time Boris Yeltsin's weakened administration is battling 
on several fronts to preserve the president's eroding authority 
from an emboldened group of rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the allegations involve high-level corruption, which has  
bedeviled Russian efforts to build a democracy and a market 
economy. The media reports it, parliament debates it, and ordinary 
citizens curse it. But few are ever punished, producing a deep 
cynicism toward the political and business elite. 
</P>
<P>
	Will there be a different outcome this time?  
</P>
<P>
	``Russia has had a lot of political scandals that haven't  
amounted to much, but I think the outcome could be different this 
time,'' said political analyst Viktor Kremenyuk. ``The days of Mr. 
Yeltsin are numbered, and this time his troubles might evolve into 
something that could end his rule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin slapped down such threats in the past, but now, with his  
fragile health and barely a year left in his term, his opponents 
believe they have enough ammunition to attack the president 
head-on. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has not been accused of corruption, but he does  
face an April 15 impeachment debate in the Communist-led 
parliament. Yeltsin is favored to win this fight, though it's 
likely to chip away at his stature, already diminished by his 
frequent illnesses and long absences from the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin is used to such confrontations with the Communists. But  
the man who makes his blood boil these days is Prosecutor General 
Yuri Skuratov. 
</P>
<P>
	Skuratov offered to resign back in February and seemed headed  
for political oblivion until he began leveling a series of 
potentially explosive allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Skuratov, who has been investigating possible bribe-taking in  
the Kremlin, announced that Russia's Central Bank hid billions of 
dollars in an obscure account on Britain's Channel Islands. And 
this past week his office ordered the arrest of two leading 
business tycoons, Boris Berezovsky and Alexander Smolensky, both 
closely linked to the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Skuratov has compiled enough evidence to cause a lot of  
trouble,'' said Kremenyuk. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin has sought to oust Skuratov, but the clumsy efforts have  
only highlighted the president's weakness and heightened suspicions 
the Kremlin is trying to cover up wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	When state television aired a video that appeared to star  
Skuratov having sex with two women, few expected the film to boost 
Skuratov's standing. But that's exactly what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was seen as a crude, ham-handed attempt to drive him  
from office, with the orders presumably coming from the upper ranks 
of the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin has suspended Skuratov, but only parliament can dismiss  
him. Last month, lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to keep him on the 
job. They are expected to take up the question again on April 21, 
and if they reinstate him once more -- the most likely scenario -- it 
will be another blow to the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone knew how powerful Yeltsin was in the past, and very  
few dared to take him on,'' said Ivan Safrantchouk, a political 
analyst at the Center for Policy Studies. ``Now people know he is 
vulnerable and they are willing to test the limits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two business leaders, Berezovsky and Smolensky, whose  
fortunes were built through close Kremlin contacts, also find their 
positions imperiled. 
</P>
<P>
	The brash Berezovsky previously boasted of his access to  
Yeltsin's family. Now he appears abandoned, fair game for his many 
enemies. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he has a sprawling business empire to manage, Berezovsky  
sought Kremlin access through low-paying government posts. Yeltsin 
hired and fired him twice in the past two years, most recently in 
March, and now apparently sees the controversial Berezovsky as a 
liability. 
</P>
<P>
	Berezovsky says the charges against him are part of a political  
vendetta, but acknowledges that he can't expect much help from the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the moment, President Yeltsin is losing power and the  
opposition is gaining ground,'' Berezovsky said in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Berezovsky said he plans to return to Russia to fight the  
charges that he was behind the illegal transfer of $250 million 
from Russia's largest airline, Aeroflot, to the Swiss company 
Andava. Smolensky is also abroad, recovering from an illness in 
Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hunting season is on for the oligarchs,'' said Kremenyuk,  
the analyst. ``The country has tremendous economic problems and 
they are obvious targets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The business elite did not use their fortunes to invest in  
Russia and restructure the economy, ``they just pumped their money 
abroad, and as a result, people see them as the enemy,'' Kremenyuk 
added.

<HEADLINE> Movie Images Dominate 20th Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLLYWOOD (AP) -- You might say motion pictures got started with  
a sneeze. 
</P>
<P>
	Audiences chorused ``God bless you'' when they saw Thomas  
Edison's grainy, black-and-white film of his employee, Fred Ott, 
sneezing. 
</P>
<P>
	Or was it a kiss that really got movies going?  
</P>
<P>
	A film short, ``The Kiss Between May Irvin and John C. Rice,''  
intrigued many, but one writer found the first celluloid smooch 
loathsome, ``magnified to gargantuan proportions and repeated 
thrice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some credit New York's Latham brothers and their films of boxing  
matches. Others point to the basement screening room in Paris where 
the Lumiere brothers first showed that moving images, even silly 
ones of people falling off horses, could be projected on a screen 
to draw thousands curious enough to pay a franc. 
</P>
<P>
	These pioneers worked their magic in the decade before the 20th  
century began. But their early efforts were mostly novelties, 
proofs of laboratory hypotheses, technological tricks. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1903, Edwin S. Porter, production head for Edison's Black  
Maria studio, showed what movies could be. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter's 12-minute ``The Great Train Robbery'' carried a story  
from beginning to end, and filled it with exciting action and 
clever stunts. The most startling came when an outlaw pointed his 
six-shooter straight at the audience and fired. 
</P>
<P>
	The screen went red, and women swooned.  
</P>
<P>
	If that scene was the progenitor of what the movies would  
become, we all know its descendants, all the places we've never 
been and people we've never met but swear we can remember: 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta as a wall of flames in ``Gone With the Wind.'' A shower  
curtain slowly ripping down in ``Psycho.'' The chilling menace of 
``Jaws'' that still keeps some out of the surf. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoke that choked us during Normandy beach assaults, from ``The  
Longest Day'' to ``Saving Private Ryan.'' The slow-motion bullet 
hail that finally stopped ``Bonnie and Clyde.'' The 
nails-in-the-dashboard car chases of ``Bullitt'' and ``The French 
Connection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone who has lived in the 20th century carries a portable  
library of film images, unrealities so real they sometimes crowd 
out actual memories. 
</P>
<P>
	A grapefruit in the face. A top hat and a ducklike walk. A dance  
around a rainy lamppost. A rider silhouetted as the sunset fades to 
black. 
</P>
<P>
	Let's roll the credits for this art form that is called the  
greatest of the century. Who produced and directed this spectacle? 
How did we all hire on as extras? 
</P>
<P>
	In 1908, the same year that Edison and other major East Coast  
producers formed the Motion Picture Patents Co. to protect their 
inventions, the Selig company filmed ``The Count of Monte Cristo'' 
in Santa Monica, the first major production away from New Jersey 
and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Attracted by the nearly year-round sunshine, other producers  
flooded into Los Angeles, many settling in a sleepy citrus-growing 
suburb called Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	During the early silent films, actors were not listed by name.  
``The Biograph Girl,'' known only by her studio, became so popular 
that the public demanded her name, Florence Lawrence. Thus the star 
system was born. 
</P>
<P>
	What was a star? Royalty, statesmen and great authors achieved  
fame, but they were known only as distant figures. People saw movie 
stars as endearing, comic and daring characters on the screen, and 
the desire to know more about them became insatiable. The studios 
were more than pleased to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto-born Gladys Smith, a child actress who became known as  
Mary Pickford, started at Biograph in 1909 at $40 a week. By 1916, 
Adolph Zukor was paying her $10,000 a week, plus a $300,000 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Adjusting for inflation, Pickford was possibly the highest paid  
actress ever, and she became an important force in Hollywood when 
she helped found United Artists. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon such stars as Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, Lillian  
Gish and Rudolph Valentino were filling theaters and earning huge 
salaries. Everyone, from the ordinary to the exalted, succumbed to 
the movies' spell. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is like writing history with lightning,'' President Woodrow  
Wilson commented after seeing D.W. Griffith's 1915 epic, ``The 
Birth of a Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A keen storyteller, Griffith virtually invented the motion  
picture form with his use of closeups, longshots, changed camera 
angles and intercutting. While ``Birth of a Nation,'' a Civil War 
spectacle, became the most successful movie of its time, the 
Kentucky-born director was assailed as a bigot for his portrayal of 
blacks and his benign depiction of the Ku Klux Klan. Black 
activists and white racists clashed in Boston and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The movies' power to stir deep feelings was harnessed during  
World War I as studios produced propaganda films such as ``The 
Beast of Berlin'' and other flagwavers. 
</P>
<P>
	Business was booming in Hollywood -- now freed from Edison's  
monopoly by the Justice Department. The Roaring '20s brought the 
consolidation of the business into all-powerful major studios, most 
of them controlling chains of theaters. The leaders: Adolph Zukor 
of Paramount Pictures; William Fox, 20th Century Fox; Louis B. 
Mayer, MGM; Harry, Albert, Sam and Jack Warner, Warner Bros.; Carl 
Laemmle, Universal Pictures; Harry and Jack Cohn, Columbia 
Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	In the midst of the boom, scandals taught the sad consequences  
of making actors seem more than human. 
</P>
<P>
	The wholesome young star Wallace Reid fell victim to drugs and  
alcohol and died at 32. Director William Desmond Taylor was 
murdered in his home, and investigators disclosed two famous 
actresses were his lovers. Comedian Roscoe ``Fatty'' Arbuckle was 
tried three times before being acquitted in the party death of a 
starlet. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's puritans raged against Hollywood as a modern Sodom  
and Gomorrah, and alarmed film bosses hired Republican politician 
Will Hays to clean up the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Actors were required to sign morality clauses that would cause  
their firing if their behavior brought public obloquy. The Hays 
Office enforced a censorship code over film content. For more than 
40 years, filmmakers worked within rules that prohibited anything 
that couldn't be seen by the whole family. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1927, MGM's Mayer invited 36 industry leaders to a banquet at  
which he proposed forming an academy to enhance movies' prestige. 
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was born. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, 270 movie notables attended a dinner where the  
Academy bestowed awards. Today's broadcast of the Oscars -- said to 
have been named by two-time winner Bette Davis because the 
statuette's behind resembled that of her then-husband, producer 
Harmon Oscar Nelson -- draws an international audience estimated by 
the academy to be near 1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The first Academy Awards were for silent films. But there was a  
special award that year, too -- to Warner Bros. for pioneering the 
use of sound in ``The Jazz Singer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Audiences cheered when Al Jolson said, ``Wait a minute, wait a  
minute. You ain't heard nothing yet.'' Within a year, the silent 
film was dead. Dialogue brought a new sophistication to the screen 
and made musicals possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Theater attendance skyrocketed, and studios thrived.  
</P>
<P>
	Even the Depression of the 1930s couldn't halt the industry's  
prosperity. Movies with upbeat titles -- ``The Gay Divorcee,'' 
``Gold Diggers of 1933'' (and '35 and '37), ``Pennies From Heaven'' 
-- distracted Americans from their daily woes. 
</P>
<P>
	During World War II, Hollywood mobilized all its forces. Stars  
like Clark Gable, James Stewart, Tyrone Power donned uniforms, and 
still other actors went on tour to entertain troops and sell war 
bonds. The industry made propaganda and training films. 
</P>
<P>
	Troops and war workers hungered for entertainment, and Hollywood  
produced glitzy musicals and raucous comedies, as well as films 
like ``Wake Island'' and ``30 Seconds Over Tokyo,'' depicting 
Americans' valor in battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the people's war. It is our war. We are the  
fighters,'' Henry Wilcoxon says in ``Mrs. Miniver'' in 1942. 
``Fight it, then. Fight it with all that is in us, and may God 
defend the right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	War's end brought vast change in Hollywood, as in so many areas  
of life. The year 1948 marked the beginning of the end for the 
studio system. 
</P>
<P>
	In that year, film exhibitors began to notice that their  
theaters were empty on Tuesday nights. Why? People were staying 
home to watch Milton Berle on television. Over time, as TV assumed 
its dominant place in entertainment, movie theaters across the 
nation closed, especially the downtown palaces erected during the 
lush years. 
</P>
<P>
	Helping to speed this trend was the government's decision that  
the film giants constituted a monopoly, controlling production, 
distribution and exhibition of movies. They were ordered to get rid 
of one of those functions, and chose to sell off their theater 
chains. 
</P>
<P>
	The resulting leaner times saw studios auction off real estate,  
costumes and props. Film libraries were sold to TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Striving to innovate, companies introduced wide-screen  
techniques such as Cinerama, CinemaScope, even 3-D movies (One 
movie poster gushed: ``Jane Russell in 3-D -- this film will knock 
BOTH your eyes out!'') But audiences complained the glasses 
required to achieve three dimensions gave them headaches, and the 
fad passed. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Hollywood innovation -- animation -- flowered in the  
century's middle years. 
</P>
<P>
	Walt Disney's characters, starting with Mickey Mouse who made  
his talkie debut in 1928's ``Steamboat Willie,'' created a genre 
along with an entertainment empire. From classic features such as 
``Snow White'' and ``Bambi,'' with their lush depictions of golden 
good and fiery evil, to modern fables like ``The Lion King,'' often 
carried by Oscar-winning songs, Disney introduced children by the 
millions to the magic of movies. 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't all, folks. If Disney's cartoons could be  
strait-laced, Warner Bros. offered saucier and often more 
sophisticated fare from that ``qwazy wabbit'' Bugs Bunny and his 
pals, many given voice by Mel Blanc. Later animators didn't even 
aim first at young children: Witness features like ``Who Framed 
Roger Rabbit?'' and TV series like ``The Simpsons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mid-century brought a darker time, too, as a Cold War chill  
swept through 1950s Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist  
Party?'' Those words uttered by Red-hunting congressmen still haunt 
American filmmaking. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of writers, directors and actors had joined the Communist  
Party, some briefly, in the radical 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	Some refused to testify and went to prison. Others acknowledged  
their membership and named names. Anti-communist film leaders, such 
as Screen Actors Guild President Ronald Reagan, helped supply the 
FBI with names of suspected party members. 
</P>
<P>
	The studios blacklisted suspects, denying them work. The  
blacklist lasted for 15 years, ruining many lives, and bitterness 
remains today. Many protested when a special Oscar was given this 
year to director Elia Kazan, (``On the Waterfront,'' ``A Streetcar 
Named Desire'') who had long been shunned by the Hollywood 
establishment for naming names. 
</P>
<P>
	Postwar American filmmakers began to feel creative competition  
from abroad. The neorealism of Rossellini, Antonioni, De Sica, 
Fellini and other Italians electrified audiences and critics with 
their raw studies of the human condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Truffaut, Vadim, Godard, Chabrol and other French directors in  
the late 1950s brought forth the New Wave. Their films were 
intensely personal, and could deal explicitly with nudity and sex. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1968, Jack Valenti, new head of the producers association,  
persuaded the company heads to dump the Hays Production Code -- 
which had frowned on Mae West's wiggle, outlawed words like 
``virgin'' and initially held up ``Gone With the Wind'' because of 
Gable's line, ``Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the producers adopted a rating system. A flood of sexy  
movies ensued. The X-rated ``Midnight Cowboy'' even won an Academy 
Award. 
</P>
<P>
	Many consider a period of about two decades starting in the  
early 1960s to be a golden age for American and British 
moviemaking. Among highlights: 
</P>
<P>
	``Lawrence of Arabia,'' ``The Manchurian Candidate,'' ``Tom  
Jones,'' ``Mary Poppins,'' ``A Raisin in the Sun,'' ``The 
Pawnbroker,'' ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,'' ``The Graduate,'' 
``A Man for All Seasons,'' ``The Sting,'' ``Two for the Road,'' 
``In the Heat of the Night,'' ``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' ``The Lion 
in Winter,'' ``Planet of the Apes,'' ``They Shoot Horses, Don't 
They?'' ``M-A-S-H,'' ``Patton,'' ``The Last Picture Show,'' ``The 
Godfather,'' ``Sounder,'' ``Deliverance,'' ``American Graffiti,'' 
``Nashville,'' ``Taxi Driver,'' ``Star Wars,'' ``Alien,'' ``Raging 
Bull,'' ``The Deer Hunter'' and ``Apocalypse Now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, as teen-age Baby Boomers experimented with drugs and  
sexual liberation and staged campus protests against the war in 
Vietnam, ``Easy Rider'' portrayed the counterculture -- through a 
pair of hippie bikers on the road -- and showed it could be 
profitable. The movie, directed by Dennis Hopper and produced by 
Peter Fonda, cost less than $400,000 and grossed $40 million 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Studio bosses decided there was a youth market out there, and a  
new generation of actors, writers and directors emerged to 
revitalize movies for this audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Spielberg and George Lucas stood out. With ``Jaws''  
(1975), Spielberg began his string of blockbusters. ``Star Wars'' 
(1977) established Lucas' genius for applying special effects to 
adventure. Together they created the hugely successful Indiana 
Jones trilogy. 
</P>
<P>
	As Hollywood's century wound down, industry economics shifted  
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Some major studios struggled. MGM, which once boasted ``more  
stars than there are in the heavens,'' sold its historic Culver 
City lot as it tried to survive. Nearly defunct, United Artists 
folded into the newly diminished MGM. 
</P>
<P>
	Other studios were snapped up by international corporations.  
Japan's Matsushita bought MCA/Universal and later sold it to the 
Seagram Co. Sony acquired Columbia and Tri-Star Pictures. Viacom 
absorbed Paramount, and Warner Bros. merged with Time Inc. 
Publisher Rupert Murdoch took over 20th Century Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Expenses keep climbing. The average production cost of a movie  
today is $52 million. On the revenue side, videocassette sales now 
add millions, along with ticket sales abroad. ``Titanic'' alone 
earned $1 billion, though that box office reflected some adolescent 
girls' dozen or more trips to see Leonardo DiCaprio. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether in a love story like ``Titanic'' or an adventure like  
the latest installment of the ``Star Wars'' epic, a ``prequel'' 
that uses cutting-edge technology to recast the cliffhangers of 
early filmmaking, Hollywood still relies on its time-tested 
alchemy: turning bright flickers of light and imagination into 
gold.

<HEADLINE> Military Satellite in Wrong Orbit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- A $250 million missile-warning  
satellite ended up in the wrong orbit following its launch aboard 
an Air Force Titan rocket, military officials said Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Support Program satellite was lifted into orbit  
Friday for the Defense Department. It was the first Titan IV flight 
since a spectacular $1 billion launch explosion in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The rocket performed as planned and the mishap apparently  
occurred several hours later, said Patsy Bomhoff, a spokeswoman at 
Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what went wrong when,'' she said. ``They're  
working around the clock and trying to work every angle possible to 
salvage this satellite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The highly sensitive 2 1/2-ton infrared telescope is designed to  
detect missile and rocket launches as well as nuclear detonations. 
It was intended for a 22,300-mile-high orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Bomhoff said the satellite separated properly from its  
upper-stage motor seven hours after Friday afternoon's liftoff. 
Controllers discovered later in the night, however, that the 
satellite was in a highly elliptical orbit, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bomhoff said she did not have any additional information, such  
as the specifics of the orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force Space Command is convening an investigating board  
of officers to look into the mishap. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite was to have joined other Defense Support Program  
craft in orbit and begun operating in three to six months. Air 
Force officials declined before Friday's launch to say how many 
working DSP satellites are in orbit, but stressed they were 
providing worldwide coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	DSP satellites were instrumental in tracking Scud missiles  
during the 1991 Persian Gulf war. 
</P>
<P>
	The next DSP satellite isn't due to be launched until December.  
</P>
<P>
	TRW built the satellite. Boeing provided the upper-stage motor.

<HEADLINE> Upbeat Economic Report Hides Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When people like Jerry Lobdill and Chuck Engel  
read about the U.S. economy, they grind their teeth at the 
seemingly endless stream of good news, realizing it masks their 
personal hardship. 
</P>
<P>
	Both know their story isn't told by the nation's unemployment  
rate, at a 29-year low of 4.2 percent in March, nor by the 10-week 
stretch of weekly jobless benefit claims beneath 300,000, the 
longest since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	And they know they're not alone in bridling at the picture  
painted by the broad brush of such statistics, and the political 
rhetoric that often accompanies them. 
</P>
<P>
	``These economic indicators ... mean wider opportunity and a  
better chance for millions of Americans,'' President Clinton 
declared at a news conference earlier this month, before turning to 
the situation in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Such talk angers Lobdill, 61, of Fort Worth, Texas.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I hear Clinton crowing about that stuff ... I'm just  
totally disgusted,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, Lobdill, a chemical engineer and applied scientist,  
lost a job of 25 years at the Fortune 500 defense contractor, 
Tracor Inc. In the wrenching industry shakeout after the Cold War, 
he and his family moved first to Syracuse, N.Y., and then to 
suburban Washington so he could take jobs that lasted, 
respectively, seven months and two years. 
</P>
<P>
	After four more years of making ends meet by substitute teaching  
high-school science and math and taking odd jobs, Lobdill again is 
working in applied science for a firm that makes underwater 
acoustic sensors -- but at a third of his former salary. 
</P>
<P>
	He takes issue in particular with the use of the unemployment  
rate as a proxy for the nation's economic health, because it makes 
no distinction between a chemical engineer working full-time 
earning $100,000 and a chemical engineer tossing newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Engel, 51, of Daytona Beach, Fla., is skeptical of  
the significance of vigorous employment and income growth in real 
estate. After the growth of large discount chain stores ended his 
nearly 30-year career selling and servicing office machines, he 
joined many other laid-off workers in thinking a real estate 
license might be the answer. 
</P>
<P>
	But in real estate, the top 10 percent of sales people rack up  
90 percent of commissions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes years to build a career in this field,'' he said.  
``What do you suppose the other 90 percent of the people that make 
10 percent of the earnings make? ... It has not made me even 
minimum wage for the time I put in last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The headline unemployment rate in March masked other  
disparities: blacks at 8.1 percent and whites at 3.6 percent; 
teen-agers at 14.3 percent and adults 25 years and older at 3.1 
percent; high-school dropouts at 6.1 percent and college graduates 
at 1.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Rates for metropolitan areas in February ranged from 19.8  
percent in the farming community of Visalia, Calif., to 1.1 percent 
in the college town of Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps a more telling measure of economic health is the  
under-employment rate, at 7.9 percent in March. It includes not 
only jobless people looking for work, but jobless people too 
discouraged to look and part-timers who want full-time work. 
</P>
<P>
	And even that fails to account for movement down the economic  
scale by people like Engel and Lobdill. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal-leaning  
Washington think tank, job losers in the 1980s and 1990s suffered 
on average a 14 percent pay cut in their next job. Nearly 29 
percent lost health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	And even as more people get hired, more are getting fired.  
Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas Inc., the Chicago job placement firm, 
reported more than 450,000 publicly announced job cuts in the six 
months ended in March -- record for the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Companies today have to make cuts to satisfy Wall Street,''  
said John A. Challenger, the firm's chief executive. ``It's the 
'90s imperative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's conventional wisdom that Clinton -- whose 1992 campaign  
operated under the unofficial slogan, 'It's the economy, stupid!'' 
-- can do no wrong in the public's eye because the economy is 
thriving. 
</P>
<P>
	But his would-be successor, Vice President Al Gore, will need to  
be especially careful when he talks about the economy's strength, 
lest he alienate voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because Bill Clinton is perceived as in touch with the average  
American's experience, he can get away with a lot,'' said Celinda 
Lake, a Democratic pollster. ``A politician like Al Gore will pay a 
lot higher price for saying, 'The economy is good,' because people 
already think he's out of touch with their pain.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> How Computerized GRE Test Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Graduate Record Examination will be given solely on computer  
after today. The Graduate Management Admissions Test already is 
given only by computer, and the Test of English as a Foreign 
Language is often given by computer in most parts of the world. The 
SAT is still given mostly on paper. 
</P>
<P>
	How such a computer-adaptive standardized test works:  
</P>
<P>
	A pre-test computer tutorial shows test-takers how -- using a  
computer mouse -- they can answer a question, and how to move to the 
next question. 
</P>
<P>
	The test begins with questions of moderate difficulty. As the  
test-taker answers each question, the computer scores the question 
and uses that information, as well as responses to previous 
questions, to determine which question to present next. 
</P>
<P>
	With each correct response, the computer typically selects a  
next question of greater difficulty. In contrast, if the test-taker 
answers a question incorrectly, the next question the computer 
selects is less difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	That means different test-takers will be given different, but  
comparable, questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Test-takers must answer each question when it is presented,  
cannot skip questions and cannot return to a question that has 
already been answered. 
</P>
<P>
	If a test-taker answers a question incorrectly due to a careless  
error, for example, the test-taker still has the opportunity to 
receive more difficult questions if he answers subsequent questions 
correctly. 
</P>
<P>
	When scoring the test, the computer takes into account the  
difficulty of the questions answered. If two test-takers have the 
same number of correct responses, generally the person who answers 
more of the difficult questions correctly will receive the higher 
score. 
</P>
<P>
	Test-takers can choose to either cancel the test results or see  
their unofficial scores (except essay scores) on the computer 
screen immediately after the test. 
</P>
<P>
	The official test score, with essays scored by people, is mailed  
to the test-taker 10 to 15 days after the test date. The score is 
mailed to colleges within about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	If a test-taker chooses to cancel a score, it cannot later be  
reinstated, and the company makes no refund.

<HEADLINE> Court Allows Lawsuit Against HMO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A federal appeals court has ruled that an HMO  
may be sued over the quality of health care in a case in Texas, the 
only state that has a law permitting such claims. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the ruling does not allow patients to sue because an  
HMO won't pay for a particular treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling on Friday came in  
the case of Bridgett Giles, a Houston woman whose 9-year-old son, 
Alex, died after their doctor failed to detect an enlarged heart. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling upholds a lower court judge who ordered the case sent  
back to state court. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling apparently is the first time the 5th Circuit has  
allowed a patient's lawsuit against an HMO to be tried in state 
court. In three previous cases, the court determined that consumers 
had no remedy for harm allegedly committed by their health plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal law under which the company wanted the case to be  
heard does not allow injured parties to sue for damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big win for patients who have little leverage  
against their HMOs and now have a a new threat under their belt to 
sue if an HMO compromises quality,'' Jamie Court, director of 
Consumers for Quality Care, an advocacy group based in Santa 
Monica, Calif., told The Dallas Morning News. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know this is just one case, but it has a ripple effect to  
help other people,'' Ms. Giles told the newspaper. Her telephone 
number is unlisted and her lawyer did not return telephone calls to 
The Associated Press on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress and at least 30 states are debating whether to give  
consumers the right to sue their HMOs for damages. The Texas law 
allowing malpractice lawsuits against HMOs was enacted in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Giles originally sued NYLCare in state court, saying the  
insurer failed to properly screen or supervise her son's doctor. 
NYLCare officials denied wrongdoing and moved the case to federal 
court, arguing that federal courts had jurisdiction under the 
federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, known as 
ERISA. 
</P>
<P>
	The law governs employer-paid pension plans and health plans. It  
replaced traditional state legal claims -- such as malpractice and 
wrongful death -- with a set of rules that requires employees to 
pursue their claims in federal court. It does not allow injured 
parties to seek damages and limits awards to the cost of any 
benefits denied by the insurer. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the 5th Circuit ruled that health care is a traditional  
area of state law. And it said that even though NYLCare raises a 
federal law defense under ERISA, it can argue that in state court. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no comment Saturday from NYLCare. An operator at the  
company's switchboard in Dallas said no one would be available for 
comment until Monday.

<HEADLINE> European Oil Firms To Gain in Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The United Nations decision to end economic  
sanctions against Libya will give the country's underdeveloped oil 
industry access to the spare parts and money needed to expand 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	That should also be a boon to foreign oil companies that do  
business in Libya, but American companies will be left at a 
competitive disadvantage because sanctions imposed by the U.S. 
government remain in place. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations on Monday suspended its seven-year  
restrictions on trade with Libya, ending a ban on international 
flights there. The world body acted after Libya handed over two 
citizens suspected of blowing up a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, 
Scotland, in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see a great future in Libya, and certainly the lifting of  
sanctions will make life a whole lot easier,'' said Andrew Harber, 
a manager in Britain for the Swedish company Lundin Oil AB. 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.N. action is unlikely to unleash a fresh wave of  
European oil companies into Libya, analysts say, because most firms 
with an interest in the country are already operating there. For 
them, U.N. sanctions were more of an inconvenience than a real 
impediment. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, new, direct flights to the Libyan capital will save time  
for visiting managers and drilling crews, who previously had to 
drive to Tripoli from the neighboring country of Tunisia, a 
five-hour journey. Only two days after the sanctions were lifted, 
British Airways announced it would start flying three flights a 
week from London to Tripoli. 
</P>
<P>
	The new relations will also likely mean faster international  
money transfers that should help companies complete their projects 
more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	With proven reserves of 30 billion barrels, Libya has as much  
oil as Norway and Britain combined. Its reserves are smaller than 
Mexico's 50 billion barrels, but larger than those of fellow OPEC 
members Nigeria and Indonesia. And its low-sulfur crude fetches a 
premium on global markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Libya also has natural gas reserves of 45.9 trillion cubic feet,  
comparable to those of Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Libyans have managed to keep up steady levels of crude  
production despite U.N. and U.S. sanctions, pumping 1.39 million 
barrels a day last year, according to the International Energy 
Agency. Promising areas of the country remain to be explored. 
Lundin, the Swedish firm, is prospecting at En Naga in the Sahara, 
620 miles southeast of Tripoli. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston-based Conoco Inc. first struck oil in Libya in 1955.  
Since withdrawing from Libya 13 years ago, Conoco has had to forgo 
the production and sale of 300 million barrels of oil worth $5 
billion, company spokesman Carlton Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
	European energy companies such as Italy's ENI, Repsol of Spain  
and Austria's OMV helped fill the void created by the American 
exodus. 
</P>
<P>
	The competitive position of U.S. companies will erode further if  
non-U.S. firms are the only ones allowed to do business in Libya, 
Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one likes to sit on their hands while their competitors are  
out there looking for oil. Libya is a proven producer, it has a lot 
of reserves and it's close to European markets,'' said Peter Bogin 
of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a Paris-based consulting 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
	For Libya's oil industry, sanctions have hurt most by blocking  
imports of certain types of equipment. The U.S. embargo continues 
to deny Libya access to specific technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanctions also have stifled investment. Since 1996, the U.S.  
Iran-Libya Sanctions Act has barred foreign firms from making new 
investments of $40 million or more -- a ceiling that European 
companies seem to be respecting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a difficult environment in which to operate, but  
certainly not an impossible one,'' said Bogin, of the Paris 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Libya's production capacity will expand slowly, but in the long  
run, analysts say, the improvements may embolden it to pump more 
oil than its OPEC production limits allow. 
</P>
<P>
	Libyan diplomats in London refused to comment when asked about  
this possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Leo Drollas, chief economist at the Center for Global Energy  
Studies in London, said Libya already has one of the worst records 
of compliance with OPEC production limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Libya is one of those countries that pay lip service to an  
agreement but then don't comply fully,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Titanic Boarding Pass Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Call it a sale to remember: A boarding pass from  
the ill-fated Titanic fetched $100,000 at an auction Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyer was Jeffrey Trainer, an Allentown, Penn., collector  
who is in the trading card business. The price began at $5,000 and 
zoomed to $100,000 in less than a minute, said Cheryl Gorsuch, 
co-owner of the Tacoma antique store that held the auction. 
</P>
<P>
	She talked Trainer through the auction by phone.

	The rare document -- an immigrant inspection card that served as  
a boarding pass for third-class passengers-- is among the most 
expensive pieces of Titanic memorabilia to hit the auction block, 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	The pass once belonged to Anna Sofia Sjoblom of Finland, who  
pinned it inside her jacket for the 1912 voyage. She had borrowed 
$8 to afford passage on the Titanic after she and three male 
friends were bumped from the Adriatic, another ship in the White 
Star Line. 
</P>
<P>
	The day the Titanic sunk was Sjoblom's birthday, though accounts  
differ as to whether she turned 18 or 20. She made it onto Lifeboat 
No. 16, reportedly the same one that carried White Star Line 
chairman J. Bruce Ismay. Her boarding pass, still pinned inside her 
jacket, never got wet. 
</P>
<P>
	Sjoblom's three friends died.  
</P>
<P>
	When she arrived in America, Sjoblom headed west with her uncle,  
finally settling in Tacoma. She married and raised two children in 
Olympia, and died in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Her pass had been packed away with old photographs and postcards  
until a relative found it and sold it to the antique store about 
six months ago.

<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Gene Benson, a charismatic outfielder who  
starred in the Negro Leagues in the 1940s and mentored a young 
Jackie Robinson before Robinson broke baseball's racial barrier, 
died Tuesday. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson played for over a decade in the Negro Leagues. He debuted  
with the Philadelphia Stars in 1937 before being traded to the 
Pittsburgh Crawfords in 1938. A year later, he returned to the 
Stars, where he played into the late 1940s. 
</P>

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eva S. Cockcroft, an art professor and  
muralist whose works grace walls from Germany to Los Angeles, died 
April 1 of breast cancer. She was 62. 
</P>
<P>
	Cockcroft taught art history at California State University,  
Long Beach and the University of California, Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vienna-born Cockcroft was lead artist on the 540-foot-long

</P>
<P>
	She made murals in New York City and New Jersey until she moved  
to Los Angeles in 1989. Her upper Manhattan mural ``La Grande Jatte 
in Harlem,'' is an ode to French Impressionist Georges Seurat.

known for friendly buyouts amid the hostile takeovers that 
dominated the 1980s, died Sunday of complications from a heart 
attack. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Hechler was involved in the acquisition of more than 25  
companies, including U.S. Banknote, the Leslie Fay Companies, Big 
Bear Stores and book publishers New American Library and E.P.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Helen Aberson Mayer, who wrote the children's  
story that inspired the 1941 Walt Disney cartoon ``Dumbo'' died 
Saturday. She was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Mayer, known as Helen Aberson when she wrote ``Dumbo, the  
Flying Elephant,'' moved from Syracuse, N.Y., to California in 1939 
at the request of the Walt Disney Company. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney, following the 1940 release of the animated film  
``Pinocchio,'' used Miss Aberson's tale of a flying elephant to 
create one of the most easily recognizable cartoon characters and 
stories.

<P>
	In the story, Dumbo the baby elephant is teased for his  
oversized ears, but eventually becomes a circus star when he

</P>
<P>
	He collapsed during a weekly media pick-up hockey game.  
</P>
<P>
	Peterson began his journalism career with United Press  
International in 1979. A year later, he joined the AP's Kansas City

</P>
<P>
	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Cardinal Raul Silva Henriquez, an  
outspoken defender of human rights during Chile's military 
dictatorship, died Friday. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Silva's order said he died of cardio-respiratory failure at a  
home for retired priests. He had been suffering from Alzheimer's 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The cardinal's defense of human rights made the church a  
prominent opponent of Gen. Augusto Pinochet's military regime, 
which seized power in 1973 and ruled until 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Silva also was one of Chile's most forceful advocates of  
dialogue and reconciliation after years of a chaotic Marxist-led 
government and the repressive military rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Silva received a law degree from Catholic University in Santiago  
in 1929 and was ordained a priest nine years later. Named 
Archbishop of Santiago in 1960, he became a cardinal two years 
after that. 
</P>
<P>
	It was during Pinochet's regime that Silva became a symbol of  
human rights. He sponsored a group that gave legal aid to political 
prisoners and helped people dismissed for political reasons to find 
jobs. He also worked to collect evidence of torture and other human 
rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	An official Chilean report says 3,197 people were killed or  
disappeared at the hands of Pinochet's secret police after he 
toppled elected President Salvador Allende in a bloody coup. 
</P>
<P>
	After Pinochet disbanded Silva's group, the cardinal replaced it  
with an organization called the Vicariate of Solidarity, which for 
years aided the victims of repression.

	An Africa specialist and political scientist by profession,

	FRANKLIN, N.C. (AP) -- Edward Tripp, the editor in chief of Yale  
University Press from 1973 to 1986, died Tuesday at age 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Tripp helped acquire more than 200 books during his time at  
Yale. He also helped create the acclaimed ``Encyclopedia of New 
York City,'' published in 1995, which includes 4,300 articles on 
the nation's largest city. 
</P>
<P>
	Tripp spent 20 years working as a New York City social worker  
and as a professional violinist before entering the publishing

approached historian Rayford Logan to start ``The Dictionary of 
American Negro Biography,'' which was published in 1983.

<HEADLINE> Maggert, Faldo Fail To Make Cut  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Jeff Maggert picked up a $1 million paycheck  
for winning the Match Play championship. It won't be enough to buy 
a green jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Maggert staggered away from the 18th hole at Augusta  
National Golf Club, made do with a payday of $5,000 and headed home 
for the weekend after missing the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old Texan, who won the Match Play championship in  
February, was joined on the sidelines by three-time Masters 
champion Nick Faldo and two-time winners Ben Crenshaw, Seve 
Ballesteros and Tom Watson. 
</P>
<P>
	Maggert shot a 6-under-par 78 in the first round, then added a  
76 on Friday to finish with a 10-over 154, missing the cut by six 
strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of the four majors, this is the toughest one for me,'' said  
Maggert, who hasn't finished higher than 37th since his surprise 
victory in the Match Play Championship. ``It's a tough course. 
Maybe I haven't played it enough yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has cracked the top 20 only once in seven trips to the  
Masters -- tying for seventh in 1996 -- and missed the cut three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like someday I'm going to have a good tournament  
here,'' Maggert said. ``I just have to stay patient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Already assured of a banner year, Maggert would prefer that it  
be remembered for more than just his Match Play victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's over and done with,'' he said. ``I've got to get out of  
here and play some good golf. That's what I'll try to do in the 
next few weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faldo hasn't played very well since the 1996 Masters, when he  
rallied from a six-stroke deficit in the final round for a 
memorable victory over Greg Norman. 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old Englishman has now missed the cut three years in  
a row at Augusta National, raising doubts he will ever regain the 
swing that made him one of the world's most dominant players. He 
was doomed by an 80 in the first round, finishing 9-over after a 73 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a fine line at the moment,'' said Faldo, whose 80 was his  
second-worst round in 16 trips to the Masters. ``I've had a million 
blows this year, and this is just another one to overcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The affable Crenshaw, whose victory in the 1995 Masters was  
among the tournament's most emotional moments, couldn't bear to 
talk with reporters after another disastrous trip to Augusta. He 
has missed the cut three of the last four years, shooting a 79 on 
Friday to finish at 153. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too painful,'' Crenshaw said, before hurrying away to  
brood in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballesteros, playing on his 42nd birthday, didn't seem all that  
bothered after missing the cut for the third year in a row. At 
least he was consistent, knocked out by consecutive rounds of 78. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just enjoying myself and trying to play well,'' said  
Ballesteros, the Masters champion in 1980 and '83. ``It's always 
nice to be here. That's a positive thing, especially since I have 
won before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watson appeared in good shape, sitting at 2-over with just four  
holes to play. But his game began to fall apart at 15, when he 
chipped from behind the green into the water along the front, 
leading to a bogey. At the par-3 16th, his tee shot landed in the 
front bunker, and he was still there after his next shot. Finally 
on the green in three, Watson two-putted for a double-bogey. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Watson put his tee shot into the pine trees at 18, then  
three-putted for another double-bogey to finish with at 151. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tough finish,'' Watson said. ``I played pretty well  
other than the last four holes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four amateurs -- Sergio Garcia (147), Tom McKnight (147), Matt  
Kuchar (148) and Trevor Immelman (148) -- made the cut, the most to 
reach the weekend since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchar, the sensation of the 1998 tournament, came to Augusta  
battling the flu and shot a 77 in the first round. But he felt 
better Friday and came through with a 71, highlighted by a 4-under, 
three-hole stretch on the back nine. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchar sandwiched two birdies around an eagle at the par-5 13th,  
when he holed out from a bunker. The Georgia Tech junior bogeyed 
the final two holes but still managed to make the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-three-year-old Gary Player, a three-time Masters champion,  
couldn't duplicate his performance a year ago, when he became the 
oldest player to make the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The South African had two straight rounds of 79 to finish  
14-over, but he managed to thrill the fans at 18 when his 60-foot 
putt snaked down the hilly green to within a foot of the hole, 
allowing him to tap out for par. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always a thrill to come here,'' Player said.

<P>
	One hundred years ago, on April 11, 1899, the treaty ending the  
Spanish-American War was declared in effect. 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1814, Napoleon Bonaparte abdicated as emperor of France and  
was banished to the island of Elba. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1898, President McKinley asked Congress for a declaration of  
war against Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1921, Iowa became the first state to impose a cigarette tax.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1945, during World War II, American soldiers liberated  
Buchenwald, the notorious Nazi concentration camp in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1951, President Truman relieved Gen. Douglas MacArthur of his  
commands in the Far East.

and exiles backed by Tanzanian forces seized control. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued  
regulations specifically prohibiting sexual harassment of workers 
by supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: Mexican officials unearthed the remains of 12 of  
13 victims of a drug-trafficking cult near Matamoros. The dead 
included University of Texas student Mark Kilroy, who had 
disappeared while on spring break. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: The White House disclosed that President and  
Mrs. Clinton had failed to report $6,498 in income that the first 
lady made in commodities trading in 1980; the couple wrote checks 
totaling $14,615 in back taxes and interest. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: The executive committee of the Ulster Union Party  
voted 55-23 to support the Northern Ireland peace accord and its

<HEADLINE> Bobbyjo Wins Grand National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIVERPOOL, England (AP) -- It was 24 years between victories for  
an Irish-bred horse in the Grand National and again the winner was 
ridden by a Carberry. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobbyjo, with 25-year-old Irishman Paul Carberry in the saddle,  
won the Grand National on Saturday by 10 lengths over Blue Charm. 
In 1975, Tommy Carberry, Paul's father and Bobbyjo's trainer, won 
the famed steeplechase race aboard L'Escargot. 
</P>
<P>
	Carberry, hugged by his father at the finish line after an  
acrobatic dismount, described the Irish sweep as ``a dream come 
true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a good start and were handy throughout,'' he said. ``He  
jumped very well and as we jumped the last I knew he would quicken. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can't get any better than that. It'll take a while to set  
in but it was worth going to bed at nine last night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Carberry said he suffered more during the race than  
his son. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think when you're riding in the race it goes quickly, but  
when you're standing as a trainer it takes a very long time,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	London-based Irish owner Bobby Burke, who named the horse for  
himself and his wife, Jo, was also thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't describe it, it's just fantastic,'' Burke said. ``I'm  
delighted for Tommy Carberry, I'm happier for Tommy more than 
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Call it a Day, ridden by two-time winner Richard Dunwoody, was  
third and Addington Boy finished fourth in the 4 1/4-mile race that 
covers 30 jumps. 
</P>
<P>
	The only mare in the race, Fiddling the Facts, went off as the  
6-1 favorite as an estimated $112 million was wagered in one of the 
most important days of year in British sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue Charm led for much of the race and was ahead over the final  
jump with five or six horses still in contention until Bobbyjo 
pulled away down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen of the 32 horses finished the difficult course and one,  
Eudipe, was killed as he went down over the 22nd jump with four 
other horses also falling at the same hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year only six horses finished and three were killed,  
setting off protests by animal-rights activists.

<HEADLINE> Talent Agents Protested Over Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Civil rights activists marched on  
two major Hollywood talent agencies in support of a group of black 
concert promoters who claim they are excluded from working with 
white performers and top black acts. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty demonstrators gathered outside William Morris Agency on  
Friday and then walked to the offices of Creative Artists Agency. 
Both companies are among defendants named in a $700 million lawsuit 
five promoters filed in New York City last November. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are hurting the opportunity for the black community,''  
said the Rev. Joseph Lowery, a former president of the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference. ``As we were lynched physically 
years ago, we're being lynched economically today by the William 
Morris and Creative Artists and others. They are the new lynch 
mob.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Morris and CAA said the accusations are false.  
</P>
<P>
	``Allegations that the William Morris Agency engages in  
exclusionary practices, condones racism or discriminates in any way 
against minorities -- in and out of the music business -- are not 
only unthinkable but false and inflammatory,'' said company 
spokesman Don DeMesquita. 
</P>
<P>
	The promoters are suing 11 talent agencies and 29 promoters,  
claiming they are excluded from promoting major acts once they 
reach star status. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit also claims white promoters pressure booking agents  
to join in a conspiracy against black promoters.

<HEADLINE> Tour Against Police Violence Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson on Saturday kicked off an  
eight-day national tour to raise awareness of police violence 
against minorities and said the killing of an unarmed man in New 
York shows it is ``open season on blacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was joined at a rally at his Rainbow/PUSH Coalition  
headquarters by the parents of Amadou Diallo, the West African 
immigrant shot 19 times in February by four white New York police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers, who said they thought Diallo was about to turn a  
weapon on them, have since been indicted on second-degree murder 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least when you are violated by a stranger or a neighbor ...  
you can call the police,'' Jackson said. ``But when the policeman 
is the bearer of violence and empowered by the state with a badge 
and a gun, that's terrorism.''

	``It is open season on blacks,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Diallo's mother, Kadiadou Diallo, told the hundreds of people  
that blacks and others should unite to end injustice, no matter 
what their differences. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson and the Rev. Al Sharpton, who has led protests in New  
York in the wake of the Diallo shooting, said police misdeeds 
against minorities are rampant across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said most of those arrested in the United States are  
white, but most of those who go to prison are black. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cards are stacked,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Eatery Wants Names From Yahoo! </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A Nashville-based restaurant chain has  
asked a judge to force Internet hub Yahoo! to reveal who placed 
confidential company data on the Internet using the names of its 
top executives. 
</P>
<P>
	The postings about Shoney's, Inc. on a Yahoo! message board  
purported to reveal closure plans for poorly performing restaurants 
and a possible company bankruptcy filing, according to the lawsuit 
filed Friday in Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the bogus e-mail aliases used to post the data were the  
names of Shoney's president, J. Michael Bodnar, and its chairman, 
Raymond Schoenbaum, who have worked to revive the company after 
years of declining sales and stock prices. At least one of the 
postings was made on March 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the restaurant are requesting a judge subpoena  
Yahoo! for the names of those who created the e-mail accounts so 
their names can be added to a related lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the information in the postings was true, but the  
company has no plans to file for bankruptcy, Shoney's spokeswoman 
Betty J. Marshall said. The company suspects the postings were 
placed by a current or former employee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not our intention to prohibit criticism or personal  
opinion about the company,'' Marshall said. ``But we have an 
obligation to protect confidential and proprietary information 
about Shoney's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! officials did not return a call for comment on Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Shoney's operates and franchises about 1,200 Shoney's, Captain  
D's, Pargo's and Fifth Quarter restaurants in 28 states. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the company announced a first-quarter loss of $15.9  
million. It closed 104 restaurants in 1998 and projected more would 
close this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a falsified Internet posting about PairGain  
Technologies sent the company's stock surging before the story 
could be debunked. 
</P>
<P>
	Also this year, Raytheon Co. got subpoenas demanding Yahoo!  
provide information on employees discussing business issues on an 
Internet forum. Yahoo! complied and two workers reportedly resigned 
from the defense contractor.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Sees 1st Daytime Air-Raid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Air-raid sirens sounded a brief  
daytime alert in the Yugoslav capital today, hours after NATO 
airstrikes on a TV tower knocked Serbian TV off the air in the 
embattled province of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO sources in Belgium confirmed the strike on the relay  
station atop Mt. Goles near the Kosovo capital of Pristina. 
Yugoslavia's state-run Tanjug news agency said the transmitter was 
hit by several missiles, leaving viewers in Pristina unable to 
watch state-run television. 
</P>
<P>
	Bad weather kept overnight airstrikes relatively light, the NATO  
sources said on condition of anonymity. They said all aircraft 
returned safely. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first daytime warning in the Yugoslav capital, air-raid  
sirens wailed in mid-morning. An all-clear sounded just over an 
hour later, but the alert rattled nerves in the Yugoslav capital, 
which so far in the 18-day-old NATO campaign has not been hit by 
any daytime raids. 
</P>
<P>
	That has not been the case in Kosovo, where daylight strikes  
have become routine. The Serb village of Gracanica, just outside 
Pristina and famous for its 14th century monastery, was hit at 
midday, Tanjug said. No details on damage were immediately 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanjug also said NATO hit a railway station depot in Kosovo  
Polje, just west of Pristina, before dawn. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a group of about 1,500 ethnic Albanian refugees from  
Kosovo were allowed to cross late Friday into Albania. They said 
they had been chased from their homes by Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia for several days has vacillated between opening  
border points and pushing Kosovars out, and closing crossings and 
urging people to return to their homes. Western officials have 
expressed fears Yugoslavia wants to keep some ethnic Albanians 
inside Kosovo to serve as human shields against NATO attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of refugees have been flown to temporary haven in  
third countries, but the bulk of the nearly half-million who fled 
or were driven out of Kosovo remain in Albania and the former 
Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO sources said Saturday that during the last 24 hours there  
had been 79 aid flights into Macedonia and 66 into Albania. The 
planes carried food, water, medical supplies and tents. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a Cypriot envoy headed home today, after failing to  
win the release of three U.S. soldiers seized March 31 along the 
Macedonian border. Spyros Kyprianou, speaker of the Cyprus 
parliament, said the continued NATO bombings were to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration said it was not surprised the talks  
failed. ``We did not have great expectations,'' said deputy press 
secretary Barry Toiv. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO allies have insisted the bombing campaign will continue  
until Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic withdraws Serb special 
police and Yugoslav army units sent to Kosovo as part of his 
14-month crackdown on the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Western leaders want Milosevic to accept a peace plan and allow  
28,000 NATO-led troops, including 4,000 Americans, to be stationed 
in Kosovo to enforce it. 
</P>
<P>
	Heightened tensions on Yugoslavia's borders with Albania and  
Macedonia have also brought fears the conflict could intensify. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tirana, Albania, the Organization for Security and  
Cooperation in Europe said Yugoslav troops clashed throughout the 
day Friday with Kosovo Liberation Army rebels along Albania's 
northern border. At least four rebels were killed, the OSCE said. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James Foley said the battle erupted  
when several hundred KLA fighters tried to slip into southwestern 
Kosovo from sanctuaries in northern Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there was no indication the Albanian army was involved,  
the Yugoslav army accused Albania of supporting ``aggression'' and 
warned it must ``bear the consequences'' if the conflict spreads. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite several days of bad weather over Kosovo, Western leaders  
insist the air campaign, which began March 24, is beginning to wear 
down Milosevic's military machine. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said during the past several days of good  
weather, NATO airstrikes have ``struck hard at the Serb machinery 
of repression and at the infrastructure that supports it,'' 
including fuel and arms depots and armored military vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia has kept up a drumbeat of angry complaints over what  
it says are widespread civilian casualties as a result of the 
bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	In a turnabout, NATO acknowledged Friday that earlier this week,  
one of its bombs from an attack on the main telephone exchange in 
Pristina fell short of its target, causing damage to a residential 
area.

	NATO Bombs Falling on Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Despite bad weather limiting NATO  
air operations, bombs fell on Kosovo and air-raid sirens blared in 
several other Yugoslav cities today, the eve of Christian Orthodox 
Easter. Dismissing a holiday weekend cease-fire as a sham, NATO 
signaled there was little likelihood of a letup in airstrikes 
tomorrow, the day Serbians celebrate Easter. The alliance also 
reported today that the campaign had so far destroyed half of 
Yugoslavia's most modern fighter planes. 

</P>
<P>
	More U.S. Firepower to Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO is expecting to add dozens of aircraft to  
its arsenal used in the bombing of Yugoslavia within days, 
officials said. The Pentagon announced today that 82 more U.S. 
planes would join the airstrikes, a move to intensify the battle 
against Serb forces. But it could take a month for 24 Apache attack 
helicopters to be ready for use from a base in Albania. Their 
introduction would mark an escalation of the war and for the first 
time allow close-to-the-ground, direct strikes against Serb troops 
and tanks during persistent bad weather. 

</P>

	Mother of Captured GI Breaks Down  
</P>
<P>
	MONTEBELLO, Calif. (AP) -- The mother of one of the American  
soldiers captured on the Yugoslav border broke down at a ceremony 
attended by hundreds today. ``He went on a mission of peace. This 
was not supposed to happen,'' Vivian Ramirez said of her son, Army 
Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez. Ramirez, 24, Staff Sgt. Christopher 
Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich., and Spc. Steven M. Gonzales, 22, 
of Huntsville, Texas, were captured March 31 while patrolling the 
Yugoslav-Macedonia border. Shouts of encouragement for Mrs. Ramirez 
came from the audience of about 300 people gathered before the 
veterans memorial at Montebello Park.

	BLUE ASH, Ohio (AP) -- A day after a tornado sliced through  
Cincinnati's northern suburbs, killing four and destroying hundreds 
of homes, residents today hurried to salvage their belongings 
before another round of forecasted storms raked the area. The state 
Emergency Management Agency estimated today that 900 homes were 
damaged in Hamilton, Clinton and Warren counties in southwest Ohio. 
Red Cross shelters remained open while police sealed off streets so 
repair crews could restore electricity and clear debris.

	Home of Suspected Spy Searched  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The New Mexico home of a scientist fired from  
his job at the Los Alamos National Laboratory under suspicion he 
passed nuclear weapons secrets to China was searched by FBI agents 
today. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson confirmed the warrant was 
executed in ``the ongoing investigation of alleged espionage,'' but 
he would not say where. Neighbors of Taiwan-born American Wen Ho 
Lee said the suspected spy emerged briefly from his home today, but 
didn't say anything.

	Murder Charge in Sex-Torture Case

	TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES, N.M. (AP) -- A man has been charged in the  
death of a 22-year-old woman whose disappearance is part of a 
10-state investigation into alleged sexual torture and kidnapping. 
While police have said for weeks the case possibly involved murder, 
their searches of a rural home and a lake have produced no bodies, 
including that of the missing woman. The only murder charge in the 
case is the one filed against Dennis Roy Yancy, 27, of Truth or 
Consequences. He was arrested last night and charged in the death 
of Marie B. Parker, 22, who disappeared in 1997.

targets in a valley between the villages of Jebal al-Botom and 
Zibqine, 10 miles southeast of the port of Tyre, the officials

	Olazabal Leads Norman at Masters

<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Jose Maria Olazabal shot a 1-over-par 73  
today in the Masters, and Greg Norman is getting yet another chance 
to finally win a coveted green jacket. Olazabal remained in the 
lead at 209, but made a few mistakes today that allowed a host of 
players -- even Tiger Woods and David Duval -- back into the hunt. 
Norman finished off his third round with a birdie to get to within 
one stroke of Olazabal and to earn a date in tomorrow's final 
pairing at Augusta National.

<HEADLINE> Springsteen Kicks Off World Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Reunited with his old band, Bruce  
Springsteen opened his world tour to a sold-out crowd of 20,000 in 
Barcelona's Saint George Palace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boss did not disappoint in his first tour with the E Street  
Band in more than a decade. They opened Friday with ``My Love Will 
Not Let You Down'' and ``Prove It All Night.'' And that's what they 
did, captivating the crowd for 2 1/2 hours through 19 songs and five 
encores. 
</P>
<P>
	After delighting the Barcelona fans with a greeting spoken in  
Catalan, Springsteen hardly addressed his audience during the 
high-energy performance bursting with old favorites including 
``Badlands,'' ``10th Avenue Freezeout'' and ``The River.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another highlight was a duet, ``Mansion on the Hill,'' sung with  
his wife, Patti Scialfa, who also played guitar and sang back-up 
throughout the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's concert, and a second date Sunday also in this  
northeastern Spanish city, mark the beginning of a 17-city European 
tour for Springsteen and the E Street Band. Dates include Munich, 
Zurich, London, Dublin and Paris before the wrapping up in Madrid. 
The first U.S. performances aren't until mid-July.

<HEADLINE> IRS Warns Tax Filers: Don't Be Late </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the estimated 34 million taxpayers who  
have yet to file their income tax returns: The headaches will only 
get worse if they miss Thursday's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Internal Revenue Service offers extensions, they  
can be quite costly. And the worst thing to do is not file anything 
by the stroke of midnight on April 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst strategy, one that can add thousands of dollars to  
your tax bill, is to do nothing,'' said Lawrence Torella, an 
accountant and partner with Richard A. Eisner &AMP; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Torella said a ``whole new generation'' of taxpayers with  
problems filing returns on time could be created by income from the 
booming stock market, an increase in the number of people who have 
stock options and windfalls from sales of small businesses. In 
addition, tax returns are more complex than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalty for failing to file a tax return is 5 percent of the  
balance due per month, up to a maximum of 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayers who aren't going to meet the filing deadline should  
send the IRS a request for extension until Aug. 16 using Form 4868, 
which is available on the Internet, IRS offices and some banks and 
post offices. The IRS automatically approves such requests. 
</P>
<P>
	But people seeking extensions should still pay an estimate of  
their taxes due, or at least as much as possible, by Thursday. 
Doing so will lessen the sting of interest -- now 8 percent on late 
payments -- and penalties of a half-percent per month. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS will refund any amount overpaid, once the final return  
is submitted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come in a little high,'' said IRS spokesman Don Roberts.  
``Whatever you have left, you're going to pay interest on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penalties for late tax payments drop to a quarter-percent per  
month if the taxpayer enters into an installment payment agreement 
with the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
	A request for such an installment plan, using Form 9465, can be  
attached to the tax return. The IRS almost always grants such 
requests as long as the taxpayer agrees to pay $25,000 or less 
within five years. There's a $43 fee to set up such a plan. 
</P>
<P>
	For reasons such as a death in the family or serious illness,  
the IRS sometimes waives late-payment penalties on returns filed on 
time. People should make such requests courteously and in writing. 
</P>
<P>
	One other note: The U.S. Tax Court has rejected claims from  
taxpayers who say accountants advised them to file returns late 
while collecting required documentation. 
</P>
<P>
	Through April 2, the IRS had received almost 70 million of the  
126 million tax returns expected this year. Counting estimates for 
this week, IRS spokesman Roberts said it's likely that 34 million 
taxpayers, or about 26 percent, will submit their returns in the 
next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Although refunds are running close to 20 percent ahead of last  
year and average $1,575, it's likely that people who owe taxes make 
up the bulk of the last-minute filers. And many people probably 
postponed doing taxes last week because of the twin Easter and 
Passover holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really have only one good weekend in April to work on tax  
returns, instead of two,'' Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Last-minute forms from the IRS are available in several ways.  
The fastest is through the Internet at www.irs.ustreas.gov. 
Taxpayers also can call from a fax machine at 1-703-368-9694 and 
have a form faxed.

<HEADLINE> Two Deer Killed by 19-Seat Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KINSTON, N.C. (AP) -- A commuter plane speeding toward takeoff at  
a rural airport slammed into a doe and two fawns, damaging the 
plane and killing the animals. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the 10 passengers or crew aboard the 19-seat USAirways  
Express propeller plane was injured in the collision, which 
occurred just before dawn Thursday at the airport about 70 miles 
southeast of Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	The deer damaged the plane's right wheel and engine, forcing  
cancellation of the Charlotte-bound flight. 
</P>
<P>
	The deer apparently wandered onto the runway after clearing a  
6-foot fence that separates the airport from nearby woods. Airport 
officials said they will consider building the fence higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane is owned by CCAir, which operates USAir flights in the  
region.

<HEADLINE> Zito To Test 2nd String at the Wood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Trainer Nick Zito is looking for a few more  
Kentucky Derby horses in today's $600,000 Wood Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, Zito's Stephen Got Even is headed to Churchill Downs  
off his victory in the GalleryFurniture.com Stakes at Turfway Park 
on March 27. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also penciled in Wondertross, the early favorite for  
today's Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland, for the May 1 Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Wood, Zito hopes his second-stringers Adonis and The  
Groom Is Red can prove themselves worthy of a trip to Churchill 
Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are two good horses,'' said Zito, a two-time Derby  
winner with Strike the Gold in 1991 and Go for Gin in 1994. ``They 
worked great the other day and I think you're going to see their 
best efforts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adonis, a powerfully built son of Kris S., was a wide sixth in  
the Florida Derby after having won his previous two races. Adonis, 
the 4-1 second choice behind favored Badge, will be ridden by Jorge 
Chavez. The colt will wear blinkers for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Groom Is Red, a 15-1 shot, is the only Grade I winner in the  
11-horse field for the 1 1/8-mile Wood (ABC-TV, post time 5:42 p.m. 
EDT). But the Rick Pitino-owned colt hasn't won as a 3-year-old. In 
his last two races, The Groom Is Red was sixth in the 
GalleryFurniture.com, and seventh on the Fountain of Youth on Feb. 
28. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think The Groom Is Red has finally come around,'' Zito said.  
``As for Adonis, all you have to do was look at the trip he had in 
the Florida Derby and you know he's a better horse than what he 
showed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Badge, trained by retired fireman John Aquilino, won the Gotham  
by 7 1/2 lengths in a speedy time of 1:34 3-5 for the mile. The son of 
Air Forbes Won has won four of his last five races. 
</P>
<P>
	The field, from the rail out, is: Badge (3-1, Shaun Bridgmohan);  
Karly's Harley (8-1, Edgar Prado); Bugatti (15-1, Robbie Davis); 
Adonis (4-1, Jorge Chavez); Cliquot (9-2, Rene Douglas); The Groom 
is Red (15-1, Craig Perret); David (12-1, Aaron Gryder); Robin 
Goodfellow (20-1, Joe Bravo); Machine To Tower (20-1, Cornelio 
Velasquez); Best of Luck (12-1, Jean-Luc Samyn), and Swamp (6-1, 
Richard Migliore).

<HEADLINE> L.A. Police Honor Captured Soldier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hours after hopes were dashed that three U.S.  
soldiers in Yugoslavia would be freed, Los Angeles police honored 
the family of captive Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of officers throughout the city on Friday signed 23  
poster-sized placards bearing the captured sergeant's military 
photograph. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez's brother, Steven, is a detective on the force.  
</P>
<P>
	Chief Bernard Parks said the cards were passed around the  
department's 18 divisions to show the family ``what the LAPD family 
is all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my understanding that if Andrew were here he would like  
to be in the LAPD,'' Parks said. ``When Andrew comes back he will 
know so many people thought so highly about him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez's mother, sister and brother, an Army veteran who  
inspired the East Los Angeles native to join the service, accepted 
the cards at police headquarters on a stage decorated with yellow 
ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd just like to thank everybody and express my thanks to them  
and hopefully we'll get my brother home soon so that this whole 
ordeal could go away,'' Steven Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before the presentation, Cyprus president Spyros  
Kyprianou said he had failed to negotiate a release for the POWs in 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Ramirez, 24, was captured near the Yugoslav-Macedonian  
border on March 31 with two other soldiers, Spc. Steven M. 
Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas, and Staff Sgt. Christopher J. 
Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich.

<HEADLINE> NASA Mulls All-Female Shuttle Crew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Come 2001, women may have an inside  
track in the macho world of space. Within the next two years, NASA 
may be flying all-female space shuttle crews -- for science. 
</P>
<P>
	With a new space station on the horizon and increasing talk of  
trips to Mars, NASA wants to make sure it protects the health of 
all its astronauts, male and female. But just as with Earth-bound 
medical research, most of what it knows has been gleaned from men, 
and projecting results onto women could be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	Weightlessness, for instance, is known to cause bone loss in  
both sexes, and because women are at greater risk of osteoporosis, 
theory might suggest women in space load up on calcium. But that 
could create kidney stones, points out Dr. Arnauld Nicogossian, the 
space agency's top doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Other areas of concern, for both sexes, include radiation and  
the weakening of the immune system in weightlessness. 
</P>
<P>
	Millie Hughes-Fulford, a University of California professor who  
flew on the space shuttle in 1991, would love to see an all-female 
crew. As an osteoporosis researcher, she'd be especially interested 
in whether women lose bone and calcium at the same rate in space as 
men. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would probably be the biggest argument against women  
going to Mars. `Oh, my dear, you're getting much too close to 
menopause and you're going to lose all that bone when you're 
gone,''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA is seeking multiple second opinions to determine whether  
more gender-specific research is needed. The study should be 
completed by the end of June. After reviewing the findings, ``then 
we'll decide if it makes sense to have a mission dedicated 
specifically to fly women and how often we have to continue that 
type of mission,'' Nicogossian said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will not be a one-time deal,'' he promised.  
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until the last few years that NASA could even consider  
putting together an all-female crew. Every shuttle mission requires 
two pilots, and NASA only recently added its second and third 
female shuttle pilots. The 119 current astronauts include 29 women. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sooner or later it's going to happen'' whether it's deliberate  
or not, said shuttle program director William Readdy. 
</P>
<P>
	Men have dominated space flight -- and consequently space medical  
research -- since Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin opened the frontier 
38 years ago this Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 278 people who have flown on U.S. spacecraft since Alan  
Shepard's 15-minute hop May 5, 1961, only 31 have been women. This 
official roster excludes Christa McAuliffe and the two other 
rookies who were killed aboard Challenger. 
</P>
<P>
	Women were not admitted to NASA's astronaut corps until 1978 and  
did not fly on a space shuttle until 1983. No woman piloted a 
shuttle until 1995. And women will not command a shuttle flight 
until Eileen Collins takes the left front seat aboard Columbia in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the space station era seems to be shaping up the same  
way -- mostly male. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the six U.S. astronauts and six Russian cosmonauts training  
to live on the international space station, only one, American 
Susan Helms, is female. 
</P>
<P>
	And only one woman was among the seven NASA astronauts who lived  
on Mir. It was only because her ride home was delayed that Shannon 
Lucid ended up staying six months in 1996, a record for women 
worldwide and for Americans of either sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Because they've worked so hard to get where they are, many of  
NASA's women dislike the idea of all-female crews, says an agency 
insider. They're insulted, in fact, by anything that smacks of 
gimmickry or implies their skills somehow don't measure up. 
</P>
<P>
	Former astronaut Kathryn Thornton, one of the few women to walk  
in space, wonders why NASA doesn't simply collect the scientific 
data by assigning more women to more space shuttle flights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why it would be necessary to have them all on the  
same flight,'' said Thornton, a physicist now teaching at the 
University of Virginia. ``I would worry about the privacy issues. 
Everybody would know these seven women on all these different 
tests. And if the issues have to deal with how the crews get along, 
I'd be really upset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A crew of all women could certainly be perceived as a gimmick,  
especially with John Glenn's trumpeted return to orbit last fall 
still resonating. 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis Brown Jr., the astronaut who commanded the Glenn mission  
and who will lead an all-male crew to the Hubble Space Telescope 
this fall, complains the proposed all-female mission has turned 
into ``a media thing and I don't know why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said he was under the impression that only the four  
payload crew members would have to be women for the proposed 
testing. The two pilots and one flight engineer generally forgo 
blood draws and other invasive testing in case they have to deal 
with emergencies aloft. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nicogossian contends the more women, the better, regardless  
of limitations on their testing status. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicogossian refuses to speculate on whether an all-female crew  
might include a geriatric volunteer, a la the 77-year-old Glenn. 
``It depends on the experiments,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And he doesn't want to guess what might happen if it turns out  
women make better space travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	Might it be onward, women only, to Mars?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll leave that question open,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ashley Judd took a break from the glamor of  
movie stardom to live out her longtime dream to become a Peace 
Corps volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
	The actress with credits including ``Heat'' and ``Kiss the  
Girls'' spent a week in a remote Amazon jungle village in Suriname, 
where she lived without electricity and running water. 
</P>
<P>
	``I woke up once during the night to go to the bathroom,'' Judd  
says in the May issue of Marie Claire magazine. ``Using facilities 
outside was not an uncomfortable adjustment for me. I grew up using 
an outhouse whenever I visited my great aunt and uncle on their 
farm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hollywood beauty enjoyed her time among the friendly  
residents of Asawai on the banks of the piranha-filled Saramacca 
River, and didn't have too many difficulties with local wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not intimidated by nature and I found nothing fearsome,  
despite the jungle's reputation,'' she said. ``The only encounter I 
had was being chased back to the hut by a mosquito which seemed to 
be the size of my hand.''

<HEADLINE> Internet Execs To Field Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As many as 45,000 people are expected to go  
online Wednesday for a daylong conference call that will give 
ordinary investors access to top Internet executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive officers and chief financial officers from  
Internet companies like Excite Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. will take part 
in the daylong call, scheduled for 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Vcall Corp., a Philadelphia-based provider of Internet  
conference calls, will waive its usual fee and won't require a 
password for the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Besecker, the company's founder, said he envisioned  
``VcallApolooza'' as a vehicle for individual investors to quiz the 
leaders of the Internet companies that have become hot properties 
in the ongoing bull market. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll level the playing field by allowing individuals to ask  
questions they'd never get to ask,'' he said Friday. Individual 
investors are rarely invited to take part in analyst meetings or 
conference calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The executives taking part in Wednesday's virtual conference  
call will make speeches or hold discussions with their counterparts 
over real-time audio and video feeds. Listeners may send questions 
via e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Besecker said he expects people to come and go throughout the  
day, logging in only for the speakers that most interest them. 
</P>
<P>
	Vcall also hopes to use the conference call as a marketing tool  
to attract future paying listeners, advertisers and clients. The 
company, founded in 1997, broadcasts corporate conference calls 
over the Internet for a fee so that investors can listen in. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, Vcall's largest audience has been about 20,000 people,  
who listened in to a conference call with Dell Computer Corp. 
Besecker said Vcall's technology can easily handle wider audiences, 
and he doesn't expect technical snares. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference call is accessible through Vcall's Web site, at  
www.vcall.com.

<HEADLINE> Dance Sport Moves Up Olympic Ladder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- That's one small step -- maybe a foxtrot -- for  
ballroom dancing in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	In another move toward placing the tango alongside the 100-meter  
dash in the games, the U.S. Olympic Committee on Saturday granted 
affiliated status to the United States Amateur Ballroom Dancers 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The change in status puts the USOC on the same level as the  
International Olympic Committee, which recognized ballroom dancing 
as a potential Olympic sport several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	That's still a long way from having dancers in the games, but  
Saturday's action makes the dance association eligible for USOC 
training and assistance grants. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC also gave full Olympic status to the U.S. Taekwondo  
Union. Taekwondo becomes a medal sport in the 2000 Games in Sydney.

<HEADLINE> Principal Charged in Cocaine Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A principal known for her good works and tough  
words about drug abuse has been charged with running a narcotics 
ring at her elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
	Delores Hill, 53, was accused at her arraignment Friday of being  
the leader of a small drug ring at the Tabernacle Church of God 
Elementary School in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hill allegedly sold $25 bags of cocaine to an undercover  
policewoman on school grounds. She was arrested along with the 
school nurse, a janitor and another worker. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities -- who shut down the private, 160-student school --  
said the defendants dealt drugs to adults behind the scenes while 
children were busy in class. But Ms. Hill allegedly made one sale 
while baby-sitting two infants in her office, said prosecutor 
Patricia Gatling. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hill was charged with felony sale and possession of a  
controlled substance. She pleaded innocent, and was being held on 
$250,000 bail. The maximum sentence for the charges is 25 years in 
prison. Her attorney, Frank Paone, would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The janitor, Steven Donawa, 42, was arrested after he stopped by  
Ms. Hill's apartment and left carrying 51 bags of cocaine, 
prosecutors said. School nurse Patricia Kersey, 41, was charged 
with participating in two drug sales. Laverne Prescod, 42, a school 
counselor, was charged in one drug sale. All the defendants pleaded 
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hill had been quoted in the past as an outspoken opponent of  
drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	``There needs to be more drug education, especially for  
parents,'' she told Newsday in 1990. ``Our second graders know more 
about drugs than some of the parents.''

<HEADLINE> Malone Puts the 'M' in NBA MVP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Six-tenths of a second were left on the  
clock. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Utah Jazz down by two points, Karl Malone had just been  
fouled while shooting a 3-pointer. He had to make three free throws 
to steal the game from the Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	And Malone -- a 14-year NBA veteran, a former league MVP, the  
soul of workmanlike consistency -- was scared. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I went back (to the bench) to get a drink of water, I  
could not hold on to it,'' he said. ``That's how nervous I was. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was up there (at the line), I was fine. But after I  
went over to get some water, I couldn't drink the water. I was 
shaking that bad. There's nerves in this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Malone overcame the jitters and made all three free throws  
Friday night, giving the Jazz a 93-92 win. That's what leaders do. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys are counting on me to hit those shots,'' he said.  
``They don't want to hear excuses. That's what I'm trying to do 
this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By his own lofty standards, Malone fell on hard times during the  
first half of the season. His numbers were down, his shot was off 
and his chances at a second Most Valuable Player Award appeared 
slim. His scoring average, though fourth-best in the league, is 
still at its lowest point since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	But after leading the Jazz to three impressive wins in the past  
six days, Malone seems to have relocated his game and set his 
sights back on a championship, the only basketball goal he has yet 
to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think people appreciate the things Karl Malone has  
done day in and day out,'' Utah coach Jerry Sloan said. ``He's made 
his body better, he's made his free throws better, he's fought back 
every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also has rejoined Miami center Alonzo Mourning in what's  
shaping up as a two-man MVP race. 
</P>
<P>
	The two have comparable offensive statistics (Malone is  
averaging 23.5 points per game and Mourning 20.0, while Zo is 
outrebounding the Mailman 11.3 to 9.2), but Mourning is a flashier 
defensive presence and leads the league in blocked shots. However, 
the Jazz have a better record than the Heat. 
</P>
<P>
	In Utah's last three games, Malone has proved his singular  
importance to the Jazz. Sloan, who has coached him since his rookie 
season, said it might have been the finest week in Malone's career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that,'' Sloan said. ``We probably wouldn't have won  
once this week without him. He's won a lot of games for us over the 
years ... and he knows what he has to do. Nobody tells him. He just 
keeps on doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday at Los Angeles, Malone set a Jazz franchise record by  
going 12-for-12 from the field, scoring 30 points in Utah's 106-93 
win against the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later, Malone destroyed the Golden State Warriors with  
a season-high 38 points, including 25 in the second half. He also 
collected 12 rebounds in the 92-85 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-four hours later, he scored 31 points and hit the three  
free throws that doused the Suns. He was a combined 27-for-29 from 
the free-throw line in the final two games, including 13-for-13 in 
the fourth quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been starting to get my groove back for a couple of weeks  
now, and I'm anxious for the playoffs to start,'' Malone said. 
``All I try to do is have one good game and move on. I don't want 
any more pressure on me than I already have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone had one other secret he used to keep him focused before  
shooting those pressure free throws Friday night. He took a long, 
slow walk to the other end of the court. 
</P>
<P>
	On the way back, he exchanged a look with John Stockton. After  
nearly 14 years together, that's all the power forward and his 
point guard needed to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to talk to him,'' Stockton said. ``I just smiled  
and felt confident.''

<HEADLINE> Beavers Raid Prized Cherry Trees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a city that knows more than its share of  
scandal, the eating habits of a rodent have not ranked with 
Watergate or Monica Lewinsky as a major topic of discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now.  
</P>
<P>
	This home of presidents and ambassadors has shifted its gaze  
from Monica to mammals, specifically the pair of beavers -- there 
could be more -- suspected of toppling four of the prized cherry 
trees at the peak of the blossom season. A gift from Japan in 1912, 
there are some 1,600 cherry trees. 
</P>
<P>
	A National Park Service effort to trap the rascally rodents  
comes as thousands of visitors and area residents look forward to 
the walk around the tree-lined Tidal Basin, the body of water 
between the Jefferson Memorial and the Washington Monument. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tidal Basin also is the place where a stripper named Fanne  
Foxe jumped in October 1974 from the limousine of Arkansas Democrat 
Wilbur Mills, one of the House's most powerful members. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always something,'' Thelma Newland of Rockville, Md.,  
said Saturday. ``Somebody in New York called it, 'Beavergate.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Like baseball fans listening to the play-by-play of a game,  
Washingtonians have tracked the Park Service's progress in 
capturing the beavers, who quickly became the region's second-most 
famous cherry-tree choppers. (The first gave his name to the 
capital.) 
</P>
<P>
	The Park Service snared one of the beavers Friday night, luring  
it into a suitcase-shaped trap only partially submerged so that the 
captured animal will not drown. 
</P>
<P>
	The beaver will be released in another area where he can chew to  
his heart's content. The Park Service would not disclose the site. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're concerned about it,'' said John Little of Harrisburg,  
Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``And it's hillarious, too, in a way,'' said his mother, Louise  
Little, of Picture Rocks, Pa. ``I live in the country, where a 
beaver is not any great shakes at all.''

<HEADLINE> New Device May Soon Sort Your Trash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- Out of tuna fish? Low on pasta? Just toss  
your empty cans and boxes into the trash and your shopping will be 
done. 
</P>
<P>
	Futuristic fantasy? Maybe not, says NCR Corp.  
</P>
<P>
	The Dayton-based company said Friday it has developed a trash  
receptacle that translates coding on empty containers into a 
shopping list that can be wired to retailers for delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a research project at the moment,'' said Stephen Emmott,  
director of NCR's Knowledge Lab in London, England. But there is 
``a fully working prototype in the lab.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emmott said the Intelligent Bin is embedded with a  
microprocessor that reads product identification codes. The 
information is transmitted wirelessly either to a computer or 
special electronic box, which compiles a list of the discarded 
items. 
</P>
<P>
	That list can then be sent to retailers over the Internet, or  
consumers can simply use the device to create their own shopping 
list, Emmott said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The benefit to consumers is this incredible convenience, to  
automatically be able to reorder things,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmott said it would also give retailers a better idea of what  
consumers like and take some of the guesswork out of marketing. 
Merchants could tailor discount coupons and special offers based on 
consumption patterns. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they know a particular consumer is consuming ice cream and  
also throws a package of strawberries away, they begin to learn 
consumer habits,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trash cans could be on the market within five to 10 years,  
but it will require the industry to move away from bar codes, 
Emmott said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bins would require widespread use of radio frequency  
identification technology -- a tiny computer chip and antenna 
embedded in product labels -- which carries more information than 
bar codes. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology has been little used because it's too expensive  
to put on inexpensive products, said Bob Glavin, spokesman for 
Monarch Marking Systems, a maker of bar-code products. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Arlen, president of Arlen Communications, a research  
company specializing in interactive media, said this age of home 
shopping would favor a smart trash can, but some consumers might 
balk. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do you feel about someone keeping track of what you use  
for toilet paper?'' he asked. ``For some people it will be a 
problem.''

	When Hornaday and Harvick touched in the half-mile track's  
second turn, on lap 289, and lost momentum, Carelli found the hole 
he needed. The driver from Colorado, who last won in Madison, Ill., 
last August, held on through an additional caution period to beat 
Harvick by 0.759-seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The runnerup finish was the best of the 23-year-old Harvick's  
career. The Bakersfield native drives a Ford, co-owned by Cleveland 
auto dealer Jim Herrick and retired NBA all-star Brad Daugherty. 
</P>
<P>
	Hornaday, his Chevy's tires losing traction, faded to  
fourth-place, surrendering third to polesitter Stacy Compton's 
Dodge on the final lap. Jimmy Hensley, driving another Dodge, 
finished fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Carelli, who averaged a near-record 76.331 mph, won $37,780. The  
race, scheduled for 300 laps, went 301 to ensure two laps of racing 
at the conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	The final 12 laps were the only ones Carelli led. The race was  
dominated by Hornaday. A total of six drivers took turns heading 
the 34-truck field, swapping the advantage 14 times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said earlier today we had a good truck,'' said Carelli, who  
started 26th. ``Last night, we qualified in the dark with what 
seemed like snow and ice and whatever but it came together today. 
</P>
<P>
	``This win means a lot to me. We've had a great truck the last  
few races since we started this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The finished moved Carelli from 13th in the Craftsman Truck  
Series point standings to sixth place. Hornaday holds a 45-point 
advantage over Compton. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Setzer, who won the race a year ago, finished sixth,  
followed by Jack Sprague, whose effort was marred by two pit road 
miscues. Mike Wallace took eighth, with Butch Miller the final 
lead-lap finisher. Kevin Cywinski was 10th, one lap behind.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Says Hof Farmers Underpayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The battle lines are drawn between the  
Agriculture Department and meat packer Excel Corp. as the agency 
moves forward with charges that the processor underpaid Midwestern 
hog farmers by about $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Excel says it will contest within 20 days the charges that it  
violated the Packers and Stockyards Act, which prohibits unfair and 
deceptive practices by packers. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA says it could request that an administrative judge fine the  
company nearly $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint, brought Friday by USDA's Grain Inspection,  
Packers and Stockyards Administration, alleges that Wichita, 
Kan.-based Excel changed the formula it uses to determine how much 
hog farmers are paid without notifying farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The change allegedly cheated more than 1,250 farmers who did  
business at the company's plants in Beardstown, Ill., Ottumwa, 
Iowa, and Marshall, Mo., by underpaying them for more than 19,900 
hogs in late 1997 and early 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Excel, which controls 9 percent of the U.S. hog slaughter  
market, is a subsidiary of Minneapolis-based food giant Cargill 
Inc. Excel also owns five beef slaughter operations in Nebraska, 
Colorado, Kansas and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The action ``is legally without merit and was taken without  
first providing adequate notice of an alleged violation,'' said 
company spokesman Mark Klein. ``We're not aware of any other case 
in which (the USDA) has filed a complaint against a company for 
improving the accuracy of a technology or process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe we would have erred by failing to implement a more  
accurate equation,'' Klein said. The company will pay aggrieved 
producers $1.8 million, but it feels additional penalties would be 
unwarranted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Klein said the company offered to pay the disputed $1.8 million  
after USDA officials complained that the growers had not been 
notified months after the October 1997 change. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is the formula for which hogs are purchased, known as  
``carcass merit basis.'' A carcass' merit is determined by the 
amount of lean it produced. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they did was reduce the lean value for most hogs, which  
meant that the farmer was getting less money for his hogs,'' said 
Harold Davis, the USDA agency's deputy administrator for packers 
and stockyards. ``The violation here is that they did not tell the 
farmer that they changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Excel counters the new formula was implemented to improve the  
company's pricing system. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company's policy is to use the most accurate measurements  
available,'' Klein said. He said the company contends that some 
producers received slightly lower payments under the change while 
others received higher payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate comes as farmers are complaining that big companies  
are pushing them out by keeping prices secret. Vice President Al 
Gore said Thursday that the Clinton administration will push for 
mandatory price reporting among meat processors to ensure that 
farmers have a fair shot in the marketplace.

<HEADLINE> Graduate School Exams Computerized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Christopher Delaney was just one of 39,000  
people today taking the last-ever, paper-and-pencil version of the 
Graduate Record Examination -- the entrance exam thousands must take 
to get into graduate school. 
</P>
<P>
	Delaney, 27, of Boston, is comfortable with technology, but he'd  
rather not wait until the test is given exclusively on computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paper and pencil is suited to my test-taking skills a little  
better,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer version -- where test-takers click on answers on a  
computer screen with a mouse instead of penciling in ovals on a 
sheet of paper -- has been available since 1993. But the end of the 
paper-and-pencil version is part of a growing trend. In 1997, the 
Graduate Management Admissions Test, required by most business 
schools, was the first to switch entirely to computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the test -- which, unlike the paper version,  
``adapts'' to each person, asking tougher questions of those doing 
well, easier questions of those performing poorly and adjusting 
scores accordingly -- is not as fair. 
</P>
<P>
	``These test scores will determine a person's life course; if  
there's still a problem, it's unforgivable for them to be switching 
the test,'' said Amy Cuddy, who has used a Massachusetts consumer 
law to alert the tests' administrator, the Educational Testing 
Service, of a pending lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuddy, 26, who is required to send a letter 30 days before  
filing suit, charges that a computerized test she took in 
Longmeadow, Mass., last fall was incorrectly scored. The score she 
got on the computer version differed wildly from the score on a 
paper version she took a month later, and from scores on practice 
computer tests. 
</P>
<P>
	ETS officials, who also give the GMAT and other standardized  
tests owned by individual policy boards, say no suits related to 
computerization have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, last year, almost half of the roughly 400,000 GRE  
test-takers opted for the computer version, said Nancy Cole, 
president of the Princeton, N.J.-based testing service. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the computer's ability to ``adapt,'' asking tougher or  
easier questions, gives a better picture of a test-taker's ability 
because concentration and time aren't wasted on questions that are 
too hard or easy. 
</P>
<P>
	Others counter that the computer tests can be nerve-wracking for  
people used to paper tests that allow them to skip items and come 
back or change answers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Computerizing low-quality, multiple-choice tests does not  
magically transform them into better assessment instruments,'' said 
Robert A. Schaeffer of FairTest, a Cambridge, Mass., group that 
monitors testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, 400 GMAT test-takers saw a ``fatal error'' message  
flash on their computer screens immediately after they finished the 
three-hour exam. Some, believing the glitch hurt their scores, 
demanded refunds. But ETS said the problem affected no scores and 
gave no refunds. 
</P>
<P>
	Cole said there's no proof the computerized version lowers or  
raises scores. And there's no way to cheat the system: ``You're not 
going to answer a couple wrong and just coast through. As soon as 
you answer them right, it starts getting harder again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Schatten, 28, who took the test in Columbia, Md., in  
December, found the test more convenient. ``I didn't think it was 
any less fair,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer tests cost more ($96, from about $55 for the paper  
GRE) and are offered six days a week instead of three times a year. 
Cole said because computers are more expensive, the testing service 
isn't making more money. 
</P>
<P>
	New York state is considering forcing the paper-and-pencil  
option, said Robert Shaw, an aide to state Sen. Kenneth P. LaValle, 
who heads the Legislature's higher education committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people who have been out of the academic environment  
for a while, who may not be as comfortable with a computer,'' Shaw 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York was first to require test-givers to provide a given  
exam's questions, answers and backup data to people disputing their 
scores. 
</P>
<P>
	Cole acknowledges the computer test's complex scoring makes it  
difficult to follow such ``truth in testing'' orders, but ETS is 
looking for ways to help people reviewing scores understand the 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
	The SAT, taken by about 2 million high school students each  
year, is still given on paper, except for a computer version given 
to younger children for colleges tracking bright students for 
special programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Major exams for medical school and law school, which are given  
by independent professional councils, are still given solely on 
paper.

<HEADLINE> Report: Gov't Lab Misled Buyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government research laboratory sold $3  
million in licenses to develop a new radar technology but didn't 
tell buyers the patent was in dispute and the radar did not meet 
federal requirements, a congressional report said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the House Science Committee asserted that as many  
as 30 investors, among them many small startup companies, were 
misled by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where a 
scientist filed a patent on the technology in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Each licensee paid $100,000 for the right to develop the  
technology known as ``impulse'' or ``ultrawide band'' radar for a 
variety of commercial purposes from home security systems to 
inspecting bridge abutments. 
</P>
<P>
	Many discovered later the laboratory's patent had been  
challenged by an Alabama scientist, who claims to have patented the 
technology in 1987. They also found out the Federal Communications 
Commission would not pass the technology because its signals 
interfere with other operations that use the nation's airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
	Reps. George Brown, D-Calif., and Bud Cramer, D-Ala., demanded  
Friday that the Energy Department investigate the commercialization 
of the so-called micropower pulse radar, or MIR, and the patenting 
dispute that remains under review by the Patent and Trademark 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressmen said the matter raises serious questions about  
technology transfers at federal research laboratories, where 
government scientists and private industry work together to develop 
commercial uses for groundbreaking technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is sufficient information to suggest that (Livermore)  
personnel engaged in activities that do not live up to the high 
professional and ethical standards expected of a federally funded 
entity,'' the congressmen wrote Energy Secretary Bill Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas McEwan, the former Livermore scientist who claims MIR,  
has insisted his technology differs significantly from the 
technology patented by Larry Fullerton, the scientist from 
Huntsville, Ala. Fullerton claims McEwan was tipped about the 
technology at a conference in 1990 where two papers describing 
Fullerton's findings were discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	McEwan, who has left Livermore and runs his own company  
developing MIR, told a colleague in a letter last year that ``the 
idea of MIR came ... in a flash of inspiration'' and had nothing to 
do with the 1990 meeting, according to congressional investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Patents and Trademark office sided, at least in part,  
with Fullerton last year and found that 12 of the 20 patents filed 
by Livermore were based on Fullerton's earlier patents. An appeal 
of that decision is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	C. Bruce Tarter, the federal laboratory's director, contends the  
Fullerton and McEwan devices differ sufficiently to lead him to 
believe the Livermore patents will be found valid. Livermore 
``proceeded in good faith to license MIR technology based on valid 
patents,'' Tarter wrote Brown last September. 
</P>
<P>
	McEwan as the inventor of MIR is believed to have received at  
least one-third of the licensing proceeds, and the rest went to the 
laboratory, investigators said. He could not be reached Friday for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	House investigators said they found substantial evidence that  
Livermore officials were far from candid about MIR when they 
aggressively marketed the technology to private businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The lab claimed MIR could immediately be incorporated into  
commercial products in the form of a chip for no more than $20 per 
device, investigators said, citing promotions to potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	When the lab submitted McEwan's invention for the prestigious  
National Medal of Technology award, it said the new radar 
``harnesses the speed of light, ... all for $10, doing what used to 
require equipment costing $40,000.'' McEwan won the award. 
</P>
<P>
	When companies signed up for licenses at $100,000 each, they  
were not told of the shadow hanging over the MIR patent, nor of the 
FCC's reservations about the technology. 
</P>
<P>
	But investigators found evidence that in 1994, McEwan was told  
by a senior FCC official in clear terms that the MIR technology 
would run into problems. He was told the equipment was prohibited 
under FCC regulations and would require a waiver, that it 
encroached on some restricted broadcast bands reserved for 
emergency use, and that without an FCC waiver devices containing 
the technology could not be sold legally.

<HEADLINE> Blue Grass Stakes Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- It's a year of big birthdays for the  
Kentucky Derby and one of its most-traveled steppingstones, the 
Blue Grass Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	A deep, strong field of eight Derby hopefuls is expected for  
today's 75th running of the 1 1/8-mile Blue Grass Stakes. All of them, 
with the possible exception of 30-1 longshot Prado's Landing, are 
being measured as possible entrants for the 125th running of the 
Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs on May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The field is the largest since 1993 for the $750,000 Blue Grass,  
sponsored by Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Zito's Wondertross, bred and co-owned by New York Yankees  
owner George Steinbrenner, was the early favorite coming off an 
impressive close and second-place finish to Vicar in the Florida 
Derby. Vicar was the early second choice, and the field also 
included Cat Thief, third in the Florida Derby, Louisiana Derby 
winner Kimberlite Pipe and Tampa Bay Derby winner Pineaff. 
</P>
<P>
	The other three expected starters in the Blue Grass were Lemon  
Drop Kid, Menifee and Prado's Landing. 
</P>
<P>
	The race is one of three Kentucky Derby prep events today. The  
others are the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct and Arkansas Derby at 
Oaklawn Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Prado's Landing is owned by the United Arab Emirates' Maktoum  
family, who are apparently using his Blue Grass performance as a 
measuring stick for how stablemates Worldly Manner and Aljabr, both 
likely Derby entrants, shape up against the top American 
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	With such a deep field, today's winner could well end up the  
early favorite for the Derby. That's a dubious distinction, one 
which has not translated into victory at Churchill Downs since 
Spectacular Bid in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless, history shows there's a good chance at least one of  
the colts running in the Blue Grass will make some Triple Crown 
noise. Since 1937, when the Blue Grass was first run at Keeneland, 
17 starters have gone on to win the Derby. The most recent was 
Thunder Gulch, who went from fourth in the Blue Grass to the Derby 
winner's circle in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	In the field of seven 3-year-olds in the $500,000 Arkansas Derby  
were Answer Lively, the 1998 champion 2-year-old colt, second to 
Blue Grass starter Kimberlite Pipe in the Louisiana Derby; Etbauer, 
winner of Oaklawn's Rebel, and Ecton Park, third in the Louisiana 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Badge was to try for was to try for a third straight win and  
fifth in his last six starts when he met 10 rivals in $500,000 Wood 
Memorial. His last victory was in the Gotham. Air Forbes Won, 
Badge's sire, won the Gotham and Wood Memorial in 1982, then 
finished seventh in the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the Wood were The Groom Is Red and Adonis, trained by  
Nick Zito, trainer of Wondertross. The Groom Is Red, who had a good 
2-year-old campaign, failed to win in his first three starts this 
year. In his last start, Adonis finished sixth in the Florida 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the three races was 1! miles. The Kentucky Derby is 1 1/4  
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Grass and Wood Memorial were to be televised by ABC  
from 5-6 p.m. EDT. The Arkansas Derby was to be on an ESPN telecast 
beginning at 6 p.m

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Eye Implants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tiny transparent rings implanted directly into  
the eye are offering a way for millions of mildly nearsighted 
Americans to attain clear, even perfect, vision without glasses or 
contact lenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration approved KeraVision Inc.'s  
Intacs corneal implants Friday, offering an alternative for some 
patients to popular but irreversible laser eye surgery at about the 
same price. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference: If patients don't like their Intacs, or suffer a  
side effect such as glare, doctors can remove the rings with a good 
chance of returning the eyes to pre-surgery condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA warned that the implants are only for mildly nearsighted  
people, whose vision is formally diagnosed as ``minus 1 diopters to 
minus 3 diopters.'' That roughly translates to vision ranging from 
20/40, where it's OK to drive but a movie is blurry without 
glasses, to about 20/300, where you can barely see the big ``E'' at 
the top of eye charts. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, laser surgery can sharpen the vision of people with  
much more severe nearsightedness. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the implants are ``really an interesting approach,'' said  
Dr. Susan Alpert, the FDA's medical device evaluation chief. ``It 
is a simple procedure. ... These can remain in permanently, but if 
there's a problem, they can be removed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patients say that's the feature that makes Intacs attractive.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'd considered laser surgery, but one of the biggest things  
that scared us ... is that if it didn't work, there's no way to 
change that,'' said Fran Palek, a Tampa, Fla., banker. So he, his 
wife, his neighbor and his neighbor's sister all tried the implants 
instead, and liked them. ``It's amazing,'' said Palek, 30, 
describing seeing with perfect vision immediately after the 
15-minute surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearsightedness occurs when the cornea, the membrane covering  
the front of the eye, is too steeply curved. Flattening the cornea 
helps correct nearsightedness. Hundreds of thousands of Americans 
have sought radial keratotomy, in which surgeons slice the cornea 
with a knife, or surgery with a laser that shaves the cornea to 
flatten it. 
</P>
<P>
	But those surgeries can be risky, sometimes causing problems  
with night vision, glare, seeing halos or blurry vision. Patients 
occasionally cannot see as well after surgery as before. Thus, most 
patients who choose these operations have fairly severe 
nearsightedness. 
</P>
<P>
	Intacs are two crescents about the thickness of a contact lens  
that form a ring around the cornea's edge. Their slight weight 
flattens the cornea without permanently destroying tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	In a yearlong study of 448 eyes, 97 percent saw 20/40 or better  
without glasses or contact lenses after the implant. About 74 
percent had 20/20 or better vision without glasses and 53 percent 
could see 20/16 -- the sharper vision required of combat pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Intacs require about a 15-minute operation. Eye drops numb the  
eye. The doctor cuts a tiny pocket into the cornea. A special 
device slips the crescents onto the cornea. A single stitch closes 
the wound. 
</P>
<P>
	Most patients achieved good vision in the implanted eye a day  
after surgery. One eye is implanted at a time, in case patients 
have problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The implants are not risk-free: Some 7 percent to 17 percent of  
patients suffered side effects similar to laser surgery, including 
glare, halos and problems with night vision. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-nine patients had their implants removed, including 15  
who were dissatisfied with their vision correction and 19 who had 
visual side effects. Removing the implant corrected more than 80 
percent of those side effects, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	As nearsighted people age, they also frequently need reading  
glasses, and Intacs won't help with that, Alpert warned. Also, the 
FDA ordered KeraVision to study Intacs' long-term benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	Intacs will cost $2,000 to $2,500 per eye, about the same as  
laser surgery. They are available immediately in Tampa; Washington, 
D.C.; Fayettesville, Ark.; St. Louis; Kansas City; New York City;

<HEADLINE> Hakkinen Wins Brazil GP Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO Brazil (AP) -- The McLarens of Mika Hakkinen and David  
Coulthard filled the front row for the Brazilian Grand Prix 
Saturday, both qualifying more than a half-second faster than the 
rest of the field. 
</P>
<P>
	A surprise was the Stewart-Ford of Brazilian Rubens Barrichello.  
He took the inside of the second row, more than .2 seconds ahead of 
Michael Schumacher and his Ferrari, which was more than a second 
behind the pole-winning Hakkinen. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen, of Finland, averaged 125.412 mph around the 2.687-mile  
Jose Carlos Pace track, just .147 seconds ahead of his Scottish 
teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	No one else in the 21-car field seriously threatened the  
McLarens, but Barrichello excited his countrymen with his fast lap. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher's best lap put him alongside Barrichello. Italy's  
Giancarlo Fisichella, in a Benetton, was fifth, and the other 
Ferrari, driven by Northern Ireland's Eddie Irvine, was sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen was pleased with his performance.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've made some radical changes to the car, but I haven't been  
able to feel 100 percent comfortable with it in any sector,'' 
Hakkinen said. ``But the pole position must mean we're getting it 
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coulthard praised his car's balance and reliability and said he  
felt very prepared. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't clinch the pole because I overdrove and flat-spotted  
a tire in my last run, so I had to be careful after that,'' 
Coulthard said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, I had one of the best laps in my entire career,''  
Barrichello said. ``I have been waiting for a good car all my life. 
It goes to prove that all I ever needed was a good car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he thought he had any chance of winning Sunday's race,  
Barrichello said, ``I don't think I can win if Mika and David are 
on the track. But, it isn't impossible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What I achieved today is a credit to the team and shows that  
Melbourne (where he finished fifth) was no fluke,'' Barrichello 
said. ``What we need for the race is reliability, which all teams 
struggle with at the start of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher was upset with his performance, saying, ``I did not  
expect to be one second off the pole time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We had hoped to be competitive from the start of the season,  
but it seems we have not achieved that,'' Schumacher said. ``It is 
unlikely we can close the gap between now and the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The field was reduced to 21 cars when Brazilian Ricardo Zonta of  
the British American team crashed during practice before 
qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	Zonta skidded out of control and smashed into a guardrail during  
the second practice session. 
</P>
<P>
	Zonta limped away from the wreckage and was taken by helicopter  
to a hospital where doctors confirmed he ruptured tendons in his 
left foot, ruling him out for Sunday's race.

<HEADLINE> Lindros Recovering From Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Eric Lindros was up and about today, a day  
after surgery to remove a hardened blood clot from his chest 
cavity. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Larry Kaiser, a chest surgeon who performed the procedure,  
said he is pleased with Lindros' progress. 
</P>
<P>
	``He look significantly better today than he did before the  
operation,'' Kaiser said. ``His film this morning looks great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser found the Flyers' star center walking up and down the  
hallway with his father, Carl Lindros. Lindros is expected to 
remain in the hospital until early next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctor said there was ``very little drainage'' from Lindros'  
chest overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser had removed a blood clot that was pressing against the  
lower lobe of Lindros' right lung, keeping it from fully expanding. 
Lindros underwent the 90-minute procedure after suffering a setback 
in his recovery from a collapsed lung. 
</P>
<P>
	About six pints of blood to seep into Lindros' chest after a 2-1  
victory over the Nashville Predators on April 1. Kaiser said the 
blood likely seeped from his lung, the result of a blow to his 
chest.

<HEADLINE> Love in Masters Contention Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Davis Love III knows the heartbreak of final  
round failures in the Masters. He gets another shot on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not that he has ever choked. It's just that whatever he  
shot wasn't low enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope all my experiences of playing back nines on Sunday  
at the Masters pays off,'' he said. ``I've been so close to 
winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Love shot a 2-under-par 70 on Saturday to pull within two shots  
of leader Jose Maria Olazabal and one of Greg Norman. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's right where you want to be,'' the 1997 PGA champion said.  
``There is a big group of guys who can win. Somebody will shoot a 
nice low score and win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Love came the closest to winning a green jacket in 1995. He shot  
6-under-par 66 on Sunday but lost by a shot to inspired Ben 
Crenshaw, who birdied the 16th and 17 holes to win his second 
Masters. Crenshaw had served as pallbearer for his teacher, Harvey 
Pennick, on the day before the tournament started. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I couldn't win, I'm glad Ben did,'' Love said at the time.  
</P>
<P>
	Love came right back to shoot 68 in the final round of the 1996  
tournament. It was good for seventh place the year that Nick Faldo 
beat Norman to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Love shot 71 in the final round of the 1997 tournament and  
finished seventh again as Tiger Woods won with a record 
18-under-par total. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all my experiences will at least help me be  
comfortable on Sunday,'' Love said. ``There's a lot of pressure and 
it can be a nervewracking day. But winning the PGA helped me a 
lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Love said the good thing about Augusta National is that no lead  
is safe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look what Steve Pate did today,'' Love said. ``He was 2-over  
when the day started and he was 5-under when it ended. There's 
always a chance on Sunday at the Masters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Love will tee off with playing partner Pate just in front of the  
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be excited and scared at the same time,'' Love said.  
``But I'll be right where I want to be.''

<HEADLINE> Nissan Sought Iacocca To Pitch Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Lee Iacocca, a pitchman for Nissan cars?  
</P>
<P>
	A Nissan executive says he tried unsuccessfully to get the  
former Chrysler Corp. chairman to appear in a series of ads for the 
Japanese automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question was, how could we cut through the clutter with TV  
ads last December?'' Mike Seergy, vice president and general 
manager of Nissan's U.S. operations, told Friday's Detroit News. 
``It just popped in my head that someone who personified 
`turnaround' was Iacocca.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iacocca helped Chrysler emerge from a downward spiral in the  
1970s to a resurgence in the 80s, and had been critical of Japanese 
car makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Seergy hoped to battle a decline in sales and image by featuring  
ads with Iacocca saying, ``Nissan makes great cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plans for a series of ads were made, but came undone after  
Iacocca said he wanted to look into ``cross-marketing deals'' 
involving his electric bicycle venture, the News reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Iacocca has downplayed his dealings with Nissan in the past, the  
paper said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Chiquita Lawyer Wants Dismissal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A former lawyer for Chiquita asked a judge to  
dismiss all charges against him in the investigation of voice-mail 
theft at the banana company. 
</P>
<P>
	George Ventura, now an attorney in Salt Lake City, is accused of  
stealing voice mail from Chiquita Brands International Inc. for a 
newspaper investigation of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura filed a motion Friday that claims prosecutors unfairly  
targeted him while ignoring other suspects and methods they used 
violated his constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
	He has pleaded innocent to five counts of unlawful interception  
of communications and five counts of unauthorized access to 
computer systems. He could get 12 1/2 years in prison if convicted. 
His trial date is scheduled for April 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters Michael Gallagher and Cameron McWhirter relied on  
voice mail messages in a package of stories last May by The 
Cincinnati Enquirer that accused Cincinnati-based Chiquita of 
improper dealings in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, the Enquirer fired Gallagher, apologized on its front  
page to Chiquita and paid the company more than $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher pleaded guilty in September to felony charges and is  
awaiting sentencing that could range from 2 1/2 years in prison to 
probation. At a court hearing last week, Gallagher identified 
Ventura as one of his confidential sources. 
</P>
<P>
	McWhirter has not been charged and now works for The Detroit  
News. The News and the Enquirer are both owned by Gannett Co. Inc.

<HEADLINE> Power Plants Drilled for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The electric power industry says a  
much-hyped test of its readiness for the Year 2000 bug was a 
success. But skeptics still wonder if the New Year will dawn in 
darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, critics say, is that Friday's drill didn't tell  
consumers anything about whether power will keep flowing to their 
switches in the event of massive computer glitches. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been planning this drill since the beginning of the  
year,'' said Randy Guidry, managing editor of Y2K News Magazine. 
``I would compare it to a student in high school taking a test 
after he's had three months to make up the questions on the test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Power plants across the country shared information via radio  
rather than computer Friday to test whether they could keep the 
lights on even if the Y2K bug knocks out communications. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's power grids depend on communications between  
generating stations so that operators can send electricity to 
regions that need it the most from power plants able to provide it. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers at hundreds of sites called in meter readings via  
handheld radios and logged in data manually, rather than using 
computers hooked together via fiber-optic lines and microwave 
transmitters. 
</P>
<P>
	``People just flick a switch and expect their power to go on,  
but it's important to ensure that the grid is reliable and 
communications are a piece of that,'' said Tom Williams, spokesman 
for Duke Energy Power Services, which has three plants in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	The drill was a success, according to a news release posted on  
the Web site of the North American Electric Reliability Council, a 
New Jersey-based industry group assigned by the U.S. Department of 
Energy to make sure the nation's utilities are ready for the new 
millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the council said some backup systems did not work as  
planned and some workers may require additional training on the 
satellite voice systems. The group also said severe lightning 
storms in the Midwest interfered with some radio systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of the council would not comment on the tests  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Utility customers weren't affected because the drill did not  
test electricity production. And that's what concerns observers 
like Guidry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today doesn't have anything to do with the ability to produce  
energy,'' he said. ``It has to do with their ability to talk to 
each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem occurs because many computers are programmed to  
recognize only the last two digits of a year and, without repairs, 
may malfunction beginning Jan. 1 when they might assume it is 1900. 
Some fear national communication and power systems could be 
disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	NERC's job is to help make sure electrical utilities are ready  
for the possibility of a Y2K glitch and spotty outages or -- a 
worse-case scenario -- complete electricity shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``The loonies out there who are profiting by panic over Y2K may  
not have it quite right,'' said John Castagna, a spokesman for the 
Washington-based Edison Electric Institute, an industry group whose 
members generate about three-quarters of the country's electricity. 
``We're working hard to make sure January 1, 2000, is just like 
every other day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Cowles, author of ``Electric Utilities and Y2K,'' praised  
the communications drill. But he said there is no way to replicate 
the conditions plants may encounter on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Testing a portion of the entire Y2K program is part of the  
contingency planning,'' he said. ``But this is a drill -- a drill 
that's not operationally testing anything. There's no way to test 
absolutely everything.''

<HEADLINE> Principal Charged in Cocaine Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A principal known for her good works and tough  
words about drug abuse has been charged with running a narcotics 
ring at her elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
	Delores Hill, 53, was accused at her arraignment Friday of being  
the leader of a small drug ring at the Tabernacle Church of God 
Elementary School in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hill allegedly sold $25 bags of cocaine to an undercover  
policewoman on school grounds. She was arrested along with the 
school nurse, a janitor and another worker. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities -- who shut down the private, 160-student school --  
said the defendants dealt drugs to adults behind the scenes while 
children were busy in class. But Ms. Hill allegedly made one sale 
while baby-sitting two infants in her office, said prosecutor 
Patricia Gatling. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hill was charged with felony sale and possession of a  
controlled substance. She pleaded innocent, and was being held on 
$250,000 bail. The maximum sentence for the charges is 25 years in 
prison. Her attorney, Frank Paone, would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The janitor, Steven Donawa, 42, was arrested after he stopped by  
Ms. Hill's apartment and left carrying 51 bags of cocaine, 
prosecutors said. School nurse Patricia Kersey, 41, was charged 
with participating in two drug sales. Laverne Prescod, 42, a school 
counselor, was charged in one drug sale. All the defendants pleaded 
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hill had been quoted in the past as an outspoken opponent of  
drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	``There needs to be more drug education, especially for  
parents,'' she told Newsday in 1990. ``Our second graders know more 
about drugs than some of the parents.''

<HEADLINE> Rodman's Wacky Ways Excused in L.A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Dennis Rodman has certainly lived up to  
his reputation as weird and distracting 21 games into his Los 
Angeles Lakers career. 
</P>
<P>
	The team wanted his rebounding and defense, which it got. But  
he's done plenty to disrupt, too -- arriving late, not showing up at 
all, taking a leave of absence, refusing to go into games, getting 
ejected and ripping his teammates for their lack of effort. 
</P>
<P>
	It's enough to make Jerry West squirm.  
</P>
<P>
	In one of this city's worst-kept secrets, the team's executive  
vice president -- and classiest Laker of all -- didn't want the 
seven-time NBA rebounding champion, but freewheeling owner Jerry 
Buss insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dennis is a talent,'' said Buss, who seems to view Rodman as a  
kindred spirit when it comes to partying. 
</P>
<P>
	During their walk on the wild side, the players are still making  
excuses for the pierced, tattooed and dyed wonder known as the 
Worm. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hasn't been negative that much,'' said Shaquille O'Neal,  
who openly campaigned to get Rodman. ``The stuff that he does or 
did, we all knew it was coming and we all were prepared for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, maybe not for all of Rodman's antics. He put the Lakers on  
hold for three weeks before signing, angering part-owner Magic 
Johnson, who spoke for many when he said, ``He's driving me 
crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was just the beginning.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodman disappeared two weeks after joining the Lakers, missing  
four games while he contemplated his basketball future and gambled 
in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bizarre behavior by most standards; normal for Rodman. He got  
paid during the absence, but said he was fined $100 a day for 
delaying his return. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just gracious of them to let him go to Vegas and do  
some gambling,'' O'Neal said without laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	What have the Lakers gotten in return? An 18-4 record with him  
in the lineup and 11.5 rebounds in 28.8 minutes per game. Without 
Rodman, they are 9-9 and the rebounding falls to O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I play basketball and I understand the game,'' said Rodman,  
whose personal distractions now include a pending divorce from 
actress wife Carmen Electra. ``I try to let the other players see 
me working hard and watch how I play, and hopefully, they will say, 
`Let's do it, too. He cannot do it all by himself.''' 
</P>
<P>
	That's why his teammates excuse him.  
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of guys in the league and coaches say things about him,  
but they'd all kill to have a guy as dedicated as Dennis,'' forward 
J.R. Reid said. ``He brings a lot to our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly not camaraderie.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodman dresses -- itself a fascinating adventure -- separately  
from his teammates and doesn't talk to them much. When he's not in 
the game, he's rarely on the bench. Instead, he rides an exercise 
bike to stay loose. 
</P>
<P>
	Three times, Rodman has refused coach Kurt Rambis' requests to  
enter games, saying he had been out too long and his muscles were 
tight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand ballplayers get stiff, but that's your job to be  
ready the entire basketball game. It doesn't matter if you play two 
seconds or you play 48 minutes,'' Rambis said Friday after Rodman 
refused to return to the court during the Lakers' 96-89 victory 
over the Minnesota Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman spent the entire fourth quarter on the bench despite the  
crowd chanting his name with three minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman went unpunished for the previous two refusals, and it was  
not known Saturday whether he would be reprimanded for his third. 
</P>
<P>
	Though frustrated, his teammates appear tolerant.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have to go to the movies together, eat dinner  
together and do all that,'' O'Neal said. ``But when we're on the 
court, we all have to play together and everybody just has to do 
their part, whether we like each other or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the fans don't seem to mind. ``Rodman Rules'' and ``Dennis  
the Menace'' were signs held up at the Forum recently. His name is 
welcomed as loudly as that of O'Neal or Kobe Bryant during 
introductions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's fourth-quarter ejection after a second technical foul  
against Golden State April 3 was cheered, even though the Lakers 
trailed by four at the time and lost by five. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're all cheering his name out there because he works hard  
and his work ethic is incredible,'' Reid said. ``Everything 
concerning basketball you want any player to emulate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Except for the ejections (two) and technical fouls (11). He has  
almost half of the team's 25 technicals. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order for them to do something, I think he's going to have  
to control himself,'' Warriors guard John Starks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Something, of course, is compete for a championship, which  
Rodman has done often in his career. He has five rings, two with 
Detroit and three with Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	But can anyone tame Rodzilla enough in Los Angeles?  
</P>
<P>
	``You don't know what he's going to do, when he's going to do  
it,'' former Lakers point guard Nick Van Exel said. ``Who's going 
to contain him?

<P>
	``In Chicago, he had Michael (Jordan) and Scottie (Pippen).  
Here, he's the man, he's won all the championships. Who's he going 
to respect? Who's he going to listen to? 
</P>
<P>
	``Jerry West is not coaching him, Magic is not coaching, so I  
don't know if he respects Shaq as much as he probably should.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The discord triggered by Rodman isn't new to the Lakers. They  
experienced it the past few years with Van Exel, who was traded to 
Denver on draft day last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The fiery guard feuded with former coach Del Harris during the  
playoffs, got suspended for shoving an official and pouted when he 
was unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was never that crazy,'' Van Exel said, comparing himself to  
Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	For most of their 50 seasons in the NBA, the Lakers have been a  
tame team, winning 11 championships in a dignified way. But that 
was before Rodman arrived in this lockout-shortened season of 
tumult. 
</P>
<P>
	Signing him was one of many moves the Lakers made this season:  
Harris was fired before he could coach Rodman and replaced by 
assistant Rambis; sharpshooter Glen Rice and Reid were added in a 
trade of popular guard Eddie Jones and center Elden Campbell, and 
guard Derek Harper was signed as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's presence has given the mixture volatility.  
</P>
<P>
	``Dennis is Dennis,'' Buss has said. ``You're not about to tell  
Dennis how to be someone else. You take him the way he is.''

<HEADLINE> Skating Coach May Face Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Craig Maurizi, a former student and then a  
colleague of famed skating coach Richard Callaghan, has accused his 
former mentor of involving him in an inappropriate sexual 
relationship, The New York Times reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper quoted Maurizi, 36, as saying the sexual  
relationship began in 1981 after Callaghan moved to Philadelphia to 
coach and Maurizi, then a student, followed. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time, I thought the sex was consensual,'' the newspaper  
quoted Maurizi as saying. ``Now when I look back, I don't think it 
was consensual. I don't care how old a student is, whether it's a 
boy or a girl, a coach should never have sex with a student.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Callaghan, who coached Tara Lipinski to an Olympic gold medal  
and Todd Eldredge to five national titles and a world championship, 
resigned as director of skating for the Detroit Skating Club in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaghan denied any sexual relationship with Maurizi and  
contended the allegations were a ploy to take over Detroit Skating 
Club skaters still being instructed by Callaghan. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Disbrow, head of the U.S. Figure Skating Association, said  
Maurizi informed him last month of his allegations. Disbrow said 
his organization couldn't act until it receives a formal complaint, 
which the newspaper said Maurizi planned to submit in a couple 
weeks.

<HEADLINE> US Calls Increase for Ground Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Failure to win release of three U.S. soldiers  
and continued defiance by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic are 
increasing calls in Congress for President Clinton to acknowledge 
that ground forces may be needed to fight the war in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``America, wake up; Europe is at war, and we are in it,'' said  
Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind., one of 11 lawmakers just back from a 
visit to NATO headquarters and American troops in Europe. Nine of 
them sent a letter to Clinton on Friday urging him to abandon his 
opposition to a ground offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration continues to oppose inserting American ground  
forces into the conflict, but it said Friday it will soon send more 
warplanes into the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress returns Monday from a two-week spring recess, and  
members are becoming increasingly vocal in addressing the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton reiterated on Friday that NATO would keep up the  
pressure on Milosevic, even as his administration continued to rule 
out ground forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Milosevic still thinks he can manipulate the situation by  
cynically using innocent people,'' Clinton said in brief remarks. 
``He hopes that we will accept as permanent the results of his 
ethnic cleansing. We will not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said they were disappointed, but not  
surprised, by the failure of a Cypriot leader to win release of 
three U.S. soldiers held by Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Pentagon, spokesman Kenneth Bacon cited reports that  
young Kosovar Albanian women had been herded into a Serb army 
training camp near Djakovica in southwest Kosovo, where they were 
raped and up to 20 killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very eerie and disturbing echo of documented  
instances of rape and killing of women in Bosnia during the Bosnian 
war,'' Bacon said. ``And it is obviously outrageous that this is 
occurring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon also said Defense Secretary William Cohen was expected  
soon to approve a request by NATO's military commander, Army Gen. 
Wesley Clark, for ``dozens'' more warplanes to supplement some 600 
NATO aircraft, half of them Americans. Bombers, fighters, 
radar-jamming planes and refueling tankers are part of the request. 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, all but two of the 11 lawmakers who accompanied  
Cohen to Europe earlier this week urged Clinton to drop his 
opposition to planning for a possible ground war. The group met 
with NATO military planners in Brussels, Belgium, and visited 
American pilots and support forces at air bases in Italy and 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the air campaign succeeds in significantly degrading  
Yugoslavia's military capability, ``there is less certainty that 
NATO's broader objectives in Kosovo ... will be achieved,'' they 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe it prudent for the United States to urge NATO to  
plan for additional military missions, including the use of ground 
forces, in the event that proves necessary to carry out such 
missions to achieve NATO's broader objective -- reversing 
Milosevic's genocide actions in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawmakers said the administration must ``reinforce the point  
to the American public that NATO's efforts could require many more 
weeks or months to succeed.'' And, they said, ``the American public 
also needs to be better prepared for the likelihood of alliance 
casualties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Signing the letter were Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz.; Carl Levin,  
D-Mich.; Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.; Jack Reed, D-R.I.; and Chuck 
Hagel, R-Neb; and Reps. Ike Skelton, D-Mo.; Steve Buyer, R-Ind.; 
Jim Turner, D-Texas; and Ellen Tauscher, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Not signing were Reps. John Spratt, D-S.C.; and Sam Gejdenson,  
D-Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., and others plan to  
introduce a measure Monday that would invoke the war powers act and 
deny funds for a ground campaign unless specifically approved by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have learned the hard way, in Vietnam, Lebanon, Somalia and  
Bosnia, that we cannot solve all the world's pressing problems with 
American ground troops,'' said Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., a co-sponsor.

<HEADLINE> Maiden Valhol Wins Arkansas Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -- Valhol, a maiden making just his third  
start, took the lead on the far turn and then pulled away down the 
stretch to win the $500,000 Arkansas Derby on Saturday at Oaklawn 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Trained by Dallas Keen and ridden by Billy Patin, Valhol came  
into the Grade II race for 3-year-olds off a second in a maiden 
race in New Orleans in February and a fourth in the Louisiana Derby 
four weeks ago when he went off at 107-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Certain, who was fourth in the Florida Derby in his last start,  
was a distant second in the field of seven. Torrid Sand, the only 
horse to go off at longer odds than the winner, was third. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who finished out of the money were 2-year-old  
champion Answer Lively, Rebel Stakes winner Etbauer and Ecton Park, 
who was beaten a neck in the Louisiana Derby and had won the Risen 
Star. 
</P>
<P>
	The $300,000 first-place check gave Valhol the graded stakes  
earnings needed to compete in the Kentucky Derby, if the field tops 
20 and his owner James D. Jackson decides to take him to 
Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ready for 'em,'' Jackson said. ``That's our next step.''  
</P>
<P>
	The son of Diazo covered 1 1/8 miles in 1:49.1 and paid $62.80,  
$18.80 and $9.80. Certain returned $5.20 and $4, while Torrid Sand 
paid $6 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Saint's Honor, wearing blinkers for the first time, took the  
early lead with Valhol on his hip. 
</P>
<P>
	They stayed that way down the backstretch with Answer Lively  
third on the outside. Etbauer began to move along the rail heading 
into the turn and Answer Lively began to close on the leaders. But, 
Valhol passed Saint's Honor on the turn and began to widen his lead 
as he hit the stretch.

<HEADLINE> Menifee Wins Kentucky Derby Prep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Turning for home, Pat Day might have had  
second thoughts about choosing to ride Menifee instead of Cat Thief 
in the Blue Grass Stakes on Saturday at Keeneland. 
</P>
<P>
	With a quarter mile left, Cat Thief, ridden by Mike Smith, was  
in the lead and Menifee was fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	At the wire, however, Menifee was first and Day had his third  
Blue Grass victory and his horse for the Kentucky Derby on May 1 at 
Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Day, who had ridden Cat Thief in that colt's previous five  
starts and now has ridden Menifee in his last four, chose Menifee 
despite the colt finishing second in the Tampa Bay Derby on March 
21. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it was all said and done, we thought this horse had a lot  
of room for improvement,'' Day said. ``He showed today he'll take 
it on the chin and keep running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Elliott Walden joked: ``I twisted his (Day) arm on the  
way back from Tampa and it worked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the top of the stretch, Cat Thief was first, followed by  
Kimberlite Pipe, Vicar and 9-5 favorite Wondertross. Then Menifee, 
four horses wide, charged down the stretch and swept into the lead 
with about a sixteenth of a mile remaining for his second victory 
in three starts this year and fourth in five career outings. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee went 1 1/8 miles in 1:48 3-5. All horses carried 123  
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The winning colt finished 1 1/4 lengths ahead of Cat Thief, who has  
two seconds and two thirds in four stakes starts this year. Vicar, 
the Florida Derby winner, finished another half-length back and 2 1/2 
lengths in front of Louisiana Derby winner Kimberlite Pipe. 
</P>
<P>
	Completing the order of finish were Lemon Drop Kid, Wondertross,  
Pineaff and Prado's Landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Wondertross is trained by Nick Zito, who also trains Adonis,  
winner of the Wood Memorial on Saturday at Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee, owned by Arthur B. Hancock III and James H. Stone and  
bred by Hancock, earned $465,000 from a $750,000 purse and paid 
$17.40, $8.80 and $5.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief returned $7 and $4.60 and Vicar, ridden by Shane  
Sellers, paid $3.60. 
</P>
<P>
	The farthest Menifee had been in four previous starts was 1 1-16  
miles in the Tampa Bay Derby. As for his ability to go 1 1/8 miles and 
then the Derby distance of 1 1/4 miles, Walden, second in the Derby 
last year with Victory Gallop, said, ``I felt like he had to prove 
it to us. ... He was moving stronger than ever at the finish and he 
galloped out well. I feel good about going a mile and a quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief and Vicar certainly will join Menifee in the Kentucky  
Derby. So probably will Kimberlite Pipe, Lemon Drop Kid and 
Wondertross, who was beaten 6 1/4 lengths by Menifee. 
</P>
<P>
	Hancock, who won the Derby with Gato Del Sol in 1982, is a  
Kentucky breeder whose father was the famed Bull Hancock. He said 
he was asked Friday night whether he'd rather win the Blue Grass or 
the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I've been blessed to win the Derby,'' he said. ``I'd  
like to win the Blue Grass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hancock would take a second Derby victory, too.

<HEADLINE> Niger To Name New President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NIAMEY, Niger (AP) -- Military leaders in the West African nation  
of Niger called an emergency meeting today to name a new head of 
state after bodyguards gunned down the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after President Ibrahim Bare Mainassara's assassination  
early Friday, Prime Minister Ibrahim Assane Mayaki disbanded the 
National Assembly and temporarily suspended all political parties. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear who would take power but Western diplomats said  
the army was in charge, at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
	``The military definitely has a monopoly on arms here and is in  
control of the security situation,'' a Western diplomat said on 
condition of anonymity. ``It's heartening that they have not 
appointed a military government. There are indications they want a 
government of a civilian character.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The airport and international borders remained officially closed  
and residents of the capital, Niamey, said small groups of soldiers 
patrolled the streets. But Friday's heavy military presence at key 
government buildings had diminished by this morning and citizens 
returned to work. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief radio address Friday, Mayaki, the prime minister,  
referred to Bare's death as an ``unfortunate accident,'' and said a 
new government would soon be formed including opposition 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses to the assassination told reporters in Niamey that  
Bare's bodyguards shot him as he prepared to board a helicopter at 
the airport to visit the western border with Mali. 
</P>
<P>
	His chief bodyguard, Tilly Smael, was also gunned down when he  
tried to return fire. Witnesses said others may have been wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Bare's killing caps a tumultuous week in which opposition called  
for his resignation, accusing his government of orchestrating 
attacks against vote-counters tallying results of February's 
regional and municipal elections in a bid to avert defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Bare seized power in a coup three years ago by ousting the  
country's first democratically elected government. He placed 
then-President Mahamane Ousmane under house arrest but released him 
three months later. 
</P>
<P>
	Bare, a former army colonel, said he staged the coup because  
Ousmane had failed to address Niger's economic and political 
problems. The country of 9.7 million people on the southern edge of 
the Sahara Desert is one of the world's poorest. 
</P>
<P>
	After taking power, Bare's government faced continued  
challenges, quelling army uprisings and mutinies last year and 
facing down student and opposition protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Two leading opposition politicians, including a former prime  
minister, and five army commandos were arrested early last year for 
allegedly plotting to kill the president. Critics said the 
allegations were fabricated to justify a crackdown on political 
opponents.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Worries Boost Sale of Seeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROBESONIA, Pa. (AP) -- The big plastic container under Ralph  
Kellner's Christmas tree was labeled Y2K EMERGENCY KIT. Inside were 
duct tape, a fortune cookie, some fish hooks and Twinkies -- 
``Expiration date: 1-3000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But among the gag gifts from his children were instructions that  
struck Kellner as entirely logical: ``Plant seeds in spring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joke all you want, he told his kids, but we're doing just that.  
And seed companies say the Kellners are not alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing power outages, empty grocery shelves and food  
distribution chaos, many Americans are stocking up on canning gear 
and planting apocalyptic vegetable gardens: potatoes, cabbage, 
beans, carrots -- anything that will keep through the winter of 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting a lot of calls in our customer service  
department from people who have never planted a seed in their 
life,'' says Renee Beaulieu of Shepherd's Garden Seeds in 
Torrington, Conn. ``Questions from people who have zero experience, 
but a lot of ambition -- plowing up your entire back yard is not 
normally how you'd start gardening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K bug is a programming glitch that, come Jan. 1, could  
cause computers to think the year 2000 is really 1900 and chew up 
reams of data that run modern lives. Industry and government 
disagree about how widespread problems will be, and some companies 
see opportunity in the confusion. 
</P>
<P>
	On its Web site, Heirloom Seeds in West Elizabeth trumpets the  
``Y2K Special,'' $115 worth of seeds for 92 vegetables and herbs. A 
bigger set includes 254 seed packs for $299.99. 
</P>
<P>
	Territorial Seed Co. in Cottage Grove, Ore., says its Millennium  
Victory Garden kit is its best-selling item ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeds of Change in Santa Fe, N.M., recommends ``survival  
seeds,'' from arugula to turnips. 
</P>
<P>
	And Millennium Seeds, a company started two years ago by Michael  
Morris, a Livermore, Colo., computer salesman worried about the Y2K 
bug, has seen monthly sales increase eight-fold since Jan. 1, from 
about $3,000 to more than $25,000 in early March. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in marketing all my life, so I know a good market  
when I see one,'' says Morris, who quit his job to start Millennium 
Seeds. ``We were out there buying seeds and I said, `Wow, this is 
an awesome market.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Gardener's Supply Co. in Burlington, Vt., reports increased  
sales of greenhouses ($300 to $3,000) and rain barrels ($110). 
</P>
<P>
	The Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry in Manitowoc, Wis., says sales of  
canning equipment have doubled. 
</P>
<P>
	Even companies ignoring Y2K marketing opportunities say they are  
inundated. Venerable W. Atlee Burpee &AMP; Co. in Warminster and 
Johnny's Selected Seed in Albion, Maine, report upticks since 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the sales boom is in so-called heirloom seeds. These  
come from open-pollinated plants, meaning gardeners can gather new 
seeds from this year's produce and plant them next year. They can't 
do that with the more common hybrid seeds, which are designed to 
resist certain pests or diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of dozen people called and said they want one of  
everything that is an heirloom in our catalog,'' marvels Ellen 
Ogden, founder of The Cook's Garden in Londonderry, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
	This spring's catalog for Chattanooga Shooting Supplies, a  
Tennessee mail-order company, offers packets of heirloom seeds 
alongside gun sights and ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know how bad it's going to be,'' says company buyer  
Bob Johnston. ``One thing we're not going to do is not make money 
on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ogden calls the whole phenomenon ``ridiculous.''  
</P>
<P>
	But Tom Johns, president of Territorial Seeds, wants to be ready  
for whatever happens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to put myself in their position and say, `What  
would I want on my shelf?''' he says. ``Whether the problems 
associated with Y2K come along or not, they're going to have a real 
good collection of seeds. It wouldn't hurt if people could be more 
self-sufficient anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bernie Crooks, 76, knows something about self-sufficiency. She's  
talked about Y2K and gardening to parishioners at church in 
Clarion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm old enough that I lived during the Depression, and we  
turned a whole back yard into a garden. My mother canned. I was 
only 6 or 7 then, but I have strong memories,'' Ms. Crooks says. 
``My granddaughter said, `Oh, it can't happen.' I said, `OK, honey. 
But if it does happen, your grandma has some rolled oats.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kellners are former commercial artists from Brooklyn, N.Y.,  
who moved to rural Berks County, 60 miles from Philadelphia, 18 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Kellner has researched the millennium bug, read  
information from every reasonable source he can find, watched 
congressional hearings on C-SPAN and talked with friends in 
computer programming. 
</P>
<P>
	All of it convinced him the power will fail at the start of  
2000, for several weeks to a few months. So he and his wife, Mary, 
both 65, bought a generator to run the freezer and pump water from 
their 200-foot-deep well. They've filled four blue tubs with soup, 
rice and canned tuna. And they are planting vegetables in six beds 
covering 350 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Kellner has never preserved food, but she plans to learn.  
Winter squash, carrots and potatoes will go into the root cellar 
under the garage. Tomatoes will make sauces. Corn she will freeze; 
beans she will dry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to do it, too,'' Ralph Kellner says, ``and I'm the  
worst gardener in the world. I've been living here for almost 20 
years, and I've had a vegetable garden and each year I've neglected 
it. It's the joke of all our friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This year,'' his wife says, ``we decided we better get  
serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if Y2K glitches never occur or are solved in days?  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll save a heck of a lot of money,'' Mary Kellner says,  
``because we won't have to go to the food store.''

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eva S. Cockcroft, an art professor and  
muralist whose works grace walls from Germany to Los Angeles, died 
April 1 of breast cancer. She was 62. 
</P>
<P>
	Cockcroft taught art history at California State University,

</P>
<P>
	She made murals in New York City and New Jersey until she moved

	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Raymond F. ``Bud'' Harvison, who spent  
42 years as a newsman for The Associated Press, died Saturday. He 
was 71 and had been in ill health. 
</P>
<P>
	A Seattle native, Harvison joined the AP there in 1947 after a

</P>
<P>
	The Orioles made it to five World Series between 1965 and 1979  
when Hoffberger owned the team. He also ran the National Brewing 
Co. for 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1983, Town &AMP; Country magazine described Hoffberger as one of  
the nation's ``most generous living Americans'' and said he had 
donated more than $10 million to charity at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1965, Mr. Hoffberger, who was born in Baltimore, assumed the  
principal ownership of the Orioles, but in 1977 made clear that 
financially all was not well with the team. Two years later, he 
sold the team to Washington lawyer Edward Bennett Williams for $12 
million.

<P>
	Mrs. Mayer, known as Helen Aberson when she wrote ``Dumbo, the  
Flying Elephant,'' moved from Syracuse to California in 1939 at the 
request of the Walt Disney Company.

<P>
	Following the 1940 release of the animated film ``Pinocchio,''  
Disney used Miss Aberson's tale of a flying elephant to create one 
of the most easily recognizable cartoon characters and stories.

	In the story, Dumbo the baby elephant is teased for his  
oversized ears, but eventually becomes a circus star when he 
realizes his ears allow him to fly.

<HEADLINE> FAA To Test Computers for Y2K Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Airline executives, government officials and air  
traffic controllers waited expectantly Saturday for the outcome of 
Federal Aviation Administration Year 2000 computer tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The live four-hour tests at Denver International Airport,  
scheduled to end Sunday at 2 a.m. MDT (4 a.m. EDT), were aimed 
partially at boosting public confidence in the nation's 
computerized aviation system when the century changes at midnight 
Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Some travelers have sworn off flying that night, fearing that  
planes may collide or fall out of the sky on Jan. 1, 2000, because 
of computer glitches. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of a programming technique used in early computers, some  
software views years in two-digit format, such as ``99'' for 1999. 
There is widespread uneasiness that unless software is patched or 
rewritten, computers will malfunction when the century ends and the 
calendar changes from ``99'' to ``00,'' which the two-digit 
computers may interpret as 1900 instead of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA officials think they have eliminated any potential problems  
through software changes made to computers which track planes from 
takeoff to landing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very confident the test will be successful, because we  
have done some dry runs on it,'' said Ray Long, head of the FAA's 
Y2K program. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who planned to observe the tests were FAA  
Administrator Jane Garvey, officials of the major airlines' trade 
organization and the largest air traffic controllers union and 
representatives of aerospace manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	The union, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, is  
urging the FAA to schedule extra workers, develop a written 
emergency procedures manual, stockpile battery-operated radios and 
expand normal safety margins around airplanes as the clock ticks 
toward midnight Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of those elements are already part of agency contingency  
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The tests were being conducted during the midnight hours to  
minimize any risk to the flying public.

<HEADLINE> FBI Raids Home of Accused Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- FBI agents searched the home of a fired  
Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist for nearly six hours 
Saturday, hauling away boxes of evidence in their investigation 
into whether nuclear weapons secrets were leaked to China. 
</P>
<P>
	The raid at the single-story brick and wooden home of Wen Ho Lee  
pierced the tranquility of the suburban neighborhood just outside 
Los Alamos where the Taiwan-born American scientist lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of commotion going on. People were driving by,  
neighbors were outside and agents were coming and going,'' said 
Phillip Warnock, a neighbor who also works at the Los Alamos 
laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	Warnock said Lee, who hasn't spoken publicly since he was fired  
earlier this year on suspicions he may have given nuclear secrets 
to China, emerged briefly from his home without speaking. ``He 
looked like he was going to prune the tree outside'' then spotted a 
cameraman and retreated inside, Warnock said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said the search  
was part of ``the ongoing investigation of alleged espionage'' at 
U.S. nuclear weapons laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said the FBI is ``pursuing this case vigorously, and  
the Department of Energy is supporting the law enforcement effort 
fully. We've also taken a number of actions to ensure strong 
protection of the national security capabilities at Energy 
Department labs, now and in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee has not been charged with any wrongdoing, and FBI officials  
caution they may not have a criminal case when their investigation 
ends. ``No inference of guilt should be taken in regard to the 
search warrant,'' FBI special agent Doug Beldon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The search occurred the day after Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji  
wrapped up a trip to Washington that included meetings with 
President Clinton and congressional leaders. China denies stealing 
any U.S. secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation began in 1996 into whether Lee transferred  
intelligence on the W-88 nuclear warhead during the Reagan 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	China's government-run Xinhua News Agency reported last month  
that Lee attended two conferences with Chinese counterparts in the 
1980s but said no secrets were passed.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Welfare Rolls Fall Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton used the latest report of  
shrinking welfare rolls -- cut nearly in half since 1993 -- to prod 
Congress for child care, housing and transportation programs that 
he said will move even more welfare recipients into jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	He also announced final regulations that give states greater  
leeway in using federal welfare grants to set up such programs 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``With these steps, we can make the legacy of welfare dependency  
a memory of the 20th century,'' Clinton said Saturday in his weekly 
radio address. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, just over 7.6 million Americans were receiving  
public assistance at the end of December, down from almost 8 
million at the end of September and 14.3 million in 1994, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can see the evidence of our progress in communities across  
our country,'' Clinton said. ``You can see it on inner-city streets 
where a new storefront -- tax preparing businesses -- are helping 
people file their income tax returns, some for the very first time 
in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``April 15 may not be the most favorite day for Americans, but  
for these people it's a cause for celebration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the president announced the number of people  
on welfare had fallen to its lowest level in 30 years. Saturday's 
figures show a further decrease of 340,000 recipients in the three 
months from October through December 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The new regulations enforce part of the welfare overhaul law  
that Congress enacted in 1996 and holds states to task for moving 
welfare recipients into jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton said the rules also make it easier for states to  
use existing welfare block grants to pay for welfare-to-work social 
services, he also pushed Congress for additional child care, 
transportation, job training and housing money. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton praised last month's Senate vote to budget $12 billion  
over 10 years for child care for low-income families. ``Frankly, I 
hope they will also pass the rest of my childcare proposal to give 
tax credits and other support to working families,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's 2000 budget seeks $1 billion to help  
200,000 long-term welfare recipients in high-poverty areas move 
into jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also wants Congress to fully fund a $430 million  
proposal to give housing vouchers that help people on welfare 
relocate closer to a new job and $150 million in transportation 
money to help people get to jobs, often in suburbs not served by 
public transportation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Orders More Jets to Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Failure to win release of three U.S. soldiers  
and continued defiance by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic are 
increasing calls in Congress for President Clinton to acknowledge 
that ground forces may be needed to fight the war in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``America, wake up; Europe is at war, and we are in it,'' said  
Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind., one of 11 lawmakers just back from a 
visit to NATO headquarters and American troops in Europe. Nine of 
them sent a letter to Clinton on Friday urging him to abandon his 
opposition to a ground offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration continues to oppose inserting American ground  
forces into the conflict, but it said Friday it will soon send more 
warplanes into the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress returns Monday from a two-week spring recess, and  
members are becoming increasingly vocal in addressing the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton reiterated on Friday that NATO would keep up the  
pressure on Milosevic, even as his administration continued to rule 
out ground forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Milosevic still thinks he can manipulate the situation by  
cynically using innocent people,'' Clinton said in brief remarks. 
``He hopes that we will accept as permanent the results of his 
ethnic cleansing. We will not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said they were disappointed, but not  
surprised, by the failure of a Cypriot leader to win release of 
three U.S. soldiers held by Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Pentagon, spokesman Kenneth Bacon cited reports that  
young Kosovar Albanian women had been herded into a Serb army 
training camp near Dakovica in southwest Kosovo, where they were 
raped and up to 20 killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very eerie and disturbing echo of documented  
instances of rape and killing of women in Bosnia during the Bosnian 
war,'' Bacon said. ``And it is obviously outrageous that this is 
occurring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon also said Defense Secretary William Cohen was expected  
soon to approve a request by NATO's military commander, Army Gen. 
Wesley Clark, for ``dozens'' more warplanes to supplement some 600 
NATO aircraft, half of them Americans. Bombers, fighters, 
radar-jamming planes and refueling tankers are part of the request. 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, all but two of the 11 lawmakers who accompanied  
Cohen to Europe earlier this week urged Clinton to drop his 
opposition to planning for a possible ground war. The group met 
with NATO military planners in Brussels, Belgium, and visited 
American pilots and support forces at air bases in Italy and 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the air campaign succeeds in significantly degrading  
Yugoslavia's military capability, ``there is less certainty that 
NATO's broader objectives in Kosovo ... will be achieved,'' they 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe it prudent for the United States to urge NATO to  
plan for additional military missions, including the use of ground 
forces, in the event that proves necessary to carry out such 
missions to achieve NATO's broader objective -- reversing 
Milosevic's genocide actions in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawmakers said the administration must ``reinforce the point  
to the American public that NATO's efforts could require many more 
weeks or months to succeed.'' And, they said, ``the American public 
also needs to be better prepared for the likelihood of alliance 
casualties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Signing the letter were Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz.; Carl Levin,  
D-Mich.; Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.; Jack Reed, D-R.I.; and Chuck 
Hagel, R-Neb; and Reps. Ike Skelton, D-Mo.; Steve Buyer, R-Ind.; 
Jim Turner, D-Texas; and Ellen Tauscher, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Not signing were Reps. John Spratt, D-S.C.; and Sam Gejdenson,  
D-Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., and others plan to  
introduce a measure Monday that would invoke the war powers act and 
deny funds for a ground campaign unless specifically approved by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have learned the hard way, in Vietnam, Lebanon, Somalia and  
Bosnia, that we cannot solve all the world's pressing problems with 
American ground troops,'' said Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., a co-sponsor.

<HEADLINE> Golfers Stand Pat at Masters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- It's usually the day for moving up -- or  
moving out. Instead, everyone clustered together during the third 
round of the Masters, leaving the packing for another day. 
</P>
<P>
	No one brought their U-Haul to the course Saturday, despite the  
most favorable scoring conditions of the tournament and a 
leaderboard packed with major winners like Jose Maria Olazabal, 
Greg Norman, Davis Love III, Nick Price, Ernie Els, Lee Janzen and 
Steve Elkington. 
</P>
<P>
	As the day progressed, the patrons waited for someone -- anyone --  
to make a bold move. As it turned out, only a couple of 
lesser-known golfers, Steve Pate and Carlos Franco, managed rounds 
worthy of remembering after a weekend at Augusta National. 
</P>
<P>
	Pate, setting a Masters record with seven straight birdies,  
finished with a 65 and moved within two shots of leader Jose Maria 
Olazabal (7-under 209). Franco, a native of Paraguay, crept into 
contention with a 68, putting him three shots off the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 17 players who left the second round with below-par  
scores, only seven moved further into the red Saturday -- failing to 
take advantage of the light breeze and softer greens. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one really made a move,'' said Scott McCarron, who began  
the day one shot behind second-round leader Olazabal and is still 
only four back despite struggling to a 76. ``I'm at 3 under and I 
still have a chance to win this tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So does much of the field. Twenty-three players go to Sunday  
within six shots of Olazabal, which happened to be the margin from 
first to second in 1996 when Norman suffered his memorable collapse 
and lost to Nick Faldo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought the scoring would be good today,'' said Janzen,  
feeling fortunate to trail Olazabal by only three strokes despite a 
third-round 73. ``But this course has stood the test of time so 
far, and I don't think it's going to roll over now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal shot a 73 and remained on top. He's the first player  
since Jack Nicklaus in 1972 to hold that position from the second 
to third rounds despite shooting above par on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to hang on,'' Olazabal said. ``Actually, I'm pretty  
pleased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spaniard was failed by his putter time and time again.  
Despite hitting 12 greens in regulation, Olazabal needed 32 putts 
to get down, after averaging only 25 the first two rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-hole stretch from Nos. 7-12 was particularly galling.  
With a chance to pull away from the struggling field, Olazabal 
missed five birdie putts from 12 feet and closer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't make putts all day long today, completely the  
opposite of yesterday,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone seems to be hanging around -- even David Duval and Tiger  
Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods finally broke par, shooting a 2-under 70, and is five  
shots behind Olazabal. Duval made the turn Saturday at 2 over for 
the tournament, but three straight birdies on the back put him six 
shots off the pace. The pre-tournament favorite would have been 
even closer if not for a three-putt par at 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order for me to have a chance to win, I have to get off to  
a quick start tomorrow,'' Woods said. ``Anyone who is 4 or 5 under 
going to the back nine has a good chance of winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarron was a model of consistency the first two days, moving  
into contention with scores of 69 and 68. He was the only golfer to 
break 70 in both rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the Californian made four bogeys on the front nine,  
then seemed to recover with a birdie at No. 11. But he was forced 
to stand at the 12th tee for more than 10 minutes while Norman, 
playing one group ahead, searched desperately for his ball, lodged 
in a bush behind the green. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Norman gave up, walking back to the tee to hit another  
shot. He managed to escape the par-3 hole with a bogey, but 
McCarron wasn't as fortunate. He put his tee shot into some 
shrubbery as well, and wound up with a triple-bogey 6. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 12th hole got me,'' McCarron said. ``But I hung in after  
that. I'm still in this tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Join the club.

<HEADLINE> Torre Returns to Yankee Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One day away from Yankee Stadium was more than  
enough for Joe Torre. 
</P>
<P>
	After watching the New York Yankees' home opener on his couch  
with his daughter, Torre made his first appearance Saturday at the 
stadium since undergoing prostate cancer surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was strange not being here yesterday (for the season  
opener),'' the Yankees' manager said from his office in the team's 
clubhouse. ``It was fun to watch, but I felt detached not being a 
part of what went on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre stayed away from the stadium Friday to avoid the  
overwhelming emotion of the day so he wouldn't take away from the 
team and Yogi Berra, who was making his first official appearance 
at the stadium in nearly 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
	So he watched Don Zimmer manage the team from his home with his  
3-year-old daughter, Andrea Rae, who was confused why her father 
was not on television with the rest of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``She saw Zim talking, she heard them talk about Yogi Berra,  
which got her excited because she thought it was Yogi Bear, and she 
said, 'Where are you daddy?' '' Torre said. ``She thought it must 
be a tape and couldn't understand why I wasn't with the rest of the 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told her if I was there, I couldn't be here with her. So she  
voted for me to stay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said it wouldn't be long before he trades the role of  
babysitter for Yankees manager. He worked out for the first time 
Friday -- spending 20 minutes on the Stairmaster and more time on 
the bike -- and felt less tired at the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	His doctor has given him clearance to come back when he feels he  
can handle the pressure that comes with being the manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the medical part, I've been given the go-ahead to turn  
loose,'' Torre said. ``When it gets around May 1, it will be close 
to the realistic time for me to get back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the opening day media crush having subsided, Torre made his  
first appearance Saturday. He met with Zimmer and the coaches, 
walked around the clubhouse shaking hands with the players and 
signing some baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just seeing everybody felt good,'' Torre said. ``I  
congratulated them on the emotional win yesterday and how they 
bounced back in Oakland (after an opening-game loss). They seemed a 
lot more relaxed than during spring training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, who had dinner with Torre after Friday's opener, was  
happy to see his close friend again. They talk nearly every day, 
but having him at the stadium was special. Giving managing advice 
instead of taking it from Torre would be even better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I ask him questions about what to do and he gives  
good answers,'' Zimmer said. '' `Do it your way.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer appeared more relaxed, following three wins and his  
cross-country feud with owner George Steinbrenner behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre sat at home and watched as Zimmer and Steinbrenner battled  
verbally about how to use pitcher Hideki Irabu. He even seemed to 
enjoy the view from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did get a chuckle out of it, even though it probably wasn't  
funny at the time,'' Torre said. ``It was just one of those things. 
The important thing is they respect each other and it went away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soon those problems will be Torre's. But for now, he is  
concentrating on getting healthy. He will be back Sunday, and 
possibly in uniform, but only for the World Series ring ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to that,'' he said. ``It will put the  
finishing touches on 1998. The reason you play is for that World 
Series ring.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Says Draft Won't be Reinstated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAUSAU, Wis. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore told a young Boy  
Scout Saturday there were no plans to reinstate the draft, despite 
the NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft question by 14-year-old Joe Wiesneski, who was wearing  
his scout uniform, was the most pointed about the conflict in 
Kosovo posed to Gore at a campaign fund-raiser for Rep. David Obey, 
D-Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is very little support for moving away from the  
volunteer Army,'' Gore told the teen-ager and about 800 others at 
the event. ``I think the volunteer armed services has been 
extremely successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has repeatedly said he had no plan to send  
ground troops to fight in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Raptors Suddenly Lose Their Bite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Regarding those big footprints the  
Toronto Raptors were leaving around the NBA, they're now threatened 
with extinction. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few days after six straight wins made them the hottest  
team in the East, three straight losses have brought them back to 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden, beating Toronto has become important to other  
teams,'' coach Butch Carter said. ``We snuck up on some people, 
booby-trapped them, but right now our intensity is not what it 
takes to win these kind of games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest loss was 106-99 Friday night against the New Jersey  
Nets, the team with the worst record in the Eastern Conference. It 
was preceded by losses at home to the Boston Celtics and the Miami 
Heat. 
</P>
<P>
	And after owning the sixth-best record in the East, the Raptors  
now have dropped back into ninth place in the conference, a 
half-game behind the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a difficult time out there,'' Charles Oakley said. ``When  
we were four games over .500, everything was lovey-dovey. It ain't 
over until the fat lady sings, but we've got to make things happen 
and start playing hard again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Raptors have undergone a major overhaul in the past 14  
months, bringing in three veterans -- Oakley, Kevin Willis and Dee 
Brown -- and asking them to mesh with a kiddie corps long on 
athletic ability but woefully short of winning experiences at the 
professional level. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakley and Willis have helped solve Toronto's rebounding  
problems, while Brown has been a sparkplug off the bench with a 
league-leading 91 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined with the exceptional play of rookie Vince Carter and  
the bench contributions of 19-year-old Tracy McGrady, the Raptors 
have become fiercely competitive while turning into a legitimate 
phenomenon in hockey-mad Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the league has taken notice, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've brought in veteran leadership, and they have learned  
to accept their roles,'' said Cavaliers coach Mike Fratello, whose 
team was run over by the Raptors late last month when they were 
building their six-game winning streak -- the longest in franchise 
history -- with home wins over Chicago, Indiana, Washington and 
Philadelphia and road wins against San Antonio and Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The bubble began to burst Tuesday when Pat Riley brought a  
fired-up Heat team to Toronto and won by 22. Two nights later, the 
lowly Boston Celtics beat the Raptors by 12 at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	The common theme in the two latest defeats was an inability to  
stop the opposition's backcourt. It's a matter of hustle and 
quickness, with the Raptors unable to recover after moving over to 
double-team. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Boston, Kenny Anderson scored a season-high 23. Against  
the Nets, Lucious Harris was left wide open and scored four 
consecutive times after Toronto had pulled within three. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teams scout you and know your stuff,'' Oakley said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Teams respect us now,'' Willis said. ``They know we're serious  
and they're not going to come in and see us roll over. They're 
ready for us now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of Toronto's remaining 15 games, all are against Eastern  
Conference opponents and only two are against teams that are out of 
the playoff picture. 
</P>
<P>
	And after this weekend, the Raptors won't have another two-day  
break until May 2-3 -- 48 games into the 50-game schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people might be down on us or starting to write us off  
again, but it's just minor adjustments that will give us back that 
winning feeling,'' said Carter, the rookie. ``People are bringing 
their `A-game' now, and we have to be ready for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In order to make the playoffs, Toronto will need to win at least  
eight of those 15 games -- and maybe as many as 10 or 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight will be against Philadelphia, New York, Cleveland and  
Milwaukee -- the teams bunched up along with Toronto fighting for 
the lowest three seeds in the East. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have the experience of being in a situation like  
this,'' Oakley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just like in the Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis fight, we're  
losing the rounds waiting for a decision. But we don't have the 
belt, so we're not going to win the decision like Evander did. 
We've got to keep fighting.''

<HEADLINE> Tornado Hits Bengals' Coach's House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Al Roberts, the Cincinnati Bengals' special  
teams coach, was thrown across his bedroom and had his house 
destroyed by the tornado that touched down in the city's northern 
suburbs Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts and his wife, Arvella, were asleep in their home in  
Montgomery when the tornado hit around 5 a.m. Four people were 
killed and hundreds of homes were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts said he and his wife were lifted and thrown about five  
feet when the tornado hit their house. He remembers landing and 
looking towards where the ceiling should have been. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking up at black sky,'' Roberts said. ``The whole roof  
is gone. Rain is coming down. I have to put my clothes on. I put my 
shirt on after there was some lightning and I saw it on the 
floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The couple walked around debris on their shaky stairs and headed  
for the front door, which Arvella Roberts couldn't open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Sweetheart, you don't have to worry about it. We can  
walk out the living room because there's no walls,''' Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The upper floor to the Roberts' home was stripped away, as was  
most of the lower floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Understand, there's nothing left,'' he said. ``The living  
room, dining room, kitchen -- gone. Upstairs there's (supposed to 
be) three bedrooms, a hallway, a bathroom. Nothing. If you saw the 
house, you wouldn't know how we got out of there.''

<HEADLINE> Nissan Sought Iacocca To Pitch Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Lee Iacocca, a pitchman for Nissan cars?  
</P>
<P>
	A Nissan executive says he tried unsuccessfully to get the  
former Chrysler Corp. chairman to appear in a series of ads for the 
Japanese automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question was, how could we cut through the clutter with TV  
ads last December?'' Mike Seergy, vice president and general 
manager of Nissan's U.S. operations, told Friday's Detroit News. 
``It just popped in my head that someone who personified 
`turnaround' was Iacocca.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iacocca helped Chrysler emerge from a downward spiral in the  
1970s to a resurgence in the 80s, and had been critical of Japanese 
car makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Seergy hoped to battle a decline in sales and image by featuring  
ads with Iacocca saying, ``Nissan makes great cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plans for a series of ads were made, but came undone after  
Iacocca said he wanted to look into ``cross-marketing deals'' 
involving his electric bicycle venture, the News reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Iacocca has downplayed his dealings with Nissan in the past, the  
paper said.

<HEADLINE> Poet Hughes Lamented Lost Love </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The late British poet Ted Hughes, whose wife  
Sylvia Plath killed herself, lamented the second woman he lost to 
suicide as his ``true wife.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six years after Plath, an acclaimed American poet, took her own  
life, Hughes' mistress Assia Wevill killed herself and her 
4-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Assia was my true wife and the best friend I ever had,''  
Hughes wrote in a letter to Wevill's sister, Celia Chaikin, two 
months after her death, according to a report Saturday in the 
Guardian. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel now my life has gone completely empty,'' he added. ``I  
know if I had only moved -- if I had only given her hope in slightly 
more emphatic words in that last phone conversation, she would have 
been OK. But I was totally exhausted and nearly off my head with 
other distractions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chaikin said that, like Plath, her sister was desperately  
insecure about Hughes and constantly worried that she would lose 
him to another woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes, a former British poet laureate, died of cancer in  
October.

<HEADLINE> Six Dead in Midwest, Plains Storms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ohio (AP) -- Chain saws and patience have become  
essential tools as residents begin repairing their lives a day 
after a tornado killed four people and demolished more than 200 
homes in Cincinnati's suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other people were killed in Illinois as powerful storms tore  
through the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio officials were still tabulating the destruction hours after  
a pre-dawn twister with 200-mph winds carved a narrow, spotty path 
through affluent subdivisions in Montgomery, Blue Ash and other 
communities Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trees, huge trees, looked like some large mower with a rotary  
blade went through and sheared them all off,'' said Montgomery 
Mayor Richard Tuten. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm uprooted and snapped trees, downed electric power  
lines and tore roofs off homes and churches. Houses were smashed 
into piles of rubble, and shopping center parking lots were strewn 
with broken glass. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 42 people were treated at hospitals, most with bruises  
or cuts. Two people were killed in a house, and two in separate car 
crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the victims, a 40-year-old man, was thrown from his car  
when the wind flipped it over, said Blue Ash Police Chief Mike 
Allen. The same gust flipped a tractor-trailer. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Emergency Management Agency estimated 200 homes were  
destroyed in Cincinnati's northeast suburbs. The storm also damaged 
houses in a western Ohio county and flipped campers at a dealership 
near Dayton. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio Gov. Bob Taft declared emergencies in three counties, a  
step to make those areas eligible for federal loan assistance. He 
said the state was providing bottled water, tetanus vaccine and 
road-clearing help. 
</P>
<P>
	``My heart went out to the families who went to bed last night  
and woke up to this,'' Taft said. ``If there is a positive side to 
this whole tragedy, it has been the tremendous outpouring of 
support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The storms began to intensify Thursday afternoon in states to  
the west. High winds damaged homes in Indiana, and at least nine 
suspected tornadoes destroyed homes, flattened barns and uprooted 
trees in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	A five-block area in the Nebraska town of North Bend was ravaged  
by a tornado, and storms also damaged buildings and downed power 
lines in Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ashland, Ill., a community of 1,200, a tornado late Thursday  
ripped apart 17 mobile homes in a trailer park and killed a 
68-year-old woman. A 43-year-old woman died in a mobile home in 
Cisco, 65 miles to the east. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sucked out the door and watched two trailers right in  
front of me go up in the air,'' said Louann Judd of Ashland. 
</P>
<P>
	George Clemons, 79, who lived by himself in his trailer, came  
back in the morning drizzle to see what little of his home 
remained. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just like a bomb went off,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Springsteen Kicks Off World Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Reunited with his old band, Bruce  
Springsteen opened his world tour to a sold-out crowd of 20,000 in 
Barcelona's Saint George Palace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boss did not disappoint in his first tour with the E Street  
Band in more than a decade. They opened Friday with ``My Love Will 
Not Let You Down'' and ``Prove It All Night.'' And that's what they 
did, captivating the crowd for 2 1/2 hours through 19 songs and five 
encores. 
</P>
<P>
	After delighting the Barcelona fans with a greeting spoken in  
Catalan, Springsteen hardly addressed his audience during the 
high-energy performance bursting with old favorites including 
``Badlands,'' ``10th Avenue Freezeout'' and ``The River.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another highlight was a duet, ``Mansion on the Hill,'' sung with  
his wife, Patti Scialfa, who also played guitar and sang back-up 
throughout the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's concert, and a second date Sunday also in this  
northeastern Spanish city, mark the beginning of a 17-city European 
tour for Springsteen and the E Street Band. Dates include Munich, 
Zurich, London, Dublin and Paris before the wrapping up in Madrid. 
The first U.S. performances aren't until mid-July.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Joins Medicare Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has joined a lawsuit  
alleging that Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. and Curative Health 
Services Inc. defrauded Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint, unsealed in U.S. District Court in Tampa, Fla.,  
alleges the fraud was related to Curative's management of wound 
care centers at 42 Columbia/HCA hospitals since 1993. Columbia/HCA 
owns 305 hospitals nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The 42 hospitals charged Medicare for excessive management fees  
that Columbia/HCA paid to Curative, the government alleged. A 
Justice Department statement said those fees were inflated to cover 
the costs of a Curative product for which Medicare does not provide 
reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also alleged the hospitals charged Medicare for  
advertising, which Medicare does not cover, and for kickbacks of 
$400 per patient that Columbia paid to Curative for referrals. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospitals violated Medicare's requirement to make only  
reasonable and prudent purchases by including the entire amount of 
the excessive management fees in annual Medicare cost reports, the 
government alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	In early 1993, after Medicare decided not to pay for Procuren,  
an experimental treatment for non-healing wounds, Columbia/HCA 
agreed to amend its contracts with Curative by increasing fixed 
management fees more than 400 percent, by cutting more than half 
the amount charged by Curative for Procuren and by adding a 
management fee of $400 a patient, the Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit alleged the $400 fee violated the Medicare and  
Medicare Anti-Kickback Act. It also said part of the fees paid by 
one hospital were for advertising expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was originally filed by Joseph Parslow, chief  
financial officer at Southwest Florida Regional Medical Center, a 
Columbia/HCA hospital in Fort Myers, Fla. in 1998. He filed under 
the private whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act, which 
allows individuals to sue on behalf of the government and receive 
15 percent to 25 percent of any money recovered if the government 
decides the lawsuit is warranted and joins in it. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has joined in several such private whistleblower  
lawsuits around the country to recover triple damages from 
Columbia/HCA for alleged fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, the Justice Department asked for a stay in another  
of those civil lawsuits, saying it was in settlement negotiations 
with the company and moving ahead in the case could hurt the 
government's criminal investigation of the chain's billing 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
	A wide-ranging federal criminal fraud investigation targeting  
Columbia/HCA is looking into whether Columbia overbilled government 
health care programs. Four Columbia executives charged with 
conspiring to defraud the government of $2.8 million have pleaded 
innocent. The company is based in Nashville, Tenn.

<HEADLINE> Jeweler Tiffany Sues Nude Bar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Tiffany &AMP; Co. is suing a nude-bar  
namesake. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York City-based diamond, silver and luxury goods company  
filed a trademark infringement lawsuit in federal court Friday 
against the operators of Tiffany's, a soon-to-open nude juice bar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tiffany's represents quality and style, not what these people  
are trying to sell,'' a lawyer for the company, Jim Swire, said in 
Saturday's Rochester Democrat and Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
	The company sent a letter weeks ago protesting the bar's name  
but got no response, he said. Federal law forbids a blurring, 
tarnishing or whittling away of the distinctiveness of a famous 
trademark. 
</P>
<P>
	The bar's owners won $10,000 in damages last month from the city  
of Rochester, which conceded that it improperly thwarted them from 
opening the bar earlier this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- Jason Krog, the 1999 Hobey Baker Award  
winner from the University of New Hampshire, signed a two-year 
contract worth slightly over $2 million with the New York Islanders 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-11, 191-pound center led the nation in scoring last  
season with 34 goals and 51 assists in 41 games. He was the captain 
of the Wildcats, who lost in overtime to Maine in the NCAA 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Islanders general manager Mike Milbury was ecstatic with the  
signing. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of our offseason goals was to acquire talent at the center  
position since Robert Reichel left,'' Milbury said. ``Jason has 
proven to be an extremely productive player on an excellent college 
hockey team. I fully expect him to be with the New York Islanders 
in September.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krog said he was happy to have the opportunity to play right  
away. 
</P>

	Bombing Continues on Holiday Eve  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Despite bad weather limiting NATO  
air operations, bombs fell on Kosovo and air-raid sirens blared in 
several other Yugoslav cities tonight, the eve of Christian 
Orthodox Easter. Dismissing a holiday weekend cease-fire as a sham, 
NATO signaled there was little likelihood of a letup in airstrikes 
tomorrow, the day Serbians celebrate Easter. The head of the 
Serbian Orthodox church, dressed in a traditional white and gold 
gown, conducted midnight mass for several hundred people at the 
Cathedral Church in downtown Belgrade. 

</P>

	More U.S. Jets to Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dozens of new warplanes are expected to arrive  
for the NATO bombing campaign within days, and Pentagon officials 
are raising the possible need to call up military reserves because 
of the additional U.S. aircraft involved. The Pentagon announced 
that 82 more U.S. planes would join the airstrikes, a move to 
intensify the battle against Serb forces. The introduction of 24 
Apache helicopters, which could take a month to be ready for use, 
would mark an escalation of the war and for the first time allow 
close-to-the-ground, direct strikes against Serb troops and tanks.

	BLUE ASH, Ohio (AP) -- The hard-hit area of southwest Ohio is  
bracing for a new round of forecasted storms tonight, barely 24 
hours after a tornado killed four and damaged some 900 homes. The 
Cincinnati Bengals' special teams coach Al Roberts had his home 
destroyed in the tornado. ``Understand, there's nothing left,'' 
Roberts said. ``The living room, dining room, kitchen -- gone. 
Upstairs there's (supposed to be) three bedrooms, a hallway, a 
bathroom. Nothing. If you saw the house, you wouldn't know how we 
got out of there.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal agents searched the New Mexico home of  
a suspected spy who was fired from his job at a Los Alamos nuclear 
laboratory last month. The raid at the single-story brick and 
wooden home of Wen Ho Lee pierced the tranquillity of the suburban 
neighborhood where the Taiwan-born American scientist lives. 
``There was a lot of commotion going on. People were driving by, 
neighbors were outside and agents were coming and going,'' said 
Phillip Warnock, a neighbor who also works at the Los Alamos 
laboratory.

	Fires Keep N.C. Town Residents Away  
</P>
<P>
	WILKESBORO, N.C. (AP) -- A forest fire in the Appalachian  
foothills kept dozens of residents out of their homes tonight as 
firefighters battled the flames. The fire had charred about 400 
acres of forest, mostly on private land, in the area 60 miles west 
of Winston-Salem. More than 50 homes were ordered evacuated 
yesterday, most of them in Pumpkin Run, a subdivision built in the 
past four years in a heavily wooded section. Firefighters continue 
battling the fire into the night, and officials said they hoped to 
have the blaze contained by tomorrow morning.

	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Pedro Martinez (2-0) allowed seven  
hits, struck out nine and walked one in seven innings as the Red 
Sox beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 5-3 tonight to begin a season 
with five victories for the first time in 53 years. Troy O'Leary 
doubled and homered to drive in three runs in his first two 
at-bats, giving Martinez all the offensive support he needed until 
Tampa Bay began the eighth inning with four straight hits to trim a 
five-run deficit to 5-3.

struck out 15 and pitched a six-hitter to gain his new team's first 
win of the season, leading the Diamondbacks over Tom Glavine and 
the Atlanta Braves 8-3 tonight. Johnson got the 57th complete game 
and 103rd double-digit strikeout game of his career, throwing 83 of 
123 pitches for strikes as the second-year Diamondbacks won for the 
first time in seven games at Turner Field.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Matt Jordan had six saves and the Dallas Burn  
extended its shutout streak to a team-record 328 minutes with a 1-0 
shootout victory over the Chicago Fire on Saturday night, ruining 
the home opener for the defending MLS Cup champions. 
</P>

a tackle from behind on Chicago's Ante Razov. 
</P>
<P>
	In the shootout, Brian Haynes and Richard Farrer scored in the  
first two frames for the Burn, while Ted Eck clinched it with a 
goal in the fifth frame. Only Jesse Marsch converted for the Fire 
in Chicago's four attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite chilly, wet weather, a crowd of 27,311 was on hand at

<HEADLINE>  Islanders Sign Hobey Baker Winner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- Jason Krog, the 1999 Hobey Baker Award  
winner from the University of New Hampshire, signed a two-year 
contract worth slightly over $2 million with the New York Islanders 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-11, 191-pound center led the nation in scoring last  
season with 34 goals and 51 assists in 41 games. He was the captain 
of the Wildcats, who lost in overtime to Maine in the NCAA 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Islanders general manager Mike Milbury was ecstatic with the  
signing. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of our offseason goals was to acquire talent at the center  
position since Robert Reichel left,'' Milbury said. ``Jason has 
proven to be an extremely productive player on an excellent college 
hockey team. I fully expect him to be with the New York Islanders 
in September.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krog said he was happy to have the opportunity to play right  
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to be here,'' Krog said. ``It's a great opportunity,  
and I feel good about my decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krog said that there were two factors that he felt led him to go  
undrafted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not your typical 6-2, 210-pound type of guy,'' he said.  
``I think some teams were scared off by my size. Also, I was a late 
bloomer (talent-wise).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milbury said size was not so much a factor thanks to the  
crackdown on obstruction fouls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Granted, size can be a factor,'' Milbury said. ``But thanks to  
all the obstruction penalties, quickness is just as important. He 
also brings an element of quiet toughness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krog is the fourth Hobey Baker winner to join the Islanders  
organization. The others were defenseman Tom Kurvers and forwards 
Kip Miller and Chris Marinucci.

<HEADLINE> Woods, Duval in Masters' Hunt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- This was supposed to be the Masters that  
would put the stamp of greatness on David Duval. This was where he 
and Tiger Woods were going to duel down the stretch Sunday at 
Augusta National and make history. 
</P>
<P>
	Hang on. It might still happen.  
</P>
<P>
	With the leaders backing up under third-round pressure, Duval  
and Woods got out early Saturday and quietly put together matching 
70s to move within a possible back nine eagle or two from the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, instead of figuring out a way to get out of sleepy  
Augusta early Sunday afternoon, they were trying to figure a way to 
win a green jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in good shape for tomorrow,'' Woods said after moving to  
214, two under par after three rounds and within five shots of 
leader Jose Maria Olazabal. ``Anything can happen on that back nine 
on Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval was another shot back, but still hopeful.  
</P>
<P>
	``I might have a chance,'' Duval said. ``I was just hoping to  
get back into it today and it looks like I have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a while on Saturday, it didn't look like that was going to  
happen. 
</P>
<P>
	A day that began with Woods and Duval eight and nine shots back,  
respectively, wasn't getting much better as the world's top two 
golfers struggled on the front nine. Woods bogeyed No. 9 to go back 
to even for the day, while Duval shot a 1-over 37. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, making the turn only a group apart, with some inviting  
holes just ahead, things started getting better in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval plunged into Amen Corner with a vengeance, making birdies  
on 11, 12 and 13. Just behind him was Woods, who stumbled with a 
bogey on 11 and was 1 over before he stuck a 7-iron about eight 
feet from a treacherous pin on the par-5 13th and rolled in the 
putt for eagle. 
</P>
<P>
	Two holes later, Woods was staring at another eagle putt on 15.  
He left the putt tantalizingly short but tapped in for a birdie. 
</P>
<P>
	In the space of two separate three-hole stretches, with the  
leaders foundering, Woods and Duval got themselves at least on the 
fringes of the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just have to hang in there and keep patient,'' Woods said.  
``I was hoping to play those holes 3 or 4 under and I played them 
3. So I'm happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The taciturn Duval doesn't usually use words like happy, but he,  
too, appeared pleased. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly feel a little better taking a few shots off,'' he  
said. ``The only problem is I just might be a little far behind for 
it to matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval, riding a hot streak that saw him win two straight  
tournaments coming into the Masters, was actually tied for the lead 
at 3 under in Thursday's opening round before making three straight 
bogeys sandwiched around a storm delay to shoot a 71. 
</P>
<P>
	A triple-bogey 8 on 15 on Friday appeared to doom his chances,  
but he came back with a birdie on the final hole to give him some 
confidence going into the weekend at 1 over, nine shots out of the 
lead held by Olazabal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing ever surprises me here,'' Duval said. ``You never  
really know what's going to happen out here. I've just made a 
couple bad decisions, had a couple bad yardages and a couple bad 
shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, who won his only Masters in 1997 by turning a nine-shot  
third-round lead into a 12-shot romp, also had an 8 in this 
tournament in his first round and will have to come back from a 
handful of shots to catch Olazabal. Complicating matters is the 
number of good golfers in between who have already won majors, 
including the likes of Greg Norman, Davis Love III, Lee Janzen and 
Steve Elkington. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Duval) knows as well as I do that we can't focus on each  
other. We need to get off to quick starts and carry the momentum 
into the back nine,'' Woods said. ``That has to be our objective, 
to have a chance on the back nine.''

<HEADLINE> Two Groups To Submit Bids for A's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Two investment groups will make bids to  
buy the Oakland Athletics this week, a team representative said. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups will submit separate bids on a one-time offer to buy  
the franchise for $120 million, according to investment banker Bob 
Caporale, who represents the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum 
Authority in the potential sale. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the bids will be made by a group led by business  
consultant Michael J. Lazarus and one led by former A's executive 
Andy Dolich. Lazarus announced his group's planned bid on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Local government officials are worried that the A's may move,  
possibly to San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	Any sale would have to be agreed to by the team's current  
owners, then approved by baseball owners, who take from 6-to-18 
months to consider sales.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Orioles Owner Hoffenberg Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Jerold C. Hoffberger, former owner of the  
Baltimore Orioles whose philanthropy benefited Maryland 
universities and hospitals, has died. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	He collapsed Friday evening while working with a business  
associate, his family said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles made it to five World Series between 1965 and 1979  
when Hoffberger owned the team. He also ran the National Brewing 
Co. for 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1983, Town &AMP; Country magazine described Hoffberger as one of  
the nation's ``most generous living Americans'' and said he had 
donated more than $10 million to charity at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a passion for Baltimore and a passion for the inner  
city. He always had his mind on the downtrodden,'' said the Rev. 
Melvin Tuggle, president of Clergy United for the Renewal of East 
Baltimore (CURE), a group of 150 East Baltimore churches. ``I 
consider him one of the greatest Baltimoreans God ever made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted Hoffberger's decision to acquire slugger Frank Robinson  
from the Cincinnati Reds before the 1966 season as the owner's way 
of inviting black Baltimoreans to embrace the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``That not only changed the Orioles' winning ways, but it also  
changed black-white relations in this city,'' Tuggle said. ``His 
trade for Frank Robinson helped tear down the tension between 
blacks and whites, and he treasured that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1965, Mr. Hoffberger, who was born in Baltimore, assumed the  
principal ownership of the Orioles, but in 1977 made clear that 
financially all was not well with the team. Two years later, he 
sold the team to Washington lawyer Edward Bennett Williams for $12 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffberger's survivors include his wife of 52 years, the former  
Alice Berney, three sons, a daughter and 10 grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Services were scheduled for Monday at the Baltimore Hebrew  
Congregation

<HEADLINE> NFL Pokes, Prods Heisman Winner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- At 10 o'clock on a chilly, blustery morning,  
the microanalysis of Ricky Williams begins. 
</P>
<P>
	With his dreadlocks tied back in two pigtails, Williams runs  
three 40-yard dashes for dozens of NFL scouts, coaches and general 
managers gathered at the finish line at the UC San Diego track. 
Moments later, they compare times, which vary widely. 
</P>
<P>
	An NFL Films crew roams the field as Williams does other drills.  
Williams' agent, Leland Hardy, is wearing a black suit and a burnt 
orange Texas cap. Eric Dickerson is there. ``He's having a good 
workout,'' the newly minted Hall of Famer says into his cell phone. 
</P>
<P>
	For a guy whose NFL draft stock supposedly has fallen a bit for  
various reasons -- questions about his weight, signing with an 
agency owned by a rapper, the fact he's not a quarterback -- this 
workout has become a main event. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 people are watching, including reporters, agents,  
hangers-on, even a few unemployed NFL players. For Williams, it's 
the final chance to impress a mass audience before the draft, which 
starts Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams says later he was just glad he didn't get hurt.  
</P>
<P>
	Two other college players who piggyback on Williams' workout  
pull hamstrings, a truly unfortunate time and place for that to 
happen. Marquis Smith, cousin of one of the top quarterback 
prospects, Akili Smith, pops his right hamstring and plows into a 
14-year-old boy standing too close to the finish line. The two 
crash to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-hour session ends in the weight room, with Williams  
bench-pressing 225 pounds 22 times while college students take it 
all in from the StairMasters and treadmills. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a circus,'' said Wilbert Montgomery, a former star  
running back who now is a coach with the St. Louis Rams. ``It's 
like going to the California State Fair to find out what kind of 
beef you're going to buy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hey, doesn't it count for something that the mild-mannered  
Williams returned to Texas for his senior season, won the Heisman 
Trophy and gained more yards than any other college running back? 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, it does, but this is the NFL and scouts want to see how  
fast you can run around orange traffic cones in the middle of a 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams showed up at the scouting combine in mid-February long  
enough for teams to deduce that he was overweight -- 244 pounds, 
thanks to the banquet circuit -- and has small hands. 
</P>
<P>
	But he skipped the drills, which is why representatives of many  
NFL teams traveled for Tuesday's workout in San Diego, where 
Williams went to high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams didn't exactly run wild in the 40. But everyone was  
pleased when he weighed in at 224 pounds, showing how hard he's 
worked the past six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if you look at how much money they're going to put  
into a player, I think it's all warranted,'' said Williams, who 
nonetheless was glad when the audition ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickerson agreed, but thinks there might be some overanalysis  
going on. 
</P>
<P>
	``They talk about his dreadlocks, his tattoos,'' Dickerson said.  
``That has nothing to do with when you play on Sundays. Everybody 
wants that perfect individual, and Ricky's a really nice guy. A 
really good person and a hell of a football player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember when I came out they talked about my goggles,''  
Dickerson said. ``They said I had eye problems because I wore 
goggles! All kinds of things come up when the draft comes around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was surprising when Williams signed with No Limit Sports,  
founded by rapper Master P. Apparently, those concerns also have 
been put to rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We checked on him thoroughly and he's a good kid,'' said  
general manager Dwight Clark of the expansion Cleveland Browns, who 
hold the draft's first pick. ``To talk to him, you see he's 
genuine. I like him. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hear about his relationship with Doak Walker and his  
visiting kids in the hospital and you wonder if it's too good to be 
true. And then you meet him and he's just a nice, polite kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, the 1948 Heisman winner from SMU, was Williams' friend  
and idol. After Walker died last fall, Williams got permission to 
wear Walker's No. 37 against Oklahoma at the Cotton Bowl, also 
known as the ``House that Doak Built.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent first-person account in The Sporting News, Williams  
lamented the misperceptions about his weight, hair, tattoos and 
pierced tongue. 
</P>
<P>
	None of that should matter, say Chargers officials who not only  
have gotten to know Williams, but are a conservative bunch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't take long to get to know the guy and figure out  
that he's one of the classiest persons around,'' player personnel 
director Billy Devaney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Added general manager Bobby Beathard: ``This guy puts his heart  
into football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whichever team picks the 21-year-old Williams will get a  
self-described throwback who also considers himself to be a member 
of Generation X. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, kids just want to be different,'' Williams said of  
dreadlocks and body piercings -- he has studs in his left ear and 
nostril, as well as his tongue. ``The crowd that I'm addressing, 
the younger crowd, it's cool to them. The older crowd, I'm sure 
they have their own opinions about them. I'm not worried about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is thinking more about being a workhorse who can carry  
the ball 35 times a game, if needed, and catch it, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try to play with a passion that Walter Payton played with  
and determination that he played with. It doesn't get any better 
than that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams understands that the draft isn't always about the best  
player, but rather the best player at the position where teams have 
needs. That means a handful of quarterbacks could go ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he'd love to be the first pick, even it means going to  
New Orleans. Saints coach Mike Ditka loves Williams so much that he 
has offered all of the team's 1999 draft picks, plus future 
considerations, to move up. 
</P>

	``My big thing is to be No. 1,'' he said. ``It has nothing to do  
with money. I think everyone wants to be No. 1. If they don't, they 
shouldn't be playing sports.''

<HEADLINE> Coupon Mistake To Cost Casino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Whoever dealt the coupons at the  
Flamingo Hilton Casino didn't shuffle the deck quite right. 
</P>
<P>
	A mailing glitch could cost the riverboat casino $1 million by  
the time thousands of small-time gamblers redeem coupons that were 
supposed to go to a smaller class of high-rollers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a mistake. A very bad mistake,'' said Kathy Zeller,  
comptroller for the Kansas City casino. ``But we are going to go 
ahead and honor the coupons until we can get new ones in the 
mail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The casino intended to mail out two sets of promotional coupons,  
one to a select group of high rollers and another to a much larger 
listing of lesser gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-roller coupons allow a player to get $75 worth of chips  
for $25. Regular coupons gave out $30 in chips for $25. 
</P>
<P>
	Each set contains ten coupons, which can be redeemed one per  
week over ten weeks. That meant high rollers could get a total $500 
in free chips and the others $50 in free chips, if all ten coupons 
were cashed in. 
</P>
<P>
	But the high-roller coupons were sent out to the list of lesser  
gamblers, causing a stampede at the casino beginning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	After giving away what one Flamingo executive estimated was  
$250,000 in free chips, the casino stopped honoring the coupons 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	That did not go over well, as gamblers stomped around the casino  
demanding to talk to whoever was in charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I bet you did this on purpose just to get us in here,'' one  
man said to a harried worker after the shutoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Five hours after the shutoff, the casino decided to reverse  
itself, for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided the only fair thing to do would be to go ahead and  
honor them. It was our mistake, not the players' mistake,'' Zeller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The casino planned to mail the same people new coupons worth the  
intended value of $5 apiece. Once those are delivered, the casino 
will no longer honor the high-value coupons. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, if the current coupons are redeemed next week at the  
same rate as this week, the casino could lose an estimated $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``You think somebody's not going to lose their job over this?''  
said a casino executive who asked not to be identified.

<HEADLINE> Final Four in Beach Volleyball Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) -- Two Brazilian teams beat two U.S. duos  
Saturday to advance to the semifinals of the FIVB Beach Volleyball 
World Tour at Acapulco. 
</P>
<P>
	Para Ferreira and Guilherme Marques beat Sinjin Smith and Rob  
Heidger 15-8 in the final round Saturday, helped by the fact the 
41-year-old Smith was playing with a broken left toe. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very tired. We just tried to serve to him. Smith was a  
little bit winded,'' Marques said. ``We just tried not to make 
mistakes and we got lucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marques and Ferreira advanced to Sunday's finals, along with  
brothers Paul and Martin Laciga of Switzerland, Ian Clark and Bill 
Boullianne of the United States, and ZeMarco de Melo and Ricardo 
Santos of Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's last match to decide the semifinalists, de Melo  
and Santos beat Karch Kiraly and Adam Johnson, both of San 
Clemente, Calif., 15-8. 
</P>
<P>
	Heidger-Smith and Kiraly-Johnson ended the tournament tied for  
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Heidger, who with Smith had earlier scored a 15-5 upset win over  
second-seeded Kiraly-Johnson, said he was pleased with his 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you would've told me going into this thing that we would've  
got a fifth place with my partner with a broken toe, I would've 
taken it -- and I will take it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith broke his toe during practice about two weeks ago and the  
injury kept him from working out. 
</P>
<P>
	``For him to come and play this well with a broken toe was  
pretty amazing,'' said Heidger, 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith and Kiraly, the only player to win Olympic gold medals in  
both indoor and beach volleyball, are the two winningest players in 
U.S. beach volleyball history. Smith has 139 domestic titles to his 
credit plus 10 in International Beach Volleyball Federation tours. 
Kiraly has 136 domestic domestic titles and three in the FIVB. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil also dominated the women's matches Saturday with No.  
1-ranked Adriana Behar and Shelda Bede and Sandra Pires and Adriana 
Samuel both advancing to Sunday's semifinals. Australia had the 
other two teams: Natalie Cook and Angela Clarke, and Pauline Manser 
and Kerri Pottharst. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Behar-Bede beat Manser-Pottharst 15-12;  
Pires-Samuel beat Lisa Arce and Barbra Fontana of the United States 
15-5; Manser-Pottharst beat Liz Masakayan and Elaine Youngs of the 
United States 15-9; and Cook-Clarke claimed a 15-11 victory over 
Jenny Jordan and Annett Davis of Los Angeles, and then beat Arce 
and Fontana 15-8. 
</P>
<P>
	The Acapulco tournament is the first of nine Olympic qualifying  
events for the women and the second of 12 for the men.

<HEADLINE> ESPN Sports' Rankings Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The millennium-watchers at ESPN are celebrating the approach of  
the year 2000 by compiling a list of the century's 50 greatest 
athletes. Mixed in among the voting panel's obvious choices are 
some perplexing decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	At the top half-hundred announced so far are Chris Evert, No.  
50; O.J. Simpson, No. 49; Pete Sampras, No. 48; Edwin Moses, No. 
47; Eric Heiden, No. 46; Bill Tilden, No. 45; Bobby Jones, No. 44, 
and Julius Erving, No. 43. 
</P>
<P>
	No arguments there. Based on ESPN's criteria of athletic ability  
alone, they certainly belong. 
</P>
<P>
	But because lists like this are so subjective, individual  
rankings can appear skewered. What makes Moses No. 47 instead of 
No. 46 or, for that matter, No. 48? No one can say. 
</P>
<P>
	A week ago, Sandy Koufax was anointed at No. 42 -- numerologists  
would have preferred No. 32 because that was his uniform number -- 
and given the added honor of being the only pitcher in the top 50. 
</P>
<P>
	That means no Walter Johnson on the ESPN list. No Christy  
Mathewson, either. No Tom Seaver or Warren Spahn or Nolan Ryan. No 
Bob Gibson or Early Wynn or Steve Carlton. 
</P>
<P>
	Just Sandy Koufax, out there by himself.  
</P>
<P>
	There can be no argument that for six seasons, from 1961-66,  
Koufax bordered on the unhittable. Once he figured out how to throw 
strikes, he dominated the game, setting a National League record 
with five consecutive ERA titles and posting a winning percentage 
of .733. There were four no-hitters, one of them a perfect game, 
four strikeout titles and three Cy Young Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	And then, at 30, with his elbow aching from arthritis, Koufax  
walked away. He had gone 97-27 over the previous four seasons as 
the best pitcher in baseball and led the league in strikeouts four 
times with a best of 382 in 1965. When he finished his career, he 
had 165 wins, 87 losses and a 2.76 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	The premature flameout was sad. Koufax was like a meteor,  
flashing across the horizon for a brief period, then disappearing. 
His mastery during that time made him a logical choice for a spot 
in ESPN's top 50. But making him the only pitcher on the list seems 
a bit of a stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Antinoro, ESPN senior producer for the 50 greatest series,  
understands how that could raise some questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The perception is he came along at the right time,'' he said.  
``The sexy strikeouts, the numbers. He left on top. He won 27 games 
in his last year. He left an indelible memory. He didn't hang on. 
There was an aura, a mystique about him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Antinoro asked the key question.  
</P>
<P>
	``Who do you knock off, if you put another pitcher on?''  
</P>
<P>
	That depends on the rest of the list.  
</P>
<P>
	Taken as a total package, Koufax's numbers are ordinary compared  
with some of the pitchers the network voters passed over. The 
others all had longer careers, but that just means they sustained 
their production and that should be rewarded, not ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan had seven no-hitters, three more than Koufax, and 5,714  
strikeouts, 3,318 more than Koufax. He's not on the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's 417 wins included 110 shutouts. He had 252 more wins  
and 70 more shutouts than Koufax. He's missing from the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathewson won 373 games and had three shutouts in a single World  
Series. Sorry, not good enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Spahn won 20 or more games 13 times and finished with 363  
victories, the most for any left-hander in history. He had 10 more 
20-win seasons and nearly 200 more victories than Koufax. Come back 
for the next list. 
</P>
<P>
	Need more evidence?  
</P>
<P>
	Koufax's best ERA was 1.73 in his last season. In 1968, Gibson  
had an ERA of 1.12. No list for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaver, Wynn and Carlton all won 300 games. So did Grover  
Alexander, Lefty Grove, and lately, Gaylord Perry, Don Sutton and 
Phil Niekro. With 165 wins, Koufax would have needed seven more 
20-win seasons to pass that plateau. He's in. They're not. 
</P>
<P>
	So, as good as Sandy K was -- and make no mistake, he was very  
good -- he had plenty of dominating company on the mound. Of all 
those also-ran pitchers, though, only Johnson at No. 60 and Gibson 
at No. 67, could crack ESPN's second half-hundred. 
</P>
<P>
	And right in the middle of all these great pitchers was this  
fellow named Cy Young, who won 511 games, 244 in this century -- the 
same one in which ESPN made Koufax the only pitcher among the top 
50 athletes.

<HEADLINE> NASA Mulls All-Female Shuttle Crew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Come 2001, women may have an inside  
track in the macho world of space. Within the next two years, NASA 
may be flying all-female space shuttle crews -- for science. 
</P>
<P>
	With a new space station on the horizon and increasing talk of  
trips to Mars, NASA wants to make sure it protects the health of 
all its astronauts, male and female. But just as with Earth-bound 
medical research, most of what it knows has been gleaned from men, 
and projecting results onto women could be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	Weightlessness, for instance, is known to cause bone loss in  
both sexes, and because women are at greater risk of osteoporosis, 
theory might suggest women in space load up on calcium. But that 
could create kidney stones, points out Dr. Arnauld Nicogossian, the 
space agency's top doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Other areas of concern, for both sexes, include radiation and  
the weakening of the immune system in weightlessness. 
</P>
<P>
	Millie Hughes-Fulford, a University of California professor who  
flew on the space shuttle in 1991, would love to see an all-female 
crew. As an osteoporosis researcher, she'd be especially interested 
in whether women lose bone and calcium at the same rate in space as 
men. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would probably be the biggest argument against women  
going to Mars. `Oh, my dear, you're getting much too close to 
menopause and you're going to lose all that bone when you're 
gone,''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA is seeking multiple second opinions to determine whether  
more gender-specific research is needed. The study should be 
completed by the end of June. After reviewing the findings, ``then 
we'll decide if it makes sense to have a mission dedicated 
specifically to fly women and how often we have to continue that 
type of mission,'' Nicogossian said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will not be a one-time deal,'' he promised.  
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until the last few years that NASA could even consider  
putting together an all-female crew. Every shuttle mission requires 
two pilots, and NASA only recently added its second and third 
female shuttle pilots. The 119 current astronauts include 29 women. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sooner or later it's going to happen'' whether it's deliberate  
or not, said shuttle program director William Readdy. 
</P>
<P>
	Men have dominated space flight -- and consequently space medical  
research -- since Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin opened the frontier 
38 years ago this Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 278 people who have flown on U.S. spacecraft since Alan  
Shepard's 15-minute hop May 5, 1961, only 31 have been women. This 
official roster excludes Christa McAuliffe and the two other 
rookies who were killed aboard Challenger. 
</P>
<P>
	Women were not admitted to NASA's astronaut corps until 1978 and  
did not fly on a space shuttle until 1983. No woman piloted a 
shuttle until 1995. And women will not command a shuttle flight 
until Eileen Collins takes the left front seat aboard Columbia in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the space station era seems to be shaping up the same  
way -- mostly male. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the six U.S. astronauts and six Russian cosmonauts training  
to live on the international space station, only one, American 
Susan Helms, is female. 
</P>
<P>
	And only one woman was among the seven NASA astronauts who lived  
on Mir. It was only because her ride home was delayed that Shannon 
Lucid ended up staying six months in 1996, a record for women 
worldwide and for Americans of either sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Because they've worked so hard to get where they are, many of  
NASA's women dislike the idea of all-female crews, says an agency 
insider. They're insulted, in fact, by anything that smacks of 
gimmickry or implies their skills somehow don't measure up. 
</P>
<P>
	Former astronaut Kathryn Thornton, one of the few women to walk  
in space, wonders why NASA doesn't simply collect the scientific 
data by assigning more women to more space shuttle flights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why it would be necessary to have them all on the  
same flight,'' said Thornton, a physicist now teaching at the 
University of Virginia. ``I would worry about the privacy issues. 
Everybody would know these seven women on all these different 
tests. And if the issues have to deal with how the crews get along, 
I'd be really upset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A crew of all women could certainly be perceived as a gimmick,  
especially with John Glenn's trumpeted return to orbit last fall 
still resonating. 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis Brown Jr., the astronaut who commanded the Glenn mission  
and who will lead an all-male crew to the Hubble Space Telescope 
this fall, complains the proposed all-female mission has turned 
into ``a media thing and I don't know why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said he was under the impression that only the four  
payload crew members would have to be women for the proposed 
testing. The two pilots and one flight engineer generally forgo 
blood draws and other invasive testing in case they have to deal 
with emergencies aloft. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nicogossian contends the more women, the better, regardless  
of limitations on their testing status. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicogossian refuses to speculate on whether an all-female crew  
might include a geriatric volunteer, a la the 77-year-old Glenn. 
``It depends on the experiments,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And he doesn't want to guess what might happen if it turns out  
women make better space travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	Might it be onward, women only, to Mars?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll leave that question open,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Piece of Plane Lands in Mass. Yard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- A 16-foot flap fell off a military  
plane's wing Saturday and into a suburban backyard, narrowly 
missing a couple who were doing outdoor chores. 
</P>
<P>
	John Stocks was raking his yard when he saw the flap falling  
about 50 feet above him, and called out to his wife, Amy. She and 
the dog, who were standing near the garage, got out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	The flap panel, from a C-5A transport plane, crushed a  
clothesline pole and tore into the Stocks' lawn. It came to rest 
inches from a bulkhead leading to their basement. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller bits of debris landed near two other area homes.  
</P>
<P>
	The plane, from Westover Air Reserve Base, was on a routine  
training mission. It landed safely, base officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tech. Sgt. William Pope said it was unclear what caused the flap  
to break off the plane. Officials retrieved the plane flap panel, 
and the incident remained under investigation.

<HEADLINE> 15th Hole a Nightmare at Augusta  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- The look on their faces is one of confusion,  
not confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	They cross their arms and stare at a pond that looks like an  
ocean, fronting a green that looks no bigger than a beach towel. If 
the shot is long, making par is not easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``That hole,'' Davis Love III said, ``is scary.''  
</P>
<P>
	Only he's not talking about the 12th, one of the most notorious  
par-3s in golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Of all the changes in the Masters this year, none has had an  
impact like No. 15, the 500-yard par-5 that always has been the 
centerpiece of any Sunday charge at Augusta. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where Gene Sarazen hit ``the shot heard 'round the  
world,'' holing out a 4-wood for double eagle to get into a playoff 
in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, there was the memorable 15-foot eagle putt by Jack  
Nicklaus on his way to a back-nine 30 to win the 1986 Masters at 
age 46. Mark O'Meara was an afterthought until his birdie at the 
15th last year, the start of his birdie-par-birdie-birdie finish 
for the green jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	When Tiger Woods was romping across Augusta in 1997, he used hit  
wedge for his second shot at No. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	If only it were that simple this year.  
</P>
<P>
	Through two rounds of the Masters, the 15th was averaging 5.097  
strokes. Should that hold up through the weekend, it would be only 
the third time in the history of the tournament that it has played 
over par. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Masters began keeping such statistics in 1942, the  
15th has been the easiest hole at Augusta. 
</P>
<P>
	Not anymore.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't hit it on the green with your second shot,'' Love  
said. ``And you can't hit on the green with your third shot. If you 
lay up, you're going to have to hit an absolutely perfect pitch 
shot to get close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Confronted with those circumstances Thursday, Love decided to  
hit a 4-iron. The ball bounced hard over the green and left him 
with this -- 30 feet up the slope to a green that runs hard and fast 
toward the water. He chose the putter, left it 10 feet short and 
gladly took par. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hit it over the green,'' he said, ``and then I laid up.''  
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Sluman wasn't so fortunate. He also hit over the green on  
his second shot, decided to chip and paid for it. The ball trickled 
by the hole, then picked up speed and didn't stop rolling until it 
was floating to the bottom of the pond -- triple bogey. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Mickelson was one stroke out of the lead Thursday when his  
5-iron into the green came up just short. He took double bogey. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's the conventional approach.  
</P>
<P>
	David Duval was in the hunt Friday when he played his second  
shot short of the water. The decision left him with indecision. A 
soft sand wedge or a hard lob wedge? He tried to hit a 
three-quarter sand wedge, but the ball spun back off the green and 
into the water. Spooked, he hit his fifth shot over the green, 
chipped on and two-putted for triple bogey. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not safe with a sand wedge or a pitching wedge, and  
you're not safe with a lob wedge,'' Nick Price said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rough, barely the depth of a golf ball, is only part of the  
problem. About 20 pine trees have been planted down the right side 
of the fairway where there used to be mounds. Even the 
medium-length hitters could use those humps as a slingshot to 
propel the ball down the fairway and leave themselves about a 
5-iron into the green. 
</P>
<P>
	While the rough is hardly U.S. Open material, it's enough to  
keep the ball from rolling down the short grass. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to hit it up on that hill and kick it back to the  
fairway,'' Scott McCarron said. ``Now I'm trying to hit a 3-iron in 
there, and that's a club or two different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pin placements have been particularly perilous the first two  
rounds and the green has been difficult to hold. 
</P>
<P>
	``Discretion is very important there,'' Greg Norman said. ``When  
you lay up, the 80-yard shot is almost as hard as the 213-yard 
shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Maria Olazabal tried to play it safe the first day and took  
bogey. He attacked in the second round and made birdie, but only 
after using his superb short game to hit a bump-and-run with a 
9-iron down the slope to about 4 inches from the cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you hit a tee shot on that hole,'' he said, ``every shot  
is a scary shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't always been that way. The fairway was always so  
generous that the only problem was going too far left and bringing 
the Georgia pines into play down the left side. If the drive was 
struck well, the only decision was which iron to hit into the 
green, or which part of the fairway to lay to attack the pin with a 
wedge. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could have a big drive or lob it down there, and the hole  
started from 90 yards in,'' Price said. ``Now, the hole starts 500 
yards back on the tee. These people, they must like to see us 
battle here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The battle no doubt will begin on the back nine Sunday, as it  
usually does. The question is whether the 15th again will be a 
launching pad for a fabulous finish or a graveyard where dreams are 
buried.

<HEADLINE> Krone Wins Final Hialeah Appearance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HIALEAH, Fla. (AP) -- Julie Krone, making her final ride at  
Hialeah Park, guided Anguilla around fallen favorite Coretta coming 
off the far turn and overtook Winfama at the eighth pole to win the 
$200,000 Black Helen Handicap on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coretta, an Irish-bred who was sent off at 3-5, was making a  
move from second when she suddenly lost her footing and skidded on 
her chest. I.C. Cindy, running just behind Coretta, bumped the 
favorite and also had to be eased. 
</P>
<P>
	Both horses left the track under their own power and neither  
jockey was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``She seems to be fine,'' trainer Christophe Clement said of  
Coretta. ``It looked bad, but she apparently came back OK. We'll 
check her out very carefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anguilla moved into second place, then ran down Winfama to win  
by two lengths, covering 1 1/8 miles on the turf in 1:47 2-5. The 
second favorite returned $7.20, $4.60 and $3.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Starry Dreamer closed with a rush for second and returned $7.40  
and $4.80. Winfama held on for third and paid $6.20. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tickled to win, but it takes something away when it  
happens this way,'' said Tom Skiffington, Anguilla's trainer. ``I 
just hope the mare is OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krone, 35, racing's leading female jockey with more than 3,500  
career wins, announced her retirement Thursday but is honoring her 
riding commitments through next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a lot of horse,'' Krone said. ``When I was going down  
the backside, my reins were just splashing around on her neck, she 
was going along so easily. She kept asking me -- `Now? Now?` -- and I 
had to keep telling her `No.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Anguilla, a 4-year-old daughter of Seattle Slew, has won five of  
her last seven starts, finishing second in the other two. 
Saturday's win brought her lifetime earnings to $344,201.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Welfare Rolls Fall Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today trumpeted a further  
decline in the nation's welfare rolls and announced steps intended 
to keep the numbers shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, just over 7.6 million Americans were receiving  
public assistance at the end of December, down from nearly 8 
million at the end of September and 14.3 million in 1994, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To continue the downtrend, Clinton also announced final  
regulations to hold states accountable for shifting welfare 
recipients into jobs and give them greater flexibility in using 
federal money to pay for child care, transportation and 
job-retention services. 
</P>
<P>
	``For too long, too many Americans were trapped in a broken  
welfare system that exiled generation after generation from the 
mainstream of American life by cutting them off from the world of 
work,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio address. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reforming our broken welfare system was the right thing to do.  
Now we must finish the job,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the president announced that the number of  
people on welfare had fallen to its lowest level in 30 years. 
Today's figures show a further decrease of 340,000 recipients in 
the three months from October through December 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton placed heavy emphasis on opening doors of employment  
opportunity to welfare recipients, saying that work helps instill 
dignity and purpose in people. For its part, the federal government 
has hired nearly 12,000 welfare recipients, exceeding the 10,000 
goal set two years ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulation the president announced today, part of the  
welfare overhaul law Congress enacted in 1996, enforces state work 
requirements and holds states to task for moving welfare recipients 
into jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This regulation says loud and clear people ought to get  
paychecks, not welfare checks,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule also makes it easier for states to use welfare block  
grants to pay for child care and transportation -- two stumbling 
blocks for those seeking to move from welfare rolls to payrolls, 
the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	He praised the Senate's recent approval of a measure to help  
low-income families pay for child care and made a pitch for his 
proposal to give tax credits and other support to working families. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the falling welfare numbers, Clinton warned against  
forgetting about those who come from poor neighborhoods with 
limited jobs skills and will have the toughest time moving off 
welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	He called on Congress to approve his proposal to extend a  
welfare-to-work program already in place. The administration's 2000 
budget seeks $1 billion to help 200,000 long-term welfare 
recipients in high-poverty areas move to work. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also wants Congress to fully fund a $430 million  
proposal to give housing vouchers that help people on welfare move 
closer to a new job and $150 million in transportation money to 
help people get to jobs, often in suburbs not served by public 
transportation.

<HEADLINE>  Springsteen Kicks Off World Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Reunited with his old band, Bruce  
Springsteen opened his world tour to a sold-out crowd of 20,000 in 
Barcelona's Saint George Palace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boss did not disappoint in his first tour with the E Street  
Band in more than a decade. They opened Friday with ``My Love Will 
Not Let You Down'' and ``Prove It All Night.'' And that's what they 
did, captivating the crowd for 2 1/2 hours through 19 songs and five 
encores. 
</P>
<P>
	After delighting the Barcelona fans with a greeting spoken in  
Catalan, Springsteen hardly addressed his audience during the 
high-energy performance bursting with old favorites including 
``Badlands,'' ``10th Avenue Freezeout'' and ``The River.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another highlight was a duet, ``Mansion on the Hill,'' sung with  
his wife, Patti Scialfa, who also played guitar and sang back-up 
throughout the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's concert, and a second date Sunday also in this  
northeastern Spanish city, mark the beginning of a 17-city European 
tour for Springsteen and the E Street Band. Dates include Munich, 
Zurich, London, Dublin and Paris before the wrapping up in Madrid. 
The first U.S. performances aren't until mid-July.

<HEADLINE> Chevrolet Pulls Plug on '99 Monte </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRISTOL, Tenn. (AP) -- Chevrolet's struggles to get its new Monte  
Carlo on the track during the 1999 Winston Cup season ended 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp. announced that it was halting its bid to  
win NASCAR's approval of the new car in time to get it on the track 
this year, and that the 2000 Monte Carlo's Winston Cup debut would 
wait until next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Since most Chevrolet teams had been operating for several weeks  
on the assumption that the new car would not be ready this year, 
Saturday's announcement was a mere formality. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevrolet marketing general manager Kurt Ritter said that even  
if NASCAR were to approve the car immediately, Monte Carlo teams 
don't think they could get a car ready this year without 
jeopardizing their 1999 title chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot ask them to take such a risk,'' Ritter said.  
</P>
<P>
	Chevrolet's 12-month quest to get the Monte Carlo approved by  
the sport's sanctioning body has resulted in a car that, according 
to Ritter, would be ``uncompetitive on the race track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR officials elected against responding to Ritter's  
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	GM said the decision to delay the introduction of the race car  
would not affect the street version of the 2000 Monte Carlo, which 
remains on schedule for retail delivery late this summer. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WALTRIP'S LAMENT:* Darrell Waltrip leads all drivers with 12  
victories at Bristol Motor Speedway, but he isn't terribly fond of 
racing on the .533-mile, high-banked oval. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason? When Waltrip was younger, the starting fields at  
Bristol generally were limited to 34 or 36 cars. Now the fields are 
43, a number that Waltrip feels cramps an already tight track. 
</P>
<P>
	``The leader takes the green flag and the 43rd guy is in the  
middle of the back straightaway,'' he said. ``In 20 laps the leader 
is lapping the back of the field. That's not good racing.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TIME TRIALS:* John Andretti led Saturday's second-round  
qualifying for the Food City 500 with a fast lap of 123.905 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Had Andretti gone that fast in Friday's opening round of time  
trials when the top 25 starting spots were set, he would have 
earned the 12th position. Instead, he will start 26th on Sunday's 
43-car grid. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven drivers failed to earn one of the top 36 spots available  
to the fastest qualifiers and had to take provisional starting 
spots. They were Johnny Benson, Ward Burton, Ernie Irvan, Chad 
Little, Jeremy Mayfield, Steve Park and Michael Waltrip. 
</P>
<P>
	Failing to make the field were Stanton Barrett, Rich Bickle,  
Derrike Cope and Carl Long. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *EARNHARDT WRECK:* Seven-time Winston Cup champion Dale  
Earnhardt crashed his Chevrolet in Saturday's final practice 
session. Earnhardt was not injured, but he will have to switch to a 
backup car for Sunday's race, forcing him to start from the rear of 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Television replays showed Earnhardt appeared to lose control of  
his car as he went down the frontstretch, setting off a long slide 
that ended when the front end of his car slammed into the concrete 
retaining wall near the first turn. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was loose up off the corner,'' Earnhardt said. ``We kept  
working on it, but it just got out from under me. We'll unload the 
backup car and see if we can get it ready. We can come back and win 
from where we're at.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *C'EST LA VIE:* Michael Waltrip tried to be philosophical about  
damaging the right rear end of his car in a crash during 
qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're all going to look like this sooner or later at Bristol  
anyway,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Shocked Tornado Victims Clean Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLUE ASH, Ohio (AP) -- A day after a tornado sliced through  
Cincinnati's northern suburbs, killing four and destroying hundreds 
of homes, residents on Saturday hurried to salvage their belongings 
before another round of storms raked the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Meiser pushed his dented lawn mower off the concrete slab  
that used to be his garage, maneuvered through piles of debris and 
parked it on his pocked front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
	While revving chain saws and rumbling repair trucks blended into  
a background din, Meiser and his wife, Vicki, picked through what 
was left of their home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost the garage and the whole roof. They're probably going  
to have to raze it and start over,'' Meiser said. ``We're just 
trying to move things along as fast as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state Emergency Management Agency estimated Saturday that  
900 homes were damaged in Hamilton, Clinton and Warren counties in 
southwest Ohio. Red Cross shelters remained open while police 
sealed off streets so repair crews could restore electricity and 
clear debris. 
</P>
<P>
	The predawn storm raced across the county. A tornado briefly  
touched down to the west, jumped back up and came down with full 
fury in Blue Ash and Montgomery, two upscale suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Two motorists were killed when their vehicles were flipped off  
the highway. A couple was killed when the tornado leveled their 
house in Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado took off the Meisers' roof, blew out their windows  
and smashed their garage. Neighbors on one side suffered only minor 
damage, and the neighbors on the other side had portions of their 
roof scraped off. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the street, Suzanne Smith's condominium suffered only  
minor damage -- a downed maple tree, a piece of the eaves missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Smith heard the wind howl, rode out the storm and emerged  
from her condo to see the frightening site across the street. 
</P>
<P>
	``I opened the front door and looked over there and I couldn't  
believe it,'' she said. ``I said, `Lord, don't let me see Vicki and 
her husband trapped.' I went over there and when I got there she 
screamed out, 'We're OK.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Even those who escaped Friday's storm shuddered when they heard  
the forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just very lucky but you know what?'' Ms. Smith said.  
``We're supposed to get more storms at 3 a.m.''

<HEADLINE> Mets' Piazza Sprains Knee Ligaments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- New York Mets catcher Mike Piazza has two  
sprained ligaments in his right knee, and may be sidelined 2-3 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza, who was injured Friday, was sent back to New York by the  
Mets on Saturday for an MRI, which revealed sprained medial 
collateral and posterior cruciate ligaments, Mets spokesman Jay 
Horwitz said Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The MRI did not detect any cartilage damage.  
</P>
<P>
	``The good news is that he doesn't need surgery,'' Horwitz said.  
``The bad news is that it will take 2-3 weeks to settle down. The 
disabled list is a possibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza twisted the knee in a rundown during Friday night's 10-3  
victory over the Montreal Expos. He remained in the game for two 
more innings before being taken out for a pinch hitter in the 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza was in the starting lineup for Saturday's game, but  
general manager Steve Phillips, who was in New York, thought he 
catcher should return to have the knee checked by team doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was some swelling and this is very precautionary,'' Mets  
assistant general manager Carmen Fusco said before the diagnosis. 
``He's walking fine on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza, acquired last year from the Florida Marlins after he  
left the Los Angeles Dodgers, is starting a $91 million, seven-year 
contract. He is hitting .429 (9-for-21) with two homers and a 
team-leading eight RBIs.

<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Defender Carlos Llamosa scored on the  
ninth shot of the shootout and D.C. United remained unbeaten with a 
3-2 victory over the New England Revolution on Saturday in Major 
League Soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	In the shootout, the United's Marco Etcheverry, Geoff Aunger and  
Ben Olsen scored on the first, seventh and eighth shots. New 
England's Joe-Max Moore, Jair and Dan Calichman matched those 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
	But then Llamosa placed the ball under goalkeeper Walter Zenga  
to make it 4-3, and the Revolution's Ted Chronopolous misfired high 
and wide to the left on the next shot. 
</P>
<P>
	United (3-0) took a 1-0 lead when Aunger scored on a header with  
just nine seconds remaining in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore made it 1-1 with his second goal of the season on a direct  
kick at 49:32. At 72:57, Roy Lassiter converted a cross from the 
right wing by Olsen for his fourth goal of the season and a 2-1 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	But with 7:39 remaining in regulation, New England forward  
Johnny Torres scored from the right wing, beating goalkeeper Tom 
Presthus to the far left post.

<HEADLINE> Jurors Return $27M Poultry Verdict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A man who said Perdue Farms Inc. betrayed a  
confidentiality agreement and stole his secret method of preparing 
roasted chicken was awarded $27 million by a jury. 
</P>
<P>
	It is now up to a judge to decide how much the nation's  
third-largest poultry company must pay to Dennis P. Hook in 
punitive damages. The jury awarded the compensatory damages on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Robert H. Bonanno must also decide whether to halt  
Perdue's marketing and sale of TenderReady chicken 
</P>
<P>
	Hook said Perdue's TenderReady chicken was based on his idea.  
</P>
<P>
	The method of preparation worked on much the same principle as  
boil-in-the-bag vegetables. The chicken was fully cooked and could 
be heated quickly -- important qualities in the fast-food industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Hook had an agreement with Pizza Hut in the early 1990s to  
develop his method. Pizza Hut turned to Perdue for poultry. 
</P>
<P>
	Hook said he demonstrated his process to Perdue, and the company  
signed a confidentiality agreement which he claimed they then 
broke.

<HEADLINE> Rifle Found Near Dead Doctor's Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMHERST, N.Y. (AP) -- A rifle found near the home of a slain  
abortion doctor may yield important clues for investigators trying 
to track down the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Barnett Slepian was killed in his kitchen by a sniper's  
bullet last fall. Investigators said Friday they found a rifle 
buried near his home in the Buffalo suburb of Amherst. 
</P>
<P>
	The gun was sent to the FBI laboratory in Washington to  
determine whether it was used to kill Slepian. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's not too badly rusted, they may be able to match the  
bullet back to the weapon,'' said Walter Rowe, forensics sciences 
professor at George Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
	The rifle might also have clothing fibers, fingerprints or a  
serial number that can be traced to the buyer, Rowe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buried a foot beneath the ground, the weapon was unearthed  
during a search of a heavily wooded, four-acre area Thursday. 
Investigators did not say how close the weapon was to the house. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-abortion protester James Kopp is being sought as a material  
witness in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Kopp's car was seen in the neighborhood in  
the days before the slaying. Kopp vanished after the shooting, and 
the car was found abandoned at the Newark, N.J., airport in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said DNA test results showed a likelihood that a  
strand of hair discovered behind Slepian's home came from Kopp.

<HEADLINE> Murder Charge in Sex-Torture Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES, N.M. (AP) -- A man has been charged in the  
death of a 22-year-old woman whose disappearance is part of a 
10-state investigation into alleged sexual torture and kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	While police have said for weeks the case possibly involved  
murder, their searches of a rural home and a lake have produced no 
bodies, including that of the missing woman. 
</P>
<P>
	The only murder charge in the case is the one filed against  
Dennis Roy Yancy, 27, of Truth or Consequences. He was arrested 
Friday night and charged in the death of Marie B. Parker, 22, who 
disappeared in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation last month led to charges of kidnapping and  
sexual torture against David Parker Ray and his girlfriend, Cynthia 
Lea Hendy. 
</P>
<P>
	Yancy, ordered held without bail, is a known associate of Ray  
and Ms. Hendy, FBI agent Doug Beldon said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Parker was last seen July 5, 1997, at a now-closed saloon  
not far from Ray's home, Beldon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation started March 22 when one of Ray's neighbors  
saw a woman naked and bloody on a road, wearing only a padlocked 
collar. The woman told police she had been shocked with electricity 
and tortured sexually. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, dozens of FBI agents and federal authorities have  
combed Ray's home, collecting more than 1,000 pieces of evidence, 
digging around the property and bringing in a cadaver-sniffing dog 
to roam the property. 
</P>
<P>
	Beldon said the investigation has expanded across 10 states and  
law officers also have searched Elephant Butte Lake for evidence. 
State and federal authorities won't list all the states, but said 
two of them are Texas and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	John Branaugh, an acquaintance of Ms. Hendy, has said she told  
him Ray killed four to six people, mutilated the bodies and dumped 
them in the lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have said they seized photos, some explicit, from  
Ray's property and were cross-checking them with missing-persons 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray, 59, and Ms. Hendy, 39, were charged with numerous crimes,  
including kidnapping, sexual abuse, battery and conspiracy. Both 
have pleaded innocent and remain in jail in lieu of $1 million bail 
each. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to murder, Yancy was charged with kidnapping,  
conspiracy and evidence tampering, Beldon said. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman who said she once rented a trailer to Yancy said she saw  
him with Hendy a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people were all running together and they weren't very  
approvable,'' Dee Phillips, 68, said in a telephone interview 
Saturday. ``I had that whole bunch around here. When I went to bed 
at night, I put a bar on the back door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yancy ``didn't seem to have a conscience,'' Mrs. Phillips said.  
``I didn't like his company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Parker had two daughters, ages 4 and 5.  
</P>
<P>
	Her mother, Kate, said last week the FBI had requested dental  
records, clothing and photos of her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	A missing person's report filed by Ms. Parker's half-brother,  
Tom McCouley, said he feared she was involved in a bad drug deal.

<HEADLINE> Fugitive Caught in Dog Cage Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHILTON, Wis. (AP) -- A woman sentenced to a year in jail for  
child abuse that included putting her daughter in a dog cage was in 
custody in Texas on Saturday, nearly two weeks after she failed to 
return to jail after a counseling session. 
</P>
<P>
	Angeline Rogers, 29, and her former cell-mate, Jerri Deadmond,  
were caught in San Antonio Friday evening, said Calumet County 
Sheriff's investigator John Dedering. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities had been searching for the women since March 30,  
when Mrs. Rogers did not return to the county jail after her 
counseling session. Authorities found her car at Deadmond's home. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Rogers and her husband, Michael, were convicted of abusing  
four of their five children, including locking their 7-year-old 
daughter in a dog cage. They were both sentenced to a year in jail, 
with work-release privileges. 
</P>
<P>
	The women were being held in a San Antonio jail Saturday  
awaiting extradition proceedings scheduled to start Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Rogers could face an additional 11 years in custody.

<HEADLINE> Apathy Reigns at Italy's Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TURIN, Italy (AP) -- A meeting of Telecom Italia shareholders'  
fell short of a quorum Saturday, failing to approve a plan to fend 
off Olivetti's hostile takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Failure to have enough shareholders turn out to make the vote  
count raised some eyebrows. One third of the voting shares was 
needed for a quorum, but only 22.5 percent were represented. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing that management didn't know what was going on,  
and it shows that it doesn't have control of the situation,'' said 
Antonio Argentino, a representative of a Telecom employees 
association that backs the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti unveiled its $58 billion proposed hostile bid in  
February, and later sweetened it to $65.2 billion. Olivetti said 
Friday it had submitted a partially complete prospectus to stock 
market regulator Consob to move ahead with the takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti also said that its lawyers have contacted Consob to  
force Telecom to make public immediately all the information 
relative to Saturday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders were supposed to vote Saturday on the conversion of  
some 2.17 billion voting shares into ordinary shares. That would 
have made a takeover far more expensive for Olivetti. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts felt Telecom's failure Saturday to reach a quorum  
might pay off later for the former state monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom chief executive Franco Bernabe can now combine  
Saturday's motions with another defensive move: a proposed merger 
with Telecom Italia Mobile, Italy's largest cellular phone operator 
which is 60 percent owned by Telecom. That merger is scheduled for 
shareholder approval in late April.

<HEADLINE> Adonis Is Golden in Wood Memorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Trainer Nick Zito looks like he has himself  
another Kentucky Derby starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Adonis caught the leaders at the top of the stretch and pulled  
away just outside the eighth pole for a two-length victory in 
Saturday's $600,000 Wood Memorial at Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Zito, a two-time Derby winner with Strike the Gold and Go for  
Gin, already has Stephen Got Even set for the May 1 Derby and said 
he'll probably take Wondertross, too, despite a sixth-place finish 
in the Blue Grass Stakes run earlier in the day at Keeneland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy with Adonis, and disappointed with Wondertross,''  
Zito said from Keeneland after listening to the live call of the 
Wood. 
</P>
<P>
	Adonis, wearing blinkers for the first time at the suggestion of  
jockey Jorge Chavez, won for the third time in his last four races. 
In his previous race, Adonis was sixth in the Florida Derby but had 
a poor trip after being forced outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Adonis, owned by Ernie Paragallo, covered 1 1/8 miles in 1:47 3-5,  
2-5 of second off the stakes record. Adonis finished two lengths 
ahead of Best of Luck, with Cliquot third, another 1 3/4 lengths back. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner returned $8.40, $5.10 and $3.90. Best of Luck,  
trained by Hall of Famer Allen Jerkens, paid $8.80 and $5.60, and 
Cliquot, a California shipper, returned $5 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Badge, the 2-1 favorite of the crowd of 15,104, was fourth,  
followed by The Groom Is Red, Swamp, Machine To Tower, David, 
Karley's Harley, Bugatti and Robin Goodfellow. 
</P>
<P>
	Zito also trains The Groom Is Red for Boston Celtics president  
and coach Rick Pitino. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Wood, Zito said he expected a ``big, big  
performance.'' And he got it from the lightly raced colt, who has 
run just six races. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope we're there again,'' Zito said. ``Jorge suggested that  
we put blinkers on him, he was not paying attention and not 
concentrating. He was absolutely right. This combination worked. 
Jorge is a terrific rider. I think he's going to get his due now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Zito, the win was his second in the Wood, one of the final  
major prep races for the Derby. He won with Thirty Six Red in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	On the undercard, Perfect Score held off Royal Ruby by a head to  
win the $100,000 Bayshore for 3-year-olds, covering seven furlongs 
in 1:23. The winner returned $9.10, 4.90 and $3.30. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly Kip, the 2-5 favorite, broke his own track record for six  
furlongs in winning the $100,000 Bold Ruler Stakes by 2 1/2 lengths 
over Artax. Kelly Kip's time of 1:07 2-5 clipped 1-5 of a second 
off the mark he set on April 11, 1998. The winner paid $2.90, $2.30 
and $2.10.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Man Claims CIA Discriminates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A lawyer for the CIA suspended for failing to  
disclose contacts with Israelis says the agency is hounding him out 
of a job based on bias about his Jewish faith and his family's 
support for Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency vehemently denied the charge today and said it does  
not tolerate anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyer, Adam Ciralsky, 27, has been on unpaid leave since  
October 1997 due to concerns within the CIA's counterintelligence 
office that he had failed polygraph examinations about his support 
for Israel and past contact with Israelis with possible ties to 
intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-Semitism charge revolves around blunt language  
contained in internal CIA memos, including one in which a senior 
official writes, ``From my experience with rich Jewish friends from 
college, I would fully expect Adam's wealthy daddy to support 
Israeli political/social causes.'' In another, a polygraph 
interrogator writes of questioning Ciralsky that, ``I got into his 
face just a little bit. ... Needless to say, his chair was backed 
against the wall in no time at all!'' 
</P>
<P>
	A third memo, like the others dating from the fall of 1997,  
indicates that Ciralsky's fate was decided by CIA Director George 
Tenet even before Ciralsky took an additional polygraph test. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tenet says this guy is outta here because of a lack of  
candor,'' the memo notes. Pointing to an upcoming lie-detector 
test, the memo concludes, ``Once that's over, it looks like we'll 
be waving good-bye to our friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Copies of the documents were provided to The Associated Press on  
Friday by Neal Sher, Ciralsky's attorney. The names of the authors 
of the memos were blacked out. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the case were reported Friday by National Public  
Radio. 
</P>
<P>
	After the NPR broadcast, Tenet issued a statement to CIA  
employees saying that the CIA has examined the allegations of 
anti-Semitism and found nothing to substantiate them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not tolerate anti-Semitism or any other form of  
discrimination at the agency,'' Tenet said. ``Anti-Semitism is 
repugnant to me and to all that our agency and our country stand 
for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA also contacted three former CIA directors, John Deutch,  
Robert Gates and William Webster, who signed a joint statement 
calling the Ciralsky allegations ``completely inconsistent with 
everything we know about the CIA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deutch attached a personal addendum: ``I am Jewish and during my  
entire experience with the CIA -- since the time I first came into 
contact with it in 1975 throughout my tenure as (director) which 
concluded in 1997 -- I never encountered any hint of anti-Semitism 
at any point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through his lawyer, Ciralsky declined to comment, saying he is  
prohibited from speaking publicly since he is still technically 
employed by the CIA. Ciralsky has not yet sued, though Sher said he 
intends to sue for discrimination within weeks. Sher also wrote to 
Attorney General Janet Reno, alleging that the CIA's handling of 
the case had violated Ciralsky's privacy rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Sher said the case points to lingering resentment within the CIA  
over the Jonathan Pollard spy case from 1985 in which a civilian 
analyst for the Navy gave Israel thousands of highly classified 
documents. Pollard is serving a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA declined to comment on the details of the case. The  
memos indicate the concern was Ciralsky's apparent evasiveness in 
acknowledging contacts that the CIA had confirmed through other 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be very important for you to get him to admit clearly  
and unequivocally that he and his family (daddy, David, Mom, etc.) 
all are deep supporters of Israel,'' a CIA official wrote in the 
memo that referred to Ciralsky's ``wealthy daddy.'' The memo said 
Ciralsky ``must be made to understand that this will not be 
misunderstood by CIA, for we are sophisticated and broad-minded 
enough to understand the unique ties that bind American Jews to 
their brethren in Israel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA established a five-member panel to examine the Ciralsky  
case and look at anti-Semitism issues more broadly. The members 
were former CIA Director Webster, retired Adm. William Crowe, 
attorney Nicole Seligman, one of President Clinton's attorneys in 
the impeachment trial, and attorneys Ely Jacobs and Henry Rosovsky. 
Tenet said none of the CIA's inquiries found evidence to support 
the anti-Semitism charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League,  
said in a telephone interview he was concerned by the language in 
some of the CIA memos but did not believe the CIA was 
institutionally anti-Semitic.

<HEADLINE> Broccoli Gets Popularity Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Watch out Mr. Bush! Broccoli is making a  
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	After lackluster sales in the early 1990s, the vegetable once  
deemed by the former president as his least favorite is gaining in 
popularity with consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	One factor may be well-publicized studies showing broccoli  
sprouts may help prevent cancer because they are loaded with a 
concentrated form of sulforaphane, a powerful cancer fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	A second explanation is convenience, says Gary Lucier, an  
economist with Agriculture Department's economic research service. 
</P>
<P>
	Full of vitamins and nutrients, the pre-cut and packaged fresh  
broccoli products fit right into the schedules and on the plates of 
today's busy families. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are time pressed,'' Lucier said. ``They're always  
looking for ways to save time. Because broccoli growers recognized 
that, they came up with a range of convenience items, broccoli 
florets, broccoli cole slaw.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The convenience aspect and the nutritional aspects. . . people  
are going to go to any lengths for that,'' Lucier said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department reports revenue for the broccoli  
industry has risen 24 percent in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail prices for fresh broccoli in 1998 were about $1.10 a  
pound, a 12 percent increase from the previous year. Because of the 
renewed demand for broccoli, the fresh market price has jumped 27 
percent since 1995, the USDA says. 
</P>
<P>
	The average American ate 5.6 pounds of fresh broccoli last year  
compared with 3.4 pounds in 1992, as well as 2.1 pounds of frozen 
broccoli products. The combined total of 7.7 pounds compares with 
5.8 pounds in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The department reports 84 percent of broccoli consumers said  
they had purchased pre-cut broccoli florets in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Grabowski, spokesman for the Washington-based Grocery  
Manufacturers of America -- the largest association for food and 
consumer product companies -- said a recent consumer survey done for 
the association found that convenience in food products was second 
only to taste. Nutrition ranked third followed by price. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it's the big family portions or the small servings  
it's all about convenience,'' Grabowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Making healthy foods convenient has worked for other vegetables  
too, such as lettuce and carrots. 
</P>
<P>
	Lettuce, once sold just by the head, now can be found in  
convenient pre-cut packages. Baby carrots are packaged for that 
consumer wanting a fast but healthy snack. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Americans ate about 13.6 pounds of carrots each and 7.4  
pounds of leaf and romaine lettuce, compared to 8.3 and 4.7 pounds 
in 1992, Lucier said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The convenience aspect of vegetables has become a pretty large  
industry,'' Lucier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vegetable grower Boskovich Farms in Oxnard, Calif., which leads  
the states in broccoli production, has seen its business for 
pre-cut broccoli grow in the last five years, company officials 
said. The prepackaged product at Boskovich Farms is sold to 
restaurants and institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	``More restaurants use it because it's faster and it's easier,''  
said marketing manager Lindsay Martinez. ``There's less cleanup. 
You don't have ice which is shipped with carton broccoli and can be 
real messy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The taste is going to better than frozen and you don't have  
additional cooking time you would have with frozen,'' Martinez 
said. ``It's just easier for the operations to use.''

<HEADLINE> New Device May Soon Sort Your Trash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- Out of tuna fish? Low on pasta? Just toss  
your empty cans and boxes into the trash and your shopping will be 
done. 
</P>
<P>
	Futuristic fantasy? Maybe not, says NCR Corp.  
</P>
<P>
	The Dayton-based company said Friday it has developed a trash  
receptacle that translates coding on empty containers into a 
shopping list that can be wired to retailers for delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a research project at the moment,'' said Stephen Emmott,  
director of NCR's Knowledge Lab in London, England. But there is 
``a fully working prototype in the lab.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emmott said the Intelligent Bin is embedded with a  
microprocessor that reads product identification codes. The 
information is transmitted wirelessly either to a computer or 
special electronic box, which compiles a list of the discarded 
items. 
</P>
<P>
	That list can then be sent to retailers over the Internet, or  
consumers can simply use the device to create their own shopping 
list, Emmott said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The benefit to consumers is this incredible convenience, to  
automatically be able to reorder things,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmott said it would also give retailers a better idea of what  
consumers like and take some of the guesswork out of marketing. 
Merchants could tailor discount coupons and special offers based on 
consumption patterns. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they know a particular consumer is consuming ice cream and  
also throws a package of strawberries away, they begin to learn 
consumer habits,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trash cans could be on the market within five to 10 years,  
but it will require the industry to move away from bar codes, 
Emmott said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bins would require widespread use of radio frequency  
identification technology -- a tiny computer chip and antenna 
embedded in product labels -- which carries more information than 
bar codes. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology has been little used because it's too expensive  
to put on inexpensive products, said Bob Glavin, spokesman for 
Monarch Marking Systems, a maker of bar-code products. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Arlen, president of Arlen Communications, a research  
company specializing in interactive media, said this age of home 
shopping would favor a smart trash can, but some consumers might 
balk. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do you feel about someone keeping track of what you use  
for toilet paper?'' he asked. ``For some people it will be a 
problem.''

<HEADLINE> Steve Pate Not Your Average Golfer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Steve Pate is not your typical golfer.  
</P>
<P>
	It's not that he shot 65 Saturday to land within two strokes of  
the lead heading into the final round of the Masters, or even that 
he got there by making seven birdies in a row, something no other 
golfer has done in the 63 years of this tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	No. What makes Pate different is the way he keeps crashing into  
things away from the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
	He walked into the interview room after one of the most sublime  
stretches ever at Augusta National and spent most of his time 
recounting what he's hit in recent years besides greens in 
regulation. The first collision forced him to take 1996 off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I drove my car into a truck at 75 mph and broke my hand and  
wrist. Probably should have come out a lot worse than I did,'' he 
began. ``Then I broke my left wrist that August. I tripped and fell 
on a dock on vacation with my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A reporter interrupted. Some priceless Q&AMP;A followed. Here are  
excerpts: 
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``Where was that?''  
</P>
<P>
	A: ``Lake Powell.''  
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``And what about the one at Kiawah?''  
</P>
<P>
	A: ``Some deep muscle bruises. I wasn't driving that time,  
though. I was a passenger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``Was that a limo?''  
</P>
<P>
	A: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``What did I read about the deer accident?''  
</P>
<P>
	A: ``I didn't get hurt. I got hit by a deer on my bike.''  
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``Where was that?''  
</P>
<P>
	A: ``In my driveway. My dog was chasing it and it broadsided me.  
It was small, around 40 pounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``A deer got caught in the bicycle's headlights?''  
</P>
<P>
	A: ``That was it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``Have you had any other weird things happen?''  
</P>
<P>
	A: ``That about covers it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Well, not exactly.  
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Pate flew as close to heaven as the golfing gods  
allow. For an hour and a half, he couldn't miss. 
</P>
<P>
	He started the day at 2 over par, birdied the third hole and  
walked onto the seventh green after hitting a sand wedge to 7 feet. 
Pate had played Augusta five times before, but not since 1993. What 
struck him as he lined up the 7-footer for birdie was not that he 
might be standing at the threshold of history, but rather that this 
was the ``only straight putt I've ever had here, I think.'' It went 
straight in. 
</P>
<P>
	At the eighth, he pitched a wedge to 20 feet and made it. At the  
ninth, Pate cozied a 9-iron to 1 foot. At No. 10, he drained a 
near-miracle from 45 feet. At No. 11, an only slightly less 
miraculous 30-footer fell. 
</P>
<P>
	At the graveyard-of-champions 12th, Pate ended any suspense  
about tying the record of six consecutive birdies held by Johnny 
Miller, Mark Calcavecchia and David Toms by sticking an 8-iron less 
than a foot from the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	About the time he pulled the ball from the hole, Pate looked  
back to see thousands staring at him. His playing partner, Lee 
Westwood, and his caddy, Allan Mellan, were staring, too, 
determined to treat Pate like a pitcher throwing a perfect game. 
Both kept telling themselves over and over, ``Stay out of the 
way,'' but refused to say a word, lest they break the spell. 
</P>
<P>
	The galleries, though, were roaring.  
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``How many people started watching you today as opposed to  
how many people finished watching you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A: ``That's a good question. I know there were a lot of people  
in the middle of the round. They started appearing out of nowhere, 
out of the trees, like Big Foot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``Steve, after that birdie on 12, you kind of walked back  
into the woods a little bit. What were you doing?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A: ``Tucking in my shirt.''  
</P>
<P>
	At the par-5 13th, Pate hit a 3-wood off the tee, 5-iron down  
the fairway and tucked a lob wedge to within 7 feet of the flag. He 
made that for the record. 
</P>
<P>
	For all the mirth and composure Pate showed on this day, it's  
worth mentioning that his chief sponsor is Tabasco brand hot sauce 
and his professional nickname is ``Volcano.'' Pate got the former 
for the same reason a PGA Tour official gave him the nickname at 
the start of the decade-- at outsized temper, occasionally displayed 
on the heels of a bad shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``Steve, are you still a volcano or did that disappear after  
the injuries and the year off?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say it's disappeared, but it's gone way in the  
background since the year off. After getting in a serious car 
accident, somehow hitting a bad shot doesn't seem quite as big a 
deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Pate plays the final round the way he did the third one,  
though, it will be the biggest deal in a career not exactly 
bursting with them.

<HEADLINE> FBI Raids Home of Accused Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- FBI agents executed a search warrant Saturday  
at the New Mexico home of a scientist fired from his job at the Los 
Alamos National Laboratory under suspicion he passed nuclear 
weapons secrets to China, federal and law enforcement sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson confirmed the warrant was  
executed in ``the ongoing investigation of alleged espionage,'' but 
he would not say where. 
</P>
<P>
	But three other sources said the warrant raid was on the  
residence of Taiwan-born American Wen Ho Lee, who was fired last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources would not describe what may have been confiscated  
but said the search was part of an effort by the FBI and the Energy 
Department to determine whether criminal charges should be brought. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Lee nor anybody else has been charged in the  
investigation, which began in 1996 into whether the scientist 
transferred intelligence on the W-88 nuclear warhead during the 
Reagan administration. 
</P>
<P>
	China's government-run Xinhua News Agency reported last month  
that Lee attended two conferences with Chinese counterparts in the 
1980s but said no secrets were passed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today the FBI executed a search warrant related to the ongoing  
investigation of alleged espionage at the Department of Energy's 
Los Alamos National Laboratory,'' Richardson said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to comment on details ``because I do not want to  
jeopardize the ability of the FBI and the system of justice to 
carry out their investigation and any subsequent action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson stressed that nobody has been charged, and FBI  
sources have cautioned in the past that charges might never be 
filed in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretary said the FBI is ``pursuing this case vigorously,  
and the Department of Energy is supporting the law enforcement 
effort fully. We've also taken a number of actions to ensure strong 
protection of the national security capabilities at Energy 
Department labs, now and in the future.''

<HEADLINE> Defending Champion O'Meara Rallies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga.. (AP) -- Besides being the defending Masters  
champion, Mark O'Meara is also a realist. 
</P>
<P>
	He feels he's too far back for another Sunday charge to the  
green jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have much of a chance, to be honest,'' O'Meara said  
after shooting a 3-under-par 69 to get to 1-under 215. ``I'm 
probably out of the tournament unless there is a miracle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Maria Olazabal was the leader at 209.  
</P>
<P>
	The diabolical 17th hole took the steam out of O'Meara's bid on  
Saturday. Masters officials moved the tee back 25 yards to 425 
yards and planted numberous pine trees down both sides on the 
par-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, somebody forgot to water the green.  
</P>
<P>
	``That hole just isn't fair,'' O'Meara said. ``It has a green  
harder than the LA freeway. I hit a 9-iron to the middle of the 
green and it almost ended up on the 18th tee box. There is a 
landing area there about five or six feet where you can hit it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara said he was at least proud of the way he defended his  
title and the fact he had made the cut in his 19th consecutive 
major. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's hard to do,'' he said. ``My game here this week was  
about 75 to 80 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *U.S. AMATEUR CHAMP A SPECTATOR:* Hank Kuehne didn't hit his  
wedges well enough to make the cut in the Masters but the U.S. 
amateur champion stayed around as a spectator for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had an awesome experience inside the ropes and now I'll get  
to see how it is outside the ropes,'' Kuehne said. ``I found out my 
wedge game wasn't good enough. You have to be very precise at 
Augusta National. I never had played a course setup this hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kuehne shot rounds of 74 and 78, eight strokes over par and four  
off the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuehne wouldn't say if or when he would turn professional. The  
Southern Methodist senior said he would make that decision later in 
the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now I just want to enjoy being at the Masters,'' said  
Kuehne, who is staying on the grounds in the ``crow's nest'' above 
the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ELDERLY FAN GETS UP CLOSE ACTION:* Dot Baker, 81, had no idea  
she would become part of the Masters action on Saturday when she 
parked her chair in her traditional spot left of the first fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott McCarron hooked his tee shot into the left woods and it  
came to rest next to her chair and cane. Rules officials asked her 
not to move until McCarron arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked if I could get up and they wouldn't let me so I just  
sat there,'' said Mrs. Baker, whose late husband Tom used to work 
as a scorer for the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got the best seat in the house,'' laughed McCarron, who  
marked his ball with a tee while Mrs. Baker got up and removed her 
chair and cane. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarron, who started the day one shot behind Jose Maria  
Olazabal, hit his next shot off the pine straw into the front 
bunker. He blasted out and two-putted for a bogey. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MCKNIGHT LEADS AMATEURS:* Tom McKnight, a petroleum distributor  
from Galax, Va., leads a strong amateur foursome going into 
Sunday's final round of the Masters. Low amateur wins a crystal 
vase and a medal. 
</P>
<P>
	McKnight, who defeated Spain's Sergio Garcia in the U.S. Amateur  
to 
/reach the finals and earn a bid to Augusta National, shot a 
1-over-par 73 and stood at 4-over 220. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been tremendous playing here and I hope I can get the  
low amateur medal,'' McKnight said. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Kuchar, the Georgia Tech junior, was a shot behind after  
shooting 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchar was sick early in the week but said ``I'm feeling better.  
My energy is climbing up every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	British amateur champion Garcia is two shots behind McKnight  
after shooting a 75. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great tournament,'' Garcia said. ``I just hope I can  
make a big move tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trevor Immelman of South Africa, the U.S. Public Links champion,  
shot 78 for 226. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ELKINGTON SAYS WATCH NORMAN:* Greg Norman's Masters collapses  
are the stuff of legend but close friend Steve Elkington says this 
is the year his fellow Australian could hold together and win the 
green jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	``Greg has always been a streaky player,'' Elkington said.  
``When he gets his confidence going, he's dangerous. I believe over 
the weekend he will be attacking like he did in the old days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norman was one shot behind leader Jose Maria Olazabal going into  
the weekend, when the Aussie has always managed to find disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Masters is the one blemish Greg would like to solve in his  
mind,'' Elkington said. ``It takes no genius to figure out what 
winning would mean to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TOUGHEST HOLE:* Television doesn't show the 205-yard, par-3  
fourth hole very often but it should. It's the hardest hole at 
Augusta National. 
</P>
<P>
	The hole ranked No. 1 with a 3.324 stroke average on Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	The much discussed No. 17, a 425-yard uphill par-4 framed by  
newly planted pine trees is No. 2 in difficulty. It played second 
hardest on Saturday with a 4.298 average.

<HEADLINE> Brothers Arrested in Vegas Robbery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- With helicopters hovering,  
camouflage-clad police swarmed on a remote mountain hideaway and 
arrested two brothers in connection with a $1.6 million armed 
robbery in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Alan Gonce, 59, and Fain T. Gonce, 63, were taken into  
custody Thursday for the Dec. 28, 1997, armed robbery of the United 
Coin Machine Co., said state police officer Mike Applegate. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen members of the state police tactical team,  
supported by Las Vegas detectives and sheriff's deputies, raided 
the brothers' isolated home near the Gila National Forest of 
southwestern New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of United Coin, which services Las Vegas slot  
machines, did not answer calls seeking comment today. 
</P>
<P>
	Las Vegas police said the 1997 robbery was carried out by two  
armed men wearing ski masks and jumpsuits while a driver waited 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Applegate said a third suspect in the heist, Eric Zessman, was  
arrested Thursday in Pahrump, Nev., by Las Vegas authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Police confiscated about $32,000 in cash, gold and silver coins  
from the brothers' place, along with property warranty deeds and 
receipts for $50,000 in mutual funds and other items, Applegate 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers also took about 30 weapons, including two that Las  
Vegas police suggest could have been used in the United Coin heist 
-- a .20-gauge shotgun and a 9mm semiautomatic pistol, Applegate 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why they were stockpiling all that ammunition, I don't know,''  
said sheriff's deputy Ron Hays.
