<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. warplanes Saturday fired
on Iraqi defense facilities in the no-fly zone in northern Iraq
after being targeted by Iraqi radar, the semi-official Anatolia
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said that a U.S. F-15 fighter patrolling the
restricted zone answered the Iraqi radar tracking with missiles
and then two U.S. warplanes attacked the radar base near Mosul,
the biggest city in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at about 3 p.m. local time (1200 GMT) and
there is no mention how many missiles were fired or damages
inflicted.
</P>
<P>
Those fighter planes took off from Incirlik air base in Adana,
southern Turkey, to police the no-fly zone, imposed by the
U.S. and its allies after the 1991 Gulf War, allegedly to protect
the Kurds there.
</P>
<P>
There are 45 warplanes of allied forces stationed at the
jointly-operated Incirlik as part of the Operation Northern Watch
to patrol the zone.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, two U.S. F-15 fighter jets took off from Incirlik
and fired three precision-guided bombs on an Iraqi missile site in
Mosul, citing similar situation.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, 17 U.S. fighter jets flew from the base, and
bombarded two Iraqi radar units and one anti-aircraft system in
Mosul.

<HEADLINE> Arafat in Jordan to Establish Ties with New Regent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
paid a brief visit to Amman Saturday to establish personal ties
with Abdullah Bin Hussein, the new crown prince and regent of the
Hashemite kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, a frequent visitor to Jordan, was greeted by Abdullah
at the Amman airport. They inspected a guard of honor before being
driven to the Raghadan Palace in the capital.
</P>
<P>
During a brief meeting at the palace, Arafat paid respect to
Abdullah as the new heir to the Jordanian throne, briefed him on
the deadlock over the Middle East peace process, and also inquired
about the health of King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
This was the first meeting between Arafat and Abdullah after
Abdullah replaced his uncle Hassan Ibn Talal as the crown prince
and regent in a shakeup masterminded by King Hussein five days ago.
</P>
<P>
After naming Abudllah, his eldest son, as the new crown prince,
and the regent during his absence, Hussein left here for a
hospital in the United States for emergency medical care as he was
suffering from a recurrent fever and low blood counts.
</P>
<P>
Hussein returned to stable condition after he was rushed to the
Mayo Clinic, Minnesota, the U.S., Jordanian officials said.
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old monarch had undergone six rounds of
chemotherapy for lymphatic cancer at the same hospital during the
second half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, 37, was an army major general in charge of the elite
special force that is responsible for the security of the Royal
Court and seemed an unknown figure to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
He is apparently on a busy diplomatic schedule this week,
receiving well-wishers, envoys, visitors, and messages of
congratulations from Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah had also met with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, who paid a special visit here Thursday to convey a
letter of congratulations from President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Clinton pledged continued economic, political
and military supports for the kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams Security Council for Failure to Lift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Sunday criticized a
U.N. Security Council memorandum saying the sanctions on Iraq is
still in place, which was issued by President of the U.N. Security
Council on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on Saturday afternoon reached an
agreement on establishing three panels to review Iraq's
disarmament and humanitarian issues and the fate of Kuwaiti
prisoners of war (POWs) allegedly detained by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Following the development, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
chaired a meeting attended by senior officials to discuss the
latest move of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, an Iraqi government spokesman said that "by
establishing three committees about Iraq whose work will last
several months, the Council did nothing but procrastinating and
keeping the unjust embargo in place on Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council required the three panels to submit their
assessment reports before April 15 and make recommendations on
what more needs to de done to settle the Iraqi issues.
</P>
<P>
Iraq demanded condemnation of and halt to the U.S. aggression,
respect of its sovereignty and national security, refrainment from
interfering in its internal affairs and the immediate lifting of
the embargo without any condition, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq was not consulted in the matter of setting up those
committees, so we are not concerned with such measure," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain bombarded Iraq for four consecutive days
in mid-December to retaliate what they claimed Iraq's
non-cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors charged with destroying
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
After the U.S.-British air raids, Iraq declared it will not
recognize what it called the illegal no-fly zones set up by
western allied forces after the 1991 Gulf War with a proclaimed
aim of protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims
in the south.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes have attacked Iraqi anti-aircraft
sites regularly after being targeted by Iraqi radar since then.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Hold General Strike in East Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Palestinians held a general
strike in east Jerusalem Sunday to protest against Israel's
demolition of an Palestinian home last week, which led to death of
a Palestinian young man.
</P>
<P>
Clashes broke out when Israeli army demolished a Palestinian
home last Tuesday in Isawyah, northeast of Jerusalem, in which
a 22-year-old Zaki Obeid was shot in the head by rubber bullets
fired by the Israeli police and died of his wounds last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians clashed with Israeli police again Friday
following Obeid's funeral, but no casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
Shops and businesses shut down Sunday in response to the strike
and the demonstrators urged the Israeli side to punish those
ordering to open fire on the Palestinians, a local shop owner said.
</P>
<P>
According to figures issued by the Palestinian side, 62
Palestinian homes near East Jerusalem and other areas in the West
Bank were demolished by the Israeli army and police recently on
the ground that the houses were built without permits or licenses
from the Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war and later annexed it. It has been encouraging Jews to move
into the area.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians, who claim Jerusalem as the capital of their
future state, say that Israel uses building permits as a form of
population control and rarely grants licenses in areas it wants to
cement its hold.

BERLIN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Freezing winter weather
gripped many parts of Europe over the weekend, claiming at least
five lives, said reports here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In Germany, two people died in a weather-related traffic
accident in Mainz-Kastel Saturday. A 17-year-old youth, who had no

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM: PKK Leader Returns to Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit claimed here Sunday that Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan has gone back to Italy.
</P>
<P>
"A reliable source in Italy pointed out that Ocalan is in
Italy, but we have no detailed information on whether Ocalan plans
to settle down in Italy or to proceed to another country from
Italy, " Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit dismissed denial from Rome of Ocalan's return to Italy,
saying the Italian government does not generally give accurate
information to Turkey concerning the whereabouts of Ocalan, leader
of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
In the same day, Italian ambassador to Turkey Massimilliano
Bandini was summoned to the Turkish foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry Deputy Undersecretary Faruk Logoglu
said "Bandini was summoned to the ministry to provide information
on the whereabouts of Ocalan. Our request for the extradition of
Ocalan is still valid."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Turkish reports had it that the fugitive PKK leader
left Italy on January 16, two months after arriving in Rome to
seek asylum, for an unidentified place. Reports of his landing in
Russia or "a Middle East country" were denied by related countries.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was detained in Rome on November 12 last year, after
arriving on a flight from Moscow, under international arrest
warrants issued by Germany and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
But Germany said later that it will not seek extradition of
Ocalan for fear of sparking unrest between its own Kurdish and
Turkish immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Italy and Turkey rifted after Italy rejected
Turkey's extradition request on account of the Italian law, which
forbids extradition to countries where the death penalty is in
force.
</P>
<P>
Over 37,000 people have been killed in the conflicts since 1984
when the PKK started a guerrilla war for autonomy in southeast
Turkey.

<HEADLINE> West European Economic Growth Slows to 2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth in western
Europe will slow to about 2 percent this year after a 2.8 percent
growth in 1998, the German economic research institute Ifo
predicted in an outlook issued in Munich Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report forecast that the situation on the labor market
would improve only marginally, with the unemployment rate falling
to an average of 9.75 percent in 1999 from 10 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The cost of living was predicted to increase 1.5 percent, the
same as last year.
</P>
<P>
The financial crises in Asia, Russia and Brazil were expected
to dampen exports, which have been the motor of the economic
upswing in western Europe, until well into 1999.
</P>
<P>
Western European exports were forecast to grow only about 4.5
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
"Latin America is likely to slide into a recession, while in
Russia the fall in production is expected to continue, and the
situation in China looks less favorable than previously thought,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth in the 15-nation European Union, Switzerland
and Norway would be fueled mainly be domestic demand in 1999, and
would pick up only in the second half of this year, the Ifo
outlook said.

<HEADLINE> Solana: NATO Still Seeking Political Solution to Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, January 31 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said the military bloc is serious about its threat of
using force to end the Kosovo crisis, but still is seeking a
negotiated political solution.
</P>
<P>
The NATO told the Sunday edition of the Spanish newspaper
Vanguardia that NATO's military threat was "undoubtedly serious",
and its purpose was to press ahead political negotiations between
the warring parties in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Authorized by NATO on Saturday to launch military action in
the southern Serbian province, Solana said the Serb and ethnic
Albanians must reach a "political accord" to bring about an
extensive autonomy there within three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he said, NATO will turn the military into reality.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, NATO delivered a strong warning against the
warring parties in Kosovo and threatened with military
intervention if they failed to stop fighting and start
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Reports said NATO's navy forces started to move to Adriatic on
January 20 following a show of intransigence by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic over the crisis, escalated by the
recent alleged massacre of 45 ethnic Albanians by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
Solana also blasted the conflicting parties for damaging
ceasefire agreement reached last October, and said Yugoslavia
should be the first to shoulder the responsibility.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong-based Goldlion
Holdings, a famous international retailer, announced recently
that its 1998 sales on the Chinese mainland hit 1.3 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Executive Manager Luo Huohuo said the sales represented an annu
al growth of 2.7 percent, with net profits for the year rising
3.5 percent to 159 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that mainland sales accounted for 80 percent
of the company's total business volume. Declining sales volumes
for Goldlion's subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Singapore due to the
Asian financial crisis have forced the company to withdraw
investments in a new shopping mall on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The company opened 48 sales outlets and 27 brand shops on the
mainland in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Luo added that Goldlion did not participate in the discount
spree which plagued many of the major brands last year, but
instead focused on unified distribution to assure the standard
wholesale and retail prices.
</P>
<P>
Goldlion entered the mainland market in 1987, and has since
enjoyed accumulated sales volume of 5.8 billion yuan and
contributed over 200 million yuan in taxes to state coffers.
Goldlion has been named as "the most competitive brand" for three
consecutive years.

WASHINGTON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers on Sunday:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO gave its secretary general the authority to launch
airstrikes anywhere in Yugoslavia on Saturday as Yugoslav
government and senior ethnic Albanian officials reacted
cautiously to Western demand that they begin prompt negotiations
on Kosovo's future.
</P>
<P>
-- Small majorities of Americans oppose the Senate's decision
to continue the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton and
take testimony from witnesses, and while the public remains
firmly against removing Clinton from office, 60 percent said the
Senate should censure his for his conduct, according to a new
Washington Post poll.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- NATO authorized military action against Serbia at anytime
if it does not agree to start talks next weekend in France with
the ethnic Albanian leaders of Kosovo about autonomy for the
province.
</P>
<P>
-- Republicans said they were not blind to the public distaste
for the proceedings of Clinton's impeachment trial, or oblivious
to the predictability of the verdict at the end. But they were
trying to satisfy a variety of concerns -- over evidence and
constitutional procedures -- that were more important than any
rapidly reached terminus.

<P>
WUHAN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province
doubled its 1997 foreign trade volume for technological products
to 520 million US dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
This dramatic growth has been attributed to Hubei's efforts to
shift its foreign trade focus to the American and European
markets. Statistics show that exports hit 450 million dollars,
with imports of well over 60 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Germany ranked as the province's leading export destination,

Exports to Greece and Sweden hit a record 100 million dollars
each.
</P>
<P>
Hubei is one of China's major industrial bases, with its
steel, automobile manufacturing and shipbuilding industries
enjoying strong development and extensive research capacities.
The province is extending great effort to tap the export
potential for ships, computer software, digital machine tools and
complete sets of equipment.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Province Sustains Export Growth Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 31 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province, the nation's major foreign trade powerhouse, recorded
sustained export growth momentum for 1998, with the figure rising
by a small margin of 1.5 percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
The year's export volume edged up to 75.7 billion US dollars
in spite of the 5.6 percent, or 41 billion dollar, shortfall in
exports to Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The growth was attributed to sustained increase in exports to
the European Union (EU). Exports to the EU have grown by an
average 16.2 percent annually over the past five years, with last
year's volume hitting 10 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong's general trade volume dropped 15 percent to 15.2
billion dollars. However, the volume to the EU grew 8.4 percent
to 1.8 billion dollars. The processing sector's exports to the
region rose by 14.6 percent to 8.1 billion dollars, a level some
eight percentage points higher than the general growth rate.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong exported commodities valued at over one billion
dollars each to Germany, Britain, the Netherlands and France. The
four countries also accounted for 78 percent of the total 7.7
billion dollars in exports to the EU.
</P>
<P>
The province will face greater challenges in terms of 1999
exports to the EU due largely to the dependence on the stability
of euro.

<HEADLINE> U.N., Taliban to Hold Talks on Security Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 31 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. mission will visit
Afghanistan in a couple of days for talks with Taliban officials
on security issues and conditions for the return of U.N. staff to
the country, the United Nations said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The visit will be a follow-up to the talks between senior
Taliban leaders and Erick De Mule, the Islamabad-based coordinator
for Afghanistan, in Kandahar on January 25, a U.N. weekly update
said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will discuss outstanding security issues and
conditions for the return of the U.N. international staff to the
war-shattered Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and foreign NGOs pulled their international
staff out of Kabul after an Italian U.N. employee was shot dead in
the Afghan capital by an angry demonstrator on August 21 last
year.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators were protesting against the U.S. Cruise
missile strikes on Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban and the United Nations signed a "security
agreement" in Islamabad on October 23, listing several conditions
for the return of international staff.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Taliban are required to provide full
protection to the U.N. staff and premises and investigate into the
killing of three U.N. officials in Kabul and the eastern Afghan
city of Jalalabad last year.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations insists that those responsible for the
murders be arrested and punished before it sends the
international staff back to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban say they have arrested two Pakistani nationals in
connection with the attack on the U.N. official in Kabul and the
suspects are being questioned in the Taliban's headquarters of
Kandahar. However they have pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking for explanation on what happened in August when
a staff member of the U.N. was killed in Kabul and two Afghan
nationals working with the U.N. were killed in Jalalabad," De Mule
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to have a better idea to what exactly the
Taliban authorities have done in terms of investigating these
cases," he said.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Rears Harvest, China Gets Angry at Judges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YONGPYONG, South Korea, January 31 (Xinhua) -- South Korea
spent a harvest day Sunday, the first medal-day of the Winter
Asiad when the host delegation took four of six golds, leaving
two other to Kazakhsan and defending champion China.
</P>
<P>
China won the women's 500 meters in the short track
speedskating competitions through Yang Yang (A) but got angry at
the judges'decision to disqualify its stars Wang Chunlu and Yang
Yang (S) for the event final.
</P>
<P>
The host won the first gold medal of the Games, which opened
Saturday, as well as three golds in the short-track speedskating.
</P>
<P>
Hur Seung-woo, silver medalist at the last Games in Garbin in
1996, gave South Korea the first gold in the morning by winning
the men's super giant slalom. The South Koreans almost swept the
medals with Japan's Kawaguchi Joji took the silver. two other
South Koreans Choi Moon-sung was third and fourth.
</P>
<P>
The host should have chance to take a 1-2-3 victory in the
S-G slalom if its defending champion Byon Jong-moon finished the
course. "It was sad for him," said Hur.
</P>
<P>
"I was unexpected to win the gold because the S-G is not my
hot events," Hur added.
</P>
<P>
The skiers from Kazakhstan proved their dominate in the cross
country skiing when they won all three medals in the men's 15
kilometers classic. Vladimir Smirnov took the gold while Pavel
Ryabinin, both gold medalist in Harbin, won the silver.
</P>
<P>
The indoor ice rink in Yongpyong was Sunday's focus for the
host and China.
</P>
<P>
The Yang's victory came much difficult than China thought
after the semi-finals when four Chinese skaters beat their South
Korean rivals with a 1-2 win in two groups respectively.
</P>
<P>
The results should mean the women's 500m final was all
Chinese-affair. Few minutes later, however, Wang Chunlu and
Yangyang (S) were announced disqualified without giving any
explain.
</P>
<P>
Soon the Chinese delegation put a written pretest but was
rejected.
</P>
<P>
"It's surprised for us to be disqualified," said Tong Lixin,
manager of the Chinese short-track speedskating team. "Our skater
didn't get in touch with anyone at all during the race. How could
we violate rules?"
</P>
<P>
The finals were delayed over 50 minutes because of China's
protests before Yang finally won.
</P>
<P>
"The gold was so difficult that we couldn't predict," said
Yang (A), who was silver medalist in the 1,500 meters earlier
Saturday. "My teammates didn't do any wrong thing. You can watch
the video that will tell you the truth."
</P>
<P>
Choi Min-kyung took the silver for the women's 500 meters and
the bronze medal went to Chinese Sun Dan.
</P>
<P>
South Korea swept two men's gold medals. Kim Dong-sung claimed
the 1,500m race with a new world record of two minutes 11.372
seconds.
</P>
<P>
Kim beat the old mark of 2:15.50 set by Feng Kai of China in
1997. Feng took the silver in 2:12.137, followed by Lee Jun-hwan
of South Korea in 2:12.287.
</P>
<P>
Lee Jun-hwan won the men's 500 meters, the host's third gold
on the ice Sunday. Feng Kai took his second silver for China,
followed by Japan's Terao Satoru.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Kim Yun-mi grabbed the first gold medal of the
short-track speedskating of the Games in the women's 500m in
2:28.637, while defending champion Yang Yang (A) and Yang Yang
(S) were second and third respectively.
</P>
<P>
China and South Korea split all 10 gold medals in Harbin. They
were expected to have more chance to win other six golds Monday
when the two-day short-track speedskating competition will
conclude.
</P>
<P>
In today's ice hockey competition, China beat Japan 6-1 to
pave its way for defending gold medal in the women's action while
defending champion Kazakhstan downed Mongolia 14-1 in the men's
tournament.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti leaders Sunday
held talks with visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for
Middle East Affairs Martin Indyk on the Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Emir Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah met with Indyk and his
accompanying delegation right after their arrival in the Gulf
emirate.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime Minister
Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Sabah also held talks with Indyk.
</P>
<P>
Although contents of the meetings were not officially
disclosed, earlier reports by the Kuwait News Agency said the
talks were scheduled to cover the developments in the region and
the U.S. efforts to contain the Iraqi regime on the political and
military levels so that it no longer poses any threat to the
region.
</P>
<P>
Indyk is now on a Gulf tour which has already taken him to
Bahrain and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Indyk held talks on Manama with Emir of
Bahrain Sheikh Isa Bin Sulman al-Khalifa and other high-level
officials on the situation in general and Iraq in particular, as
well as bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official told reporters before his departure from
Bahrain that he briefed the Bahraini emir on the U.S. policy
toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
That policy, he said, is based on three main elements --
underlining the international support to the United Nations
Security Council resolutions related to Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
in 1990-1991, increasing humanitarian support to the Iraqi people
and supporting the Iraqi people's aspiration.
</P>
<P>
Indyk is the second high-level U.S. official visiting Kuwait
since the U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen came to Kuwait during
Christmas, when he visited U.S. troops stationed here and held
talks with Kuwaiti leaders on possible results of the U.S.-led
military operation.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao
recently stressed that maintaining social stability in rural
areas is of great significance to China's reform, development and
overall stability.
</P>
<P>
Wen made the remarks during a January 28-31 fact-finding tour
of southwestern China's Sichuan Province. He called on local
government officials to place the highest priority on daily life
in rural areas and properly deal with any disputes arising in
related areas to ensure farmers enjoy a happy Spring Festival
which begins on February 16.
</P>
<P>
He urged all localities to extend land contracts for an
additional 30 years, and to distribute all contracts and
documents outlining operational rights to farmers.
</P>
<P>
Positive steps should be taken to remove contradictions which
could possibly threaten social stability in rural areas, said
Wen, adding that direct persuasion and education should be used
to solve problems.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Takes Three Golds, China Puts Protest on Judges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YONGPYONG, South Korea, January 31 (Xinhua) -- South Korea won
three of four gold medals in the short-track speedskating races
on Sunday, while China argued for their two stars' disqualified
for the women's 500-meter final at the Winter Asiad.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese skaters, who split the 10 gold medals at the last
Games in Harbin with South Korea, took only one gold through Yang
Yang (A) in the women's 500m race, but got angry for the judges'
decision.
</P>
<P>
The Yang's victory came much difficult than China thought
after the semi-final as four Chinese skaters beat South Korean
rivals to finish the line with a 1-2 position in two groups
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The results should mean the women's 500m final would be all
Chinese-affair. Few minutes later, however, Wang Chunlu and
Yangyang(S) were announced disqualified without giving any
explain.
</P>
<P>
Soon after that the Chinese delegation put a written pretest
to the Competition Committee, but was rejected.
</P>
<P>
"It's surprised for us to be disqualified," said Tong Lixin,
manager of the Chinese short-track speedskating team. "Our skater
didn't get in touch with any one at all during the whole
semi-final race. How could we violate rules?"
</P>
<P>
The finals were delayed over 50 minutes because of China's
protests before Yang finally won the gold for her country.
</P>
<P>
"The gold was so difficult that we couldn't predict," said
Yang(A), who was silver medalist in the 1,500 meters earlier
Saturday. "My teammates didn't do any wrong thing. You can watch
the video that will tell you the truth."
</P>
<P>
Choi Min-kyung took the silver for the women's 500 meters and
the bronze medal went to Chinese Sun Dan.
</P>
<P>
South Korea swept two men's gold medals. Kim Dong-sung claimed
the 1,500 race with a new world record of two minutes 11.372
seconds.
</P>
<P>
Kim beat the old mark of 2:15.50 set by Feng Kai of China in
1997. Feng took the silver in 2:12.137, followed by Lee Jun-hwan
of South Korea in 2:12.287.
</P>
<P>
Lee Jun-hwan won the host's third gold medal on the ice Sunday
when he firstly crossed the finish line. Feng Kai took his second
silver. Japan's Terao Satoru was third.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Kim Yun-mi grabbed the first gold medal of the
short-track speedskating competition at the Games, which opened
Saturday, in 2:28.637, while defending champion Yang Yang (A) and
Yang Yang (S) were second and third respectively.
</P>
<P>
The two-day short-track speed skating competition will decide
six other gold medals on Monday with South Korea and China have
more chances to win.

<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of National
People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, met this afternoon in
the Chinese capital with a Chilean delegation led by Gutenbery
Martinez, president of Chile's Chamber of Deputies.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that Chile was the first South American country to
forge diplomatic ties with China. The two countries have
witnessed the smooth growth of bilateral ties and frequent
high-level reciprocal visits in recent years, said Li, adding
that China places high value on friendly cooperative relations
with Chile and hopes to further the ties.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader briefed the delegation on China's
independent foreign policy of peace and the nation's views and
stance on multipolarization and economic globalization. Li said
China advocates that all countries, regardless of their size,
strength or wealth, are equal members of the international
community. "Every country should independently handle its own
affairs," said Li.
</P>
<P>
Li also briefed the delegation on China's system of people's
congress.
</P>
<P>
Martinez said his country and China share identical or similar
views on the international situation and major global issues.
Chile stresses the need to respect the choices made by people in
all nations, and the fact that all countries should observe
international laws, according to Martinez. He also expressed hope
that the two countries will further expand mutually beneficial
cooperation.

JERUSALEM, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Haim Ramon, a veteran
politician of Israeli Labor Party, announced on Sunday that he
decided to stay in the party, a move that will help Labor leader
Ehud Barak to win in the coming elections in May.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Tel Aviv, Ramon said that he will
remain in the party and compete in the primary elections which are
due to be held on February 15.
</P>
<P>
Ramon has been dissatisfied with the primaries' voting system
of the Labor party. Early reports said that he might defect to the
newly established centrist party.
</P>
<P>
But Ramon told reporters that his main goal was to block
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bid for reelection.
</P>
<P>
He said that if he left Labor, it would harm Barak and would
indirectly help Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel Radio reported on Sunday that David Levy,
leader of Gesher Party and former foreign minister, is
considering to join forces with Barak in the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
The election for prime minister is scheduled to be held on May
17. Netanyahu, Barak and the centrist party leader Yitzhak
Mordechai are the three powerful competitors for the post.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Orders Probe Into Appointment of Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 31 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela has ordered an investigation into the appointment
of a crooked lawyer, Ramesh Vassen, to the post of consul-general
to India, Sunday Times reported.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Mandela's spokesman, Parks Mankahlana, as
saying lately that the probe would begin as soon as Mandela
returned from his European tour.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the president had recently ratified
Vassen's appointment, acting on the recommendation of the
Department of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
"We assumed that (the Department of) Foreign Affairs had done
their homework," Mankahlana said.
</P>
<P>
Vassen was declared too dishonest to act as an attorney In May
1998 by South Africa's Appeal Court.
</P>
<P>
Douglas Gibson, the Democratic Party's justice spokesman, who
first exposed the scandal, said that the failure of the Foreign
Ministry to inform Mandela was either a cover-up of Vassen's
wrong-doing, or evidence of incompetence of the department.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign Affairs have seriously embarrassed the president. How
could they not know of Vassen's background when it was public
knowledge?" Gibson asked.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Times said it had learnt that Vassen, who at one stage
was a partner in a law firm with Justice Minister Dullah Omar,
personally approached Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad for a job
six months after investigation into his misappropriation of trust
funds began.
</P>
<P>
Vassen was appointed to the senior post of deputy director, and
then promoted to full director before he had even started work,
said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Vassen was found guilty of misuse and theft of trust moneys in
August 1996 by the Cape High Court. In the worst instance, the
court found Vassen had stolen 61,763.55 Rand (about 10,000 U.S.
Dollars at present value) from the deceased estate of a
working-class father.
</P>
<P>
Last May, Vassen appealed against his striking off, but his
appeal was turned down.
</P>
<P>
The paper said Vassen's appointment was the most recent of
similar cases involving disqualified lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Kwenza Mlaba, struck from the roll of lawyers in April 1998 in
connection with the theft of 800,000 Rand (133,000 Dollars) from a
paralyzed client, was offered a post in the Home Affairs
Department last November.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Rejects Taliban Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has declined to
accept as Afghanistan's consul general in Karachi a Taliban
official who was expelled last year by Saudi Arabia, sources said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Maulvi Shahuddin Dilawar, the former Afghan charge d'affaires
in Riyadh, was designated as consul general in the Afghan
consulate in the Pakistani port of Karachi, but Pakistan did not
accept the nomination, according to a report of the News Network
International.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Afghan Embassy here have also confirmed it,
saying Maulvi Dilawar has been given the new assignment in the
Afghan capital of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia withdrew its charge d'affaires from Kabul and
expelled the Taliban envoy from the kingdom in September last year
over the Taliban's decision to shelter Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
The ruling hard-line Taliban militia has rejected calls from
the United States and Saudi Arabia to expel the Saudi dissident,
saying Osama is a guest of the Afghan nation.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the expulsion from Saudi Arabia, Maulvi Dilawar was
designated as Afghanistan's ambassador to Pakistan, but was not
accepted by Islamabad, in a move to avoid embarrassment to Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban have not designated a new ambassador to Pakistan
for the last six months and Maulvi Saeed-ur-Rahman Haqqani has
been working as the charge d'affaires at the Afghan Embassy in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are the
only three countries that have recognized the Taliban, who control
over 80 percent of the territory of Afghanistan including its
capital, Kabul.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Quietly Marks Peaceful Liberation Anniversary (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Beijing, the Chinese capital,
celebrated the 50th anniversary of the city's peaceful liberation
today without festive flowers, slogans lining the streets or
throngs of people singing and dancing to mark the event.
</P>
<P>
However, an ongoing photo exhibition enables people to view
the mighty mounted troops marching through the city gate five
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
The peaceful liberation of Peking (Beijing) proved to be a
prelude for the founding of New China. Beijingers celebrated qu
ietly today but are nonetheless preparing for a major gala on
October 1 this year to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding
of the People's Republic of China (PRC).
</P>
<P>
The renovation project on Tian'anmen Square continued today
and the Forbidden City to the north stands in the same
magnificence as it did 700 years ago. New buildings, including
the Great Hall of the People and the Oriental Square financed by
a Hong Kong company are rising nearby.
</P>
<P>
The capital, the nation's political center, has demonstrated
vitality and prosperity throughout the 1990s, with worldwide new
stories carrying the Beijing dateline reaching the highest level
in history.
</P>
<P>
Today's Beijing-based newspapers carried some articles to mark
the anniversary of peaceful liberation, but most allocated more
space to news regarding a proposal to revise the Chinese
Constitution, the stability of the Chinese currency, outbound
tours and stock market trends.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Library, the world's fifth largest library, graces
the Baishiqiao area, a major defensive position for Kuomintang
troops a half century ago. Today, however, signs advertising
domestic and overseas computers are the most attractive sight in
the nearby area..
</P>
<P>
Local residents now shop in a mall built on sites which once
featured barracks housing former Kuomintang troops.
</P>
<P>
The younger generation is extremely proud of the dramatic
changes which have taken place in Beijing. "I'm not really sure
what happened back then," said a vocational school student from
Beijing's East District who was visiting the 15-day Peaceful
Liberation exhibition which opened on January 26.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition features more than 180 historic photos and
charts, as well as 85 documents and cultural relics, including
General Fu Zuoyi's letter to Marshal Ye Jianying and original
manuscripts penned by Mao Zedong.

<P>
Troops led the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Kuomintang
troops fought the four years of war following the end of World
War II, with the attacks on Beijing and Tianjin representing
important military campaigns in Chinese history. The People's
Liberation Army (PLA) led by the CPC eventually gained control
over Beijing, a city with abundant historical and cultural
relics, without firing a single shot.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Peking was preserved intact was a decisive
factor in its designation as the national capital for New China
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) has included a number of the capital's
historical sites on the World Cultural Heritage List.
</P>
<P>
The PLA entered the city gate at noon of January 31, 1949. Ma,
a teacher at the Capital University of Economy and Trade,
witnessed the arrival of the PLA and expressed his belief that
defending Kuomintang troops agreed to preserve the ancient
capital.
</P>
<P>
"They were Chinese and felt the past glory of history would be
rejuvenated when the war was over," said Ma.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has a history of over 3,000 years and served as the
nation's capital during six ancient dynasties. Italian
adventurer Marco Polo introduced the oriental city, the world's
largest city at the time, to the west in the 13th century.
</P>
<P>
A British mission arrived in Beijing in the 18th century and
found that the city was a citadel closed to international
exchanges. Beijing has featured a complex mix of the Orient and
the West for over two centuries, with the capital remaining as a
symbol of the long-standing weakness of old China until 1949.
</P>
<P>
The Eight-Power Allied Forces, aggressors from Britain, the
United States, Germany, France, Czarist Russia, Japan, Italy and
Austria, invaded China in 1900, and Japanese forces invaded the
country from 1937-1945.
</P>
<P>
Beijing resident Wang Chun, 81, recalled that the Beijingers
ground apricot kernels for edible oil and stood along the road to
give jars of the oil to PLA soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"China is an extraordinary country and will become even
stronger in the future," a professor at Yanjing University (the
present-day Beijing Univbersity) told visiting guests on the eve
of peaceful liberation of Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Taliban to Meet its Demands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Sunday urged the Afghan
Taliban militia to meet its demands after Taliban leaders voiced
their readiness to talk with Iran over the existing
misunderstanding and differences between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said that
before any other developments, it is a necessary prerequisite for
the Taliban to meet Iran's demands.
</P>
<P>
He cited identification, arrest and punishment of those
responsible for the murder of Iranian diplomats and journalists
in northern Afghanistan as one of Iran's demands.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban forces stormed Iran's consulate in Mazari Sharif
and killed eight Iranian diplomats and one reporter there on
August 8 last year when they conquered the stronghold of the
opposition the Northern Alliance headed by Afghan President
Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Taliban returned the bodies of the killed Iranians and
released 51 Iranians captured in Afghanistan as a goodwill
gesture to Iran after Tehran mounted over 200,000 troops on its
eastern border with Afghnistan.
</P>
<P>
Taliban said on Wednesday that it is seeking to improve ties
with Tehran and is ready to negotiate with Iranian officials over
outstanding disputes.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that the Taliban should voice its readiness to meet
Iran's requirement if it is interested in improving ties with
Iran.
</P>
<P>
There will be no obstacles from the Iranian side in this
regard, he said, adding that Iranian officials will convey Iran's
demands and expectations to the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Ebrahim Taherian, head of the special committee for
Afghan affairs at the Iranian Foreign Ministry, told the Iranian
daily Tehran Times that Iran would maintain its troops deployed on
its eastern border until peace and stability is fully restored in
Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Opposition Leader to Run for Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The opposition National
Chairman of the Tanzania's People's Party (TPP), Dr. Aleck
Humphrey Che-Mponda, has announced that he will run for the 2005
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Che-Mponda, who lost the 1995 presidential elections, told
Sunday Observer that he is ready to rise to the challenge in 2005,
when President Benjamin Mkapa will complete his tenure if
re-elected again in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on people's allegations that TPP was dubbed as
"CCM-B" as it has always danced to the tune of the ruling party
CCM (Chama Cha Mapinduzi - - Revolutionary Party of Tanzania), the
national chairman said it is not true.
</P>
<P>
Che-Mponda defended that his party is branded as CCM-B because
he has always played the balancing role in coordinating
relationship between the opposition and the ruling party, thus
sustaining the reigning harmony, peace and tranquility in
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
He said TPP's ideological policy is very different from that of
the CCM and other political parties, claiming that he treated all
political parties as comrades rather than enemies.
</P>
<P>
The opposition party leader also said he does not follow
Marxism and the socialist orientation.
</P>
<P>
Che-Mponda entered the Howard University of the United States
in 1959, studying electrical engineering. He later changed to
political science and won a doctorate degree in philosophy. After
that, he served as assistant professor at the University of Notre
Dame of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
During 1976 and 1992, Che-Mponda was a senior lecturer at the
University of Dar es Salaam where he taught public international
law, politics, public administration and international relations
courses.
</P>
<P>
Che-Mponda said the reason for his withdrawal from the 1995
presidential elections was simple: he was not able to pay one
million Shillings (about 1, 600 U.S. Dollars) of deposit money to
the electoral commission.
</P>
<P>
He was also unlucky in the following years -- ran and lost as
candidate for the parliamentary seat in Kinodoni constituency in
Dar es Salaam in 1995, ran and lost again in the 1996 Temeke
parliamentary by-election.
</P>
<P>
Last week, he revealed that he has gathered enough strength to
the extent that he wants to stand as a candidate for the 2005
presidential elections representing his party.
</P>
<P>
He said," I have learnt a lot and if it is politics, I have now
 graduated. I can play my cards well."

<HEADLINE> Uganda Imports Anti-Tank, Aircraft Missiles via </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has imported a
large military consignment including anti-tank and anti-aircraft
missiles via the Dar es Salaam Harbor, The Sunday Observer said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The English newspaper quoted sources as saying that the
shipment includes six pieces of armored tanks, 5,000 anti-tank
missiles, 5,000 anti- aircraft missiles, 5,000 automatic machine
guns, 1,000 grenade launchers, 2,000 boxes of ammunition and 1,000
pairs of combat boats.
</P>
<P>
This is the third reported importation of weapons by Uganda via
 Tanzanian harbors since last November.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the military hardware arrived aboard MV
KOMALSAN from North Korea at the Dar es Salaam Port on January 14
and is reported to have been transported by the central railway to
Mwanza en route to Port Bell in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a letter from the High Commission of Uganda in
Dar es Salaam to the Tanzanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
International Cooperation dated January 11 as saying that Uganda
requested Tanzania to help clear and ensure the safety of the
cargo and to provide escort.
</P>
<P>
"The High Commission of the Republic of Uganda has the honor to
request for the ministry's assistance in prompt clearance and
escort of its military consignment. The consignment will be
carried through the Central line," the letter stated.
</P>
<P>
The first consignment of 90 tanks imported from Ukraine arrived
at Dar es Salaam Port by the end of last November and the second
consignment of about 80 tons of Portable Missile Mortars imported
from Ukraine or Russia arrived at Tanga Port in late December.
</P>
<P>
The sources were quoted as saying that Rwanda could have been
the real beneficiary of the weapons.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda have been allied in supporting the rebels in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) against President Laurent
Kabila soon after the war broke out early last August.
</P>
<P>
Claiming to be neutral in the DRC conflict, Tanzania recalled
its military advisors from the DRC almost immediately after the
conflict broke out while other neighboring countries rushed their
troops to either side of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The war has so far already drawn in Angola, Namibia, Chad and
Zimbabwe on Kabila's side while the Tutsi-led rebels are allegedly
backed by Rwanda and Uganda.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Gives Final Approval for Nigeria '99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Federation of International
Football Associations (FIFA) has given Nigeria the final approval
to host the 10th World Youth Soccer Championship (WYC) tagged
Nigeria '99.
</P>
<P>
The Nigeria Football Association (NFA) secretariat said
Saturday that the football house had received a letter from the
world football governing body for the final approval, Post
Express Sunday quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
A document on the championship's rules and regulations were
also enveloped with the letter, which was signed by FIFA's Acting
secretary-general Michel Zen-Ruffinen.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday, NFA secretary-general Alhaji Sani Toro
promised to some of the association's key officials that "Nigeria
'99 is real. FIFA has given us the final approval". The letter
came in consequence.
</P>
<P>
At the local Organizing Committee Secretariat in Abuja, it was
learnt that many of the countries, which qualified for the
championship, have sent in their national flags and national
anthems to the tournament, which is scheduled to kick off on
April 3.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a high-ranked team of FIFA officials arrived in
Nigeria Saturday to start a final week-long inspection of
facilities for Nigeria '99.
</P>
<P>
Another FIFA team is already in the West African country
inspecting the hotels due to host teams and officials.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Nigeria was refused the right to stage the event for
medical and security reasons at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
About 18 countries are so far certain to contend Nigeria '99
with defending champion Germany leading the pack of qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, who is automatically qualified as the host, would be
joined by two other African countries, who are to emerge from the
African Youth Championship billed to be held from February 21 to
March 3 in Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Oceanea is to be represented by Australia while four Asian
representatives are South Korea, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Other teams include Spain, Croatia, England, Ireland and
Portugal from Europe and Brazil, Argentina, the United States,
Costa-Rica, Honduras and Mexico from North and South Americas.

<P>
LAGOS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African Unity
(OAU) election monitoring team is due in Nigeria next week for the
February 27 presidential election in the country, according to a
New Nigeria paper report Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted OAU Assistant Secretary General for
political affairs, Ambassador Daniel Antonio, as saying in capital
Abuja Saturday that all African countries would send
representatives to the OAU monitoring team.
</P>
<P>
Antonio is in Nigeria to assess the level of preparedness for
the election by the Independent National Electoral Commission
(INEC) of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to the INEC headquarters in Abuja, he said the
OAU saw the February 27 presidential election as very important
and would assist to ensure that it is successful.
</P>
<P>
In response, INEC Chairman Justice Ephraim Akpata said that the
doors of the commission were open to fellow Africans who were
desirous of scrutinizing its activities.

<HEADLINE> Teenagers Get Life For Torture-murder in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong, 31 January (Xinhua) -- Six Hong Kong teenagers woke
up to years behind bars here Saturday after a judge jailed them
for the "brutal and inhumane" killing of a schoolboy.
</P>
<P>
Four of the six teenagers were jailed for life and the rest
received terms of more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Justice Michael Wong Kinchow urged parents, authorities and
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government to
curb an undercurrent of youth violence which led to the killing
of 15-year-old Luk Chiwai.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very tragic case, tragic that an innocent young boy
lost his life and tragic that a number of young men are going to
lose their liberty for a long, long time, " said Justice Wong.
</P>
<P>
Wong also delivered a strong sideswipe at neglectful parents
and publishers of violent material aimed at young people.
</P>
<P>
In the gang murder on May 14, 1997, 14 teenagers including
three girls, aged 14-18 at the time, were found guilty.
</P>
<P>
Convicted murderers Fu Hinchun, Hui Chiwai, Ng Mingchun, and
Chan Takming will serve their lives in jail.
</P>
<P>
Mak Kaho will serve 26 years for murder and Wong Kampo, who
was aged 14 at the time will serve 23 years for murder. Shek
Szekin was sentenced to seven years.

<HEADLINE> Tallbott to Discuss Non-Proliferation With Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Tallbott arrives here Monday to continue his talks
with Pakistani officials on security and non-proliferation issues.
</P>
<P>
Tallbott's visit is the first by a senior U.S. official to
Pakistan after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's visit to the United
States in December last year.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and the United States had made notable progress in the
previous seven rounds of talks toward the objective of security
and non-proliferation in the region, the Associated Press of
Pakistan quoted government officials as saying Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Islamabad and Washington, they said, have convergent approaches
on a number of issues like the Comprehensive Test Treaty (CTBT),
nuclear exports controls and the need for mutual strategic
restraint by Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan maintains a positive attitude toward international
non-proliferation concerns, "while safeguarding its vital national
interests and the need to maintain credible nuclear deterrence
against Indian aggression or blackmail," the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They quoted Prime Minister Sharif as saying at the U.N. General
Assembly in September last year that Pakistan was ready to adhere
to CTBT "in an atmosphere free of coercion."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is staunchly opposed to the export of fissile material
and nuclear technology to third countries, the officials said,
adding, "We are in the process of enacting a law providing for a
fool-proof control on exports of sensitive technology."
</P>
<P>
They also referred to India's negative approach that hampers
the realization of the objectives of security and
non-proliferation to which both Pakistan and the United States
have subscribed.
</P>
<P>
"India's position on the CTBT remains ambiguous at best," the
officials said, adding that New Delhi has openly rejected
non-weaponization and non-deployment of its nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Tallbott, who is currently visiting New Delhi, has been told by
Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh in clear terms that the
Indian government would continue its nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani officials said the Kashmir issue will also figure
prominently at the forthcoming talks with the U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
"Kashmir is the main source of tension and instability in the
region as well as a key to the realization of stable peace and
security in the nuclear South Asia," they said.
</P>
<P>
Islamabad hopes that the United States will commit itself to
more active and effective efforts to promote a solution for the
Kashmir dispute during the upcoming talks.

KATHMANDU, January 31 (Xinhua) -- A six-day leprosy elimination
campaign, the second in Nepal, was launched Sunday in 27 of the
country's 75 districts on the occasion of the 46th World Leprosy
Day.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, some 14,000 health workers and volunteers
are mobilized to identify leprosy patients and provide them with
free medication.
</P>
<P>
The Himalayan kingdom aims to lower the number of leprosy cases
from the present four in every 10,000 people to just one by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Health Organization, the elimination of
leprosy as a public health problem means reducing the prevalence
rate to below one case per 10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
A total of 55,666 patients had been cured in Nepal thanks to
the multi-drug therapy and about 14,440 others are undergoing
treatment, the Nepali press said.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Banks Urged to Consider Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Islamic banks are urged to
consider mergers to compete with powerful rivals, the Gulf News
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Islamic banks need to take note of the implications of recent
mergers between major banks, said Shamshad Nabi, the Jeddah-based
Islamic Development Bank's Deputy Director of the Trade, Finance
and Promotion Department in Dubai on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of a three-day meeting of
Islamic banks' directors of operations and investment, the
official said that the mergers resulted in the emergence of mega
organizations offering a comprehensive range of financial services
under one roof.
</P>
<P>
Islamic banks should not ignore this trend of merging for
their current and future growth, especially since the number of
such banks has increased to 200 spreading across all continents,
said Mohammed Ali Bin Zayed, head of the Dubai Islamic Bank's
executive committee at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The global variation in efficiency of economic systems, flow of
liquidity, feasibility of investments, poverty, inflation and
non-employment rates and local, regional and international
competiveness place heavy responsibility on Islamic banks and
operations and investment directors, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
They should diversify investment processes and develop banking
operations in order to ensure their success and bypass economic
crisis and market fluctuations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Given the present size of Islamic banks, he said, they are ill
equipped to offer a similar range of comprehensive financial
services as the normal banks.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, serious focus of attention and efforts
might be necessary toward the creation of larger entities through
mergers, which will help them to compete with the major banking
and financial institutions at home and abroad.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Keep Troops on Afghanistan Border: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Iranian armed forces deployed
on its eastern border with Afghanistan will remain until the
restoration of peace and security in Afghanistan, local daily
Tehran Times Sunday quoted an Iranian official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Ebrahim Taherian, head of the special committee for
Afghan affairs at the Iranian Foreign Ministry, made the
statement in a response to the recent remarks by Pakistani Foreign
Minister Sartaj Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said at the Pakistan Senate recently that Iran should
withdraw its forces from its eastern border with Afghanistan,
since the Taliban have made positive moves to meet Iran's demands.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban returned the bodies of eight Iranian diplomats and
a reporter killed by the Taliban forces last August in northern
Afghanistan after Iran deployed over 200,000 troops on its
eastern border.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban also released 51 Iranians arrested for allegedly
sending arms to the Taliban's opposition groups. However, Iran
said that the Iranians were truck drivers who transferred
commercial goods to the Central Asian states.
</P>
<P>
Talking to Tehran Times, Taherian reiterated that the Taliban
should meet Iran's demand on identification, arrest and punishment
of the agents involved in the killing of the Iranian diplomats and
reporter.
</P>
<P>
Iran will withdraw its forces if peace and stability is fully
restored in Afghanistan, he said, adding that Iran's policy on the
Afghan issue is based on finding a solution to the issue in order
to realize peace and stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the Taliban repeatedly announced their
readiness to talk with Iran to solve their difference, but Iran
insisted that the Taliban must meet its demands before holding any
talks.

<HEADLINE> UK Undertakes to Help Liaoning Transform State Loss-Making Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The fourth mission of the
British Agency of International Development has visited northeast
China's Liaoning Province to acquaint its members with a
state-owned retooling program Liaoning and British organization
will cooperate on.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the cooperation program is aimed
at introducing successful methods Britain used to transform its
state industries in 1960s and 1970s to Liaoning, which is facing
a heavy task of retooling its state-owned enterprises (SOE) and
turn quite a number of these money-losing firms into
profit-making ones.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced during an official
visit to China last October that Britain had decided to support
China's upgrading of state-owned enterprises by making piloting
efforts in Liaoning and Sichuan provinces.
</P>
<P>
The British Agency of International Development, which falls
under jurisdiction of the British Treasury, has earmarked 10
million British pounds to cover fact-finding tours to China and
related costs.
</P>
<P>
In all, the British agency has dispatched four fact-finding
missions to Liaoning where their mission members visited related
government departments and research institutions dealing with the
upgrading of SOE and looked into the related work on subjects
ranging from arrangements of laid-off workers to the
establishment of social security network. Members on the fourth
mission mainly conducted surveys in state-owned enterprises in
the provincial capital of Shenyang.
</P>
<P>
The British agency has also expressed its readiness to invite
some international financial organizations to help Liaoning with
its reform of SOE. A number of financial agencies have had
contacts with this province.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation program will spread to two more open coastal
cities of Liaoning if the first-phase cooperation is successful,
according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Province, an old industrial base built under the
planned economy, boasted one tenth of China's large and
medium-sized state-owned enterprises.

security forces have seized more than three tonnes of narcotics in
eastern and southeastern regions of the country. haunted by drug
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
This confiscation included 3,043 kilograms of opium, 476
kilograms of hashish, 50 kilograms of morphine and 50 kilograms of
heroin, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The drugs and some fire arms were seized from smugglers in the
southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan and the southern Fars
province.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not mention when the drugs were
confiscated.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Fallah, the secretary of the anti-drug headquarters,
said in Vienna on Tuesday that Iran hauled 25 tonnes of heroin and
morphine and 150 tonnes of opium in the first 11 months of 1998.

January 1989, under which any one caught with 30 grams of heroin
or five kilograms of opium faces the death penalty.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Repeated with correction CPC Solicits Opinions of Non-Party Personages on Constitution Amendment (6) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We will further establish the authority of the constitution
within the bounds of society and set up a powerful supervisory
system under which the effective implementation of the
constitution is guaranteed," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
"What is most important is that the power of government organs
are regulated and limited in accordance with law so as to ensure
state power is practiced strictly in line with the constitution,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang confirmed that abuse of power by any government organ or
staff member is forbidden.
</P>
<P>
"Violating any part of the constitution is the most serious of
illegal acts," Jiang said, adding that any such behavior will be
thoroughly investigated and brought to justice. He pledged to
take more effective measures to enforce the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called for frequent monitoring to ensure the
constitution was being adhered to at all levels and for those
relevant authorities to take action to correct any violations
against it.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen and improve the Party's leadership over the work
is the key to safeguarding the sanctity of the constitution.
</P>
<P>
"The CPC, which has been at the forefront of drawing up and
implementing the constitution, is actually held in check by the
constitution itself," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
"The Party has no special interests of its own and will not
allow any of its members to enjoy special rights," Jiang
stressed. The CPC and its members must act as models in abiding
by the constitution and all other laws.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the 1993 amendment added to the constitutional
system of multi-party cooperation and consultation under the CPC
leadership will continue to be an essential part of it and can
also be developed over a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, he stressed, the basis of multi-party cooperation and
the political consultation system is the major legal framework of
China and is essentially what is known as the constitution. All
non-Communist parties and organizations have important duties to
safeguard the sanctity of the constitution and its enforcement.
They also have an essential supervisory function over the
enforcement of the constitution and all other laws.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his hope that all non-Communist parties will
make more efforts to cooperate under the principles of long-term
co-existence, mutual supervision, treating each other with all
sincerity and most importantly sharing weal or woe whilst
standing shoulder to shoulder, firm against any foe.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged the non-Communist parties to make new
contributions to building China into a socialist country ruled by
law and its socialist modernization drive.

<HEADLINE> Kafelnikov Beats Erratic Enqvist to Win Australian Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Tenth seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov
of Russia won the Australian Open men's singles title in
Melbourne on Sunday, coming from one set down to beat unseeded
Thomas Enqvist of Sweden 4-6, 6-0, 6-3, 7-6 (7-1) in a
two-hour-26 minute marathon.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 French Open champion jumped to No.3 in the ATP world
rankings with his win, replacing Australian Pat Rafter.
</P>
<P>
Enqvist, who had been in a devastating form which saw him
unbeaten in his last 14 matches and clinching the Australian
Hardcourt Championships and Kooyong Classic titles, failed to
produce the kind of tennis that eliminated top Australians Pat
Rafter and Mark Philippoussis to reach his first Grand Slam final
in 21 attempts.
</P>
<P>
The Sweden broke Kafelnikov in the fifth game for the 6-4
first set victory in 33 minutes but everything went wrong for him
since then.
</P>
<P>
An erratic performance saw the Swede losing nine games in a
row as Kafelnikov broke him in the second, fourth and sixth games
of the second set which the Russian stormed back 6-0.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov took full advantage of Enqvist who had lost all
rhythm and whose forehand went to pieces to seal the third set in
45 minutes to go 2-1 up.
</P>
<P>
The first 12 games of the fourth set went with service, with
Kafelnikov deftly handling Enqvist's groundstrokes with some deep
sliced backhands which drew errors from Enqvist's forehand.
</P>
<P>
Kafelinkov made it 5-5 through Enqvist's unforced forehand
error but the Swede's two aces put him ahead at 6-5 before
Kafelnikov holding serve to send the match into a crucial
tie-break which he took 7-1 for an emphatic victory.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov after the match thanked world No 1 Pete Sampras for
opting out of the first Grand Slam of the year and said he was
happy to win the last Australian Open of this century.

<HEADLINE> Manila Requires Polluting Firms to Plant Trees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Polluting factories in Manila
will soon be required to plant fruit-bearing trees in open spaces
in lieu of paying anti-pollution fines, government officials said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Under an innovative government environment plan, the penalty
for polluting firms will have to plant three-to-five-year-old
fruit-bearing trees in the metropolis, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The plan is aimed at re-greening Metro Manila with mature
trees, they said.
</P>
<P>
Using mature trees, which have far greater chances of survival,
is better than the traditional practice of planting
two-to-three-month-old seedlings, they said.
</P>
<P>
Government agencies have come up with projects or measures in
line with President Joseph Estrada's earlier vow to stop
environmental onslaught, they said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has signed a memorandum order last week, directing
local governments to implement an action program on the
environment protection.
</P>
<P>
He said his administration is strengthening mechanism to
preserve the country's biological diversity and marine and forest
resources.

<HEADLINE> Hunan Becomes Major Foreign Investment Destination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Contracted foreign
investments in central-south China's Hunan Province grew by
nearly 30 percent in 1998 to 1.9 billion US dollars in spite of
delayed funding allocations for a number of projects.
</P>
<P>
Hunan led other areas in central and western regions in terms
of contracted foreign investments during the period.
</P>
<P>
The influx in funding has been attributed to the efforts the
province made to develop foreign financing sources in the
America, Europe, Australia and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Investment contracts with the North American and European
businessmen accounted for 41 percent of the province's total
contracted investment and 29 percent of allocated investments.
</P>
<P>
The province attracted foreign investment for a number of
high-tech projects in wide-ranging areas, including the aviation,
automobile manufacturing and chemical sectors.
</P>
<P>
Countries in southeast Asia previously accounted to 80 percent
of Hunan's total foreign investment volume, according to Ge
Jianmin, an official in charge of foreign investment in Hunan.
However, he noted that financial turmoil in the region has led to
the disappearance of many investment channels.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the crisis delayed investments in a number of
projects during the year. For example, a pledged foreign
investment of 700 million US dollars BOT (build, operate,
transfer) power plant failed to materialize. The province ended
the year with direct funding of 970 million US dollars in direct
funding.
</P>
<P>
Foreign financing has played an increasingly vital role in
promoting local economic growth in recent years, and the local
government has encouraged profitable domestic companies to expand
fund-raising efforts abroad.
</P>
<P>
A seminar held earlier this month to discuss the feasibility
of various local companies financing securities abroad attracted
financial regulatory officials from China's interior area and
Hong Kong, as well as consultants from U.S.-based NASDAQ, Amex
and Prudential Securities.

MANILA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- At least 14 people were hurt
when a gang of robbers exploded a grenade as they escaped after
pouncing on a jewelry store here Sunday afternoon, broadcast

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Checks Rural-to-Urban Migration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The agriculture-led
industrial development strategy adopted by the Ethiopian
government has helped to check the rural-to-urban migration in the
last few years, a senior Ethiopian official said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the Association of Geography
Professionals of Ethiopia here Saturday, Ethiopian Vice-Minister
of Education Tekle-Haimanot Haile-Selasie said that the migration
to the urban areas was arrested because the farmers have now
become owners of agricultural land.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Herald newspaper Sunday quoted the vice-minister
as saying that the previous economic policy was the root cause for
the large- scale migration to the urban areas.
</P>
<P>
He called on the association to thoroughly examine the matter
and play a decisive role in tackling the problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Nigussie Teferra, Head of the
National Office of Population, noted that migration to the urban
areas is usually caused by the absence of basic socio-economic
development infrastructure in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
He said that the population-related policies issued in the last
seven years on the basis of the country's decentralization policy
have helped to check the tide of rural-to-urban migration and
contributed to efforts to transforming the life of farmers.
</P>
<P>
Bekure Wolde-Semaiat, President of the Association of Geography
 Professionals of Ethiopia, also said at the meeting that the
subject of migration deserves to be given special consideration in
the country's socio- economic development policy.

<HEADLINE> Gansu Cooperates Cordially with European Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, January 31 (Xinhua) -- European investors are
becoming more active in Gansu, an economically less-advantaged
inland province in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Gansu's import and export trade with Europe has exceeded the
60 million U.S. dollar mark annually in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The province is adding incentives for foreign investors by
developing into a major trade center in northwestern China, where
the number of consumers are expected to reach 80 million.
</P>
<P>
Gansu has more than 20 joint ventures with Germany, France,
Italy, and Austria, with a combined contractual investment of
more than 70 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has vowed to implement greater
preferential policies to attract more overseas investment,
including European investment, in comprehensive agricultural
development, the renovation of State-owned enterprises,
construction of the largest petrochemical base in northwest
China, and financial institutions, according to officials.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Pledges to Ease Capital Controls to Woo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is working
towards making it easier for foreign capital to enter the country
for investment purposes.
</P>
<P>
The authorities are examining the introduction of an exit tax
for foreign investors wanting to take out their investments in
Malaysian equities during the one-year moratorium on repatriation
of funds from equity investments, Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Saturday in Davos, Switzerland, where he is
attending a World Economic Forum meeting, the Malaysian national
news agency Bernama reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The moratorium was imposed on September 1 last year as part of
the selective exchange control measures to curb excessive
speculation on the stock market and ringgit (local currency).
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said his coming to the World Economic Forum in Davos
enabled him to explain to people like fund managers, top
businessmen and government leaders who did not understand
Malaysia's exchange control measures and now they better
appreciated Malaysia's stance, less critical.
</P>
<P>
According to Bernama, Mahathir said in an interview with the
Malaysian media later that he felt vindicated now that more people
understood his views on the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
More people are beginning to accept the view that there should
be curbs on currency trading, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir wanted a better regulated international financial
system which would allow people all over the world and not just a
few countries to prosper.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir was of the view that an single currency in Asia was a
good idea, but he said "the time has not yet come and it would
take some time before we come to that," according to Bernama.

<HEADLINE> Canada Supports NATO Final Warning to Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Canada Saturday announced that
it had joined other NATO allies in issuing a final warning to the
Yugoslav government and the leadership of ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In making the announcement, Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy welcomed the January 29 statement by the president of
the United Nations Security Council, which supports the peace
process for Kosovo and demands full compliance by the opposing
parties.
</P>
<P>
NATO's decision reinforces the demands of the international
community that the parties in Kosovo fully respect the provisions
of U.N. Security Council resolutions 1160, 1199 and 1203.
</P>
<P>
"NATO is acting to secure a settlement that will prevent a
further humanitarian disaster in Kosovo," said Axworthy in a
press release issued here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The parties must recognize the urgency of the situation and
face consequences for continued violations of the obligations
imposed by the U.N. Security Council last October," the foreign
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Canada has six CF-18 aircraft in the region, committed to NATO
operations.
</P>
<P>
"While we continue to hope for a negotiated settlement, our
task force in Italy is fully prepared to take part in NATO air
operations if required," said Canadian National Defense Minister
Art Eggleton in the press release.
</P>
<P>
The two Canadian ministers strongly underlined the Yugoslav
government's responsibility for the safety of over 1,000
verifiers deployed in Kosovo under the auspices of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
They also stated that those responsible for the massacres at
Racak and Rogovo must be brought to justice, and that the
Yugoslav authorities must cooperate fully with the International
Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Invests Heavily in Fixed Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 31 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province invested 259.4 billion yuan in fixed assets last year,
up 12.9 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
This greatly increased domestic demand and hastened the growth
of Guangdong's economy, authorities noted.
</P>
<P>
In the latter half of 1998, Guangdong poured huge investments
into water control projects, transportation, environmental
protection, high-tech industries, and urban infrastructure in
large and medium-sized cities, as part of the national effort to
accelerate the construction of basic facilities.
</P>
<P>
Investment in fixed assets had risen by a wide margin in early
1990s, but the momentum stopped a few years later.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, however, the province earmarked investments of 22.3
billion yuan for 30 key projects, including a reservoir in
Yangjiang and a subway line in the city of Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Expressways and railways in the province increased by 495.1
kilometers and 51.2 kilometers, respectively, last year,
authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Prepared to Face Defamation Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad has said he is prepared to face the defamation
suit brought against him by his former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
"If it is within the law to sue me, then he (Anwar) can sue me.
I am ready to face the action against me," he said Saturday at a
news conference in Davos where he is attending a World Economic
Forum meeting, according to the Malaysian national news agency
Bernama Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said he would also be available as a witness in the
court case involving Anwar "if it is within their (the lawyers)
right to question me."
</P>
<P>
Anwar filed a 100-million-ringgit (about 26.315 million U.S.
dollar) defamation suit against Mahathir on January 25 and his
lawyers expressed their intention Saturday to call Mahathir as a
defense witness in Anwar's ongoing trial on four charges of
corrupt practice.
</P>
<P>
The Kuala Lumpur High Court called for Anwar's defense on the
four charges Saturday after ruling that the prosecution had made
out a prima case against him.
</P>
<P>
The defense will start on February 8.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who was dismissed as the deputy prime minister and
finance minister on September 2 last year, is on trial on the four
corruption charges since November 2.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations in support of Anwar, which quenched for about
two months, returned to the streets as several hundreds of Anwar's
supporters gathered at several areas, shouting slogans. However,
no incident occurred.

<HEADLINE> UK Scientist Not to Object to Having Daughter Cloned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Richard Dawkins, one of
Britain's most controversial scientists, has said that he would
not necessarily object to having his own daughter cloned.
</P>
<P>
Dawkins, a professor from Oxford University and author of
several bestsellers on genetics, said cloning was really no
different from the natural way of the creation of an identical
twin.
</P>
<P>
"If I have somebody that I love, and if there was some
particularly good reason to have an identical twin, that's all it
is. There's nothing new about it," said Dawkins when asked by a
BBC World Service program if he would be prepared to have his
daughter cloned.
</P>
<P>
Although he admitted that the first child to be cloned "would
be a very unusual individual and might be laughed at in school,"
Dawkins said these were "not major problems."
</P>
<P>
He told the radio program Agenda, to be broadcast Sunday, that
he would be "delighted" if he could have a cherished pet cloned.
</P>
<P>
"The only really deep reason people have for objecting to such
a thing is that it offends some deep-seated sense," he said,
suggesting that human cloning could help childless couples.

CHANGCHUN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese doctors recently
completed the successful reconstruction of a mammary gland for a
middle-aged woman by removing the cancerous left breast and
implanting skin tissue from the patient's abdomen..
</P>
<P>
Chief Surgeon Cui Jianhua, an associate professor in the
Thoracic Surgery Department at the Third Hospital, noted the
similar structure between abdominal skin tissue and a woman's
breasts.
</P>
<P>
Surgeons completed the operation, the first of its kind in
China, in eight hours. Cui said that the nipple on the left
breast will be reconstructed at a later date.
</P>
<P>
Gai Lijun, 44, a resident of Baishan city in northeast China's
Jilin province healed rapidly and recently discharged from the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
The widely used method for treating breast cancer in China
centers on removing the cancerous breast and introducing

</P>
<P>
The successful operation completed by Gai and his team will be
highly significant for treating patients suffering from the early
stages of breast cancer and for undertaking plastic surgery,

DALIAN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Police in Dalian, a coastal
city in north China's Liaoning Province, has arrested members of
a ring illegally trying to sell a panda pelt.
</P>
<P>
The police on Wednesday caught the smugglers red-handed in a
local hotel, where one jobless young suspect named Feng was
selling the panda pelt for 200,000 yuan (about 24,000 U.S.

<P>
Feng told the police that "he bought the pelt from another
person, who skinned the panda after it died of disease in the
1950s".
</P>
<P>
But experts with the local zoo estimated that the panda had
been shot and killed in the 1970s. The seized pelt is 1.6 meters
long and nearly one meter wide, with two bullet holes visible on
the back.

<P>
Chinese law bans the poaching of animals under state

<HEADLINE> Poland's Economic Growth Down in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Poland's gross domestic product
(GDP) grew by 4.8 percent in 1998, failing to reach its budgeted
target of 5.6 percent and down two percentage points from a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Polish newspaper Law and Economy reported Saturday that
the Central Bureau of Statistics attributed the economic slowdown
to the downsliding growth of added value in the industrial and
building sectors.
</P>
<P>
Industrial added value rose by 4.2 percent in 1998, against
the 10.3-percent growth in 1997, while the added value for the
building industry saw a 10.3 percent growth in 1998, down from
13.6 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The economic slowdown was also attributed to a downward growth
of domestic demand, which recorded 6.7 percent in 1998, lower
than the 9.3 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown has led to deteriorating employment and falling
living standards for the residents.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment started to rise last September, hitting 10.4
percent by the end of the year, up 0.1 percent from the same
period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
People's income grew but by a margin much smaller than
previous years. Meanwhile, gaps in income also widened, with
farmers' living standards obviously down.
</P>
<P>
A bumper harvest last year brought a 6.6-percent increase in
the supply of agricultural products over the previous year,
exceeding market demand. The oversupply, coupled with the
frustrated agricultural exports due to the Russian economic
crisis, resulted in a sharp drop in the prices of agricultural
products as well as in farmers' income.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Poland also witnessed a 25 percent drop in exports
to Russia, which expanded the country's trade deficits.
Statistics showed that trade deficits in the first 11 months
totaled 19.4 billion U.S. dollars. The figure for the whole year
was estimated at 22 billion dollars, in contrast with 14.8
billion dollars for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released Friday by the Polish Government Strategy
Research Center showed Poland had a foreign exchange reserve of
27.4 billion U.S. dollars by the end of last year.

<P>
NEW DELHI, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Initial gains were wiped out
and equities moved downwards on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE)
during the week.
</P>
<P>
The sensitive index on the stock market fluctuated in a wide
range of 3,400.07 and 3,246.03 points before ending the week at
3,315.57 points as against last week's close of 3,297.86 points,
netting a marginal gain of 17.71 points.
</P>
<P>
The national index also gained 3.18 points to close the week at
1,461.52 points from the previous weekend close of 1,458.34
points. The BSE-200 and U.S. dollar index were quoted fractionally
up at the weekend at 338.05 and 132.43 points compared with last
weekend's close of 337.37 and 132.13 points respectively.
</P>
<P>
Though almost all index-based scrips showed falls, marginal
gains in the sensitive index were credited to hefty rise in shares
of consumer giant and steel major. The setback in prices was
termed as a small technical correction in the markets.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Prices To Rise In Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Fuel prices in Brazil will go
up 3.8 percent starting on Monday, the Mines and Energy Ministry
and Ministry of Finance announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But the announcement denied that the readjustments in
gasoline, kitchen gas and diesel prices were a result of the
country's recent currency devaluation.
</P>
<P>
It said that the price increases are not meant to charge the
consumers for the gap between the dollar and the real, but are
implementation of a plan to complete the budget adjustment in
different sectors of the state amounting to 23.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation, which had reached 44 percent by last Friday,
has caused a struggle between speculators and producers who abide
by the government order to maintain the prices in force before
January 18.
</P>
<P>
But Sao Paulo State Food Products Wholesale Commerce president
Wilson Tanaka said that maintaining the prices of such food items
as beef is difficult because cattle raisers and teamsters claim
that their costs have increased in the wake of the new prices of
fuels.
</P>
<P>
Rice, beef, coffee and chicken prices have been readjusted up
by 21 percent in the popular "corner stores" of Sao Paulo despite
the government's veto to the basic staples basket price rises.
</P>
<P>
A survey made last Friday by the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper
on restaurants showed that during the last two weeks prices rose
by up to 52 percent in dishes prepared with red meat, 50 percent
with fish, and 31 percent with cheese.
</P>
<P>
However, many foreigners working in Brazil and earning
dollars, effectively doubled their salary when the real dipped
below two to the dollar this week for the first time ever.

<P>
CARACAS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Uruguayan President Julio
Maria Sanguinetti has said that Venezuela could unilaterally
develop cooperation with the South American Common Market
(Mercosur) if the Andean Community, of which Venezuela is a
member, cannot establish economic ties with Mercosur immediately.
</P>
<P>
Sanguinetti made the remark in an interview with the
Venezuelan newspaper El Nacional published on Saturday, on the
eve of his arrival in Caracas to attend the inauguration ceremony
of Venezuelan President-elect Hugo Chavez.
</P>
<P>
The other bridge between the two organizations must be built
through the process of liberalization of trade and commercial
services, Sanguinetti said.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur groups Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay while
the Andean Community comprises Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru
and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Talks between the two groups stagnated because of the
postponement of negotiations on customs tariff reductions that
would facilitate the flow of commodities and services.
</P>
<P>
Chavez backs Venezuela's integration with Mercosur, even
without the support of other Andean countries.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Income from Panama Canal's
transit tolls reached 150.2 million U.S. dollars during the last
quarter of 1998, up 12.3 million dollars from the expected
amount, said the Panama Canal Commission.
</P>
<P>
The number of transiting deep-draft ships was 3,368, also
surpassing the foreseen 3,178, canal administrator Aleman Zubieta
said at the second meeting of the Board of Directors.
</P>
<P>
Aleman Zubieta attributed the growth to the increase in

the increase in the tolls since January 1998.

The implementation of a new inspection system on navigation
safety was also discussed during the meeting.

<HEADLINE> China to Adopt New Policies to Promote Domestic Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- China will adopt new policies
to promote domestic demand, a key element in boosting its
economic growth this year.
</P>
<P>
"The government plans to consolidate its consumption policies,
since some of them did not suit the market economy," Chen
Bangzhu, vice-minister of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, was quoted as saying by today's China Daily Business
Weekly.
</P>
<P>
The new policies aims to explore new consumption areas,
including residential housing, cars and information
technology-related products, and the wide rural markets, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
The retail sector should co-operate with banks to expand
credit consumption, he added.
</P>
<P>
Although mortgages were introduced in the early 1990s, they
have not worked effectively since regulations were so restrictive
that few customers can meet the criteria required. This was one
of the reasons for the stockpiles of residential housing and cars.
</P>
<P>
However, the abolition of the government-subsidized housing
system at the end of last year will greatly promote housing
consumption.
</P>
<P>
China's commercial banks offered about 300 billion yuan (36.14
billion US dollars) to support housing mortgages last year.
</P>
<P>
Bank sources said that the amount of mortgage loans will be
expanded significantly this year given the increasing momentum of
individual housing purchases. Measures will also be adopted to
make mortgages more available.
</P>
<P>
Leasing will be another priority this year. The leasing
business has grown rapidly since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The government will establish a series of regulations to
normalize the leasing business, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, tapping rural markets has become a top priority for
industrial sectors, which are hoping 900 million rural consumers
will buy their stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
"Industrial sectors should produce goods adapted to the rural
market, rather than simply getting rid of stocks," said Yang
Shude, director of the State Internal Trade Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The Internal trade sector, controlling the country's retail
and distribution network, will strengthen its function as a
bridge to the rural meets, Yang said.

<HEADLINE> CPC Solicits Opinions of Non-Party Personages on Constitution Amendment (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, general secretary
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, has
stressed that the incorporation of Deng Xiaoping Theory as a
guiding ideology in the constitution is a major proposition of
the CPC.
</P>
<P>
Jiang confirmed the status of Deng's theory during a recent
meeting of the CPC Central Committee to solicit opinions of
non-Party members on the CPC's proposal for amendments to parts
of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
He added that it is also the common aspiration of the people
of various ethnic groups to assimilate Deng's Theory, which
dictates that the country be ruled by laws and basic economic and
distribution systems as significant elements in the primary
stages of socialism which are part of the constitution.
</P>
<P>
This, said Jiang, is of great importance to holding high
forever the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and adhering to
the CPC's basic policy related to the primary stage of socialism.
</P>
<P>
Jiang went on to say that it is also of great importance to
the development of a socialist market economy, the promotion of
socialist democratic politics and cultural and ethical progress
as well as building a powerful, democratic, civilized, socialist
modernized country.
</P>
<P>
The move is China's declaration to the world that supported by
the constitution, the Chinese people will unswervingly push ahead
the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics and make
much more contributions to the country's prosperity and the progr
ess of mankind.

At the beginning of the meeting, Jiang Zemin outlined to

constitution.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Since the convening of the 15th National Congress
of the CPC, China has entered a new phase in the implementation
of reforms, opening-up and its modernization drive."
</P>
<P>
Jiang announced that quite a number of people from all walks
of life had suggested necessary amendments to the constitution
based on the guidelines proposed by the congress.
</P>
<P>
He said the CPC Central Committee attaches great importance to
the proposed amendments and was preparing to make a proposal
about them to the NPC Standing Committee which will then in turn
submit them to the Second Session of the Ninth NPC for discussion.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the guiding principle for the amendments must
consider changing circumstances although there are those parts

The non-Party personages said that incorporating the essence
of the 15th CPC Congress into the constitution complies with the
aspiration of the Chinese people of various ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
In this way, it becomes the will of the country and the
people, and hones the constitution to suit better the actual
situation of the primary stage of socialism in China, they said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they held, it will also help better encourage
Chinese people of various ethnic groups to build socialism with
Chinese characteristics, inspire their understanding of the
historical mission and political responsibility aligned with it;
help them unite still closer around the CPC Central Committee
with Jiang Zemin as the core, and generally advance the great
cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics into the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
Participants also put forward opinions and suggestions for
specific amendments of various parts of the constitution.
</P>
<P>
After listening intently to their speeches, Jiang said the
constitution, representing the fundamental law of the state,
plays a very important role in the life of the state.
</P>
<P>
The existing constitution, which was formulated in 1982,
details China's basic social system and the tasks it has to
fulfill. It also outlines the Four Cardinal Principles and
specifies the reform and opening-up as the country's guiding
principles, Jiang said, adding that it is an essential part of
running the country well and maintaining stability in this new
exciting era.
</P>
<P>
He reminded participants that the constitution is China's
highest legal authority, and provides a series of basic rules
which can be followed by the Chinese people of various ethnic
groups, all government institutions, the armed forces, all
political parties and social organizations, as well as all
enterprises and institutions.
</P>
<P>
The people and these organizations are duty bound for
safeguarding the dignity of the constitution and making sure it
is enforced, he said.

Jiang pointed out that the constitution is essential for
governing the country by law and meeting the needs of building a
socialist country ruled by law.
</P>
<P>
Since the reform and opening-up policy was introduced in the
late 1970s, China's economic growth and progress could never have
been scored without recourse to the constitution and he stressed
that China's achievement in the driving forward socialist
democratic legislation reflects the radiance of the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it is a good constitution that complies with
China's specific national conditions, Jiang concluded.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the constitution itself does, however, need
to make progress in line with changes taking place in the
country, and it is essential to revise certain sections that do
not conform to the practicalities currently existing, in
accordance with the demands of China's political, economic and
social life, and taking into account the experience gained from
the reform, opening-up and modernization construction.
</P>
<P>
The amendments will help perfect the constitution, making it
more suitable for today's situation, and will facilitate
safeguarding its legal status and authority, Jiang said, noting
that the previous two amendments in 1988 and 1993 both
demonstrated the effectiveness of this point.

"We will further establish the authority of the constitution
within the bounds of society and set up a powerful supervisory
system under which the effective implementation of the
constitution is guaranteed," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
"What is most important is that the power of government organs
are regulated and limited in accordance with law so as to ensure
state power is practiced strictly in line with the constitution,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang confirmed that abuse of power by any government organ or
staff member is forbidden.
</P>
<P>
"Violating any part of the constitution is the most serious of
illegal acts," Jiang said, adding that any such behavior will be
thoroughly investigated and brought to justice. He pledged to
take more effective measures to enforce the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called for frequent monitoring to ensure the
constitution was being adhered to at al levels and for those
relevant authorities to take action to correct any violations
against it.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen and improve the Party's leadership over the work
is the key to safeguarding the sanctity of the constitution.
</P>
<P>
"The CPC, which has been at the forefront of drawing up and
implementing the constitution, is actually held in check by the
constitution itself," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
"The Party has no special interests of its own and will not
allow any of its members to enjoy special rights," Jiang
stressed. The CPC and its members must act as models in abiding
by the constitution and all other laws.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the 1993 amendment added to the constitutional
system of multi-party cooperation and consultation under the CPC
leadership will continue to be an essential part of it and can
also be developed over a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, he stressed, the basis of multi-party cooperation and
the political consultation system is the major legal framework of
any country and is essentially what is known as the constitution.
All democratic parties and organizations have important duties to
safeguard the sanctity of the constitution and its enforcement.
They also have an essential supervisory function over the
enforcement of the constitution and all other laws.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his hope that all democratic parties will make
more efforts to cooperate under the principles of long-term
co-existence, mutual supervision, treating each other with all
sincerity and most importantly sharing weal or woe whilst
standing shoulder to shoulder, firm against any foe.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged democratic parties to make new contributions to
building China into a socialist country ruled by law and its
socialist modernization drive.

constitution during the turbulent Cultural Revolution (1966-1976)
will never be repeated.
</P>
<P>
However, he reminded people that the authority of the
constitution is still not completely enforced, and a few problems
still exist.
</P>
<P>
A number of departments in enterprises and various locations
do not act in line with the law, carry it out strictly, or crack
down on those violating the law, and a few officials even overtly
defy the constitution and laws and abuse both for their personal
gain, he said.
</P>
<P>
Protectionism and severe corruption also exist in some areas
of society, he said.
</P>
<P>
All these phenomena and misconduct have impaired the dignity
of the constitution and laws, and are obstacles to the ongoing
reform, opening-up and modernization construction, he said.
</P>
<P>
People have expressed their strong disapproval about such
activities and these problems must be solved in real earnest,
Jiang noted.

<HEADLINE> Albania Calls for Pressure on Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian government Friday
urged the international community to build up military pressure
on Belgrade, saying it was a top priority to hold peace talks
between the warring sides in the south Serbian province of Kosovo
with the involvement of mediators.
</P>
<P>
Albania voiced the call in a statement in response to the
resolution of the six-nation Contact Group on former Yugoslavia
-- the United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany and Italy
-- in London on Friday, which demanded that the conflicting
parties in Kosovo conclude talks on an autonomy deal within a
week.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government held that the London meeting's
decision to incorporate terms on Kosovo's interim autonomy in the
Contact Group's documents paved the way for the ultimate
settlement of the Kosovo crisis by the end of the three-year
transitional period, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government noted that political measures must be
accompanied with powerful military pressure on Belgrade. It warne
d against any illusion that Belgrade would comply with the
resolutions of the international community without military
intervention.
</P>
<P>
The statement attributed the failed implementation of two U.N.
resolutions on Kosovo and the peace agreement struck by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
last October to the absence of a combination of political
measures and military pressure in the international efforts for
solving the issue.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council has aired its backing of
the demands of the six-nation Contact Group for a negotiated
autonomy plan for Kosovo, where around 2,000 people have died
since the outbreak of clashes between the security forces and
ethnic Albanian rebels last February.

<HEADLINE> Real Estate Prices Grow Slowly in 4th Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Real estate prices in the
fourth quarter of 1998 grew very slowly, China Daily Business
Weekly reported today, according to the State Development
Planning Commission (SDPC) and State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The two departments collected statistics from 35 of the
country's large and medium-sized cities including Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin and Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
The market price of housing increased by only one percent over
the same period in 1997, compared with 1.3 percent in the third
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the same period in 1997, the price of ordinary
housing inched up 0.1 percent, while the price of economy
housing, sold to serve the needs of people with less housing
space, rose by 5.2 percent. The price of luxury housing decreased
by 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The SDPC said the major reason behind the big increase in the
price of economy housing is the current housing reform, which has
reduced the amount of welfare housing and encouraged more people
to purchase their own homes.
</P>
<P>
Most luxury housing is located in suburban areas, where
infrastructure facilities such as transportation are still
undeveloped. But their prices are still high and market demand is
still no satisfied.
</P>
<P>
Land prices in the fourth quarter rose by 1.3 percent over the
same period of 1997, but the increase was 1.8 percentage points
down on the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Housing rents fell 1.7 percent over the fourth quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Rentals of office buildings, commercial housing, factory
warehouses and hotels dropped respectively by 2.2 percent, 0.7
percent, 2.2 percent and 6 percent compared with the fourth
quarter of 1997.

LIMA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian Prime Minister and
Finance Minister Victor Joy Way Rojas announced Saturday that the
Central Bank will intervene in the exchange market if there is an
attempt to speculate by any exchange operator.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation has not occurred so far because there
is a balance between supply and demand on the market, the prime
minister said at a press conference in Lima, capital of Peru.
</P>
<P>
He said the transitory unstable exchange quotations registered
earlier were the consequence of a situation caused by the
Brazilian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that after the announcement of the government plan,
in which liquidity is guaranteed, there is no reason to modify
the exchange rate," he said.

<HEADLINE> Investment Funds Good for State-Owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese financial experts
believe industrial investment funds may function as a new channel
to raise funds for non-listed companies and help improve their
management structure.
</P>
<P>
Today's Business Weekly quoted an official from the State
Development Planning Commission as saying that it will be good to
use industrial investment funds to promote the reform of
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The idea for industrial investment funds is based on the
successful practice of investment funds abroad and has been
endowed with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
"It is a collective investment system involving public equity
capital and specializing in capital management and supervision.
The fund is aimed at directly providing capital for non-listed
enterprises by holding equity stock and at helping them optimize
management strategies through the fund managers' expertise and
experience," said the official.
</P>
<P>
A professional industrial fund management company will be
appointed to manage and utilize capital and a commercial bank
will be entrusted with the deposit of funds. Profit will be
shared according to the proportion invested, while risks will be
borne mutually, said the official.
</P>
<P>
He believed China's present economic situation has provided t
he basic environment for launching such funds.
</P>
<P>
"The fund can attract investors once it achieves a six to
eight percent rate of return, because savings deposits have been
rising steadily while the interest rate is comparatively low," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, a large number of companies with big market
potential cannot enter the stock market as there is only limited
scope for it to expand. Industrial investment funds can fill this
gap by providing the necessary capital to these companies and
restructuring them.
</P>
<P>
The funds can help lower the debt-equity ratio of enterprises
and banks' non-performing loans by purchasing part of the banks'
financial claims on the companies.
</P>
<P>
The funds could then help upgrade non-listed enterprises based
on their experience in management and capital operations. This
could improve the quality of the stock market in the future.
</P>
<P>
Some government departments are drawing up management methods
for sample industrial investment funds. These will set strict
rules on the establishment, structure and management of the funds
in order to ward off possible financial risks.
</P>
<P>
However, as the funds are something new and may encounter
problems as they are put into practice, they must have different
features from overseas investment funds, the official stressed.
</P>
<P>
The majority of those raising funds must be public not private
institutions in the first place and, secondly, the only
structural form to be recommended for a fund will be an
industrial investment fund company, the official elaborated.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Freezes Domestic Coffee Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian
National Federation of Coffee Producers Saturday suspended
automatic adjustment of domestic coffee purchase prices because
of the emergency situation faced by coffee producers.
</P>
<P>
Starting Saturday, a 125-kilogram bag of pergamino coffee will
be purchased for 200.32 U.S. dollars, or 1.6 dollars per
kilogram, a price that has been in force since January 22, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian coffee price on the New York Coffee, Sugar and
Cocoa Exchange closed Friday at 1.19 dollars per pound (2.2
dollars per kilogram), against last week's 1.22 dollars per pound.
</P>
<P>
The quotation in the New York market for mild coffee, which is
the price of reference for Colombian coffee, went down from 1.05
dollars per pound on January 22, 1999 to 1.03 dollars per pound
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
A devastating earthquake on Monday killed at least 940 people
across Colombia's western coffee-growing region, leaving about
200,000 people homeless.
</P>
<P>
The economy of the affected region depends heavily on the
coffee crop.

<HEADLINE> Germans Dominate Luge World Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Germans dominated the opening day
of the luge world championships on their home track, capturing
both the men's doubles and women's singles races in Koenigssee on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Instead of the German stars, it was the new generation who won
the titles along the world's most difficult tracks.
</P>
<P>
Sonja Wiedemann, who started last, fought off a blowing
snowstorm to lead a German sweep of the top three places. The
21-year-old finished her two heats in one minute 32.490 seconds.
</P>
<P>
"I secretly thought about third place, but first, it's going
to take some time to digest that," said Wiedemann.
</P>
<P>
Former junior world champions Patric Leitner and Alexander
Resch stunned the men's field by putting together two consistent
runs to win the doubles in 1:31.841.
</P>
<P>
Leitner, 21, and Resch, 19, hadn't won a World Cup entering
the event.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. bronze-medal winning team at Nagano Mark Grimmette
and Brian Martin again finished third in 1:32.074 behind Austrian
cousins Tobias and Markus Schiegel at 1:32.047.
</P>
<P>
Grimmette and Martin, the overall World Cup leaders, were
edged for silver when the Schiegel's blazed to a track record of
45.771 on their second run.
</P>
<P>
Olympic silver medalist Barbara Niedernhuber finished second
in the women's singles after running into difficulty on the lower
half of the course. She finished in 1:32.490, while fellow German
Sylke Otto was third in 1:32.544.

BRASILIA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando

due to his country's financial crisis, official sources here
announced.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia will represent Cardoso
at the sworn-in ceremony of Venezuelan new president Hugo Chevez
on February 2.
</P>

Cardoso also decided not to attend the summit of Group 15,

</P>
<P>
Vice-president Marco Maciel will attend the summit on
Cardoso's behalf, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso canceled the two trips because he wants to watch the
economic development of his country and to consolidate the new
exchange policy of free fluctuation, they added.
</P>
<P>
On Friday the dollar was worth 2.15 reals, which meant a 35
percent depreciation of the Brazilian currency compared to the
exchange rate of 1.59 reals to the dollar on January 18, when the
new free fluctuation exchange policy went in force.

"Last year, global construction investment totaled about US

"While maintaining East and Southeast Asian markets, our

<HEADLINE> Schenk Gains Vacant WBO Middleweight Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Bert Schenk stunned American
Freemann Barr with a left cross in the fourth round to gain the
vacant WBO middleweight title in Cottbuss, Germany on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Schenk, the first middleweight champion in history from
Germany, followed the punch with a hard shot to the body as the
Bahamas-born boxer was counted out with 37 seconds remaining in
the round.
</P>
<P>
Barr, whose record fell to 18-2, was turned around by the
blows, then walked away and sunk to his knees in a neutral corner.
</P>
<P>
The superior punching power of Schenk, 22-0 with 12
knockouts, proved decisive in a close fight. He snapped the
American's head back with the left cross at the end of both the
first and third rounds.
</P>
<P>
The title had been vacant since American Otis Grant gave it
up last year in order to challenge light heavyweight champion Roy
Jones Jr.
</P>
<P>
Schenk became the fifth world champion fighting in Germany,
all for Hamburg's Universum Box Promotion.
</P>
<P>
He was the first German to fight for a middleweight title in
59 years.

<P>
BONN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champion Japan won a Ski
Jumping Team World Cup competition in Willingen, Germany on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But Martin Schmitt of Germany, stole the show in front of
40,000 spectators as he leapt to the day's best combined jumps of
132 and 131 meters although his team finished third behind Japan
and Austria.
</P>
<P>
Japan's foursome of Kazuya Yoshioka, Hideharu Miyahira,
Noriaki Kasai and Kazuyoshi Funaki handily won the team event
with 976.5 points, the third triumph for Japan in the 13 World
Cup team events ever held.
</P>
<P>
Austria's team of Reinhard Schwarzenberger, Wolfgang Loitzl,
Stefan Horngacher and Andreas Widhoezl finished second with 903.8
points on their combined jumps.
</P>
<P>
Germany settled for third at 896.9 points with Schmitt, Sven

distance fourth at 813.3 points, edging Finland at 805.5.
</P>
<P>
Hannawald may have cost the Germans second when he unleashed a
leap of 131.5 meters, but lost costly points by droppping a hand
into the snow to prevent a spill on his landing.

<HEADLINE> Jail Time for Mike Tyson Sought in Maryland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Plans by promoters for Mike
Tyson to fight in April might be detrailed by plans by Montgomery
County State's Attorney Doug Gansler. He wants to put the former
heavyweight champion in jail.
</P>
<P>
Tyson is scheduled to be sentenced Friday in Montgomery County
District Court on second-degree assault charges in connection
with an August traffic accident in which two men accused the
fighter of attacking them.
</P>
<P>
Tyson pleaded no contest to the charges, and his manager and
others with a financial stake in the fighter have said privately
they don't expect him to do any jail time for the charges.
</P>
<P>
But Gansler has different expectations. He has sent a
memorandum to District Court Judge Stephen Johnson recommending
that Tyson serve time.
</P>
<P>
Gansler called Tyson "a time bomb buried in our own backyard."
The boxer has a home in Potomac but was trained in Phoenix for
his last fight on January 16 against Francois Botha and said he
plans to move there.
</P>
<P>
Gansler said that "given the defendant's denial of
responsibility, his defiance, his comments on his character, and
his predictions of future conduct, the goals of deterence and
rehabilitation may never be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Tyson displayed all these characteristics before his fight
with Botha in Las Vegas. He cursed out a television reporter
during one interview and made a number of controversial comments,
including that he was "beyond good and evil, right and wrong."
</P>
<P>
Gansler said that Tyson's behavior was that of a "bully" and
that his actions against two motorists involved in the three-car
accident were "difficult, if not impossible, adequately to
explain or comprehend under the circumstances."

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Political Will for Solving Iraq Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- China Saturday called on
all the parties concerned to be realistic and show their political
will to seek ways of breaking the deadlock on the Iraq issue.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy that the Security Council has finally adopted the
modified Canadian proposal, which has incorporated some positive
elements," China's Permanent Representative to the United Nations
Qin Huasun told Xinhua after a meeting of the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin listed the positive elements as expanding the
composition of the U.N. panels, reconfirming the primary role of
the council in maintaining world peace and security as well as the
role of Secretary-General Kofi Annan in this process.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that this is the very first step. The council still
has a long way to go towards a final solution and it still has to
face the serious consequences on its authority posed by the
unilateral military strikes on Iraq last December," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We also urge the parties concerned to refrain from taking any
action that might aggravate the situation on the ground," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin urged the parties concerned "to be realistic and
show their political will so that the current deadlock could be
broken and that the objectives of the Security Council resolutions
could be fully achieved."
</P>
<P>
The council which had been heavily divided on how to deal with
the U.N.-Iraq relations since the U.S.-British strikes against
Iraq on December 16-19, reached an agreement Saturday on setting
up three panels to review all the aspects of the Iraq issue.
</P>
<P>
The first panel is on the Iraqi disarmament, the second one is
on humanitarian issues and the third is on prisoners of war in the
Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The agreement "puts the Security Council back into the
picture," said Council President Celso Amorim.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Blair Agree to Boost Cyber Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair Saturday welcomed U.S. Vice-President Al Gore to London for
meetings aimed at cementing the already close relationship between
the two men and boosting business on the internet.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, holding talks in the prime minister's Downing
Street residence, discussed issues including electronic commerce,
measures to improve U.S.-Europe trade relations and international
security.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement on electronic commerce was issued after their
talks.
</P>
<P>
"Electronic commerce will be an engine of economic growth in
the 21st century.... Electronic commerce will enhance the standard
of living of citizens in the U.S. and the UK as well as the rest
of the globe by creating new, high-paying jobs and opportunities,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the United States will work together to ensure the
public and private sectors in both countries are prepared for the
millennium bug, they added.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed the situation in the Serbian
province of Kosovo as well as global trade issues.
</P>
<P>
But it was estimated that the real substance behind the vice
president's visit was to reaffirm his relationship with Blair
ahead of his bid to secure the Democratic Party's nomination for
president.

<P>
Gore flew in London Saturday to make the stop-over visit as he
returned from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He
was due to fly home around midnight.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Advisors Discuss Kosovo Force With Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
is consulting key U.S. allies and members of Congress about
sending ground troops to Kosovo if a cease-fire is reached, senior
officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) threatened to
take military action if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
ethnic Albanian leaders do not begin peace talks.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said it was too early to
determine the kind of force that would be required on the ground
and the nature of the U.S. contribution to any force.
</P>
<P>
"Until we know more about what a prospective settlement might
be, it's impossible to determine what type of international
presence would be required and what a role for the United States
might be," Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
"We are consulting with our allies and with Congress on the
situation in Kosovo and what our next steps should be," Crowley
added.
</P>
<P>
"We have ruled out sending troops into a combat situation, or a
nonpermissive environment, as the Pentagon likes to say," said a
senior administration official.
</P>
<P>
"But in the event we have a peace in Kosovo, obviously we have
to think about participating with other countries in a force" to
make certain the cease-fire was being honored, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Several administration officials said that no final decision
had been made about participating in a ground force -- with
President Bill Clinton himself yet to be presented a detailed
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
Military planners estimate that a force of between 20,000 and
30,000 would be needed to monitor the situation in Kosovo, where
ethnic Albanians have been trying to break away from Serb rule.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the United States, Russia, Britain, Germany and
Italy agreed to summon warring Serbs and ethnic Albanians to
France by Feb. 6 to begin negotiations, setting a tight deadline
for concluding a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, NATO cleared the way for the use of military force
to help impose a peace deal in Kosovo, authorizing alliance
Secretary General Javier Solana to launch air strikes against
Yugoslav targets if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council backed demands late Friday for a
negotiated autonomy plan for the Serbian province, where around
2,000 people have died in almost a year of clashes between the
Serb security forces and ethnic Albanian rebels.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Decides to Establish 3 Panels on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council Saturday afternoon reached an agreement on
establishing three panels to review all the aspects of Iraq's
relations with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Security Council had held a series of
consultations on it.
</P>
<P>
According to a note by the Security Council, the first panel,
on disarmament and current and future ongoing monitoring and
verification issues, would involve the participation and expertise
from the United Nations Special Commission, the International
Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. Secretariat, and any other relevant
expertise.
</P>
<P>
The panel would assess all existing and relevant information
available, including data from ongoing monotoring and
verification, relating to the state of disarmament in Iraq, and
make recommendations to the Security Council on how to reestablish
an effective disarmament and ongoing monitoring and verification
regime in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The second panel, on humanitarian issues, would involve the
participation and expertise from the Office of the Iraq Program,
the Secretariat of the Committee established by Security Council
resolution 661 (1990), and the U.N. Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
This panel would assess the current humanitarian situation in
Iraq and make recommendations to the Security Council regarding
measures to improve the humanitarian situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The third panel, on prisoners of war, Kuwaiti property and
archives and on closely-related issues, would involve the
participation and expertise from the U.N. Secretariat and any
other relevant experts.
</P>
<P>
The panel would make an assessment, in consultation with
relevant experts, of Iraqi compliance relating to these issues and
make recommendations to the Security Council with regard to these
matters.

<HEADLINE> Chinese TV Set Maker Taps U.S. Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese TV set maker's
effort to tap the U.S. market became a leading news item in the
U.S. newspaper Investor's Business Daily Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen-based Konka Group Co. hopes for a "great reception" in
the U.S., the daily said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese TV set maker started shipping TVs to the U.S. last
October. Later this year, Konka plans to enter the emerging
high-definition digital TV market with a set priced around 3,000
U.S. dollars, about half of what others are charging.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted Konka's president Wei Rong Chen as saying, "If
you want to conquer the global market, you have to conquer the
U.S. market."
</P>
<P>
In the past three months, Konka has shipped 25,000 analog color
TVs to the U.S. By 2001, the company hopes to ship 1 million
analog and digital sets to U.S. retailers. And it plans to start
selling digital video disc players later this year.
</P>
<P>
"The moves are part of a global push by Konka," the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
Konka made 4.7 million TVs last year, close to the 7 million
sets produced by France's Thomson SA. Thomson as well as the
Netherlands' Philips Electronic NV and Japan's Sony Corp.
dominated the U.S. TV market that sold 22.2 million sets last
year.
</P>
<P>
Konka's move has caught U.S. economists' eyes. Jack
Fensterstock, president of Bethesda, Md.-based investment firm
China Capital Corp., said that from toys to computers,
Chinese-made goods abound in the U.S. but no notable Chinese
brands sell in the country. Konka is unique among Chinese
companies, he added.
</P>
<P>
Fensterstock said it's only in the past three or four years
that Chinese companies have realized they have to build global
brands.
</P>
<P>
Konka has exported its TV sets to Australia, South Africa,
Indonesia, Russia and countries in Latin America. But U.S.
analysts said the U.S. is not an easy market to be in.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps they can compete on price, but it's a fiercely
competitive market," said Dave Arland, spokesman for
Indianapolis-based Thomson Consumer Electronics Inc., maker of
RCA, GE and ProScan TVs.
</P>
<P>
Konka opened an office in San Jose, Calif., last July. Wendy
Wu, vice president of sales and marketing for Konka USA Ltd., said
price is part of Konka's strategy but the company hopes to bill
itself as more than just a low-cost maker. The TV maker is drawing
up advertising and marketing plans.
</P>
<P>
At present, Konka sells only through regional stores such as
Florida's BrandsMart USA. It needs to ship to national retailers
such as Circuit City Stores Inc., Best Buy Co. and War-Mart
Stores, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
"They seem pretty aggressive," said Mark Seavy, senior editor
of Television Digest, a New York-based newsletter. "They are
determined to get into the U.S. market."

<HEADLINE> AIDS Epidemic Scourges Rwandan Prisons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The AIDS epidemic is scourging
Rwandan prisons as indicated by a report by the Rwandan Ministry
of Justice which said that 2, 272 detainees had died of HIV/AIDS
related diseases.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, 80 percent of the deaths registered in
Rwandan prisons are due to AIDS or HIV/AIDS related diseases. The
other 20 percent are attributed to malnutrition and other diseases
like dysentery, and typhoid which is said to have claimed about
400 detainees in Rilima prison, south of the capital Kigali, said
a report reaching here Saturday from Rwanda News Agency.
</P>
<P>
A worker with one Kigali-based human rights organization
monitoring the situation in Rwandan prisons said that besides
malnutrition, typhoid continues to be the cause of death in six
prisons he recently visited.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan officials were not immediately available for comment,
and the International Committee of the Red Cross which carries out
visits in prisons were not inclined to comment on the death toll.
</P>
<P>
''Around the world, the ICRC does not make any comment about
observations made in prisons, the same policy remains for
Rwanda,'' an ICRC Kigali Office official said.
</P>
<P>
The most recent statistics by the Ministry of Justice and the
ICRC indicate that 25,028 genocide suspects are currently held in
Rwandan prisons. Over 150 were sentenced to death since the
beginning of trials in December 1996, with 22 executed in public.

<HEADLINE> Leaders of Egypt, Russia Discuss Regional Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
currently in Davos, Switzerland, to attend the World Economic
Forum, held talks Saturday with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov on regional issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's political advisor Osama el-Baz, who was accompanying
him, told Egypt's Middle East News Agency that the talks also
dealt with ways of fostering bilateral ties, especially in the
cultural and economic fields.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed the latest developments in the Middle
East, particularly the stalled peace process, over which Primakov
voiced concern, el-Baz said.
</P>
<P>
Peace-making between the Palestinians and Israel is in a
standstill due to Israel's failure to carry out the October Wye
peace agreement, under which Israel should pull back from another
13 percent of the West Bank in three phases.
</P>
<P>
The accord was shelved after Israel implemented the first phase
of pullback in December. Israel demanded the Palestinians collect
illegal weapons, reduce the police force and renounce intention to
declare an independent state.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have rejected the demands as new conditions
which are not included in the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Primakov also tackled the Iraqi crisis, el-Baz said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been in a confrontation with the U.S. and Britain
after their forces launched an air campaign in mid-December to
punish Baghdad for what they denounced as Baghdad's failure to
cooperate in U.N. arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
Primakov told Mubarak that Russia has some ideas on the way
that the U.N. Security Council should follow in tackling the Iraqi
issue and the arms inspections, el-Baz said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Form Military Courts to Quell Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif Saturday announced that military courts will be set
up soon all over the country to ensure prompt trial of terrorists
and to give them deterrent punishment.
</P>
<P>
Addressing party workers of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League
in the Punjab provincial capital of Lahore, Sharif said military
courts to be set up under Article 245 of the Pakistani
Constitution will start functioning soon across the country to
deal with criminals with an iron hand, according to official
sources.
</P>
<P>
He said this decision was taken in view of the positive results
yielded by the imposition of governor rule and establishment of
military trial courts in November last year in Karachi, capital of
Sindh Province.
</P>
<P>
"The present government will never compromise on law and order
and will fully ensure maintenance of law and order, peace,
tranquillity, rule of law and supremacy of the constitution
throughout the country," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said the main purpose of setting up the military courts is
to award exemplary punishments to hardened criminals involved in
gang rape, terrorism and sectarianism.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the government has taken this bold
decision in the larger national interest to crush terrorist and
sectarian activities throughout the country without any
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
He said his government is fully committed to stamping out
heinous crimes from the society and weeding out lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
The governor rule and award of deterrent punishments to
terrorists, dacoits, murderers and criminals involved in gang rape
through the establishment of military courts in Karachi helped a
lot in stopping strikes, eliminating extortion and reducing
overall crime including acts of terrorism, Sharif noted.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the government will overcome in due
course all the major problems being confronted by the people.

<P>
CAIRO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran announced on Saturday that over 8,000 industrial
and educational development projects would be put into operation
during the 10-Day Dawn period (February 1-10) to mark the 20th
anniversary of the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Hassan Qadiri Abyaneh, an official at the 10-Day Dawn
celebration headquarters said that the projects have been carried
out by the different ministries and organizations in various
fields.
</P>
<P>
An exhibit will be held in Tehran during the festival to
showcase the achievements of the Islamic revolution over the past
20 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- The Yemeni foreign exchange reserves resumed growing
after months of oil revenue falls, according to the
Arabic-language newspaper Al Hayat.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Yemen Central Bank governor Ahmed Abdul
Rahman Al Samawi as saying the reserves hit 1 billion U.S.
dollars, covering five-month import needs. The reserves went down
in the second half of last year to 750 millions dollars from 1.2
billion by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Samawi pointed out that Yemen repaid 160 million od debts last
years, saying market experienced stability in 1998 despite the
world economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran announced on Saturday that the installed
capacity of the country's power plants has reached 25,400
megawatts in the current Iranian calendar year ending March 20.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Energy Minister for Electricity Affairs Mohammad
Malaki said this more than tripled the power generation capacity
on the eve of the Islamic revolution in 1979, which stood at 7,024
megawatts.
</P>
<P>
He said the per capita power generation rose from 545 kilowatt
in 1979 to about 1,650 kilowatt at present.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran's electricity output reached 102 billion
kilowatts-hours (kwh) this Iranian year from about 17.4 billion
kwh in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The number of power subscribers shows a four-fold increase
over the past 20 years, standing at about 14,100,000 this year
from 3,400,000 in 1979, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official also noted that the length of power distribution
lines rose to about 398,000 kilometers now from 56,000 kilometers
20 years ago and the number of villages provided with electricity
reached 39,000 from 4,327 in 1979.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Saudi Arabia's budget deficit is expected to drop to
8.5 billion dollars in 1999 from 12 billion the present fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
Saudi-British Bank sources were quoted as saying the decreasing
deficit would not result from reduced expenditures but an increase
in oil prices. However, they expected a lower growth rate of 1.5
percent, instead of the targeted 1.7 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Arab nation will need 250 billion investments by
2025 for developing power generation, transport and delivery
systems, according to projections by the Arab Economic Unity
Council.
</P>
<P>
An economic report issued by the council said that as a result
of the absence of coordination between the Arab states, some
industrial capacities are idle.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are being exerted for industrial standardization by the
Arab word, said the report.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT -- Kuwait's oil production capacity increased to 2.5
million barrels per day (bpd), informed sources were quoted as
saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the current actual production is 2 million
bpd, according to the emirate's oil production quota set by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that by the middle of the next decade, the
demand for Kuwaiti oil is expected to reach 3 million bpd, and
Kuwaiti oil companies are planning to raise the production
capacity to 3.5 million bpd.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni Court Tries Britons, Frenchman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The court in the Yemeni port
city of Aden adjourned the trial of five Britons and a Frenchman
who were arrested in December, 1998 on charges of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, Saeed al-Aakel, called on the judge to issue a
ban on publishing the proceedings, saying that some media had
published "inaccurate and false reports" which could affect the
course of justice.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the jury decided that the proceedings of the trial
will not be allowed to be disseminated as of Saturday in order to
secure the trial.
</P>
<P>
The suspects have been charged of smuggling weapons into this
southern port city a few days before they were apprehended.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni News Agency said the jury are led by Justice Gamal
Mohammed Omar and included Yemeni and British prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
The trial was attended by a number of the British Diplomatic
representatives in Aden and the family members of the suspects and
journalists in a building surrounded by police.
</P>
<P>
The report said the witnesses were called to testify at the
session which was put off to February 1.
</P>
<P>
The trial was adjourned to give the prosecution and defense
more time to call on witnesses. Defense lawyers reportedly had
suggested they needed at least a month to prepare their case.
</P>
<P>
This is the second session of the trial which began Wednesday
when the defendants claimed of being tortured and ill-treated.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said authorities found rocket-propelled
grenades, TNT explosives, anti-tank rockets, mines, laptops and
communications equipment in the car of the two British suspects
Mohsin Ghalain and Malik Nasser Harhra when they were arrested in
Aden.
</P>
<P>
Ghalain and Harhra acknowledged that they were stopped by
police but denied they had weapons in the car.
</P>
<P>
Police have charged Ghalain, Harhra, along with Ghulam
Hussein, 25, Shahid Butt, 33, and Samad Ahmed, 21, and Frenchman
James Luovres, 30, with associating with armed groups, forming a
plan to commit murder and destruction, and possessing weapons.
</P>
<P>
All six suspects have pleaded not guilty to the charges.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, six other suspects, including three Britons,
arrived in Aden late Friday for interrogation by the attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
The six, who were arrested on Wednesday also on terrorism
charges, were supposed to appear in court with the five Britons
and the Frenchman but were instead handed over to the attorney
general for further interrogation.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan University Graduates Urged to Serve Rural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has urged university graduates to render services to
rural communities in the country.
</P>
<P>
He made the call when addressing the fifth Congregation of
Mbarara University of Science and Technology in southwestern
Uganda Saturday, a press release from the President's Office said
Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Residents of rural areas need the services of people who are
well- trained and can guide them in not only the health delivery
but also in political and socio-economic affairs, he added.
</P>
<P>
The president, who is also the chancellor of the university,
said that the graduates should struggle and keep alive especially
from the AIDS scourge and work to create more jobs, noting that
the country needs a modern economy where the work force does not
look to government as the main provider of employment.
</P>
<P>
He requested all universities in the country to train students
to keep the idea of service to the community firmly embedded in
their minds and commended the university for its widening the
diploma and degree offerings.
</P>
<P>
The press release said Museveni presented diplomas and
conferred degrees to 86 students at Saturday's graduation
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The university has so far awarded 225 Bachelor of Arts degrees,
five Master of Arts degrees and 43 Diplomas since it opened in
1989.

<TEXT>
<P>
In a statement to mark World Leprosy Day which is commemorated
on the last Sunday of January annually, a spokesman said the
country had experienced a decline of leprosy cases from 2,400 in
1983 to 27 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said though incidence of leprosy were
showing a downward trend there was need for new cases to be
reported and treated to avoid disabilities.
</P>
<P>
"Leprosy has always been a dreaded and feared disease because
if untreated it can cause deformities, mutilations and
stigmatizations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Those who suffer from leprosy, he said, could be cured with a
multi-drug therapy and within 36 hours of starting treatment the
patient would no longer be infectious.
</P>
<P>
Leprosy is a chronic and disabling disease which is caused by a
bacteria called mycobacterium lepae.
</P>
<P>
Indications of leprosy include pale skin patches with
diminished sensation and enlarged peripheral nerves.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that worldwide over half a million new cases are
 diagnosed each year with 65 new cases diagnosed every hour.

in the north of the country at 13:25 local time (1025 GMT)
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He added that these jets were from Turkish airspace.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that 14 formations of U.S.-British
warplanes coming from Saudi and Kuwaiti airspaces violated Iraqi
airspace at 16:30 (1330 GMT) local time on the same day.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that 16 sorties of warplanes came from
Kuwaiti airspaces and 20 from Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
All these violations occurred in the so-called no-fly zones
set up by the U.S.-led allied forces in northern and southern
Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War with a proclaimed aim of protecting
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
Baghdad's suppression.
</P>
<P>
Since the four-day U.S.-British bombardment on Iraq in
mid-December, Iraqi air-defense forces and U.S.-British warplanes
have exchanged fires over the no-fly zones regularly.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, residential quarters in the southern Iraqi city
of Basra were bombarded by U.S. missiles and bombs for the
first time after the mid-December air raids. 24 civilians were
killed and nearly 100 others were injured.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton agreed on Tuesday to the U.S.
military request to go ahead with responding more aggressively
to Iraq's challenges to U.S. and British jets patrolling the
no-fly zones.

<HEADLINE> Israel Blamed for Arab Halt to Bilateral Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
blamed Israel Saturday for Arab countries' halt to economic
relations with the Jewish state, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who is currently in Davos, Switzerland, to attend the
World Economic Forum, told a press conference that Arab countries'
suspension of economic cooperation with Israel was prompted by
Israeli government's intransigent policy on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Once the peace process is revived, it will only be natural to
resume (Arab) cooperation with Israel, " the Egyptian president
said.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel is in a
standstill due to Israel's failure to carry out the Wye peace
accord signed last October, under which the Jewish state should
withdraw from another 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Reaching a comprehensive agreement with Arab neighbors and
implementing the signed deals might enable Israel to integrate
into the region's economies, Mubarak stressed.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that only a comprehensive and lasting peace can
secure regional security and stability for the peoples in the
Middle East, including the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the planned declaration of an independent
Palestinian state on May 4, Mubarak said that it is "up to the
Palestinians to decide."
</P>
<P>
"Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and his colleagues are
capable of taking their own decision," the Egyptian leader said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has announced that a Palestinian state will be declared
on May 4 regardless of the outcome of the peace process, a move
opposed by Israel.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Accuses Ukraine of Dumping Steel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has accused
Ukraine of dumping cheap steel which has made the government
suffer revenue losses and has damaged domestic industries.
</P>
<P>
The government has lost 612,000 U.S. Dollars in import duty and
value added tax (VAT) following the imports of 9,000 tons of cheap
steel from Ukraine in the last two months by Tanzanian
businessmen, the Iron and Steel Association has revealed.
</P>
<P>
An official with the association, who declined to be
identified, said that the dutiable value of steel from Ukraine at
the Dar es Salaam port has dropped to 230 U.S. Dollars per ton,
compared with 350 U.S. Dollars two months ago, local press
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
If the trend is left uncurbed, the local producers of mild
steel will suffer immensely, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's demand of mild steel is about 70,000 tons a year,
partly met by Messrs Iron and Steel, MM Integrated Steel Mill,
Steel Maker, Hans Steel Mill, Tanga Rolling Mill and other firms.
More steel firms are ready to be launched.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Chairman of Confederation of Tanzania
Industries, Juma Mwapachu, appealed to the government to impose a
dutiable value of 328 U.S. Dollars per ton on mild steel from
Ukraine and a surcharge of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mwapachu explained that due to global economic difficulties,
some countries especially those of former Soviet Union, have been
undercutting mild steel prices through state subsidies in order to
capture markets and Ukraine was singled out as the leading dumper.

<HEADLINE> Nyerere Sends Peace Committees to Visit Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 30 (Xinhua) - The Burundi peace mediator
Julius Nyerere has instructed four peace committees to visit
Burundi in a bid to prepare proposals for an agreement among the
waring factions by June.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Tanzania's northern town of Arusha said Saturday
that Nyerere asked them to expedite their work and get a much
clearer picture on the ground so that certain deals in the peace
efforts could be achieved by at least in the middle of this year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking with the chairmen and vice-chairmen of the committees
on Friday evening in Arusha, the former Tanzanian president told a
closed-door session that he was hopeful that "something tangible
could be achieved at least by June."
</P>
<P>
The committees are for Nature of Burundi Conflict chaired by
General Amando Guebuza of Mozambique, for Democracy and Good
Governance chaired by Professor Nicholas Hayson of South Africa,
for Peace and Security chaired by Father Matteo Zuppe, and for
Economic Reconstruction and Development chaired by George Lennkh
of Austria.
</P>
<P>
The committees are scheduled to meet again in March to brief
the peace facilitator on their site assessments.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi peace talks, which resumed last June, has been
making slow but sure progress among rival factions and has won a
suspension of the two and half year-old economic sanctions imposed
on Burundi by neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
The fifth round of the talks by the 18 parties and two
ex-presidents is set for June, but no date has been mentioned.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's Famous Church Renovated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Rock-Hewn Church of
Adadi Mariam,

some 65 kilometers south of Ethiopian capital, has been renovated
in 18 months at a cost of about 150,000 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The church, together with nearby Stelae of Tiya is listed as
one of the world heritages by the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
According to a report Saturday from the Ethiopian News Agency,
Ethiopian Minister of Information and Culture, Woldemichael Chemu,
said Friday the heritage of Adadi Mariam is unique because it is
surrounded by the prehistoric archaeological site of Awash
Mekla-Kontare and the Stelae of Tiya.
</P>
<P>
He said the government of Ethiopia is committed to enhance
protection of the historical and cultural heritages of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The building is 19.5 meters long, 16 meters wide and six meters
high and has10 doors and 24 windows. It was carved out of the
living rock stands with its cemetery on a rocky outcrop raised
above the surrounding area.
</P>
<P>
Adadi Mariam was said to be built by King Lalibela, an
Ethiopian emperor who ruled from 1181 to 1221. However, scholars
say the church was constructed between the 13th and 16th century
after the Rock-Hewn Churches of Lalibela, some 640 kilometers
north of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Adadi Mariam is said to have served as a place of worship until
the 16th century when it was covered over with soil and thereafter
forgotten. The church was rediscovered in 1887.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 35,000 tourists, 7,000 of whom foreigners, visit
the church every year.

<HEADLINE> Arab Interior Ministers Condemn Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The 16th session of the Council
of Arab Interior Ministers closed here Saturday with a final
statement condemning terrorism in all forms, and calling for
coordinated Arab efforts against drug abuses and trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Arab countries supported all efforts
to convene an international anti-terrorism conference under the
auspices of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, closed one day ahead of its schedule, fell short
of concrete action plans against drugs and terrorism, which are
posing an increasingly serious threat to the region.
</P>
<P>
The final statement, without elaborating, stressed the need to
differentiate terrorism from the rights of peoples to struggle in
all forms and in line with U.N. resolutions and international law,
against foreign aggression.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day discussions, the participants blamed Israel
as one of the major sources of terrorism in the Middle East as it
tries to "ensure its targets of expansion into the Arab World."
</P>
<P>
They also blamed Israel for trying to damage the reputation of
Arab citizens by falsifying a world public opinion that Arabs are
behind acts of terrorism, sabotage and violence.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by interior ministers and
representatives from Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia,
Morocco, Syria, Lebanon, Algeria, the United Arab Emirates,
Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The ministers decided to hold their 17th session in Algeria in
the year 2000.

HARARE, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has

</P>

Higher Education and Technology Minister Ignatius Chombo said
this during the official launching of the Masters in Education

<P>
Open University is at an advanced stage, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added the biggest challenge facing the country is to provide
school leavers with vocational and technical training.

"Unnecessary restrictions of access to education is an elitist
practice which has no room in a nation which is working toward an

<HEADLINE> Ill-Informed Tanzanian Handicrafts Hard to Enter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian handicrafts are
faced with difficulties in gaining access to the world market,
mainly due to lack of up-to-date information.
</P>
<P>
Stephen E. Maree, an art consultant, said in Dar es Salaam
Saturday that Tanzanian handicrafts are less competitive in the
world market for lack of knowledge of the latest trends in color
and design.
</P>
<P>
He said local handicraft dealers should pay more attention to
foreign clients' requirements on the packaging standards and
documentation.
</P>
<P>
Maree, who is also Managing Director of the Dar es Salaam-based
Amka Trust, said that lack of capital to purchase tools, equipment
and raw materials is a major problem for handicraft enterprises.
</P>
<P>
However, Maree said there are ample opportunities for Tanzanian
 producers who wish to export art wares because the economic
situation is conducive for the market of handmade products.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, the famous Makonde art of wood carving
will continue to be the biggest item of Tanzania's handicraft
export, provided right design and varieties in production are
introduced.
</P>
<P>
Basket ware, textiles, batik and pottery have promising market
prospects if they are further developed with better designs and
marketing strategies, Maree said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that handmade paper continues to enjoy excellent
export growth momentum.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer is scheduled to pay a four-day visit to Egypt on February
13, an Egyptian official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Fathi al Shazli, the Egyptian assistant foreign minister, told
reporters that Fischer, whose country holds the rotating
presidency of the European Union (EU), will discuss with President
Hosni Mubarak the latest developments in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Al Shazli said the talks are expected to center on the stalled
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Peace-making between the Palestinians and Israel is at a
standstill due to Israel's failure to carry out the Wye peace
accord signed last October in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, Israel should withdraw from another 13
percent of the West Bank in three phases. Israel suspended its
implementation in early December, accusing the Palestinians of
defaulting on their commitments.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, however, have rejected Israel's accusation as
adding more conditions that are not included in the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
The EU, which desires to play a role in advancing the Mideast
peace march, keeps close consultations on the issue with Egypt,
the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel and a
key mediator in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Fischer will also discuss with Egyptian officials the Barcelona
process and the Euro-Egyptian partnership agreement, al Shazli
said.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation EU and 12 Mediterranean countries including Egypt
decided at a meeting in Barcelona, Spain, in 1995 to take steps to
enhance cooperation in the political, economic and social fields.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and the EU are also holding talks on the partnership
agreement, under which the EU would, among other things, help
upgrade Egypt's industry as part of the effort to promote
bilateral economic relations.

CAIRO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Ambassador in Cairo
Yim Sung-Joon on Saturday hailed Egypt as a promising trade
partner.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Middle East News Agency before a
visit by South Korean Prime Minister Kim Chong-Pil, Yim said Egypt
which lies at the heart of the Middle East has huge potentials for
economic cooperation with his country.
</P>
<P>
He said that Kim Chong-Pil is due to arrive here on Wednesday
for a four-day visit, during which he will hold talks with his
Egyptian counterpart Kamal El-Ganzouri on ways of enhancing
bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
Kim and a delegation in tow will discuss with the Egyptian side
the launch of joint projects, including South Korea's contribution
to the Valley of Technology in Ismailia, a city on the shore of
the Suez Canal about 110 kilometers northeast of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
A South Korean organization has conducted feasibility study for
the Valley of Technology, which is "of special interest" to the
two countries, Egyptian Assistant Foreign Minister Nagi
al-Ghatrifi has said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will be the first stop of Kim's upcoming Middle East
tour, which will also take him to Israel and the Palestinian
self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ghatrifi said that Kim's visit is "of special significance"
in light of "the active and historical relations" between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, which established diplomatic relations with Egypt
in 1995, has invested 160 million U.S. dollars in the fields of
oil, auto industry, bank, electronics and construction in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
It has expressed readiness to invest more in Egypt's national
projects, including the giant land-reclamation Toshka project in
the south to channel Nile water to irrigate a swatch of desert.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warplanes Attack Six Iraqi Air Defense Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. warplanes Saturday
attacked six Iraqi air defense sites in the northern no-fly zone
in Iraq, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
The first incident occurred when a U.S. Air Force F-15E took
the offensive action after being targeted by Iraqi radar, said a
statement from Operation Northern Watch at Incirlik, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Later, U.S. F-15e fired missiles on four more Iraqi sites while
a U.S. Marine EA-6B Prowler fired a missile at an Iraqi
radar-guided anti-aircraft artillery system, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
All the warplanes returned safely to Incirlik air base in
Incirlik and damage to the Iraqi sites was being assessed.
</P>
<P>
It was the highest number of incidents in one day since
confrontations between U.S. warplanes and Iraqi air-defense sites
started up late last month in no-fly zones in northern and
southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It remained unclear whether the Iraqi sites ever opened fire on
the U.S. planes in any of the six incidents, a U.S. military
spokeswoman in Incirlik said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency Saturday quoted the armed forces as
saying that the attacks took place. It gave no details on possible
casualties or damage.
</P>
<P>
"The hostile planes fled to the hideouts of evil they came
from," the Iraqi News Agency said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Majlis Sets Aside Money against U.S. Plots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative Majlis
Saturday night earmarked a special allocation for "uncovering and
neutralizing U.S. schemes against Iran."
</P>
<P>
The Majlis set the unspecified amount of money while debating
the country's budget bill for the new Iranian calendar year to
start on March 21, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The allocation was set for fighting off "cultural invasion" of
the U.S. against Iran and following up Iran's legal claims
against the U.S. at international forum.
</P>
<P>
It was also aimed at "disillusioning" the world people about
the U.S. government, and exposing its infringements on the Charter
of the United Nations and violations of its own commitments to
Iran, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the United States allocated 20 million U.S. dollars to
reinforce its ban on Western companies to do business with the
Iranian regime, accused by Washington as one of the "rogue
governments" seeking nuclear weapons and supporting international
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Iranian Majlis earmarked the same amount of money
in an attempt to neutralize the American scheme.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's retaliatory move taken by the Majlis indicated that
Iranian conservatives hardened their anti-U.S. stance, as the
moderate government of President Mohammad Khatami was favoring a
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The two countries broke diplomatic relations in 1980 after
radical Iranian students took over the U.S. embassy in Tehran and
held embassy staff as hostages in the heydays in the Islamic
revolution in 1979.
