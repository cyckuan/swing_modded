AGASSI BEATS SAMPRAS TO REACH FINAL OF AUSTRALIAN OPEN
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS last 2 grafs with Sampras pulling out of Davis Cup.) 
 (rk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ It felt more like a 15-rounder than a
five-setter when Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras met on Thursday
night in their Australian Open semifinal, but there were also a few
strokes of tennis artistry worth preserving for future generations.
</P>
<P>
   From Sampras, there were the concussive, career-high 37 aces:
four of them hit with second serves under extreme pressure against
the world's No. 1 player and No. 1 returner. There was the
sprinting, stretching forehand passing shot that Sampras somehow
hit from an acute angle to take a 4-3 lead in the fourth-set
tiebreaker: a lead that would turn out to be his last.
</P>
<P>
   As for Agassi, there was the forehand retort to yet another
excellent serve in the final set, a return that landed smack on the
line, giving him a quick break and a snowballing psychological
edge. And there was the bolt of a backhand winner in the very next
game, a ball hit down the line off a shot sliced low and without a
great deal of force. That winner spoke volumes about Agassi's
rhythm and level of fitness in that it required him to bend deeply
and generate pace and precision all on his own at a very late stage
in the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the proceedings lasted 2 hours 55 minutes on a cool and
gusty evening at Melbourne Park. And in the end it was appropriate
that this match between the main attractions in men's tennis was
played in Rod Laver Arena, because Agassi's 6-4, 3-6, 6-7 (0), 7-6
(5), 6-1 victory made him the first man since Laver to reach four
consecutive finals in Grand Slam events.
</P>
<P>
   ``This amazing run I've had in the Slams, certainly I don't take
for granted the difficulty of it,'' Agassi said. ``By the same
token, you don't really focus on that. You keep focusing on the
next match, and I think one day you look back and take stock on
what you have accomplished. But right now, I don't think is the
time for me to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Laver won the four majors in 1969, and though Agassi is a long
way from matching the red-headed Australian's Grand Slam or the one
completed in 1938 by Don Budge, who died in the United States on
Wednesday, Agassi is now in excellent position to win his third
major title in eight months.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the French Open last June, he lost to Sampras in
the Wimbledon final in July and then won the U.S. Open in
September. Now, only the winner of the Yevgeny Kafelnikov-Magnus
Norman semifinal on Friday stands in his way of collecting the
Melbourne major.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the second-seeded Russian, Kafelnikov, the defending
champion here, nor the 12th-seeded Swede, Norman, will be favored
against Agassi: not in light of his victory over Sampras and not in
light of his remarkably concentrated, recession-proof play
throughout the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre doesn't want to look back five years from now and wish
he could do this differently,'' said his coach Brad Gilbert. ``He's
in the prime of his life, and he's not going to get another shot at
that. All that is going to happen in his tennis career is going to
happen now.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi did not head home to Las Vegas for his off-season and
revel idly in his achievements. According to his trainer, Gil
Reyes, he went straight back to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't miss a day,'' Reyes said. ``On Christmas Eve, you
could see cars driving by: families going to Christmas parties and
Christmas meals, and Andre was up on the hill running sprints. That
tells you a little bit about a guy who has done so much and has so
much. And I just kept looking at him and saying, `What makes this
man go?' He was up there just running and running: so quiet and all
you could hear were his legs pounding and his lungs screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of Thursday night here, all that could be heard was the
whack of the ball hitting Sampras' strings and the smack of it
ricocheting off the padded walls that surround the court. ``When a
guy has 37 aces, you are not moving around for periods of time out
there,'' Agassi said, ``except your neck.''
</P>
<P>
   There were only four service breaks in the match, and Agassi had
three of them. But there were none in the third and fourth sets,
when the match and mood reached its peak. Sampras took the lead
after rolling through the third-set tiebreaker at love, smacking
two aces and three other winners. And after both players dodged
trouble on their serves throughout the fourth set, it soon came
time for another tiebreaker. The tension built as each player
matched the other: 1-1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, 5-5. Agassi edged ahead 6-5
as Sampras' service return hit the tape, then the Las Vegan closed
out the tiebreaker 7-5 with a great return that set up a short
forehand crosscourt past Sampras at the net.
</P>
<P>
   But though Sampras is one of the best pressure players in
history and has a much better record in five-set matches than
Agassi, the rest of this match, surprisingly, was a denouement, as
Sampras' shoulders and standard of play slumped. Agassi broke him
in the second game and again in the sixth game and was soon pumping
a triumphant fist in the direction of Gilbert, Reyes and his
girlfriend Steffi Graf who reached five Australian Open finals of
her own before retiring last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Sampras said after the match that he had injured his hip
flexor in the third game of the match. He announced on Friday that
he would not play in the United States' Davis Cup first-round
matchup against Zimbabwe next weekend, and would be out of action
for three to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played the match feeling it, and movement is obviously a big
part of my game,'' he said. ``But I am not sitting here with an
excuse why I lost. He outplayed me, and I had my chances, and
certainly a little hip strain doesn't help.''

MINDFUL OF HIS LEGACY, CLINTON TAKES CREDIT FOR NATION'S
PROSPERITY
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: SUBS to update text, add Bush comment and details; no

 (With CLINTON-SPEECH)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With one eye on his own legacy and another on the
political aspirations of his vice president, President Clinton
claimed credit Thursday night for leading the nation onto the broad
uplands of unparalleled prosperity and laid out an election-year
manifesto for his party.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, he spoke of successfully crossing his bridge to the
21th century. Inevitably, he spoke at great length. Inevitably, he
put some Democratic spots on Republican ideas. Inevitably, too, he
set sweeping goals _ no child raised in poverty, affordable health
care for everyone, a cleaner and safer planet _ without providing
much of a road map toward realizing them.
</P>
<P>
   It was Clinton's last State of the Union address _ his final
crack at an annual political ritual that he loves, in part because
he is so good at it. Barring some national political crisis, he
will have only two more occasions before he leaves office next year
to address the nation at length, rather than in the snippets that
appear on television and in news articles: at this summer's
Democratic National Convention and in a farewell address later.
</P>
<P>
   He summed up his message in a single paragraph, just 60 words.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fortunate to be alive at this moment in history,'' the
president said as soon as the welcoming applause had died. ``Never
before has our nation enjoyed, at once, so much prosperity and
social progress with so little internal crisis and so few external
threats. Never before have we had such a blessed opportunity _ and
therefore, such a profound obligation _ to build the more perfect
union of our founders' dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Clinton listed his economic achievements, as unabashedly as
a salesman hawking his wares: rapid growth, low inflation, low
unemployment, decreased poverty, ``the first back-to-back surpluses
in 42 years'' and, as of next month, ``the longest period of
economic growth in our entire history.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke with all the expansiveness of a man who had hit
the lottery or answered Regis Philbin's million-dollar question.
With dollars cascading into the Treasury in a profusion that was
unimaginable when his second term began, Clinton proposed several
tax cuts though no across-the-board reductions of the sort espoused
by congressional Republicans _ and substantial federal initiatives
in more than a dozen fields.
</P>
<P>
   He sounded more like the Bill Clinton who told Congress on Feb.
17, 1993, ``Tonight I want to talk to you about what government can
do, because I believe government can do more,'' than the Bill
Clinton who declared not once but three times in his State of the
Union speech on Jan. 23, 1996, that ``the era of big government is
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, including Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the leading
contender for his party's presidential nomination, described
Clinton's agenda as that of a spendthrift.
</P>
<P>
   But as always, Clinton re-staked his claim to the middle ground,
the political terrain where he built his political victories as he
led his party back to power after 12 years of Republican control of
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We restored the vital center,'' he said pointedly in a summary
of his seven-going-on-eight years in the Oval Office, ``replacing
outdated ideologies with a new vision anchored in basic, enduring
values: opportunity for all, responsibility from all and a
community of all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who knows a parade when he sees one approaching, leaped
to the head of another one Thursday night. He signed on to a
Republican proposal, one of several, to ease the so-called marriage
penalty in the tax code, just as he had embraced other pet
Republican programs _ national missile defense, a scaled-down
version of the old ``Star Wars'' program; the balanced budget;
reform of the Internal Revenue Service; and opposition to same-sex
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   But like many of his other initiatives, his marriage-penalty
proposal had a sharp political twist, because it was aimed squarely
at the poor and lower-income families. It would apply only to
taxpayers who do not itemize their deductions, a provision that
would exclude most mortgage-payers. Other remedies for the problem
would have covered more people and cost more.
</P>
<P>
   This was not only Clinton's last State of the Union address but
also the first of the new millennium, as he took pains to note. Yet
it was more matter-of-fact than some of his past efforts, with
fewer rhetorical furbelows. Perhaps scholars are correct when they
suggest that this president does best when he is in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the confrontation with Congress in 1996, facing
what looked like a potentially difficult re-election campaign, he
put himself in a commanding position for November by declaring a
consensus on a number of issues that the Republicans on Capitol
Hill had expected to struggle over. In 1998 and 1999, reeling from
the Monica Lewinsky case, he not only delivered fluent speeches,
which many had thought beyond his powers in such a fraught
situation, but also reframed the budget debate by telling the
Republican tax-cutters: Save Social Security First.
</P>
<P>
   A different view is taken by Michael A. Waldman, a former
director of speechwriting for the White House, who was involved, to
some degree, in drafting Clinton's first seven State of the Union
messages.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think that after the 1994 election you see an effort
to reconstruct the presidency and its role through these
speeches,'' Waldman said. ``Not the heroic presidency any more that
passes grand programs, but a presidency refocused on what a lot of
pundits deride as small issues, but which are in part an effort to
bit by bit restore people's confidence that government can do
things.''
</P>
<P>
   That focus on the possible and the manageable, of course, seems
to some a lack of vision, particularly when it comes to foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's speech was devoid of new initiatives in that
area. A series of excerpted highlights produced by the White House
press office mentioned drugs and education and gun control, but
included not a word about foreign affairs. The speech itself urged
a new effort to close the gap between the world's have and the
have-nots, but proposed no new money for aid to poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton emphasized the need to work to strengthn democracy in
Russia rather than vigorously condemning Russian policy in
Chechnya, and he devoted little time to assuaging Russian fears,
shared by Western Europe, that the United States has turned its
back on efforts to control nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, the president hopes that his role in bringing a
tenuous peace to Northern Ireland and nudging Israel and Syria
towards a peace agreement will be seen as his foreign-policy
legacy. He hoped to add luster to that in his speech Thursday
night, while aiding the campaign of Al Gore, who stood behind him.
A Gore victory would of course redound to Clinton's credit, and it
was Gore's gun control proposal, rather than that of his rival for
the Democratic presidential nomination, former Sen. Bill Bradley of
New Jersey, that the president supported..
</P>
<P>
   But historians increasingly see Clinton as ``a politically
talented underachiever'' who dealt mainly in ``incremental policy
departures.''
</P>
<P>
   Those phrases come from a new book by Fred Greenstein, a
professor at Princeton University, to be published in May by The
Free Press. Titled ``The Presidential Difference: Leadership Style
from F.D.R. to Clinton,'' it sums up this president as follows:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tribute to Clinton's resiliency and political prowess
that he has succeeded in serving two presidential terms. It is a
commentary on his weaknesses that this talented political leader
has not had more to show for his time in office.''

STATE AND NEIGHBORHOOD CLASH OVER POSSESSION OF 1657 DOCUMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GLENN COLLINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just before Thanksgiving, the state of New York
entrusted a fire-damaged, rarely exhibited, little-known but
much-beloved 342-year-old document _termed priceless by historians
_ to the normally nonseditious Queens neighborhood of Flushing.
</P>
<P>
   Now Flushing doesn't want to give it back.
</P>
<P>
   No, chanting residents will not be linking arms to form a human
shield to block the convoy of armed state troopers arriving Monday
to return the 1657 document from its third-floor place of honor at
the Flushing Public Library to the obscurity of a cool,
light-restricted conservation vault at the New York State Archives
in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, many who cherish the document _ which for centuries has
been known as the Flushing Remonstrance _ are expected to bid
farewell to it this weekend at the library at 41-17 Main St., where
it will be on view through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Historians believe the Remonstrance to be the first recorded
defense of religious freedom in the new world. And a coalition of
Flushing's elected representatives, civic officials, religious
leaders and historians is campaigning to bring the Flushing
Remonstrance back home.
</P>
<P>
   They assert that the document's importance is obscured while it
is shut away in a vault and say the centuries-old message of
tolerance is an inspirational rallying point for Flushing today. A
babel of more than a hundred languages and ethnic groups, the
neighborhood is habitually tranquil, but no stranger to racial
friction and even bias crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The best argument for moving the document to Flushing ``is its
very name, the Flushing Remonstrance,'' said Rep. Joseph Crowley,
the Queens Democrat. ``It has lain dormant for years, and that's
because it's not in Queens, where people might be able to
appreciate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Claire Shulman, the Queens borough president, said she did not
``want to start a war with the state troopers, but why does it have
to go back?'' She added: ``It's not from Albany, it's from Queens.
Let them get their own historic symbol.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some of the neighborhood's 60,000 residents accord the
Remonstrance the sort of veneration ordinarily reserved for sacred
icons. The Rev. Nicholas Genevieve-Tweed, pastor of the Macedonia
AME Church in Flushing, said that ``in this age, where hate crimes
are increasing and there is a resurgence in intolerance, there is a
need for the Remonstrance to serve as a model for all people of
good will.'' He envisages a permanent display of the Remonstrance
in Queens that would attract student visits, essay-writing
contests, workshops, seminars and conferences.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To scholars, the Remonstrance ``is sometimes regarded as the
first Declaration of Independence, and was a forerunner of the
First Amendment,'' said Dr. Kenneth Jackson, a professor of history
at Columbia University, and the editor of The Encyclopedia of New
York City. He is not part of the coalition working to keep the
Remonstrance in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though not well known,'' Jackson said, ``it is a major
statement of the right to associate with whom you want, and the
right to practice the religion of your choice.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   David Oats, an editor of The Queens Courier, a weekly newspaper,
said that the people ``that John Rocker didn't want to sit next to
on the Number 7 line probably came from Flushing,'' referring to
the Gotham-bashing Atlanta Braves pitcher. ``This is the diversity
we love, which the Remonstrance protected,'' added Oats.

   The saga of the document, historians say, began when a group of
about 30 freeholders in Flushing (at that time called Vlissengen)
held a town meeting to discuss Gov. Peter Stuyvesant's restrictions
on Quakers because they were not members of the Dutch Reformed
Church. On Dec. 27, 1657, the freeholders, English nationals who
were subject to Dutch law, drafted and signed a remonstrance, a
traditional form of Dutch protest, opposing the restrictions.

   ``You have been pleased to send up unto us a certain prohibition
or command that we should not receive or entertain any of those
people called Quakers,'' the Remonstrance begins, ``because they
are supposed to be by some, seducers of the people. For our part we
cannot condemn them in this case, neither can we stretch out our
hands against them, to punish, banish or persecute them. . . .''

</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 29, the town sheriff, the town clerk and two magistrates
presented the Remonstrance to Stuyvesant's colonial government, and
were promptly arrested (and shortly thereafter, released).
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a lot of courage to do that, because Peter Stuyvesant
was very irascible,'' said Dr. Stanley Cogan, the Queens borough
historian and president of the Queens Historical Society. He said
he favored a modern remonstrance, ``in which our local citizens and
legislators petition Albany to have the Flushing Remonstrance
returned to its rightful home.''

   Some historians believe that the actual petition signed by the
Flushing farmers was forwarded to Holland, where researchers have
yet to unearth it among the surviving papers of the Dutch West
India Co. The version exhibited in the Flushing Library is written
on rag paper, and is the 1657 record of the declaration and its
signers. Copied by a notary into the colonial-council minutes of
New Amsterdam, it officially marked the entry of the Remonstrance
into the legal records.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   John Bowne, a Flushing farmer, put the Remonstrance to the test
five years later. Despite Stuyvesant's ban on Quaker assemblies,
Bowne invited Quakers to meet in his home, which is now open to the
public as the John Bowne house on the Flushing street that bears
his name. For his courage, Bowne was arrested, jailed and banished.
</P>
<P>
   And so he journeyed to the Netherlands, where his arguments for
religious tolerance (taken from the Remonstrance) were embraced by
the Dutch West India Co., which freed him and rebuked Stuyvesant.
</P>
<P>
   ``They felt that religious freedom was needed as something of a
marketing feature to attract immigrants to the colony,'' said Ric
Burns, who directed ``New York: A Documentary Film.'' He said that
``the spirit of the Remonstrance, and not just the letter, would be
preserved more dramatically in Queens.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Since November, more than 3,000 people have visited the
Remonstrance, according to Ruth Herzberg, manager of the Flushing
Library.

   The loan of the Remonstrance to Queens is only its third return
to its roots. It was exhibited in 1957, to celebrate its 300th
anniversary, and was lent again in 1976 for the nation's
bicentennial.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of the Remonstrance ``will only embolden the
crusade to get it back,'' said Oats of The Courier.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the coalition _ a group so informal that it has yet
to adopt a name _ hope ``to send a message to the people who put up
hate stickers and swastikas in our community,'' said Flushing's
state assemblyman, Brian McLaughlin. He vowed to push the state
Legislature to appropriate the money ``to give the document greater
exposure, and to put a curriculum together around its existence.''

</P>
<P>
   Crowley said he wanted to ``work in conjunction with the state
archives'' in finding a way to house the document in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   But not before it is returned to Albany. Gary Strong, director
of the Queens Borough Public Library, commented that ``we are very
clear, the Remonstrance goes back to the archives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be violating our loan agreement, and our credibility,
if we did not return it,'' Strong said. ``I don't want the library
to be in the middle of a political fight.'' He added, ``we would
like to be able to negotiate its return'' to Queens.
</P>
<P>
   V. Chapman-Smith, the New York state archivist, offered a
compromise: ``We would be very glad to provide the Flushing people
with a quality reproduction of those pages out of the council
minutes.'' But a permanent return of the original to Flushing is
out of the question, she said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Legally the state governments of New York (Dutch, British then
American) have had continuing custodianship of the document since
it was written. Although the pages of the Remonstrance have been
removed from the New Amsterdam colonial-council minutes for
exhibition, the Remonstrance ``is not a separate document,'' Ms.
Chapman-Smith said, and the Flushing coalition is ``asking us to
tear apart an official government record.''
</P>
<P>
   The Remonstrance, she said, is ``part of a larger collection of
over 12,000 pages of Dutch documents,'' adding, ``It would be
irresponsible of me to separate those papers.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Greek patriots' quest for the return of England's Elgin
marbles purloined from the Parthenon, and unlike Native Americans
who picket museums for the return of their artifacts, ``the state
archives is the rightful owner,'' said Dr. Ann Buttenwieser,
chairwoman of the research committee of the New York State Archives
Partnership Trust Board, the advisory and funding partner of the
archives.
</P>
<P>
   Removing the Remonstrance from the state archives ``would set
the wrong precedent,'' Dr. Buttenwieser said. ``If that happens,
archives and other institutions will think twice about lending
things.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Remonstrance is not only ``extremely priceless,'' said Ms.
Chapman-Smith, but is also ``extremely fragile.'' She referred to
its survival despite moisture damage (during the Revolutionary War
it was stored in the hold of a ship) and a fire in 1911. The
document's ink will fade if it is exposed to light for long
periods, she said, and the Remonstrance urgently requires attention
to correct a botched 1930s restoration job. The state archives
plans to clean and mount it as part of an $80,000 federal
conservation grant.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson suggested another compromise. ``Maybe the archives could
send it down for two months'' of the year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Chapman-Smith raised a more limited possibility. ``We could
entertain that it come back for occasional visits to Queens,'' she
said, ``depending on the condition of the document and whether
Queens could provide strict security and the proper conservation
requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   The Remonstrance still has tangible power in its hometown,
according to Quaiser Malik, a 21-year-old student from Elmhurst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard of it until I saw it here,'' said Malik, a
freshman at New York City Technical College who traveled to
Flushing this week to study the document. ``I am a Muslim, and I
love this country because of the laws that protect my religious
faith.''

   The final seconds fade into history and the man of the hour is
mobbed. A disembodied voice rises above the din: ``Steve McNair,
you've just passed for more than 200 yards and rushed for 200 more
to beat the St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl 34. What are you going to
do now?''
</P>
<P>
   McNair, breaking into a grin as bright as the flashbulbs going
off all around him: ``I'm going to www.McFlair.com!''
</P>
<P>
   It could happen, if not Sunday, then someday soon.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs Disney World when there's the World Wide Web? The
Internet is Tomorrowland, it's Main Street USA, it's Cyberspace
Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Sports fans, we have seen the future and it is Jervon Kearse
speaking sporadically and carrying the Web domain,
www.SuperFreak.com.
</P>
<P>
   The writing is on Shannon Sharpe's Web site, and Andre Reed's.
They are two of the 200-plus athletes who are spinning their own
Web following in concert with Los Angeles-based AthleteDirect.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe, Denver's verbose receiver, recently revealed in his
Web-site journal that he's henceforth going to let his fingers do
all his talking. The mouth that scores says he no longer plans to
give interviews to reporters, which is sort of like Dennis Rodman
swearing off partying or Ricky Martin immobilizing his hips.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, a fellow receiver, made waves that surfers of the Net were
the first to catch, divulging in a recent entry in his Web-site
journal at www.AthleteDirect.com that he ``wasn't that enthusiastic
about going to work'' this season in Buffalo and would like to be
traded or released.
</P>
<P>
   He subsequently had a 45-minute gripe session with Bills owner
Ralph Wilson. We know this only because Reed wrote about it in his
most recent journal entry. He doesn't talk to the media much
anymore ``because it's a waste of time for me. So I guess people
will find out everything from me on my (Web) site.''
</P>
<P>
   If Sharpe and Reed whistle while they write, it's undoubtedly an
Aretha Franklin tune tweaked for the 21st century pro athlete:
``C-O-N-T-R-O-L, find out what will work real well.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, this juking of the media worries us and not just
because we're the ones left grabbing at air. Truth often is the
opponent that gets trampled when athletes have publicists and
agents running interference for them. Take whistle-blowing
reporters out of play and the temptation for athletes and their
carefully assembled teams to chop-block any facts that get in the
way becomes great indeed.
</P>
<P>
   It seems almost as if technology is hurtling us into a bygone
era, when our favorite sports figures could spin away from
accountability, bounce off responsibility, duck morality and run
untouched through fame's corridors.
</P>
<P>
   That begs a question, not for fans to post on their favorite
athletes's Web-site message boards but to ponder themselves: Is it
the icon they really care to know or the image? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   !dtpost!q q q!dtpost!
</P>
<P>
   AthleteDirect is very clear on what it is not. ``We are not an
objective news organization,'' said AthleteDirect general manager
Jason Schirn.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the company exists to offer athletes another avenue of
communication and commerce. AthleteDirect produces the Web pages
for the athletes, who receive a share of the advertising and
merchandising revenue their pages generate.
</P>
<P>
   The athletes are centerfolds, exposing themselves without
reservation because they know the picture the public gets will be a
softer, air-brushed version of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The first journal entry of a collegian projected to go high in a
recent NFL draft was slimmed down after he wrote about gaining a
lot of weight on the postseason banquet circuit. The AthleteDirect
employee who was editing the copy explained to the player that it
was a cute story, but how attractive would it be to the NFL scouts
reading it? The player quickly Ok'd the, uh, cosmetic changes.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say if Atlanta Braves reliever John Rocker had
typed his comments about gays and foreigners and New Yorkers in a
Web-site journal instead of telling them to a ``Sports
Illustrated'' reporter, we probably would be no wiser to his
wantonness.
</P>
<P>
   That's the beauty of the Internet for athletes who, unlike the
professionals in the epoch BC (before cable T.V.), no longer need
exposure for exposure's sake.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think athletes are increasingly gravitating toward outlets
that place them in the least amount of jeopardy and offer them the
maximum exposure,'' said NBC broadcaster Bob Costas, who remains a
voice of calm in an increasingly cacophonous profession. ``Athletes
today have so many ways to reach the public and gain publicity and
get exposure for their next endorsement deal, they don't look at
talking to the traditional media as an obligation the way athletes
did a generation ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The traditional media keeps multiplying. It's so large now,
every move an athlete makes is magnified. With so many people
chasing after them, it's no surprise athletes are running to the
World Wide Web for cover.
</P>
<P>
   AthleteDirect isn't just a shelter, ``Essentially what they're
going to see is shrines of themselves,'' Schirn said. ``What
athlete isn't intrigued by seeing a shrine to himself?''
</P>
<P>
   Their infatuation is palpable. AthleteDirect has had a year to
rival Kurt Warner's, signing up 150 of its 250 clients during the
past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Warner, he isn't among AthleteDirect's clients. As
of Thursday, none of the participants in Super Bowl XXXIV were. But
Schirn, a one-time center on the Grant High of Van Nuys basketball
team, intimated that could change within the next couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   So stay wired. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Former UCLA standout Troy Aikman was the first football player
to start a Web site. He did so in 1996, at the suggestion of his
agent, Leigh Steinberg. Shortly thereafter, Dodgers first baseman
Eric Karros became the first baseball player to metaphorically
plant his flag in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it just because of the newness of the thing,'' Karros
said. ``I never envisioned it becoming as big as it's become.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodness knows Karros doesn't need to spin his public image;
it's already as sugary as cotton candy. He maintains his Web site
because he enjoys connecting with the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Karros is from the same school (literally and figuratively) as
ex- Bruin Reggie Miller. The loquacious Indiana Pacers guard was
the only athlete of a half dozen we tried who promptly replied to
an E-mail we sent to his message board at www.AthleteDirect.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Web sites are more for the fans who don't get a chance to see
us all the time,'' Miller said, explaining his World Wide Web view.
</P>
<P>
   Karros, reached the other day by telephone, said, ``It's a fun
way to interact with the fans on a personal level. I like talking
to the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Every year, it seems, the trade winds blow Karros' way. He has
been sent packing from the Dodgers so many times he ought to have
an endorsement deal with Samsonite by now. We wondered, would
Karros ever use his Web site to lash out at management the way
Buffalo's Reed did?
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was an issue that came up, would I put it up on my
Web site before I went anywhere else with it? Yes. Probably,''
Karros said. ``It doesn't mean I would do that. But at least that
way you could put your point of view out there in your own words.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Lakers swingman Kobe Bryant used his AthleteDirect
Web site to unveil his first music video. Can the Rams' Bob 'n'
Weave Dance be far behind?

EDITORIAL: A POLITICAL STATE OF THE UNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Jan. 28:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, a politician who is clearly unhappy about not
being able to run for office again this year, delivered a State of
the Union Message last night that managed to bring the campaign
trail into the halls of the Capitol. Clinton has less than 12
months left in office, but he put forward an array of programs to
expand health care, education programs, scientific research and
anti-poverty efforts while shoring up the big retirement systems.
These programs, however laudable, are unlikely to be enacted by a
Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not really a speech about getting laws enacted by a
hostile Congress. This is a State of the Union that will be
remembered as a bold attempt to anoint the vice president and the
first lady as Clinton's political heirs and to shape the political
terrain to their advantage. Less altruistically, the president was
also seeking to frame the 2000 campaign debate so as to prolong his
time in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   By tradition, State of the Union speeches open a dialogue
between the White House and Congress for the legislative agenda of
the coming months. But with fierce battles raging in both the
Republican and Democratic presidential races, Clinton zeroed in on
the emerging divisions in the primary election states. The main
cleavage in this year's election is already clear, with the
Democrats calling for ambitious spending programs and Republicans
resisting. Congress may well end up taking its cue on taxes from
the presidential race, in which Gov. George W. Bush of Texas wants
a sweeping tax cut that would use up much of the budget surplus,
and Sen. John McCain wants a smaller tax cut and more money set
aside for Social Security and Medicare, echoing the White House
proposal for tax cuts of only $250 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' refusal to applaud reflected a frustrated
awareness that the speech was another demonstration of Clinton's
extraordinary ability to champion Democratic goals by borrowing GOP
themes. His approach on eradicating poverty relies heavily on tax
cuts and credits, as well as emphasizing work and family. He spoke
of expanding education aid, but sounded almost like Bush in
demanding that the money be used to reward students' performance.
Clinton even said he wanted to shut down schools that fail to teach
students, an echo of the Texas governor's demand that if federal
aid does not raise standards, the money should be given instead to
parents for private schools.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Democratic race, Clinton almost seemed to be trying
to rebut Bill Bradley's charge that Vice President Al Gore has not
been bold in his proposals. He spoke at length about the unfinished
agenda he shares with Gore of health, schools and reducing poverty,
which also happen to be the former New Jersey senator's major
themes, and he expropriated another of Bradley's campaign themes, a
call to register all handguns. The president praised his vice
president so relentlessly that he drew laughter when he stumbled
and spoke of Gore's desire for ``liberal'' communities, when he
wanted to say ``livable.'' The staging of the speech was
unapologetically promotional, especially when the first lady
appeared with Hank Aaron, the baseball legend who has been
counseling the Atlanta Braves pitcher John Rocker for his comments
denigrating New York.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Clinton pulled off the feat of addressing a Congress
that had just impeached him and was about to decide whether to
remove him from office. Thursday night he undertook a political
operation of almost equal intricacy. He presented a State of the
Union speech that was, simultaneously, an exercise in legacy
enhancement and a political brief for his proteges.

YOUNG AMERICA DESIGNER ENDS SILENCE ON MISHAP
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ For the second time in four days, the
lack of consistent breeze forced the cancellation of a scheduled
contest Friday in the final round of the Louis Vuitton Cup series
to determine the challenger in next month's America's Cup match
with Team New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   The best-of-9 race challenger finals between San Francisco's
America One and Italy's Prada Challenge remains deadlocked at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Hauraki Gulf stayed placid, controversy was
stirring ashore. The subject, however, was not one of the two
remaining syndicates from the original fleet of 11, but the New
York Yacht Club's Young America squad, an early favorite that was
eliminated in shocking fashion more than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of the end for Young America occurred in a race
against Japan's Nippon Challenge on Nov. 9. One of the American
syndicate's two boats cracked and nearly sank, sending the team
into a spiral from which it never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there has been no lack of speculation about the
cause of the failure of the carbon-fiber hull. Citing an insurance
investigation, the central figures _ the head of the syndicate,
John Marshall; the builder, Eric Goetz of Bristol, R.I.; and the
principal design team, Farr Yacht Designs of Annapolis, Md. _ had
provided no explanation.
</P>
<P>
   The silence was broken Friday when Russell Bowler, a Farr
partner, issued a statement explaining _ and exonerating _ his
firm's role in the accident. He said previous repairs to the boat,
done without his firm's knowledge, had contributed to the damage in
the Nov. 9 collision.
</P>
<P>
   After 11 weeks of silence, Bowler said in a statement: ``We made
our decision to provide details on the cause of the break in an
effort to correct speculations by competitors and journalists, and
to provide insights for boat builders, yacht designers and
sailors.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call from Annapolis, Bowler cited an incident
that happened before the Nov. 9 accident _ and the subsequent
repair to the hull, which, he said, was undertaken without his
office's input _ as critical elements in the breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the week prior to the collapse there were some areas on the
boat's starboard side where the top skin of the construction
laminate was found to be not attached to the core,'' he said. ``We
tried to investigate the extent of this as well as we could with
the usual sounding techniques and didn't get a very good answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowler said the delamination problem could have been corrected,
but Farr Yacht Designs had no full-time composite experts in New
Zealand because of budget constraints. He also said the repairs to
the side deck were carried out without the knowledge of Farr Yacht
Designs; Goetz, the builder; or Young America's structural
engineer, Dirk Kramers. Bowler said he did not learn of the earlier
unsupervised repair until after the Nov. 9 incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reaction was one of utter horror,'' he said. ``I couldn't
believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he and Kramers were stunned by the damage because ``we
felt we had added an abundance of strength in an attempt to make
the boat extremely stiff forward and aft.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowler admitted that Young America had suffered problems in
other areas from the time the boat was launched. ``They were
problems of a similar nature,'' he said. ``That is, skin to core
not being attached. I hesitate to say they were normal problems,
but I think everyone has some small amount of work to do on these
boats when they get mobile.''
</P>
<P>
   For members of the New York Yacht Club, who seek accountability
for the tens of millions of dollars invested in the campaign, the
matter is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real story had to be kept quiet for some time because the
insurers were doing their investigation,'' Bowler said. ``Young
America may come out with a report in time, but it certainly
doesn't look to be in the near future.''

COMMENTARY: THE FIGHT FOR AN OPEN PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DOROTHY J. SAMUELS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has taken to defending the rigged
ballot rules for New York's March 7 Republican primary as a
reasonable test of a candidate's grass-roots support in the state.
He thus echoes the innocuous-sounding arguments put forth by his
New York handlers, Gov. George Pataki and the state GOP chairman,
William Powers. But the intricate ballot rules for the Republican
primary are in fact calibrated unfairly to exclude as many
candidates as possible except for the one favored by state party
leaders. This exclusionary system will be challenged Friday when
lawyers representing Sen. John McCain appear in federal court
seeking to overturn the election rules as an unconstitutional
burden on voting rights.
</P>
<P>
   The legal showdown culminates a week of ugly ballot warfare
leading up to Thursday's disappointing state court ruling
invalidating McCain's petitions in much of upstate New York. But as
affidavits filed in the federal court case by New York University
Law School's Brennan Center usefully document, outsider candidates
like McCain must surmount tremendous hurdles just to file petitions
in the first place. These affidavits give a realistic and graphic
picture of how the ballot rules set up barriers that make it
difficult for candidates to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   The rules gave candidates just 37 days beginning right after
Thanksgiving, and encompassing Christmas and the millennial New
Year's celebration, to collect the required number of signatures in
each of New York's 31 congressional districts and 5,000 additional
signatures statewide. These district signatures, moreover, could
not be collected by just anyone. To be valid, they had to be
witnessed by a voter from within the district, a notary public or
the commissioner of deeds.
</P>
<P>
   The state party, with its built-in network of party officials
and workers in each county, could easily mobilize to gain Bush
access to the statewide ballot without spending much money. McCain,
by contrast, had trouble getting started. The state party made it
clear to local Republican operatives that supporting Bush was the
only acceptable option. Helping McCain, potential defectors were
warned, ``would be viewed as a cardinal sin within the party...,''
recalls James Baker, a McCain petition coordinator, of the party's
efforts to discourage Republicans from joining McCain delegate
slates by raising the specter of political retribution.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the problem of obtaining accurate lists of
Republican voters. Some county boards of election refused to mail
lists, contending they were too big, and the lists that were
available were typically arranged by county, not congressional
district. Finally the McCain campaign bought lists from a political
software company, but even so, according to McCain's New York
political director, Gerry O'Brien, four days were lost translating
the lists into a usable format.
</P>
<P>
   After spending about 1,500 man-hours and $75,000 on
pre-petitioning tasks, the McCain team had only 20 days left to
collect signatures and get ready for the inevitable ballot
challenges. Gathering signatures was a slow and difficult process.
Many voters were away for the holidays or did not wish to be
disturbed during family gatherings. Volunteers had to contend with
snowstorms and wind-chill temperatures below zero in some parts of
the state. In rural areas, petition circulators often had to drive
30 miles to find enrolled Republicans to sign.
</P>
<P>
   A test of grass-roots support is one thing. A regimen of
petition torture that could end up keeping McCain off the ballot in
about half of the state is quite another.

SALLEY OK WITH HIS ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Life as a backup center on the Lakers is rough
these days. You don't play much, and to add insult, the coach has
taken to referring to you as ``not compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   But John Salley is accustomed to coach Phil Jackson's ways, and
as a veteran, he's also very patient. He's not about to argue with
losing minutes as Shaquille O'Neal plays 40 to 47 a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``(O'Neal) made a comment one time that Tree Rollins was the
best backup he had (in Orlando),'' Salley recalled. ``I said, `Back
then, you weren't playing so many minutes and they went with their
experience.' Now that he has all the experience and understands his
height, his weight and his strength, I mean, wouldn't you ride it?
You would ride him until it breaks down.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Jackson seems to be doing, as O'Neal has averaged
46.8 minutes over the last six games. Salley has appeared in only
one of the last seven games and it was for four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell yeah, I want to play. Phil knows that,'' said Salley, who
keeps in shape with daily workouts on the treadmill and in the
weight room. ``When he calls my number to give me five to seven to
10 minutes, I'm going to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Salley recalled the story of former teammate and UCLA alum David
Greenwood, a bit player on the Detroit Pistons' 1989-90 team that
won the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did not play one minute during the regular season, and against
Portland in the finals, he played 11 minutes, had 11 points and 11
rebounds, because he stayed in shape,'' Salley said. ``So I
understand staying in shape, staying professional and when your
number's called, being able to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Jackson referring to his backup centers, Salley and
Travis Knight, as ``not compelling''? Said Salley: ``Phil likes
words. . . . He's got (seven) championship rings, I'll trust his
gut.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Quiet time: Jackson waited until the third month of his first
season with the Lakers to employ one of his renowned techniques:
meditation. He did it last week, before an intense film session and
said it was an appropriate time to try it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was just some things going on, where people had
to reassess themselves,'' he said. ``It's easy to blame or to point
fingers at things, at situations that go wrong. And when you do
that, sometimes you have to reassess yourself. We had a couple
games we lost that were really close. It was easy to go through a
tape and say, `You did this wrong and you did that wrong.' . . . I
think (meditating) gives you a space in which you can be accepting.
I think most the guys were receptive to it. There were a few guys
that were resistant. That's natural.''

<P>
   MIAMI _ A federal judge on Thursday rebuffed the Clinton
administration's latest effort to clear the way for 6-year-old
Elian Gonzalez's prompt return to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, William M. Hoeveler, gave relatives who are holding
the boy here nearly a month, until Feb. 24, to prepare a response
to the Justice Department's argument that the relatives have no
legal right to act in the child's behalf. A Justice Department
lawyer had asked for a ruling by next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In opposing the Miami relatives' requests, the department also
included documents contending that the relatives had offered
Elian's divorced father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, a job, a car and
millions of dollars to leave Cuba and settle in Miami with his son.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez told investigators from the Immigration and
Naturalization Service that his Miami relatives ``even offered me
money to leave Elian'' with them in Miami, according to the
documents. ``That's when I hung up the telephone,'' he told the INS
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   But the Miami relatives, who denied Gonzalez's contentions, were
elated by the ruling of Hoeveler of the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Florida. ``We feel very good about the judge's
decision,'' said Spencer Eig, a lawyer for Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's
great-uncle, who with his wife and daughter, are fighting for
custody of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his wisdom,'' Eig said, ``he ignored the request made by
the government. We want Elian to get a full and fair day in
court.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoeveler's ruling marked one more setback for the Justice
Department and the immigration service. Initially, the government
intended to repatriate the child on Jan. 14. Elian was rescued from
sea two months ago after his mother drowned fleeing Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   As the court fight continued here, there were signs that
Republicans in Washington were backing off their support for making
the boy an American citizen.
</P>
<P>
   On some issues, ``politicians just have to step aside,'' said
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting of Republican House members, Hastert would only
say ``there's a difference of opinion'' among party members about
how to proceed. Hastert has supported the legislation but declined
to predict its fate.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, there was strong Democratic opposition to the
citizenship bill, and Republicans were divided. Sen. Chuck Hagel,
R-Neb., and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, waged a
strong battle to keep the measure off the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., a leading
congressional proponent of returning Elian to Cuba, claimed the
Capitol Hill efforts this week by Elian's grandmothers, who had
traveled from Cuba to argue for the boy's return to his father,
helped to build congressional opposition to the citizenship bill.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers were lining up behind a less controversial bill
that would confer permanent residency on Elian rather than full
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, R-Miss., a supporter of
the bill who once pledged to rush it to the Senate floor this week,
is now undecided about a timetable, his spokesman, John Czwartacki,
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In another turn, the Dominican nun who brought Elian together
with his grandmothers at her Miami Beach home on Wednesday said on
Thursday that she had changed her mind as a result of the meeting
and believed that the boy should not be returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview from her car before flying to Washington and
meetings on Friday with Attorney General Janet Reno and Florida's
senators, Connie Mack, a Republican, and Bob Graham, a Democrat,
the nun, Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, said she was surprised by the
shift in her views. Sister Jeanne is the president of Barry
University in Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to yesterday,'' Sister Jeanne said, ``I thought that the
law was simple and that a decision could be made straight away'' to
let the father have custody.
</P>
<P>
   But in the grandmothers' preparations for the meeting, their
fearful demeanor and Sister Jeanne's sense that the Castro
government was intruding behind the scenes, she said, ``I began to
experience something that worried me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to do with manipulation and a lack of freedom in the
presence of fear. I became concerned that this child could not
flourish in that kind of environment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the preparations for the hour-and-a-half meeting, at which
Elian's Miami relatives were permitted to wait in separate rooms,
Sister Jeanne said the women or their negotiators wanted pictures
of her house, inside and outside, showing that in assigning
everyone to rooms, the two sides would not see one another. ``I
felt they were controlled,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For the grandmothers, too, the meeting was unsettling in another
way. After returning to Washington to lobby for custody of the boy,
they said they had barely recognized him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's changed completely,'' said Mariela Quintana, mother of
Elian's mother, Elizabet Broton Gonzalez, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In the fashion of teen-agers, Elian showed up at the meeting on
Wednesday wearing a gold chain. He has been taught to wear baseball
caps, backwards, and to use beepers and cell phones. He plays
Nintendo games and watches video movies.
</P>
<P>
   The National Council of Churches, which has been coordinating
the grandmothers' six-day quest and has provided a plane for them,
said on Thursday that it was turning them over to the Cuban
Interests Section in Washington, which performs some of the
functions of an embassy.

MEMBERS OF CONGRESS FROM KANSAS, MISSOURI REFLECT ON CLINTON
SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Members of Congress from Kansas and Missouri agreed
with President Clinton on Thursday that the state of the union is
strong, but they differed on who deserves credit and on what can be
accomplished this year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Pat Danner, a Kansas City area Democrat, said America's
economic boom could largely be attributed to the policies of
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and former Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He was wise enough to retain Greenspan and to have Rubin come
into his Cabinet,'' Danner said. ``One of the most important things
for any elected official is to have the ability to select the right
people for the right positions.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kit Bond, a Missouri Republican, also praised Greenspan
``as a real guru'' and said the economic recovery in America began
under former President George Bush, whom Clinton beat in 1992. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bond said he was not impressed with the array of spending plans
Clinton laid out Thursday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, the president is giving a promise-filled speech
loaded with more big government, poll-tested spending proposals I
believe would squander our surplus,'' Bond said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican, said Clinton proposed
``an expensive, often federally intrusive, vision for America.''
The Republican-controlled Congress deserves credit for the robust
economy, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pat Roberts, the other Kansas Republican, said the state of
the union is not strong everywhere. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The agriculture economy is going through difficult times, our
military has problems with recruitment and retention, and our
national security policy needs a lot of work,'' Roberts said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats and some Republicans found things to like in the
Clinton speech. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he reached out to both sides of the aisle on some
issues that we should all be able to rally around,'' said Rep.
Karen McCarthy, a Kansas City Democrat. Stemming the flow of jobs
to other counties is an example, she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Danner said she was happy that Clinton had embraced a reduction
in the higher tax rate that married couples have compared to
singles. She has pushed for a reduction. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dennis Moore, a Johnson County Democrat, said he was
heartened by the president's call for reduction of the national
debt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an unparalleled opportunity to do something right for
future generations and for ourselves at the same time by paying
down the debt, which will drive down interest rates and further
stimulate the economy,'' Moore said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moore proposes that 50 percent of any budget surpluses be used
to pay down the national debt, 25 percent go for tax relief and 25
percent be used to bolster Social Security and Medicare. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Roy Blunt, a Springfield area Republican and chief deputy
majority whip in the House, said he was encouraged by Clinton's
speech, even though he said the president couldn't cut debt and
increase spending at the same time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He accepted an awful lot of the agenda we put forth last
year,'' Blunt said, citing Social Security restoration and a
balanced budget as examples. ``You listen for the things where you
can have some common accomplishments.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican often critical of
Clinton, said he was pleased with what the president said on debt
reduction and the budget but was especially glad he mentioned
improving urban schools like those in Missouri that are losing
accreditation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to look for ways to work together,'' Ashcroft said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ike Skelton, a Lexington, Mo., Democrat, said he liked much
of the president's speech but was disappointed he didn't have more
to say about farmers. Clinton focused on land and water
conservation incentives in farm legislation rather than on general
subsidies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In times of low yield, there ought to be a better safety
net,'' Skelton said. ``We've got to preserve the family farm.'' &QL;

REPUBLICANS ASSAIL PRESIDENT'S SPENDING PROPOSALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subbing throughout for updating, additional details, new quotes.

(bl) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans on Thursday night criticized the agenda
President Clinton outlined for his last year in office as
spendthrift, and heralded their party as the true steward of fiscal
responsibility, guardian of the elderly and champion of millions of
uninsured Americans.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton delivered his last State of the Union address
Thursday evening, Republicans seized on its details to warn voters
that Democrats could not be trusted to oversee the nation's
prosperity and the federal budget surpluses that have accompanied
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The litany of spending programs the president announced
tonight proves my point that if you leave a large surplus in
Washington, the money will be spent on bigger government,'' said
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential
front-runner, in a statement. ``The president's tax cut is too
small, and it will not help the economy grow or make the tax code
more fair.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, expressing amazement at an array
of more than 60 proposed new initiatives from a $50 million plan to
clean up the Great Lakes to a $20 million proposal to fight
infectious diseases, said: ``As Washington digs out of the latest
winter blizzard, the Congress will dig out of an avalanche of
presidential spending initiatives. We will sift through the
president's requests and make a determination what is necessary and
what is not.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction from Republicans previewed the yearlong battle
between the two parties over how best to use the trillions of
dollars in projected surpluses, already a core theme on the
campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties have vowed to protect Social Security and pay down
the $3.6 trillion national debt, but Democrats would use much of
the non-Social Security surplus to increase spending on domestic
programs, while Republicans are eager to plow much of those monies
into tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   For the televised Republican response to Clinton, party leaders
picked Sens. Bill Frist of Tennessee and Susan Collins of Maine,
experts on health care and education, issues usually associated
with Democrats. The choice underscored Republicans' desire to show
a moderate face on two issues that have emerged as immensely
popular with voters.
</P>
<P>
   The two senators took sharply different approaches. Sen. Collins
never even mentioned Clinton or the more than $3 billion in
education spending increases he proposed Thursday night. She
indirectly criticized the administration for ``dictating to
communities how they should run their schools,'' advocating instead
pushing for more control over education decisions to local
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans want what all parents want for their children's
schools: more federal help but less federal interference,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Frist, a doctor, repeatedly attacked Clinton's
health care proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time he proposed a health plan was seven years ago,''
Frist said, referring to the ill-fated effort headed by Hillary
Rodham Clinton. ``And then it amounted to a federal government
takeover of our entire health care system.''
</P>
<P>
   But Frist also edged closer to embracing a version of two
Democratic health-care proposals: a patients' bill of rights that
allows patients to sue their health care plan under certain
conditions, and expanding Medicare to include prescription drug
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to keep doctors first, lawyers second,'' Frist
told reporters of the Republican plan to regulate health
maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans lawmakers in tough re-election fights were quick to
embrace Clinton's education and health care goals, while distancing
themselves from other increases in domestic spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I am in agreement with many of his goals _ for example,
improving the quality of education for our children and creating
some kind of prescription drug benefit for America's seniors _
generally it is important that we restrict increases in spending,
lest we seriously slow our economic growth,'' said Sen. William
Roth, R-Del., who is facing a tough campaign this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and even many Democrats rolled their eyes at
Clinton's verbosity Thursday night. (``Long, but strong,'' Rep.
Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., , said of the 90-minute speech.) But virtually
absent from Thursday night's Republican reaction was any mention of
the Monica Lewinsky scandal, which dominated discussion outside the
chamber at the last two State of the Union addresses.
</P>
<P>
   And while most Republicans were not ready to give Bill Clinton a
hearty send-off, some lawmakers held out a symbolic olive branch.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans, including Rep. David Dreier of California,
cheered Clinton's support for bringing China into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake,'' said Dreier, who heads the House Rules
Committee. ``Republicans will work in good faith with this
president and every Democrat in Congress who puts ideas ahead of
politics.''

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
Steve Francis had done the unthinkable so often it must have seemed
like a good idea. So with two minutes left and the Rockets finally
ready to put away the NBA's losingest team, the Rockets stopped
thinking.
<TEXT>
<P>
   To pick the most foolish mistake of the final minutes would be
more difficult than defeating the Golden State Warriors normally
would be. And Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich added three officials
calls he called ``horrendous'' to consideration.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets did all they could to help the Warriors to a
115-110 win Thursday night before just 13,998 at Compaq Center, the
Rockets' smallest home crowd since the season's first week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically handed them the game,'' Francis said. ``It seemed
like the last couple games we've been going backward instead of
going forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we passed that point. You're definitely going to
have your ups and downs in the season, but this definitely wasn't
the time I thought we'd do something of this nature. We gave this
one away. We gave them the win.''
</P>
<P>
   More than all those early-season fourth-quarter collapses,
Thursday's was needless, and not only because the Rockets allowed
the NBA's second-worst shooting team, weakened by injuries and a
suspension, to put up 115 points, matching the Warriors' season
high.
</P>
<P>
   Even allowing that, the Rockets flogged themselves for their
inept final minutes when they invited the Warriors to steal their
ninth win of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The most crushing mistake might have come when Francis tested
his luck and leaping ability once too often and Cuttino Mobley
suddenly failed to cover his back.
</P>
<P>
   Francis had grabbed 17 rebounds, more than any Rockets player
has collected in a game this season since a pair of Charles Barkley
rebound-hoarding games in November. He had seven offensive
rebounds. With a career-best 14 assists, matching the Rockets'
rookie record, and 25 points, he had his first triple double.
Anthony ``Pig'' Miller had a career-high 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Rockets clinging to a 110-108 lead in the last
minute, Shandon Anderson missed a jumper and Francis went for his
18th rebound. When the ball bounded beyond his reach, Warriors
guard Mookie Blaylock took off for the other end with no one to
slow him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost had the rebound,'' Francis said. ``I thought I had
it. But when they pushed the ball up the court, I thought somebody
would pick him up. My bad. I shouldn't have gone for the rebound.
It was a gutsy decision on my part to go for the ball. It was a
long rebound.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobley did come over to cut off Blaylock. But as Blaylock
reached the 3-point arc, Mobley left him and Blaylock never
hesitated. He quickly drained a 3 for the Warriors' first lead
since midway through the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't run away from the guy with the ball, especially
if he's the best 3-point guy,'' Tomjanovich said. ``That's all we
talked about: `No 3-pointers.' We just get burned when we make
mental mistakes like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had isolated Mobley, with mixed success, on the
previous two possessions. But behind by one, they put the ball back
into Francis' hands. He drove the baseline and looked to pass back
out but was lost in a forest of long arms.
</P>
<P>
   His pass was slapped down by Antawn Jamison with 19.2 seconds
left. The Rockets were forced to quickly foul, and Vonteego
Cummings made both free throws for a three-point Warriors lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned the ball over at the end of the game,'' Francis said.
``That lost the game for us. My man hit the 3. That sums it up.
That triple double, that's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets had another chance and were no more pleased with
how that turned out.
</P>
<P>
   They got the ball to Matt Bullard at the 3-point line. Bullard
had made three of six 3s and had 17 points when he found himself
defended in a switch by Blaylock. Bullard tried to use his
nine-inch height advantage to shoot over the 11-year veteran, but
Blaylock blocked his shot, ending the Rockets' chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets were forced to foul again, and Cummings added two
free throws to complete a 9-0 Warriors run in the last 1:04.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to shoot over him, and I wanted to draw a foul,
too,'' Bullard said. ``I guess he got all ball. I thought he did
(foul on the play). But I don't wear the whistle.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich was less diplomatic. As frustrated as he was by the
Rockets' late blunders, he was incensed by the no-call on Bullard's
shot, sure Blaylock had slapped Bullard on the forearm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made some costly mistakes late in the game, the biggest one
being leaving Mookie Blaylock,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We had him
covered, then we ran away from the ball. That put the pressure on
us. We didn't get shots at the end, a couple when we just ran into
a pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we got three of the most horrendous calls ever. I'll call
up the league on that. A guy shooting a 3-point shot and you miss
when the guy hacks across your arm, you don't have to be looking at
rebound position or anything like that. That's ridiculous. That's a
farce. He was fouled. The guy hacked him right across his arm. He
couldn't even get his arm up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two loose-ball fouls that were not fouls. We had that
one. And we made some mistakes, too. It was too much.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was enough to ensure that even the Warriors couldn't
lose, a notion that in itself should have been unthinkable.

BUSH, BRADLEY AGREE ON TARGET _ GORE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  NASHUA, N.H. _ Playing catch-up in close races, Democratic
presidential candidate Bill Bradley and GOP contender George W.
Bush found common ground Thursday _ taking jabs at Vice President
Al Gore.
<P>
   Former New Jersey Sen. Bradley, interviewed on a local
television station, said, ``I'm no longer going to accept
misrepresentations of my record by Al Gore. ... If somebody doesn't
tell the truth in a campaign, how can we be sure he'll do it as
president?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also put Gore in the bull's-eye, predicting ``a litany of
spending, spending, spending'' proposals by the Clinton-Gore
administration in last night's State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (Gore) can figure out how to handle his
relationship with the president,'' the Texas governor said. ``He
distances (himself), he doesn't distance. ... It's going to send a
confusing signal to the voters.''
</P>
<P>
   With five days to go before New Hampshire's ``first in the
nation'' primary, both Republican and Democratic candidates are
pounding the pavement in the Granite State, cutting each other up
in a last-ditch drive to make their case to voters.
</P>
<P>
   So intense is the competition, and so intimate the campaigning,
that the motto for many discriminating citizens here is ``don't
vote for anyone who hasn't been in your living room,'' said Bliss
Woodruff, a retired architect in Nashua.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the Democratic front-runner who is pulling away from
Bradley in the polls and is still considered the party favorite for
the nomination, is facing shots from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, coming off a disappointing 2-to-1 loss to Gore in
Iowa's caucuses, faces increasing pressure to win in New Hampshire,
or at least finish a close second, to maintain credibility and
claims that he could be viable against a GOP opponent in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Some Bradley supporters say the former basketball player must
adopt a get-tough strategy against Gore, one Bradley himself called
``attack, attack, attack.''
</P>
<P>
   But party faithfuls, watching the increasingly acrimonious
contest between Gore and Bradley, say the real war lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats will do fine,'' Democratic campaign adviser Bob
Mulholland said Thursday. He plans to tag along with both
Democratic and GOP candidates in New Hampshire to learn strategy
and techniques. ``Both candidates have become better as a result _
and that will help us in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is lagging slightly behind Arizona Sen. John McCain in New
Hampshire polls, and he slammed McCain's tax plan Thursday, calling
it ``very much like Clinton's.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also touted an endorsement by Jack Kemp, the 1996 GOP vice
presidential candidate, flat-tax advocate and former Steve Forbes
supporter.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Bush appears confident. He holds strong
leads in South Carolina, New York and California, where crucial
primaries come next. Indeed, during a news conference Thursday, he
was asked if he was getting a bit presumptuous in criticizing Gore,
and the Clinton administration, before he has even secured the GOP
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush insisted he takes nothing for granted, saying Tuesday's
primary is ``going to be a close contest, and I have a lot of work
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush began at dawn Thursday, addressing 200 people at the
Greater Nashua Chamber of Commerce breakfast, then heading to
Sanders Corp., a Lockheed Martin Corp. division that is the state's
largest private employer and a major manufacturer of defense
systems.
</P>
<P>
   His enthusiastic reception came in sharp contrast to the welcome
given to rival GOP candidate Forbes, who was there just the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   And appearing eager to dispel a staffer's announcement that he
would no longer hold news conferences _ which earned him rebukes on
some editorial pages _ Bush made himself available for questions
from all comers. He held two lengthy sessions with reporters,
bantering with the press and even asking them by name about their
children and families.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he offered extended question-and-answer sessions to
voters, as well as to children at Fairground Elementary School.
There, he danced with some of the schoolgirls, who asked him to
take a spin on the cafeteria floor.
</P>
<P>
   Even with New Hampshire residents who will not vote for another
decade, Bush never stopped campaigning. ``Why don't you just go
home,'' he told the kids conspiratorially, ``and (tell) your mother
and dad that I've come and asked for their vote.''

 CONNERLY OPPOSES ANTI-GAY INITIATIVE  &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Exposing a deep political fissure in the Republican
party, UC Regent Ward Connerly and several other prominent GOP
party members announced their opposition Thursday to Proposition
22, a measure on the March 7 ballot that would ban gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, which was put on the ballot by state Sen.
William ``Pete'' Knight, R-Palmdale, is broadly supported by state
Republicans. But Connerly, who led the campaign for the
anti-affirmative action Proposition 209, said gay rights are a
matter of personal freedom and not an area where the government
should be involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support two people having the right to do whatever they want
to do,'' said Connerly.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's statement by Connerly, GOP Senate candidate Tom
Campbell, and state Assemblyman Jim Cunneen, R-San Jose, comes on
the heels of several other public battles within the Republican
Party. Only last year, for example, a splinter group of moderate
state Republicans held an alternative convention to adopt a
pro-choice platform.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also comes as leaders are hoping the rank and file
will unite behind the party's candidates. In less than two weeks,
the state GOP will meet in Burlingame to adopt a party platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you are seeing is symptomatic of the problems the party
has had for the past five years,'' said GOP consultant Mike Madrid.
``The base of the party has remained unchanged, while the
demographics in California have changed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, how do you broaden the base of the party when
the core is so intense on certain key issues?'' Madrid said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Proposition 22 deny that there is any division
among Republicans, citing the support of the California Republican
Party and 56 GOP members of the Legislature and congressional
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not at all surprised to see the author of Prop. 209, one
of the most divisive measures ever introduced against Latinos, has
chosen to join forces with a campaign against marriage,'' said
Julio Calderon, a spokesman for the proposition, citing a survey
showing 67 percent of Latino voters support Proposition 22.
</P>
<P>
   But the president of the California Republican League, a group
that promotes inclusion in the party, said such issues hurt
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this notion that we put this stuff on the ballot as a
`wedge' issue and promote wedge-issue politics _ it feeds the
notion that Republicans are into dividing people,'' said Gary
Zlotnick, the league's president.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly also said Republicans suffer from their public image.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have a more difficult time than the Democrats because
some think it is written somewhere that we should oppress gays,''
he said. ``Some people invoke the Bible and don't think it through.
But Democrats come out against the initiative and then dance around
the real issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Democratic presidential hopefuls, Vice President Al Gore
and former Sen. Bill Bradley, have come out against the initiative
but oppose same-sex marriage.

 HATE VICTIM'S MOTHER SPEAKS OUT AGAINST ANTI-GAY MARRIAGE MEASURE  &HT;     By ELAINE HERSCHER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The mother of Matthew Shepard, the young gay man
beaten to death in Wyoming, appealed to Californians Thursday to
vote against a state ballot initiative that would ban gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in San Francisco, the first stop in her
campaign against Proposition 22 on the California's March 7 ballot,
Judy Shepard called the measure ``another seed of fear and
ignorance'' and asked Californians to vote with their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a parent and a member of a family, and I think everybody
should have the right to be part of a family,'' Shepard said. ``You
don't have to be for or against same-sex marriages to vote against
the Knight Initiative. (Gay marriages) don't even exist yet. This
is a pre-emptive gesture that seems an unnecessary way to exclude a
class of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 22, referred to by some as the Knight Initiative
after its sponsor, Republican state Sen. William ``Pete'' Knight of
Palmdale, states that marriage is valid only between a man and a
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Same-sex marriages are not legal in California or in any state,
but the initiative's supporters say the state should preclude
having to accept marriages between gays and lesbians should they
become legal elsewhere. Same-sex marriage may have moved a step
closer in December when the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that gay
and lesbian couples should be granted the same legal protections of
marriage enjoyed by heterosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard's son Matthew, a 21-year-old student at the University
of Wyoming, died in October 1998 at the hands of two men who
testified that they beat him beyond recognition and left him tied
to a fence post in freezing weather because he was gay. They were
convicted and sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard said Thursday that the measure on California's ballot is
grounded in the same kind of hatred and discrimination that
motivated the men who killed her son. She also said it could
provide a framework for undoing domestic-partner benefits and
hospital visitation rights for gay and lesbian partners.
</P>
<P>
   A gay man speaking on behalf of the Proposition 22 campaign said
in a telephone interview Thursday that although he admires Judy
Shepard and hers was an ``unspeakable tragedy,'' she is wrong and
the measure does not promote intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a firm believer in state's rights. I believe no state
should tell California how to define marriage,'' said Tom
Beddingfield of San Jose, who is working on behalf of the measure.
``We're not precluding anything. We're closing a loophole so that
Vermont judges will have no bearing on the state of California.''
</P>
<P>
   Beddingfield, who lost a partner to suicide, said he would not
rule out supporting legal gay marriage in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think about myself. I have to think about what's best
for the state of California,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Shepard said facing reporters is her ``least favorite
thing in the world,'' she is continuing to Los Angeles Friday and
speaking at fund-raisers for the anti-Proposition 22 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard lives most of the time in Casper, Wyo., where her son
died and where she has established the Matthew Shepard Foundation,
a philanthropic and educational organization to help young people.
</P>
<P>
   She said that if her son had ever planned to marry another man,
she would have been ``the happiest mom in the world that he found
someone to share his life with. He has every right to have a love
and the right to lose that love just like everyone else.''

DAVIS AGAINST MEASURE LIMITING CAMPAIGN GIFTS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     and LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Gov. Gray Davis will announce his opposition Friday
to Proposition 25, a measure to limit campaign contributions
sharply, and he will support Proposition 26, which would lower the
approval threshold for local schools' bonds from a two-thirds to a
majority vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic governor is scheduled Friday to reveal _ by press
release _ his positions on the 21 propositions appearing on the
March ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' press office declined to comment on the governor's
positions Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 25, the campaign finance measure Davis opposes,
would put a severe  &LR; crimp in his prodigious fund raising, much of
which comes from businesses and other special interest groups in
amounts far exceeding the limits that would be imposed by the
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   The proposition provides for public financing of campaign media
advertisements for candidates adopting voluntary spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   Contribution limits would be set at $5,000 for statewide
candidates, $3,000 for other candidates, $25,000 for political
parties and $50,000 total per election.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate contributions would be banned under the initiative,
and fund raising could take place only 12 months before the primary
election and 90 days after the election.
</P>
<P>
   California Common Cause endorses the measure. The California
Chamber of Commerce opposes it, saying public money should not be
used to finance campaigns. Labor unions also oppose it because it
reduces the financial clout they wield in elections.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 26, the school bond initiative, would make it easier
for local school districts to pass bonds for construction and
modernization of school facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' GOP predecessor, Gov. Pete Wilson, backed the idea of
lowering the approval level from a two-thirds to a majority vote.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is expected to oppose Proposition 28, which would repeal
the 50-cent-a-pack tax on cigarettes approved by voters in November
1998. He backed Proposition 10, the initiative that imposed the
tax.
</P>
<P>
   He also will urge a ``yes'' vote on Propositions 30 and 31,
referendums on two bills that expand attorneys' ability to sue
insurance companies. The insurance industry has budgeted $50
million to urge voters to vote ``no'' on the propositions, thus
nullifying the bills that Davis signed into law.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has said earlier that he favors Proposition 1A, which
expands gambling on Indian lands, and Propositions 12 through 16,
bond measures to build parks, water projects, libraries, veteran's
homes and crime labs.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time Davis has publicly taken a position on
Proposition 22, whose opponents say is aimed at banning California
from accepting same sex marriages, even when they occur in other
states.
</P>
<P>
   In a December interview, Davis re-emphasized his opposition to
same-sex marriage, but at the same time highlighted his signing of
several bills strengthening the state's domestic partner laws.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is not alone in opposing Proposition 22.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic presidential candidates Al Gore and Bill Bradley,
have both announced their opposition to Proposition 22. Bradley
described the initiative as ``divisive.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Davis, though, they both say they do not support same-sex
marriage. Davis is the chair of Gore's California campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Both of California's U.S. Senators -- Dianne Feinstein and
Barbara Boxer -- are opposed to the proposition, as are 12 members
of the state's Democratic Congressional delegation.

TUOMAINEN HAS SCORING TOUCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ Marko Tuomainen _ goal scorer?
</P>
<P>
   Few on the third line ever get called goal scorers, but
Tuomainen has two in the past three games, including one in the
Kings' 6-2 victory Thursday night over the Nashville Predators.
</P>
<P>
   Tuomainen now has eight goals, which puts him among the league
leaders for rookies. He also had one Sunday in the Kings' victory
over Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the third line we know our job is to stop the other team's
best players,'' Tuomainen said. ``But we were all goal scorers
once, and it's not something you forget. We know our jobs, but it's
nice when you get the chance to do it once in a while''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Predators, Tuomainen scored the Kings' fourth goal
with 54 seconds left in the first period that put the game out of
reach. It came 16 seconds after Luc Robitaille gave the Kings a 3-1
lead and just minutes after goaltender Stephane Fiset stopped a
breakaway by Nashville's Greg Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The momentum really shifted right there,'' Robitaille said.
``Instead of a possible tie game, we had good lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he's only a rookie at age 27, Tuomainen played the past
two seasons in his native Finland. He came out of college as a goal
scorer and was pictured that way when Edmonton drafted him in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   With Hamilton, Ontario of the American Hockey League, Tuomainen
scored 31 goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in Finland, we had a very skilled team,'' Tuomainen
said. ``That's where I started playing the more defensive game.''
</P>
<P>
   The proof was in the penalty minutes. He had 20 his first year
in Finland. Last season, he had 173. That was the reason the Kings
signed him as a free agent last June.
</P>
<P>
   He has been slowed recently by a sore left foot but hasn't
missed any playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pleased with how he has grown as a player,'' coach
Andy Murray said. ``I would say the biggest change in him is his
grit. We needed someone to step in against the other team's skill
players. That isn't always easy to do when you've been a scorer
your whole life. But that's why he's in the league.
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick whistle: The Kings were scheduled to remain in
Nashville overnight and fly to Toronto this morning. General
manager Dave Taylor is joining the team in Toronto then heading
onto Calgary for an amateur tournament.

UNRESTRAINED CLINTON EMERGES IN HIS LAST STATE OF THE
UNION  ADDRESS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ America saw the real Bill Clinton Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Free from economic limits, re-election concerns or fresh
scandals, the president offered an unrestrained agenda the nation
hasn't seen since his first days in office.
</P>
<P>
   Facing his final year as president, Clinton returned with vigor
to the activist roots that are his hallmark, and he made it plain
that he no longer believes that the ``era of big government is
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called for nothing less than the end of child poverty,
universal health care, the reversal of global warming and making
the United States the safest country on earth.
</P>
<P>
   He offered assistance to farmers, students, immigrants, parents,
teachers and renters.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed the largest increase in Head Start in the program's
history and the largest expansion of Medicare since its inception
in 1965, and he advocated doubling the money spent on schools in
poor neighborhoods. Congress, he demanded, should raise the minimum
wage, reform campaign finance laws, pass a patient's bill of rights
and approve new restrictions on guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our moment,'' Clinton said at the conclusion of his
89-minute speech, the longest State of the Union Address of his
presidency and one in which some Republicans figured he spent about
$4 billion a minute.
</P>
<P>
   This was a Clinton not seen since 1993, when as a newly
inaugurated president he declared that: ``There is so much good, so
much possibility, so much excitement in this country now, that if
we act boldly and honestly, as leaders should, our legacy will be
one of prosperity and progress.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the year Clinton proposed a plan for universal health
care, a $30 billion jobs program, and 100,000 new police officers
(of which only the latter became law.)
</P>
<P>
   The following year Clinton lurched to the right after
Republicans took control of Congress. Suddenly he supported a
balanced budget, tax cuts and a stronger defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know big government does not have all the answers,'' he
told Congress in 1996, the year he faced re-election.
</P>
<P>
   No such concessions were offered Thursday night, though Clinton
did display a pragmatism learned through years of legislative
setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not not reach (these goals) all this year. Not even in
this decade,'' Clinton said. ``But we will reach them.''
</P>
<P>
   His exhuberance over the nation's potential was evident in the
first 11 words of his speech: ``We are fortunate to be alive at
this moment in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Clinton is responsible for the good times is a matter of
partisan debate. Regardless, he has been blessed with a booming
economy that allows him to simultaneously propose enormous spending
programs, tax cuts and the elimination of the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fellow Americans,'' he said. ``the state of our union is
the strongest it has ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   State of the Union addresses are always a combination of policy,
pomp and pageant. In the Clinton years, they have also been
peculiar.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Clinton addressed House members who had just impeached
him. The year before, the speech came six days after the first
reports of his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. One year
before that, the speech coincided with a jury's verdict in the
civil trial of O.J. Simpson, prompting some television networks to
run split screens showing each news event.
</P>
<P>
   This year Clinton had the spotlight mostly to himself, though
much of Washington's political establishment was in New Hampshire
consumed with next Tuesday's primary.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, no doubt mindful that the best way for his agenda to
come to fruition to to see his own vice president elected, referred
to Al Gore six times. President Dwight Eisenhower did not mention
Vice President Richard Nixon in his final State of the Union
address, nor did President Ronald Reagan mention Vice President
George Bush in his.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Clinton used words nearly identical to those
frequently used by Gore to explain why his health care plan is
superior to the more comprehensive plan advanced by rival, Bill
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson of our history, and the lesson of the last seven
years,'' Clinton said, ``is that great goals are reached step by
step, building on our progress, always gaining ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech embraced countless liberal solutions to social
problems. Still, Clinton clung tightly to the centrist vision that
has made him a political force to be reckoned with for the past
seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The president described his shifting political approaches as
part of a ``roadmap'' formulated back in 1992, one that has led the
nation to unparalleled opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``America,'' Clinton said, ``again has the confidence to dream
big dreams.'' &QL;

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATLANTA _ A year ago, Bob McNair came to the Super Bowl hat in
hand, a giant plastic stadium model in tow, selling himself to
anybody who deigned to stop and chat. Because he was on the outside
looking in, he had to work every room he entered, whether it was
filled with media types or NFL owners.
</P>
<P>
   McNair's unyielding efforts to bring pro football back to
Houston had thus far gone unrewarded. The league's 32nd franchise
was still Los Angeles' to lose. But Bob never lost the faith. If
there was going to be expansion, and, yes, that was still a
disturbing if, he knew his package was the better one by far.
Eventually, his would-be partners had to figure this out.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, they did.
</P>
<P>
   So McNair returns to this Super Bowl in a triumphant, expansive
mood as an insider now, and probably the most popular member of his
new fraternity. He and his wife, Janice, attended an owners party
at the home of the Falcons' Taylor Smith on Thursday night in what
amounted to his formal coming out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell me everybody will be nice to me until we're actually
up and running,'' McNair said, ``and we start trying to sign some
of the other teams' good players.''
</P>
<P>
   Or coaches. Since the Titans' Jeff Fisher doesn't yet have a
deal done for an extension beyond the 2000 season, speculation has
surfaced that McNair may be casting covetous glances toward him. He
politely declined any comment, however, lest a fine for tampering
be added to his whopping franchise fee. McNair arrived in Atlanta,
oddly enough not long after Bud Adams, Fisher's boss and the
individual most responsible for McNair's gaining entree into the
NFL's tight little circle _ he abandoned the Houston market to Bob,
didn't he? _ had held a rambling, gaffe-filled news conference at
the headquarters hotel downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Check's in the mail
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say the, uh, personal style of these two men could
not be more contrasting. Suffice it also to say Houston got the
better end of the deal, save for the fact that Bud's Titans, in the
franchise's 40th year, are only four quarters from a world
championship on Tennessee's behalf, whereas Bob is 2{ years from
having a team on the field.
</P>
<P>
   But progress is being made daily toward that end. Some $50
million in permanent seat licenses have been sold, he has cash in
hand or commitments for 60 of the 154 luxury suites, a general
manager in the person of Charley Casserly is on board, and a
scouting staff is being assembled as we speak. McNair doesn't have
to pinch himself to see if his dream has come true anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not considering that, just recently, he wrote his
first check _ for $150 million _ to the NFL toward the $700 million
total.
</P>
<P>
   ``That got my attention,'' he said, ``even though I knew it was
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of his visit to Atlanta is more than to see and be
seen, or to root the Titans on to victory. And, yes, he will be
pulling hard for them because of their Houston history, never mind
that he has a namesake at quarterback. Foremost on the agenda will
be meetings with NFL Properties to pare down the list of possible
names for the team _ Wildcatters appears to be coming on strong, as
does Apollos _ and a color scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Also, roughly 200 potential partners and suite purchasers are
flying in Friday, at McNair's expense, for a weekend of his
hospitality, a pleasure package that includes those most-prized
game tickets. Regarding same, unfortunately, Bob remains a
second-class citizen. Established franchises receive 700 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got all I could get,'' he said. ``Last year I had a hard
time coming up with 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Super hopes for Houston
</P>
<P>
   McNair expressed concern about a snowy cold front drifting our
way for fear that his guests could be delayed, but he also agreed
with the notion that the worse the weather gets, the less likely
Atlanta will be to retain its place in future Super Bowl rotations.
Good for Houston, to be sure. There will be some discussion of our
2004 bid, although it is unlikely to be finalized before the owners
meetings in March.
</P>
<P>
   By then, if not sooner, McNair also expects to have his
ownership group in place. He intends to have ``no more than 10 to
12 limited partners,'' although the NFL allows up to 25, and his
personal share of the team will stay at a minimum of 51 percent. He
will entertain interest at any level down to only 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Only being a relative term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, we'll be capitalized at around $800 million,''
McNair said, ``so 1 percent would be $8 million. That's a lot of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the dollar figures are staggering. Bud himself marveled
at what it will cost to replace him in Houston, admitting there is
no way he could afford to do what McNair has done. But Adams did
say he intended to help in a small way, by purchasing season
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my knowledge,'' McNair said, ``we haven't heard from Bud
yet. But we'll certainly be glad to accommodate him.''

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ For the first time in his 40 years as an owner, Bud Adams
had a news conference at the Super Bowl.
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Tennessee Titans defeat the St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl
XXXIV on Sunday, commissioner Paul Tagliabue will present Adams
with the Lombardi Trophy that goes to the NFL champion.
</P>
<P>
   Adams receiving the Lombardi Trophy would be a bittersweet
experience for NFL fans in Houston. Bitter because it would mean
that Adams won his first Super Bowl after moving his team from
Houston to Nashville. But sweet because many fans are pulling for
the team that used to be known as the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not the Oilers anymore, but I want to say this _ we had
great support in Houston,'' Adams said Thursday. ``I can't say
enough good things about Houston. It's a good football town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to see Houston get another team. Bob McNair's paying
a lot of money ($700 million) for that franchise. I know I couldn't
afford that kind of money.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 30-minute news conference that was enlightening and
entertaining, Adams touched on numerous subjects, ranging from his
appreciation for the fans in Houston to his dislike for the
marketing tactics of Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones to an
imminent contract extension for coach Jeff Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans are playing in their first Super Bowl, and their fans
have become famous around the league for their fervent support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of our fans in Tennessee, but I'm especially proud
of the Houston fans who are still supporting us,'' Adams said.
``We've got a lot of people from Houston coming to the Super Bowl,
and that doesn't surprise me.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams used last week's Chronicle poll to show reporters from
around the world that the Titans have strong support in Houston. He
pointed out that almost 15,000 votes were cast in the poll and that
66 percent wanted the Titans to reach the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to leave Houston, but I couldn't get a new
stadium built,'' Adams said. ``We were leasing from a baseball guy
(Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr.), and we needed a larger cut of
things like parking and concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute we moved, they were ready to build a new stadium at
any cost. If we were still in Houston, I'd probably still be
fighting for the new stadium. I can't complain about the support we
got in Houston. But we needed a new stadium. I think that's been
proved because the baseball guy's getting a new stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams, who arrived at Super Bowl XXXIV on Thursday, insisted
that he would try to do the ``Cherokee Hop'' victory dance if the
Titans beat the Rams, and he pointed to the good-luck tie that he
continues to wear because he is superstitious.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I do that dance, I might not be able to get up for a
week,'' he said. ``It involves bending and using one leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for my tie, I got some steak juice on it at Ruth's Chris.
It's got some spots on it, but I don't think you can see them very
well because I've got someone trying to get them out. I'm waiting
to (beat the Rams) before I get it cleaned.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams never hesitates to accuse former Houston Mayor Bob Lanier
when explaining why he moved the franchise to Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1993, Mayor Lanier asked how much money I'd put in a new
stadium, and I told him $50 million,'' Adams said. ``He later told
me that I needed to put in more, so I went to $85 million, but we
couldn't get it done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sued the city and county in federal court. Houston hired an
attorney, John O'Quinn. You know what he's famous for _ he's the
boob-job expert.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Quinn has represented numerous plaintiffs in breast-implant
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said when the Oilers failed to get any help from Lanier on
building a downtown domed stadium, he had to take drastic measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called the Nashville mayor (Phil Bredesen),'' he said. ``I
said, `Mayor, this is Bud Adams. If you'll build me a stadium, I'll
move my team.' He said, `This isn't Bud Adams. I'd appreciate it if
you didn't make any more prank calls.'
</P>
<P>
   ``A few minutes later, he called back and said, `Bud, I didn't
know it was you. Sure, I'd like to talk.' I needed a new stadium to
keep up with the Joneses.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he thinks about Jones, Adams said, ``Jerry knows
more about football than most owners, and he's been very
successful. But I don't like ambush marketing like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all partners in this thing. We have to do it on the same
wavelength. There's a trust that's built up. We share revenue, and
that's one reason we're so much better off than the other
leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Adams was asked a question that would have made Houston
fans nod in disbelief: Is Adams a pariah in Houston?
</P>
<P>
   ``The press treats me like that,'' he said, ``but the fans
aren't like that. I've still got a lot of friends in Houston. When
I walk around town, people say, `Hi, Bud.'''

CURRY WATCHES CSUN WOMEN LOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Edniesha Curry mystery deepened Thursday night
as the Cal State Northridge guard who quit Monday for ``personal
reasons'' appeared at Northridge to watch her former team lose a
key Big Sky game to Weber State.
</P>
<P>
   Curry declined to elaborate. However, sources close to the team
said coach Frozena Jerro has had disagreements with a couple of
players that might explain Curry's departure. Jerro, too, declined
to answer specific questions over the controversy, which seriously
wound CSUN's chances of returning to the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Curry, dressed in blue overalls over a blue T-shirt, did not say
whether she would or could return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to watch my team win and stay in first place,''
said Curry, who is the Matadors' best player.
</P>
<P>
   Neither happened. Weber State won 61-59, and Montana took over
first place by beating Portland State.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge (12-6, 6-2) might have been able to beat Sacramento
State with just nine players and no Curry, but this was Weber State
(6-11, 4-3)which beat Montana earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge dug itself too big of a first-half hole, shooting 29
percent from the field and scoring a season-low 17 points. Weber
State went ona 15-1 run over the last 8:06 to lead 31-17 at the
half.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors trailed 45-27 with 14:37 to play before going on a
30-8 run over 10 minutes. Daphne Verrept's 3-pointer with 5:08 to
play put CSUN ahead 48-47.
</P>
<P>
   But along the way, post players Keisha Harris and Lynda Amari
fouled out, and the Wildcats battled back, tying the score at 59-59
with 27.8 seconds on two free throws by Stephanie Stanger. Then
Neda Milic committeda behind-the-back foul with 8.2 seconds to
play, and Meghan Geddes (a game-high 16 points) made both free
throws. Milic's game-tying shot at thebuzzer was an airball.
</P>
<P>
   Amari, with 14 points, was the only Matador in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   Curry didn't come to Wednesday's win over Sacramento State. Her
appearance, along with that of Jamilah Jones, who took a strange
midseason ``leave of absence'' this week, was welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good they came to show for their teammates,'' Jerro
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it didn't stop those teammates from being confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personal problems isn't understandable to me,'' Milic said.
``Eddy'sa great emotional leader, and I played with Eddy ever since
I came to Northridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Milic said she has spoken with Curry, and Curry told her she's
reluctant to return.
</P>
<P>
   Jones sat two rows behind the bench with her father, Tony.
Jamilah Jones, dressed in a gray t-shirt and bluejeans, said her
absence was because her step-grandfather had been hospitalized. But
since he was out of intensive care, she came to the game.
</P>
<P>
   That failed to explain why she was out of uniform and
unavailable to play. Said Jerro, ``I don't know. I didn't think
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said she will return to the team as early as Monday.
Northridge's next game is Thursday at Idaho State.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge had better settle its differences if it's to repeat
its postseason success of a year ago. Out of first place,the
Matadors now play on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to stop hurting ourselves,'' Jerro said. ``We can
came outand beat teams. We're not going to change things, but we
cannot give people help.''

 IF COWS CAN FLY, WHY NOT DI?  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ We don't need no stinking bridges.
</P>
<P>
   The man who is bulldozing the Milk Farm cow is rendering our
bridges obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Milk Farm is the abandoned roadside restaurant along I-80 in
Dixon, Calif., a landmark because of its looming neon sign of a cow
jumping over the moon.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant and sign are being torn down to make way for a
factory. The man who owns the property is an inventor who hopes to
build flying commuter sky cars on the site where the cow once flew.
</P>
<P>
   So why bother to fix the dilapidated Bay Bridge, or to build
Sen. Feinstein's proposed southern crossing, the Dianne Span, when
the future of local transportation is up in the air?
</P>
<P>
   But progress has its pitfalls. If you think commuting is a bear
now, imagine how it will be when the skies are aswarm with half a
million people late for work, spilling coffee in their laps, cell
phoning, e-trading and flipping one another off as they all fight
for landing space.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, you, get offa my cloud.
</P>
<P>
   Another horrifying thought: Flying Muni buses.
</P>
<P>
   TAKE THE COW, says the owner of Milk Farm to a woman who is
protesting the demise of the diner and its sign.
</P>
<P>
   And so, soon we'll have another homeless cultural symbol of the
golden age of silly roadside ad art.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Maxwell says we should establish an old icons home, maybe
a grove somewhere in Golden Gate Park. It would be a serene,
contemplative glade where the Doggie Diner head, the Milk Farm cow
and other beloved cultural remnants can provide inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Playland's Laughing Sal is stored away somewhere, so there's
three objects to kick off the project.
</P>
<P>
   And when the sky car replaces the ground car, the grove could
become the new home of the Golden Gate Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   THE MAN with the tan, George Hamilton, is  &UR; not  &LR; living with
Danielle Steel in her S.F. manse. Where did you read such
mis-scooped poop? In this column? Oh.
</P>
<P>
   My apologies. Guess it's time to get the old rumor mill
overhauled.
</P>
<P>
   THE STARS will be shining over Brisbane tomorrow night, and no,
Brisbaners aren't trying to beat Macy's to the punch in decorating
for the 2000 Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
   The hundreds of rooftop holiday stars that the folks of Brisbane
light every December will be visible, just West of 101 and just
south of Candlestick.
</P>
<P>
   The stars will twinkle in honor of Frank Walch, who, for more
than 60 years, constructed the wooden stars in his garage and gave
'em away. Frank died last Friday at age 89.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our starmaker is gone,'' sighs a Brisbaner, ``but his memory
twinkles on.''
</P>
<P>
   IF THE DOGGIE Diner head must come down, we've got contingency
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plop it on Val Diamond's head as Beach Blanket Babylon's
ultimate milliner's statement,'' suggests Michael Hom.
</P>
<P>
   And Brian Rogers says, ``Hollow it out, put a vacancy sign on it
and rent it out for $2,000 a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Or put it above the Fog City Diner and change the restaurant's
name to The Foggy Doggy.
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE AGASSI, if he wins the Australian Open, and he's one match
away, becomes the greatest slacker-to-superstar comeback story in
recent sports memory.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of athletes make courageous comebacks from injuries, but
Andre dropped off the tennis map because he was fat, lazy and
unfocused. Then he hooked up with Brad Gilbert, Bay Area tennis
star-turned-guru, and they've been unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   MARKETING YIN/YANG: Worst new marketing concept: Saturation
signage. The Montgomery St. BART station has been taken hostage by
a dot-com company that bought up all the ad space, including
pillars, and has done everything but rubber-stamp the company name
on the forehead of every rider passing through the station. The
effect is hypnotizing, dizzying ... and boring.
</P>
<P>
   Best new marketing concept: The new Coors football bottle, with
the simulated-pigskin-pebble surface.
</P>
<P>
   BOFA'S ``ADOPT-AN-ATM'' program was a failure, because the
concept of working overtime for free didn't catch on, for some
reason.
</P>
<P>
   Now it will be interesting to see how BofA's new
``orphan-an-ATM'' program works out. Will the ATMs turn to
panhandling, the computers hitting up card users with messages
like, ``Spare change for Windex?''

IRON MAN BRUCE MATTHEWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; ATLANTA _ There are a lot of unique things about Bruce
Matthews, foremost of which is his 6-foot-5, 305- pound frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are always coming up to me and saying, `Did you play
football?' '' relates the Tennessee Titans guard, who has played in
264 regular-season games, an NFL record for offensive linemen. ``I
say, `Yeah, did a little playing in high school.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But more than size sets Matthews apart.
</P>
<P>
   As far as he knows, he's the only player in the history of the
NFL who was a college teammate of his head coach, Jeff Fisher, and
a pro teammate with his line coach, Mike Munchak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get kidded about that all the time,'' said Matthews. ``Young
guys on the team come up to me and say, `You actually played with
coach at USC?' `Yeah,' I tell them. They just can't believe it.
What's the big deal? I was a freshman and he was a senior.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there's that other slight oddity about Bruce
Matthews: He just happens to be a 38-year-old man who's never
missed an NFL game because of an injury in a physically damaging
sport usually unwelcoming to those who have celebrated so many
birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Warner might be the rags-to-riches story of Sunday's Super
Bowl between the St. Louis Rams and Titans. And the 40-year-old
punter, Mike Horan, might be the most unlikely participant because
as recently as early November he was nothing more than a loan
officer at a mortgage company in Colorado before being rescued from
such a plight by the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   But the one player who might be defying the lengthiest odds, if
not defying medical science, to be performing in Super Bowl XXXIV
is Bruce Matthews, the 1979 Arcadia High graduate and former
Trojans All-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around here, Bruce is like Father Time, but he's still a kid
at heart,'' said Titans star running back, Eddie George,
beneficiary of Matthews' stout blocking. ``He still has that
youthful spirit. Some guys are serious and they have that love for
the game. Bruce can be serious or funny.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, Matthews has been mixing it up with some of the
strongest, toughest and meanest men in America _ NFL defensive
linemen and linebackers _ for 17 seasons without displaying even
the faintest hint of slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bruce will walk away from the game when he wants to
walk away,'' said Jeff Fisher, the Titans coach. ``As long as he's
healthy and able to play on the grass and able to win and enjoys
playing, he can play as long as he wants. I do know people ask me
if I think I'll see anyone like him again. The answer to that is
no.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Matthews is set to participate in another Pro Bowl _
his 12th straight _ after concluding business against the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``God just blessed me with a great body, as He did with Clay,''
said Matthews, referring to his older brother, who was a linebacker
19 seasons with the Cleveland Browns and Atlanta Falcons. ``I've
just been very fortunate. I've tweaked the knee a few times, but
it's never kept me out of a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Married with four sons and a daughter, Matthews lives in Texas,
where the Titans once performed as the Houston Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The low point of my career came in 1995, about a week after I
had re-signed with the team in August,'' Matthews said. ``We went
to Knoxville to play an exhibition game against the Washington
Redskins, and our team announced that they were moving to
Tennessee. That was pretty hard to take. I loved Houston and didn't
want to leave. But I guess things have worked out for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews doesn't understand the reason so many people make such
an issue about his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first 10 or 12 years I was in the league, no one said
a thing about how old I was,'' he said. ``Then all of a sudden guys
started retiring and people started coming up to me and saying
things like, `Wow, you've been in the league for 13 years now.' And
I'd say, `Yeah, so what?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And suddenly now everyone who interviews me wants to talk
about my age. Honestly, I don't feel any different now than when I
came into the league. Oh, I don't recover as quickly from games as
I once did. My recuperative powers have definitely declined. But,
as far as my ability to do my job, I don't think I have declined at
all.''

 CLINTON'S ADDRESS A CALL TO `REVOLUTION'  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his final State of the Union address, President
Clinton called Thursday night for a ``21st century American
revolution'' that would end child poverty, provide affordable
health care to all, eliminate the national debt and reverse global
warming.
</P>
<P>
   Standing above the assembled House and Senate, the president
urged the nation to seize the opportunities of an economic boom to
embark on a raft of new programs, or ``investments,'' targeted at
the middle and lower income classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before have we had such a blessed opportunity _ and
therefore, such a profound obligation _ to build the more perfect
union of our founders' dreams,'' he declared. ``These are great
goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sought to emblazon his presidential legacy with the
glowing statistics of what, at the end of February, will be the
longest expansion in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have built a new economy,'' Clinton boasted. ``We will
begin the new century with over 20 million new jobs, the fastest
economic growth in more than 30 years, the lowest unemployment
rates in 30 years, the lowest poverty rates in 20 years, the lowest
African-American and Hispanic unemployment rates on record, the
first back-to-back budget surpluses in 42 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's last State of the Union speech proved to be his
longest, packed with 87 policy prescriptions, both sweeping and
small, rattled off at the rate of nearly one a minute over nearly
an hour and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Following a familiar pattern, Clinton pointed often to citizens
in the galleries to emphasize his various themes, from Robert
Knowling, Jr., chief executive officer of Covad Communications in
Santa Clara, who works to bring more minorities to the high tech
workforce, to Tom Mauser, the father of a teenager killed in the
shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Six times, Clinton referred to the man seated behind him _ Vice
President Al Gore. Many of Clinton's proposals, such as a popular
new prescription drug benefit for Medicare and efforts to bridge
the ``digital divide,'' mirror planks in Gore's presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The president credited Gore for suggesting a 10-year, $110
billion expansion of government health coverage to the parents of
certain children enrolled in state Medicaid programs, and credited
the vice president's wife, Tipper, for leading efforts to improve
mental health programs.
</P>
<P>
   And mouthing the words, ``I love you'' to his wife Hillary, now
a candidate for Senate in New York, Clinton thanked the First lady
working ``tirelessly'' on behalf of children.
</P>
<P>
   With the economic expansion flooding the federal treasury with
surplus tax revenue _ $1.9 trillion over the next decade under the
rosiest projections _ Clinton proposed $350 billion in tax cuts
over the next 10 years, including matching dollar-for-dollar the
savings of low income earners.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cuts, which would be offset by $100 billion in tax
increases achieved by closing certain shelters, also include
marriage penalty relief, long a major goal of congressional
Republicans, and up to $2,800 in annual tax deductions per family
for college tuition at a cost of $30 billion over ten years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton outlined a huge expansion of health care programs,
including: a new prescription drug benefit for Medicare, estimated
to cost as much as $165 billion over a decade; buttressing Medicare
finances by $400 billion over 10 years; allowing people age 55 to
buy into Medicare; tax breaks for providers of long-term care; and
a new ``patients bill of rights'' for consumers in health
maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taken together, these proposals would mark the largest
investment in health care in the 35 years since the creation of
Medicare,'' Clinton boasted.
</P>
<P>
   The president called for a host of other programs targetting the
poor, including another major expansion of the Earned Income Tax
Credit, an increase in the minimum wage, now at $5.15 an hour, and
a $1 billion expansion of Head Start, a program for poor
preschoolers, potentially the largest increase in the program's
history.
</P>
<P>
   The president also proposed that states require licenses for all
handgun purchases, including a photo ID, a background check and a
gun safety requirement, and again praised Gore for ``facing down
the gun lobby'' in an earlier tie-breaking vote on gun limitations.
</P>
<P>
   He urged more help for farmers, a ``New Markets'' initiative for
businesses who invest in poor communities, and a permanent
conservation fund to ``save natural treasures from California
redwoods to the Everglades.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton challenged fellow Democrats on the contentious issue of
trade. While the nation must ``never tolerate abusive child labor
or a race to the bottom on the environment and worker protection,''
Clinton said, he insisted that ``open markets and rules-based trade
are the best engines we know for raising living standards, reducing
global poverty adn environmental destruction, and assuring the free
flow of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   The president took special pains to emphasize the political
shift of the Democratic party, declaring, ``We restored the vital
center, replacing outdated ideologies with a new vision anchored in
basic, enduring values: opportunity for all, responsibility from
all, and a community of all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   And while he had twice vetoed the Republican welfare overhaul
before finally signing it, producing a deep rift in his cabinet,
Clinton declared that his administration had ``ended welfare as we
knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's chances could be slim for getting many of these
initiatives through a sharply divided congress that has 435 members
of the House and a third of the Senate up for election themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Clinton posted only a 37 percent legislative success
rate, the second lowest in 50 years, according to an analysis by
the periodical Congressional Quarterly. The only worse score came
in 1995, when Clinton faced a freshly installed Republican
congressional majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one took at face value all of the president's suggested new
spending, it would more than eclipse his opening proposal to pay
down the national debt in short order and save Social Security and
Medicare,'' said Rep. Chris Cox, a House GOP leader from Newport
Beach. ``The president is fully aware that congress will have to
make choices ... and he can count on this congress to be fiscally
responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Republicans will come under pressure to accommodate the
more popular Clinton proposals. Already, they have begun to embrace
a prescription drug benefit for Medicare and new protections for
HMO patients.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were thrilled with the speech, which offered a roadmap
for their congressional agenda and wind in their sails for the
November election.
</P>
<P>
   `'I thought it was a great speech,'' said Rep. Nancy Pelosi,
D-San Francisco. ``I thought it would be a visionary speech for the
new millennium, and I think it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Walnut Creek, Calif., Democrat Ellen Tauscher said Clinton is
``obviously a very engaged, very vibrant president with a big
agenda for his last year in office that I think will be good for
the Bay Area and California.''

GRIZZLIES DEFEAT NETS, 108-106 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ For the second straight night, the
New Jersey Nets lost a game that appeared destined for overtime at
the buzzer. Michael Dickerson, who had tormented the Nets' all
night, hit a 16-foot jumper from the baseline with Lucious Harris
draped on him to give the Vancouver Grizzlies a 108-106 victory at
General Motors Place.
</P>
<P>
   The shot nullified a tremendous performance by the Nets' Stephon
Marbury, who scored 23 of his career-high 42 points in the fourth
quarter. His final basket was a 3-pointer off the glass from 27
feet away on the right wing. The shot tied the game at 106-106 and
looked to give the Nets, who trailed by 8 points with a minute and
a half left, new life.
</P>
<P>
   But with three seconds left, Dickerson took an inbounds pass
from Dennis Scott, drove to the right baseline and lofted a shot
over Harris' outstretched arms. It was eerily similar to the
3-pointer that Chuck Person made at the buzzer to give the
SuperSonics a 95-92 victory over the Nets Wednesday night in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury was formidable, driving to the basket or draining
long-range jumpers, but he could not beat Dickerson, Shareef
Abdur-Rahim, Mike Bibby and Bryant Reeves all by himself.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Nets (17-26) to 0-3 on a four-game road
trip that concludes Saturday against the Los Angeles Clippers. The
Nets have lost six of their last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury was nothing short of phenomenal, scoring his 42 points
on 14-of-23 shooting and handing out 9 assists. His dominance of
the Nets' offense was not of the early-season variety, when he
attempted to do too much. On Thursday night his high shot count was
absolutely necessary, as none of his teammates asserted themselves
offensively.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Van Horn (19 points) and Kerry Kittles (17 points)
followed Marbury, but Van Horn scored few baskets of consequence,
and Kittles scored 10 of his points in the first 2 minutes 15
seconds of the game. Kendall Gill finished with 14, 10 of which
came in the third quarter. But in the fourth, Marbury was left
alone.
</P>
<P>
   With no one player able to outdo Marbury, the Grizzlies relied
on a joint effort. Dickerson, outplaying Kittles badly, led the way
with 29 points. Abdur-Rahim added 23 points and 7 rebounds, and
Bibby recorded 11 points and 11 assists.
</P>
<P>
   The unforeseen production of Reeves, who averages just 9 points
and 5 rebounds, might have been the difference. With Jim McIlvaine
sidelined by a sore left Achilles', the Nets seemed helpless
inside, as Reeves scored 18 points and grabbed 6 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury's brilliance kept the Nets in the hunt and, almost
miraculously, gave them a chance to win. Trailing by 98-90 with a
minute and a half left, the Nets' point guard sank a 3-pointer that
started a run in which he scored 11 of the team's last 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver kept the lead by hitting free throws, but Marbury
pulled the Nets within 105-103 by hitting two free throws with 16
seconds to play. Scott made 1 of 2 free throws with 13 seconds to
play before Marbury tied it with his incredible 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, who rallied from a 58-45 halftime deficit behind 64.3
percent shooting in the third quarter, started the fourth trailing
by 6 points. But their reserves quickly closed the gap when Harris
buried a 3-pointer to pull them within 80-77. Marbury followed with
a lay-in that seemed to signify a momentum shift and a possible
Nets takeover.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott hit a 3-pointer to re-establish Vancouver's breathing
room, and soon the lead was back to 8 points.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury's heroics began in earnest in the third quarter, when he
had 11 points and 2 assists to pull the Nets within 65-62.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gill, one of the league's finest defenders, had no
defensive answer for the 6-foot-9-inch Abdur-Rahim, he answered
often on the other end to score 10 in the third period and help
Marbury give the Nets hope.
</P>
<P>
   Kittles was phenomenal at the game's outset, hitting his first
four shots in scoring the Nets' first 10 points before fading. The
performance was reminiscent of Van Horn's play just 24 hours
earlier, when he scored 12 of the Nets' first 14 points but just 2
the rest of the way in a 95-92 loss to Seattle on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Attacking Dickerson, Kittles opened the scoring with a
hard-driving 5-footer on the baseline, then followed with
consecutive 3-pointers and a layup off a backdoor cut that came
from a great feed by Marbury.
</P>
<P>
   But as Kittles sparkled, the Nets' inability to stop Vancouver
became apparent. Not only did the Grizzlies match Kittles's hot
start, they did him one better by hitting their first five
field-goal attempts.

THE SUPER BOWL ABC'S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just about everything you need to know about ABC's coverage of
Sunday's Super Bowl XXXIV but were afraid to ask because it might
invoke a vision of Georgia Frontiere during the Lombardi Trophy
presentation coming up on Mike Tirico and trying to stick her
tongue down his throat:
</P>
<P>
   __ The ratings projection: What about it?
</P>
<P>
   There's no other number that carries so much weight in the
industry but really measures nothing more than a rough estimate
based on a lousy guess by an outdated piece of social technology.
</P>
<P>
   That said (again), here's some ratings trivia to choke on:
</P>
<P>
   The highest-rated Super Bowl of all time was a 49.1 and 73
share. The teams? Then little-known San Francisco and Cincinnati,
in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   And of the 33 previous Super Bowls, the 1969 New York Jets-
Baltimore Colts magical moment is the second-lowest rated (36.0) of
all time, bottomed only by the first Super Bowl, which was split
between CBS (23.0) and NBC (17.8). As for that '69 game sparking
viewer interest in this event, the '70 game did just a 39.4/69 and
the '71 game was 39.9/75.
</P>
<P>
   No Super Bowl has been below a 40.0 rating since.
</P>
<P>
   __ Cameras: Again, why is everyone so fixated on this number? As
always, as many as unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   In raw terms, there'll be 23 stationary (including three Super
Slo-Mos), six hand-held, two remote pan-and-tilters on the field
goals, one blimp (in an indoor stadium, yes), plus seven high-
definition cameras for the HDTV telecast you'll never see.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's always the goof player who brings his
cam-corder onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   __ The game announcers: Al Michaels, Boomer Esiason . . . and
there you go.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, everyone from John Elway to Mike Ditka
to Jimmy Johnson to Steve Young to Regis Philbin have been thrown
out (usually by their agents) as possible third-men-in-the-booth
for ABC's crew.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high-profile criticism heaped upon second-year TV
analyst Esiason, two is what ABC is sticking with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about (criticism) too much,'' said Esiason, who
quarterbacked the Cincinnati Bengals to the '89 Bowl and should be
more at ease with this role than he was as co-host of the Miss
America paegent a few years back.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons I took (this job) was because of the high-
profile nature. It's like a quarterback with the criticism coming
Monday, or (in this case) on Tuesday or Saturday when Norman Chad's
articles come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Esiason also says he'll be pretty darned excited, but he knows
how to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '88, (Bengals coach) Sam Wyche did a great job keeping us
within the realm of what we were doing. He said, `Enjoy the week of
adulation, but remember once we're inside the lines, it's a
football game.' I'm trying to approach it the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, he won't have to worry too much about week-long adulation
getting in the way.
</P>
<P>
   __ TV innovations: Other than the fact this'll be the first
Super Bowl to use the imaginary yellow first-down line called ``1st
&AMP; Ten,'' plus HDTV, plus the Internet's Enhanced TV gizmo, expect
nothing more than a gloried
</P>
<P>
   Which ain't bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get too far away from the basics, then you've put
yourself in an uncomfortable situation,'' said game producer Ken
Wolfe. ``Like a team, you can't change your offense in a Super
Bowl. We're using basically what got us here. I'd be kidding if I
said this isn't more intensified, but there's a certain pressure
every Monday night to come up with this.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The pregame show: Fox heaped seven hours upon us last year.
This will be the same, except it'll be a split-up Disney synergetic
Fantasia world ESPN has a three-hour Tirico-hosted ``NFL
Countdown'' from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. before ABC's Chris Berman-hosted
four-hour shindig starts.
</P>
<P>
   ABC and ESPN folk are littered all over the telecast, from Jim
McKay to Brent Musburger, Barbara Walters and the cast of ``The
View'' to Charles Gibson and, for some reason, his point of view;
there's both Robin and Jimmy Roberts, as well as chef Emeril
Lagasse and Beano Cook for culinary needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem, if there is one with a Super Bowl, is for
the longest time the pregame show has gotten longer and longer, and
what has happened is it's less compelling by that very nature,''
said John Filippelli, vice president of production for ABC Sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``By its nature, (the pregame show) exists to set up a game
that's already set up ad nauseum. To me, the shows lack emotional
dimension. They're fine on their own terms. But they don't resonate
emotionally. So at the core of what we're doing it'll be emotional
features.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Here's your live emotion: ABC/ESPN reporter Andrea Kremer
gave birth Wednesday in Atlanta and still plans to work live Sunday
on ESPN's pre-pregame show. Interestingly, she's already taped a
story about how some Super Bowl players are taken advantage of by
their families, who try to milk them for tickets, homes, etc.
</P>
<P>
   And any feature on Dick Vermeil is sure to have emotion.
</P>
<P>
   The other planned highlights include a feature on Fritz Pollard,
the first African-American player and head coach in the NFL, with
the Akron Pros in 1921; a tribute to Walter Payton, and a piece on
Dan Marino and his wife's adoption of an abandoned Chinese girl.
</P>
<P>
   __ The lowlight: Probably Phil Collins being interviewed by
``Take A Look At Me Now'' Berman.
</P>
<P>
   __ The postgame show: Tirico hands that Lombardi off to former
ABC colleague Vermeil and runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``After doing the Bob Hope Classic last week, I watched the last
part of the NFC title game (on Fox) and saw Terry (Bradshaw)'s
interview with Georgia Frontiere,'' Tirico said with a laugh. ``You
know, it's their moment, their stage. You just try to stay out of
the way.''

the dishes in Southern California need cable or an old antenna to

DirecTV spokesman said it'll come, but there's no telling whether
that'll be in a month, a year or longer.

PHIL MATHEWS STILL INTENSE, STILL WINNING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With a touch of fright, maybe even some morbid
fascination, a group of curious Ventura Community College students
would tiptoe into the basketball gym at lunch each day and watch
the madness unfold on the gym floor.
</P>
<P>
   !netlead-end! &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was 1985, and Phil Mathews had just taken over as coach of
Ventura's sagging men's basketball program. As the students
observed Mathews during those midafternoon practices, they weren't
sure what to make of the fiery new coach. But this much was
certain: Mathews was one bad dude. Maybe even a little crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Mathews, now the head coach at the University of San Francisco,
would scowl at his players, or erupt at them with Bobby Knight-like
tirades that seemed to reverberate against the gym walls. A missed
assignment by a player resulted in face-to-face showdowns with
Mathews, who wo and scream obscenities. And pity the poor players
who weren't in the proper defensive position. That meant watching
the rest of practice alone while running lap after lap after lap
around the court.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes with tears streaming down their cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Mathews was one bad dude, all right. Maybe even a little
crazy.
</P>
<P>
   But check out these crazy numbers: Under Mathews, the Pirates
compiled a mind-boggling 298-56 record in 10 years, winning two
state championships and reaching the championship game four times.
</P>
<P>
   Mathews' Western State Conference teams at Ventura were ranked
No. 1 in California three consecutive years, and 11 players from
his 1994-95 team earned Division I scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Crazy? You bet.
</P>
<P>
   Mathews hasn't changed a bit since taking over San Francisco
five years ago. The scowl is there and so are the maniacal
outbursts on the sideline during games and the marathon practices.
</P>
<P>
   But so are the wins the Dons reached the NCAA tournament in
1997-98 for the first time since 1982. They started 1999-00 off by
winning 11 of 12, although a recent four-game skid has dampened the
spirits somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   More important, community support and season-ticket sales have
increased significantly in the Bay Area, where 16 major
professional and college teams battle for recognition. Mathews,
always charismatic and never shy with an entertaining quote, is the
main reason.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco athletic director Bill Hogan had all this in mind
when he plucked Mathews away from Ventura in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important to us that we get somebody who wasn't too
bland,'' Hogan said. ``We wanted somebody who could create some
excitement, and certainly that's part of what Phil brings.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its recent stumbles, San Francisco expects to challenge
for a postseason berth, and with wins tonight over Pepperdine and
Saturday against Loyola Marymount, the Dons would take steps in
that direction. As for Mathews, he's grown accustomed to the madman
image others have of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who don't know the program probably think I'm a raving
maniac, a lunatic who yells at his players,'' said Mathews. ``They
probably think I shouldn't talk to young guys like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to tell you verbally what I think you're doing
wrong. I'm going to be aggressive with you and let you know I'm
unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a style not suited for the faint of heart San Francisco
lost potential stars Ra'oof Sadat and Dony Wilcher the last two
years because they couldn't handle Mathews' hard-handed approach.
</P>
<P>
   The coach makes no apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am what I am,'' Mathews said. ``I'm very intense and I want
intense people around me, guys that have a thick skin, guys that I
know will go to battle. Certain guys can handle that and certain
guys can't.''
</P>
<P>
   The mentally tough players who decide to stay with it usually
thrive under Mathews. And the ones who stick it out stay loyal long
after their playing days are finished. Sometimes they even come to
understand what Mathews was trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you love the game, you know you need to put yourself in a
position to be a winner,'' said Dallas Mavericks forward Cedric
Ceballos, who played under Mathews at Ventura College. ``We kind of
overlooked the yelling and screaming and focused on his words.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing Phil does is befriend you before he coaches
you,'' Ceballos added. ``You understand how respectful he is not
only toward basketball but life. You take that away with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Mathews isn't always the lunatic he is in practice or
at games. And he never tears into a player without also building
him back up at some point.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's all that screaming that players remember most.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always the same old thing, yelling and hollering,'' said
Dons guard Ali Thomas. ``If you're going to play at USF, you've got
to know something about coach Mathews. You can't come in here and
expect it to be a cakewalk. If you have thick skin, you're all
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathews has been especially vocal lately. The Dons have stumbled
in West Coast Conference play, losing three of four games after
leading the nation with a 12-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Mathews put the Dons through a 2-hour practice on
Martin Luther King Day, starting at 6 a.m. Just to make sure they
got the message, Mathews followed that session up with another
2-hour practice in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We celebrated (Martin Luther King Day) in between,'' Mathews
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's Phil Mathews, one bad dude. Maybe even a little crazy. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-PRISONS (Paris) _ While working at La Sante prison in
Paris, Dr. Veronique Vasseur met inmates so deranged or depressed
that they had swallowed rat poison, forks or drain cleaner. Nearly
half of the France's 55,000 prisoners have never been convicted
because the law here allows investigating magistrates to put
suspects in jail indefinitely without trial or bail. Dr. Vasseur's
account of her work has caused an uproar. By Suzanne Daley.

   MULLIGAN-DAMAGE (Undated) _ A New Jersey appeals court rules
that a golfer who takes a second tee shot without warning his
partners, and then injures someone with that shot, may be sued for
his errant swing. The opinion breaks with precedent in sports
liability cases, saying that hitting a ``mulligan'' could be
considered a recklessly dangerous act. By Neil MacFarquhar.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BUSINESS DAY _ (Moved in ``f'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CONSUMER-GOODS (Undated) _ Growth companies find it hard to stay
on the fast track forever. That truism was made clear this week by
Coca-Cola and Procter &AMP; Gamble, two of the world's pre-eminent
makers of consumer goods. Both companies made moves that had one
goal: restoring the rapid growth in profits that investors once
took for granted. By Gretchen Morgenson.
</P>
<P>
   SUPERBOWL-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ Whether or not Super Bowl XXXIV
is remembered for the game that the St. Louis Rams and the
Tennessee Titans play on Sunday, it will certainly enter the annals
of advertising as Dot-Com Bowl I. But will consumers recall the
commercial assault as a dot-comedy of errors or as a turning point
for dot-coms on the road to respectability? That's the $135 million
question _ the approximate cost of all the commercials to run
during the game. By Stuart Elliott.

</P>
<P>
   OIL-NORRIS-COLUMN (Undated) _ Who you gonna believe? Me or your
lying eyes? When it comes to oil prices, that classic Richard Pryor
query ought to be the refrain of the experts, who have been in
agreement for months that oil prices will not _ no, cannot _ long
remain anywhere close to their current level. But prices keep
rising anyway. By Floyd Norris.
</P>

New England, where he will become the Patriots' general manager and

</P>
<P>
   FBN-RHODEN-COLUMN (Atlanta) _ Sports of The Times column on
Trent Green, who was ticketed to be the St. Louis Rams' starting
quarterback this season, but was hurt in an exhibition game and saw
unknown Kurt Warner take his place and end up as the league's most
valuable player. By William C. Rhoden.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-SUPER-TEAMS (Atlanta) _ Both teams vying for the National
Football League championship, the Tennessee Titans and St. Louis
Rams, have relocated three times, leaving rankled fans and civic

   &UR; WEEKEND (Moved in ``e'' category) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOREAN-CERAMICS (New York) _ ``Korean ceramics from the Museum
of Oriental Ceramics, Osaka'' is not, as Yogi Berra might have
said, a case of deja vu all over again. More than 35 of the nearly
50 pieces in this serenely beautiful show were part of a larger
exhibition of ceramics from the same museum that traveled to
Chicago, San Francisco and the Met in 1992. But it scarcely
matters. The recidivists, like the first-timers, constitute the
masterworks of the Osaka museum's extensive Korean holdings. By
Roberta Smith.
</P>
<P>
   APPLES-MINNEAPOLIS (Minneapolis, Minn.) _ Snow paralyzes some
American cities and disheartens others. But Minneapolis and its
unidentical twin, St. Paul, cope with it. More than that; many
people here positively revel in it. Winter is their favorite
season. Our peripatetic correspondent R.W. Apple Jr. reports from
the Twin Cities.

</P>
<P>
   BACH-ANNIVERSARY (Undated) _ The last Bach year wasn't so long
ago: 1985, to be exact, the 300th anniversary of the composer's
birth. And although Bach had to share the celebration with other
masters born in the fateful, fertile year 1685, Handel and
Scarlatti, he did not lack for attention. Now, in the calculus of
births and deaths, centenaries and quarter-millenniums, and points
in between, comes another Bach year: the 250th anniversary of the
composer's death. Not complaining, mind you. In addition to the
commercial aspects _ books, records and scores; concerts, recitals
and festivals _ and the odd bit of flimflammery, such
commemorations typically give a jolt to scholarship on the subject
as well as a boost in public awareness. By James Oestreich.

USC CAN'T DUCK DEFEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ USC's charmed existence in nail-biters finally
came to an end in the biting cold of McArthur Court on Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   With the temperatures in the low 30's outside, and a cool draft
inside, the Trojans finally suffered their first loss of the
Pacific-10 Conference season as Oregon hung on for a 68-67 victory.
</P>
<P>
   But not before USC nearly pulled off another unlikely victory.
Forward Brian Scalabrine blocked forward A.D. Smith's shot with 34
seconds left to give the Trojans a chance for victory. Scalabrine
then missed a 13-foot jumper with 11.4 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   However, Oregon's Darius Wright missed a free-throw with 8.6
seconds remaining, and USC had one final chance. Brandon Granville
drove in the lane and had an open shot, but his pass for David
Bluthenthal under the basket was broken up and time expired.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans' real undoing was free-throw shooting. They missed
five of seven in one stretch in the final six minutes.
</P>
<P>
   USC (12-6, 5-1) seemed to wear down in the game's final minutes
as coach Henry Bibby relied primarily on five players. The Trojans
led 61-59 on a tip-in by Bluthenthal with 7:49 left, but Oregon
(14-3, 5-1) then went on a 7-0 run to open a 66-61 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But just when the Trojans appeared to falter, they came back as
Bluthenthal scored a layup and made two free throws to bring USC
back within one point (66-65) with 2:21 left.
</P>
<P>
   It was a close game from the outset. The score was tied seven
times in the first half and neither team led by more than Oregon's
four-point halftime margin (40-36).
</P>
<P>
   Nothing changed in the first five minutes of the second half, as
the Trojans erased the deficit and were tied 48-48 with 14:29 left.
</P>
<P>
   USC got an unlikely first-half boost from freshman guard Nate
Hair, who had seven points in the opening 20 minutes, just two
below his career high.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't been afraid to shoot and we don't want him to be,''
Bibby said. ``We will give him a lot of chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Hair made three of four shots in the first half. He was inserted
into the starting lineup in the second and hit a 3-pointer on his
first shot to break his career high with 15:56 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   He followed up with another 3-pointer that gave the Trojans a
55-52 lead with 11:56 left. That gave him 13 points, or 10 more
than the entire USC bench scored against Arizona. He finished with
13.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were balanced early as Scalabrine led USC in the
first half with 10 points, while Trepagnier added nine. Alex Scales
led the Ducks with 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   USC shot 52 percent in the first half and Oregon 54.8.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby did not substitute as much as he did in last week's upset
of Arizona. Hair replaced center Kostas Charissis six minutes into
the contest, and junior Rashad Jones replaced Granville for just 29
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans dressed just 10 players for the game, with Bibby
electing not to bring additional walk-ons to replace the injured
Sam Clancy and Jarvis Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps mindful of fatigue, Bibby employed an unusual strategy
of having all four USC players retreat to the Oregon basket
whenever a Trojan was shooting free throws.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: With USC entering the game in first place, the Trojans
were the first team other than Arizona, Stanford or UCLA to
maintain sole possession of first place at any point during the
Pac-10 season since Oregon State in 1991. . . .
</P>
<P>
   A USC spokesperson said walk-on forward Abdullah Elmagbari has
been incorrectly listed as a freshman all season. He is a junior.

UCLA HAS BEST STRETCH RUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORVALLIS, Ore. _ Finally, some !ital!highlights on a school
night.
</P>
<P>
   After three forgettable weekday showings _ three defeats fraught
with last-second breakdowns, atrocious ballhandling and poor effort
_ the UCLA Bruins finally got it right on a school night.
</P>
<P>
   And in impressive fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins used their best stretch of the season just when they
needed it most, turning an 11-point second-half deficit into a
85-74 victory over Oregon State on Thursday at Gill Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The win kept them on a reasonable pace for the 18 wins they
probably need to secure an at-large bid. It also relieved the
Saturday pressure they've felt each week since the calendar turned.
Whatever happens at Oregon's deafening McArthur Court on Saturday
evening, the Bruins (12-5, 3-3) have the split they desperately
needed. They must win six of their last 13 to reach 18 wins, a
realistic scenario considering they have seven games at home.
</P>
<P>
   The key Thursday was a 24-3 surge that turned a 56-45 deficit
into a 69-59 lead with five minutes left. The Bruins held Oregon
State without a field goal for 7:28, they handled the ball lwith
care, and they overwhelmed Oregon State with size and superb
passing.
</P>
<P>
   Center Dan Gadzuric scored nine points in the run, with help
from Jason Kapono and Ray Young, who followed his impressive
defensive effort against Arizona State's Eddie House with a
career-high 22 points against the Beavers.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were prepared for a close game. After all, the
previous four in Gill had been decided by 15 points. In last year's
two-point defeat, UCLA shot 15 percent from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   ``They slow it way down,'' said junior Rico Hines, who did not
play Thursday because of a sprained big toe. ``It's an ugly place.
It's dead there. The main thing is the tempo. They want to control
the tempo,and we want to control the tempo.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore forward Matt Barnes started in place of Hines, with
Kapono sliding from small forward to big guard. It was Barnes'
first start since Feb. 25, but he was replaced by Young after two
minutes. Young proceeded to energize UCLA's offense in a manner
usually reserved for Kapono or Jerome Moiso.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Bruins nearly five minutes to score, but they
quickly found their groove. Young and Kapono made UCLA's first
seven baskets with the sharpest shooting of the season; five were
from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins grabbed a 23-21 lead on Gadzuric's tip, but it didn't
last. Oregon State countered with Josh Steinthal's 3-pointer and
tightened its defense. UCLA managed just three baskets in the final
nine minutes of the half. When the Bruins didn't commit turnovers,
they missed 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA opened the second half with one basket and two turnovers in
four possessions. Meanwhile, the Beavers scored at will _ inside,
outside, foul line. Their lead expanded to 48-38 when guard Dino
Tanner sliced through UCLA's confused defense for a layup.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes quieted the crowd with a nifty drive, then Moiso wheeled
past a defender for a thunder dunk. Oregon State regrouped briefly
on Tanner's 3-pointers and Brian Jackson's free throws. But with 11
minutes left the Bruins began their most-impressive charge of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   It started with Earl Watson's layup on an inbounds play, then
Gadzuric made two power layins. Watson found Kapono for a
3-pointer, and the 56-45 deficit had been cut to 58-56. Young's
turnaround tied it. After Young blocked Tanner's jumper, Kapono's
brilliant pass through the defense found Gadzuric for a dunk.
Suddenly, the Bruins had a 60-58 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric returned the favor a minute later, hitting Kapono for a
lefthanded layin. Kapono's 3-pointer with 5:36 left pushed UCLA's
leadto 67-59.

THE PLAY'S THE THING FOR CSUN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ It was fitting this beating, the second one
the Cal State Northridge men's basketball team has laid upon
Sacramento State in two years, took place in an auditorium, with a
stage, a curtain, the whole works.
</P>
<P>
   There was less suspense in the second half of CSUN's 75-57
victory over Sac State than in last year's Los Angeles musical
production of ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we are on (the Hornets') hit list,'' Northridge center
Brian Heinle said. ``We knew they wanted to come out and beat us.
We just didn't want to let that happen. We wanted to come out and
start fast early and finish strong. That's what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Counting last year's 99-65 CSUN win in Memorial Auditorium, when
the Matadors had a school-record 11 dunks, Northridge has outscored
Sac State 175-122 in 80 minutes of basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably played one of the best overall `team' games that
we've played all year,'' said CSUN coach Bobby Braswell, who one
day earlier broke the news to the Matadors that senior forward
Andre Larry had left the team for personal reasons. ``It's been a
rough couple days for our program. It's kind of a solemn trip.''
</P>
<P>
   True, maybe because of the drama of Larry's departure, and the
Shakesperean surroundings _ Braswell said reserve guard Denny Ogden
called him ``Brasio, Brasio'' during warmups _ CSUN played with
more emotion than usual in winning its third in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Nine minutes into the game, Northridge (13-5, 5-2) led 18-8. At
halftime, the Matadors' lead was 35-22. When guard Carl Holmes made
a 3-pointer with 15 minutes, 19 seconds left in the second half,
CSUN led 49-27.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the 1,553 fans probably wondered if they could
get ``Hamlet'' after the game in a bonus double-feature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out tonight and performed at a high level,'' Holmes
said. ``Without Andre, we wanted to prove to people we're still a
good team.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the game finished, the Northridge players and coaches
shifted their thoughts to Saturday night's anticipated matchup at
defending Big Sky Conference champion Weber State. The Wildcats,
picked to repeat as Big Sky champion in every preseason poll, are
12-5, 4-2 entering tonight's game against Northern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN is now 17-2 all-time against Sacramento State. The Matadors
are 3-12 against Weber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was focused,'' said reserve guard Marco McCain, who
scored all of his 18 points on six 3-pointers. ``Now this game is
over with. We're going to enjoy the win, but now we've got to think
about Weber State. Everybody has to chip in. Everybody has to do
more than what we've been doing.''

TV ADS MAY STEAL SHOW ON SUNDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Steve Carney  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The whole world will be watching, the nation's best will be on
display, and they all know the entire year is worthless if they
don't perform well at the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   With the biggest game of the season also being the biggest TV
show of any year, the Super Bowl traditionally is the national
event to launch a new product, or an entirely new company.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with two upstart, small-market teams playing for the
NFL championship, the commercials may be more of a draw for many on
Sunday than the game itself. After all, more people can probably
name the Budweiser lizard than the Tennessee Titans' quarterback
(Louie vs. Steve McNair, for those of you keeping score at home).
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other television show where people are waiting for
the commercials,'' said Laura Bennett, whose agency created an ad
featuring brawling brides for OurBeginning.com, an Orlando,
Fla.-based Internet company that makes invitations and other
specialized announcements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when you need to reach a specific audience,
and there are times when you need to reach the whole world,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Or, at least 130 million people -- a typical Super Bowl
viewership.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five percent of Americans say they will watch at least
part of the game, and 8 percent say they tune in just to see the
ads, according to a survey by the Baltimore advertising agency
Eisner Communications.
</P>
<P>
   That might explain why businesses are forking over $2.2 million
to ABC for each 30-second spot, and $135 million overall.
</P>
<P>
   This year more than ever, Internet companies are playing ball.
At least 10 Web-based companies have bought ads this year, compared
with two last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dot.coms move at the speed of light. There's no time to
waste,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its spot showing women slugging it out in a
bridal store, OurBeginning.com will feature pregame commercials
showing an old English town crier getting pummeled for his 4 a.m.
announcements.
</P>
<P>
   The brawling brides spot had to be edited for ABC. Bennett said
the network thought the original commercial had ``too much personal
violence'' to air during its football game.
</P>
<P>
   So a ``director's cut'' of the ``Angry Brides'' spot will be
available on the Web site at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Another spot features the Pets.com Sock Puppet in an all-new
setting.
</P>
<P>
   The Walt Disney Co. is using the Super Bowl to launch a campaign
called ``Why do we love the Mouse?'' that features Shaquille O'Neal
and Regis Philbin -- and other celebrities in future commercials --
waxing nostalgic about Mickey.
</P>
<P>
   A Budweiser ad will feature hockey great Wayne Gretzky taking
the keys from a friend who has been drinking, and offering to drive
him home. We next see the pair idling down the street atop a
Zamboni machine.
</P>
<P>
   FedEx's ad inserts a delivery truck into clips of the movie
``Wizard of Oz,'' showing the company really can deliver to places
others can only imagine.
</P>
<P>
   EDS Corp., a company that manages computer systems, will air an
irreverent spot showing grizzled cowboys herding house cats across
the lonesome prairie, advising, ``Don't let anybody tell ya it's
easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the U.S. Census will be among those counting on the power
of the Super Bowl. The government agency landed a spot -- at half
price -- when another advertiser pulled out at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   The ad urges people to return their surveys after they receive
them this spring. Census Bureau officials acknowledge the ad won't
be remembered for its originality, but they're just happy to be at
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intercepted a pass in the ad game for the Super Bowl,''
said spokesman David Hoffmann.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, HotJobs.com spent $2 million, half its annual
revenue, on a Super Bowl ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went in not knowing what we were heading for, and we hit a
bunch of roadblocks along the way,'' said Bob Liu, company
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Among the obstacles was censorship from Fox, which aired the
game last year. The network that gave the country ``The Simpsons''
and ``When Pets Attack'' determined that HotJobs' spot -- featuring
a zookeeper suffering indignities from the, um, back end of an
elephant -- was not appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The company ran a toned-down replacement ad that featured a
security guard daydreaming of better jobs. Company officials say
the exposure boosted visits to HotJobs' Web site from 800 thousand
visits a month to 1.7 million after the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought we were crazy, but we think it was a success
for us,'' Liu said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rex Kovacevich, an assistant professor of marketing at the
University of Southern California, said tales of companies flooded
with adulation and business after their 30-second gems ``are still
pretty rare. It's a lot of money and you're competing with a lot of
messages.''
</P>
<P>
   Liu said many businesses wrongly believe that all they need to
do is write a fat check, air one Super Bowl commercial and wait for
the profits to stream in.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going in thinking there is a formula to this,'' Liu
said. ``Running a Super Bowl ad is not a guarantee of success. You
still need to build a strong business model. ... If you're just
going in for the glory, you're going about it the wrong way.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Super Bowl ads have achieved legendary status in pop
culture, becoming highlights that are more memorable than the
blowout games they interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon dates back to 1984, when Apple launched its
Macintosh line of computers with an Orwellian spot featuring an
athletic woman breaking through a legion of drone-like workers and
smashing a Big Brother-esque image.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Macintosh ad, just visually, was spectacular. It
definitely stopped the room,'' Kovacevich said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, advertisers have felt pressure to create spots at
least as memorable, using humor, sex or special effects. And the
ads themselves have become events -- whether they featured a
gymnastic, Doritos-eating vixen, animated beer bottles or the Pepsi
commercial pyrotechnics that set Michael Jackson ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to go on the Super Bowl and not have big results
to show for it,'' Kovacevich said.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Titans and St. Louis Rams feel they've arrived in
their sport's upper echelon with their Super Bowl appearances, so
does Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels almost overwhelming'' to create a commercial that
will appear during the biggest TV show of the year, she said. ``I'm
not sure I understood the way people respond to the Super Bowl.
It's the top of the big leagues. It's a nice feeling.''

   PALMDALE, Calif. -- Predictions of 1,000 jobs by June are
proving to be too optimistic for SR Technics, the Swiss company
planning to establish a jetliner modification and repair plant in
Palmdale, east of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   SR Technics now expects to be able to employ 350 people by June,
after re-evaluating the work needed to get its new Palmdale plant
ready. The company still expects to build up to a 1,000-employee
work force over the next several months and eventually grow to
5,000 workers, city officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are still moving ahead and doing what they said they were
doing,'' Palmdale Mayor Jim Ledford said Thursday. ``They have got
a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The prediction of 1,000 jobs by June was made by company
officials when they announced just before Christmas that they had
selected Palmdale as the site of their North American aircraft
modification and repair center.
</P>
<P>
   SR Technics is establishing its center at the former Boeing Site
9 complex near Avenue P and 30th Street East, where the B-1B bomber
fleet was built in the 1980s. The company has finalized purchase
agreements for the buildings from Boeing and has a lease in place
from the Los Angeles World Airports department, which owns the
land.
</P>
<P>
   Antelope Valley leaders view the company as a harbinger for
economic development and for the viability of the nearby Palmdale
Regional Airport. The news of the company's move to Palmdale is
expected to draw interest from other aerospace-related companies
that might want to relocate to the region.

PHONE SWINDLER GETS FINE, SERVICE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The former head of a Texas telephone company was fined $4,050
and ordered to perform 500 hours of community service Thursday
after pleading no contest to charges that he swindled scores of San
Fernando Valley residents out of $500,000 in bogus phone fees.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Zepeda, 28, of Plano, Texas, pleaded no contest to six
counts of telecommunications fraud during an appearance before Los
Angeles Municipal Court Judge Robert L. Hess, who then levied the
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Zepeda will perform the community service through approved
organizations in his home state.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy City Attorney P. Greg Parham said Zepeda engaged in a
practice known as ``cramming.''
</P>
<P>
   The scheme involves billing customers for services they did not
order or receive through their GTE telephone bills.
</P>
<P>
   Zepeda's company, Future Telephone Communications, billed 30,000
households $8.99 each in service charges.
</P>
<P>
   After an investigation by the California Public Utilities
Commission, triggered by reports in the Daily News, City Attorney
James Hahn filed charges in April 1997 against Zepeda and his
company.
</P>
<P>
   Zepeda successfully filed for dismissal of the charges, but the
City Attorney's office won reinstatement on appeal last October.
</P>
<P>
   The company pleaded no contest in July 1997 to 25 counts of
fraud and was fined $25,000 and ordered to pay $500,000 in
restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Customers who had been illegally billed received credits on
their telephone bills, paid for by the company, but the fine has
not been paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The corporation, shortly after resolving the restitution,
filed for bankruptcy,'' Parham said. ``We're never happy when the
full benefit of the bargain we reached with the defendant is not
fully meted out.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Zepeda nor his attorney could be reached for comment on
Thursday.

<P>
   AUSTIN, TEXAS _ On the last Sunday in January, millions of
Americans anxiously gather around their television sets. Surrounded
by beer and snacks, including an estimated 8 million pounds (3.6
million kg) of guacamole, they watch a football game whose winner
is usually obvious by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Super Bowl audience has expanded beyond
America's borders, and 800 million people across the world will
watch this year's championship between the St. Louis Rams and the
Tennessee Titans, two teams short both on football tradition and
worldwide (not to mention national) appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping that at least the commercials are entertaining.
Yet if this year's Super Bowl contenders are not household names,
the National Football League (NFL) would not want it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the NFL has structured its business to create parity
among all 31 teams in the league, and this season came closest to
achieving that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Once-dismal teams from smaller cities made the play-offs,
whereas the league's powerhouses (such as the San Francisco 49ers
and the Dallas Cowboys) all had lackluster seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In most sports, teams from rich media markets have the edge over
those from backwaters. But in American football, teams share the
television revenues, worth $17.6 billion over eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries are capped, new players are drafted so as to help the
worst teams, and ticket revenues are split 60:40 between home and
away teams, letting small teams share the big gates of the large
teams.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the Green Bay Packers, the team in the smallest
media market, had a better record than the New York Giants, a team
in the largest.
</P>
<P>
   Other sports are different. In major-league baseball, each team
negotiates its own local television contract. Owners in the larger
cities have huge broadcast and cable deals and have funnelled the
revenues into the team's payroll.
</P>
<P>
   All eight teams in last year's baseball play-offs ranked in the
top ten in terms of payroll. For the 2000 season, the Los Angeles
Dodgers will pay two players a combined $29 million, more than the
entire payrolls of seven other major-league teams.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting on Jan. 19, baseball owners voted to give the
league commissioner, Bud Selig, greater powers to restore the sport
to balance. Selig can now redistribute baseball's revenues from the
Internet to poorer clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Some see this as a step toward a revenue-sharing scheme like the
NFL's _ though that would need the nod of such skeptical ``big
market'' owners as Ted Turner and George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Is the NFL right?

   AUSTIN, TEXAS _ On the last Sunday in January, millions of
Americans anxiously gather around their television sets. Surrounded
by beer and snacks, including an estimated 8 million pounds (3.6
million kg) of guacamole, they watch a football game whose winner
is usually obvious by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Super Bowl audience has expanded beyond
America's borders, and 800 million people across the world will
watch this year's championship between the St. Louis Rams and the
Tennessee Titans, two teams short both on football tradition and
worldwide (not to mention national) appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping that at least the commercials are entertaining.
Yet if this year's Super Bowl contenders are not household names,
the National Football League (NFL) would not want it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the NFL has structured its business to create parity
among all 31 teams in the league, and this season came closest to
achieving that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Once-dismal teams from smaller cities made the play-offs,
whereas the league's powerhouses (such as the San Francisco 49ers
and the Dallas Cowboys) all had lackluster seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In most sports, teams from rich media markets have the edge over
those from backwaters. But in American football, teams share the
television revenues, worth $17.6 billion over eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries are capped, new players are drafted so as to help the
worst teams, and ticket revenues are split 60:40 between home and
away teams, letting small teams share the big gates of the large
teams.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the Green Bay Packers, the team in the smallest
media market, had a better record than the New York Giants, a team
in the largest.
</P>
<P>
   Other sports are different. In major-league baseball, each team
negotiates its own local television contract. Owners in the larger
cities have huge broadcast and cable deals and have funnelled the
revenues into the team's payroll.
</P>
<P>
   All eight teams in last year's baseball play-offs ranked in the
top ten in terms of payroll. For the 2000 season, the Los Angeles
Dodgers will pay two players a combined $29 million, more than the
entire payrolls of seven other major-league teams.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting on Jan. 19, baseball owners voted to give the
league commissioner, Bud Selig, greater powers to restore the sport
to balance. Selig can now redistribute baseball's revenues from the
Internet to poorer clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Some see this as a step toward a revenue-sharing scheme like the
NFL's _ though that would need the nod of such skeptical ``big
market'' owners as Ted Turner and George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Is the NFL right?
</P>

 &HT;    DISABLED TWIN TELLS ABOUT SWITCH TO REGULAR CLASSES
 &HT;    Eds: Advance for release Saturday, Jan. 26
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Anastasia Somoza, 16, and her twin sister Alba are
10th graders at School of the Future, a public high school in
Manhattan. Each is a quadriplegic wheelchair user with cerebral
palsy.
</P>
<P>
   Anastasia was one of the students who joined concerned parents
recently on Capitol Hill to urge stricter enforcement of laws
protecting the right of disabled children to a free, appropriate
public education in the ``least restrictive environment.''
</P>
<P>
   She told the others how a persistent parent, volunteers from a
big law firm and personal intervention by President Clinton helped
Alba follow Anastasia out of special classes and into classes also
attended by children without disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ ANDREW MOLLISON
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is a condensed version of what Anastasia said:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When I started kindergarten, I went to a special school in Long
Island that was only for disabled students, and my twin sister was
in a special education classroom in a public school about an hour's
bus ride from our house in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   They would not let Alba attend my school because she could not
speak.
</P>
<P>
   In her own class, nobody knew how to use her assistive
technology. My sister is very smart, and has an IQ of 130, but the
teachers simply were not trained to teach her properly. She then
simply tuned them out because she was so bored, and refused to
respond. They kept giving her ``baby stuff'' to work on year after
year.
</P>
<P>
   My school was OK academically. But it was so far from home that
I left home at 7 a.m. and returned at 6 p.m., at which time I still
had to have therapy, dinner, my bath and do homework. I had no
playmates because my friends lived too far away and we had no car.
I was always tired and hated the long bus ride.
</P>
<P>
   My mom went to a conference one day and learned all about
inclusion, and how well children did in their local classrooms.
When my school continued to refuse to accept my sister, she took me
out of there and returned me to our district, to the same school as
Alba.
</P>
<P>
   However this time, she had me placed in a 3rd grade class where
I was the only child with a disability. When my mom saw how well I
was doing, she decided to place Alba in a regular class.
</P>
<P>
   That is when our problems began. The principal and the district
refused to allow Alba into a general education classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody like my sister was allowed into regular education in New
York City and they put the chancellor's lawyers in charge of the
legal team opposing my mom. She had a legal aid lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   About this time, I was invited to a town meeting with President
Clinton at the White House. It was filmed on television, and I
asked the president to help my sister, and he sure did, and still
writes to us today.
</P>
<P>
   Even with his help, it took my mom one and a half years in court
to get my sister into regular education, and to get both of us the
support services we needed.
</P>
<P>
   A big law firm in New York helped my mom without charging;
otherwise we could not have done it.
</P>
<P>
   During the legal battle, it was really terrible for me and my
sister at school. They did everything to be nasty to my mom, and
refused to do even the simplest things to make things easier for my
sister and for me.
</P>
<P>
   But the kids in school were great and so were some teachers who
secretly helped my mom and told her what was going on in our
school.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, my sister was integrated into the fourth grade, but all
the time we spent at that school was difficult for us.
</P>
<P>
   When we moved on to the 7th grade in my present school, it was
like night and day. Everybody welcomed us, the principal, the
teachers and the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Both my sister and I started to get really good grades and
everyone was astonished with our progress.
</P>
<P>
   I was named the ``most outstanding student'' in the 9th grade
last year and am top of my class this year. I went to Yale
University summer school for political science. I was the only
student with a disability and I graduated in the top ten of 200
students with straight A's.
</P>
<P>
   My sister has made extraordinary progress. She is having a hard
time catching up from all the years she lost in special education,
but her teachers have said that she has had an exceptional
turnaround. She is talking up a storm on her communication
computer, and is one of the most popular kids in the school.
</P>
<P>
   I think that if people just have faith in students with special
needs, if they just give us a chance to show what we can do, and
not concentrate on what we cannot do, there will be many, many more
success stories of children like my sister and me.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: The fantastic journey of two stray
poodles
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ My wife was driving along, minding her own
business as much as she ever does, when she spotted two little
white poodles sitting beside the road, looking one way and then the
other, trying to decide if it was safe to cross the street.
</P>
<P>
   My wife knew exactly what to do. She'd done it before. She
circled the block and stopped the car. When she got out, the
poodles came right to her. She has a way with dogs.
</P>
<P>
   She also has a way with me. That's why we already had eight
dogs, all of which came from either the side of the road or the
pound, including a little white poodle of our own.
</P>
<P>
   Our rule is to take all the dogs God sends us. But how many, oh
Lord, how many?
</P>
<P>
   My wife was sure these little poodles already had a home. Even
though they wore no collars, they were groomed and well cared for.
She had picked them up only a few blocks from where we live. She
suggested we drive around the neighborhood and try to find their
owner.
</P>
<P>
   I make it a point not to dispute my wife. What I do is humor
her. Sure, maybe the owner was out looking for the lost dogs. And
maybe we would meet up. A long shot, but it wouldn't hurt to try.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, my wife had decided the dogs were mother and
daughter. She's like that. She makes up stories about the dogs we
find, always stories with happy endings. A couple of our dogs she
insists are mother and son who were separated but have finally been
reunited. Another pair are aunt and niece. I go along. It doesn't
hurt anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turn at the next corner,'' my wife said. I didn't ask why. I
was just going along, driving along.
</P>
<P>
   Up the block she spotted a painter's truck in front of the
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it!'' she declared. ``That must be where they live. The
painter probably left a door open and the dogs got out.''
</P>
<P>
   I make a point never to dispute my wife. But good grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is ridiculous,'' I fumed. ``We'll never find the owner
going door to door, stopping at one house or another that fits some
silly story you've made up. We're wasting our time.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I was pulling the car into the driveway next to the
painter's truck.
</P>
<P>
   My wife got out, went to the door and knocked. The next thing I
knew a man was coming out of the house and heading toward the car,
a big smile of relief on his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'd looked everywhere for them,'' he said as my wife
presented him with his dogs, who were twisting and yapping and
licking his face. ``The painter left the gate open. That's how they
got out.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he stopped. ``But how in the world did you know where to
bring them?''
</P>
<P>
   I shook my head. ``If I told you, you'd think I was making it
up.''
</P>
<P>
   But all's well that ends well. Of course, that's how all my
wife's stories end, and I make it a point never to dispute her.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. The poodles were mother and daughter.

   For Black History month, which begins on Monday, Feb. 1, The New
York times Syndicate is offering a five-part feature, ``The
Caldwell Journals,'' an account of major moments in the
civil-rights movement of the 1960s by Earl Caldwell, the nationally
acclaimed black journalist whose early career was shaped by that
dynamic era.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell, a former New York Times reporter, was witness to some
of the most important events of the last 40 years. He covered the
riots that swept many American cities during the summer of 1967.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the National Association of Black Journalists presented
Caldwell with its President's Award, saying his record of
professional achievement made him ``one of the most important
journalists in the last 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell is currently a writer-in-residence at the Robert C.
Maynard Institute for Journalism Education in Oakland, Calif., and
is writing ``The Caldwell Journals'' for the institute's Web site.

<P>
   &UR; PART 1: THE BOLL WEEVIL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this excerpt, Earl Caldwell starts work at The Democrat and
Chronicle, in Rochester, N.Y. About his first assignment, Caldwell
writes, ``The story was boxed across the top of the front page of
the Sunday edition. It was even before the masthead.'' Caldwell and
another reporter _ a white journalist named Bill Vogler _ are sent
out into the streets of Rochester to cover the segregation that
exists in housing. Their experiences are startlingly different. ``I
would just reach the door and promptly be told, `The apartment has
already been rented,''' Caldwell writes. ``Right after I was told
that no apartment was available, Vogler would visit the same place
and be invited inside.'' The community's reaction to the resulting
story was overwhelmingly positive _ particularly among blacks, who
nicknamed Caldwell the boll weevil, which came from the title of a
then-popular song. ``When they'd see me, they'd say, with a lot of
laughter, `Here comes that boll weevil. He's still looking for a
home,''' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 2: HARLEM _ THE COLONY CONVERGES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this excerpt, Caldwell recounts the riots in Harlem that came
about in July 1964, after a white cop had shot and killed a black
youth. ``I grabbed a notebook and a few clothes and headed for the
airport, hoping that my experience in Rochester had prepared me for
the challenge ahead in the Big Apple,'' he writes. Crowds of blacks
lined the streets _ screaming, jeering, ducking. ``I was at least
as astonished as the police and the blacks on the streets to see a
dozen or so reporters, all black like me, representing large and
powerful organizations such as The New York Times, the Associated
Press, the New York Post ... Time magazine. ... We acknowledged
with one another the bit of history of which we were a part.''
Something very great is happening and Caldwell and his black
colleagues are at the center of it. The doors have opened.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 3: MALCOLM X &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In February 1965, Malcolm X accepts an invitation to address a
black church in Rochester. Despite speculation that the speech will
be canceled, he arrives on Feb. 16. Caldwell recounts Malcolm X's
moving speech. However, through most of the hour, the civil-rights
activist cites example after example of how the press is used
against black people. People stand up and shout their approval.
Caldwell realizes that he can't go to Malcolm X's hotel later with
the others. Caldwell fears the meeting will be a ``get the press''
session. Five days later, on Feb. 21, Caldwell is at work at his
newspaper when the shocking news hits the headlines: Malcolm X was
killed just as he started to deliver a speech at the Audubon
Ballroom in Harlem. ``For me, the lesson driven home was that a
reporter's job required toughness and that journalism was not the
place for the easily embarrassed or intimidated,'' Caldwell writes.
``I had missed my chance to meet and talk with Malcolm X. I vowed
never to make a similar mistake again.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 4: WHITE REPORTERS OUT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Harlem on the Sunday that Malcolm X is shot, two reporters
are right up in front in the Audubon Ballroom, so close to the
podium that when the shooting starts, they have to dive to the
floor for cover. The journalists: Stan Scott and Gene Simpson. How
they got into the ballroom that afternoon played large part in
ushering in a whole new era for reporters who are black. This is
their story.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 5: BLACK IS BEAUTIFUL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this excerpt, Caldwell is now working for the Herald Tribune
and is witnessing what he calls ``the black consciousness
movement.'' Editors want reporters to literally camp out in Harlem
and the other black areas of the city to report and write about
what is taking place. Caldwell gets the assignment and is
overwhelmed by what he witnesses. ``A massive redefinition of self
was taking place in the ghettos,'' he writes. ``Very little went
unchallenged. And at the core was an unprecedented embracing of
blackness.''

ushering in a whole new era for reporters who are black. This is
their story.

   &UR; PART 5: BLACK IS BEAUTIFUL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this excerpt, Caldwell is now working for the Herald Tribune
and is witnessing what he calls ``the black consciousness
movement.'' Editors want reporters to literally camp out in Harlem
and the other black areas of the city to report and write about
what is taking place. Caldwell gets the assignment and is
overwhelmed by what he witnesses. ``A massive redefinition of self
was taking place in the ghettos,'' he writes. ``Very little went
unchallenged. And at the core was an unprecedented embracing of
blackness.''

<P>
   PRELUDE TO PART ONE: In August 1963, tensions between blacks and
whites in many cities across the United States were on the rise.
Crowds converged on the nation's capital for the historic March on
Washington. Earl Caldwell, then a reporter for the Lancaster
Intelligencer-Journal, joined his parents in the living room of
their home in central Pennsylvania to watch Martin Luther King Jr.
deliver what many call his finest speech. Ten days later, a bomb
exploded during Sunday services at a black church in Birmingham,
Ala., killing four girls. Across urban America, black populations
became restless, and newspaper editors began searching for
reporters who could get inside the ``ghettos'' to gather stories
from those black communities. The Democrat and Chronicle in
Rochester, N.Y., began to recruit Caldwell aggressively. In the
fall of 1963, he accepted the job. Here, Caldwell recounts his
first assignment for the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The story was boxed across the top of the front page of the
Sunday edition. It was even above the masthead. Of all the stories
I had ever written, nothing came close to this, my first story as a
reporter at the Democrat and Chronicle in Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the story herald my arrival, but there was also a
photograph of me, which was a way of letting readers know that for
the first time the newspaper had a reporter who was black.
</P>
<P>
   I'd arrived in town expecting the newspaper to make good on a
promise. Back when they were wooing me, I was told that if I
accepted the job, they would have an apartment waiting in a luxury
building not far from the newspaper. When I got to town and
mentioned all of this, I got a blank stare. Nobody knew what I was
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Dick Dougherty came up with his idea. He was the city
editor, and on my first day at the D&AMP;C, he told me that of all the
complaints that he was getting from blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say the housing here is really segregated,'' he said. ``I
don't know if that's true or not. You have to find an apartment. We
don't need to phony up anything. We can use your experience to tell
a true story of what the situation really is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you do it?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty was a tall, thin guy whose hair was white even though
he didn't look to be a day past 35. His style was low key but very
persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   I had never reported and written a story about race, and what
Dougherty was suggesting caught me off-guard. But I was just
starting out on a new job; there was no way I was going to say no
to my city editor.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty wanted two reporters on the story _ one white and one
black. The plan was for each of us to try separately to rent the
same apartment. The white reporter was Bill Vogler. He was a
veteran on the staff at the D&AMP;C and he liked the idea. The two of
us got newspapers and circled apartments in my price range. Then we
got started.
</P>
<P>
   After we had visited about five or six apartments, Vogler asked
me, ``Are you sure you're actually going into these places?''
</P>
<P>
   He did not understand. I would just reach the door and promptly
be told, ``The apartment has already been rented.'' Right after I
was told that no apartment was available, Vogler would visit the
same place and be invited inside. He'd get a whole spiel on how
great the apartment was, why he'd like it and what the neighborhood
had to offer.
</P>
<P>
   My experience was so different that at times it would be
downright embarrassing. One building had a big sign on the lawn,
Apartment for Rent. I was heading up the sidewalk when a window on
the second floor opened. A woman leaned out and hollered: ``If
you're coming for the apartment, forget it. It's already rented.''
</P>
<P>
   Once I explained all this to Vogler, we kept going. We visited
apartment after apartment. It was always the same: no to me, yes to
him. I just kept making notes of everything that happened. At the
typewriter, I got my chance to tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the story was published, blacks began showing up
in the newsroom ``to meet Earl Caldwell.'' Some would barge right
past the receptionist.
</P>
<P>
   These were not ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Some people called these visitors troublemakers. They called
themselves activists, which meant they were in the forefront of
stoking, shaping and channeling the anger they said was growing in
Rochester's two black communities, the Third and Seventh wards.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper itself was a target of their anger. They said they
never saw reporters in their neighborhoods ``except when there's
trouble'' and accused the newspaper of not covering the important
issues in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   They looked to me to change that. They said that they expected
to see me in their communities, to tell the stories that were not
being told. The irony was that in a sense, my editor and the
activists were saying the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find out what the facts are,'' Dougherty had
challenged me. ``We expect you to tell the story,'' the activists
said, inviting me to the ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   I was being handed what every reporter wants: a big and
important story.
</P>
<P>
   The front-page story of my experience in hunting an apartment
had given me the kind of notoriety that a reporter new in town
could only dream of. The reaction was overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Once the story was published, so many whites called to offer an
apartment that I had to write another piece just to tell that
story. One very nice woman, also white, did rent me a place not far
from the office.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I had settled in, black folks still hung a nickname
on me. They called me boll weevil. The name came from the title of
a popular song, and when they'd see me, they'd say, with a lot of
laughter, ``Here comes boll weevil. He's still looking for a
home.'''

<P>
   PRELUDE TO PART TWO: On a hot night in Harlem in July 1964, the
explosion came. After a white police officer had shot and killed a
black youth, riots erupted in the black neighborhoods in the
northeast _ a portent of what was to come. At the Democrat and
Chronicle, the city editor called Earl Caldwell to his desk. ``We
want you to go down to Harlem,'' he said. Although Caldwell had
visited New York, he had never been to Harlem. He grabbed a
notebook and a few clothes and headed for the airport, hoping that
his experience in Rochester had prepared him for the challenge in
New York City. Here, Caldwell describes what it was like for him
and other black reporters in Harlem during the riots, which raged
around them for three nights.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The rioting in Harlem came in furious bursts. Rocks and bottles
sailed from tenement roofs. Molotov cocktails exploded on streets
littered with broken glass.
</P>
<P>
   Cops fired salvo after salvo into smoky, pitch-black skies.
Police cruisers, sirens wailing, roared in pursuit of hit-and-run
looters.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds lined the streets, sometimes as many as a thousand
people, all of them black. They screamed, jeered, ducked, dodged
and _ when turned on by riot-weary cops _ scrambled and ran.
</P>
<P>
   And there we were, smack in the middle of it, with notebooks in
hand, dashing at the heels of the crowds, observing the battles and
trying as best we could to record it all.
</P>
<P>
   Frenzied as it was in those moments of battle, that's all they
were, moments. They would rise like a storm and then, just as
suddenly, dissipate. And with every inevitable lull in the action,
attention turned to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' people demanded. Some would reach for the press
credentials that dangled from our necks.
</P>
<P>
   We tried to explain ourselves. ``We're press,'' we said. But
that was not nearly explanation enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``What press?'' our inquisitors fired back.
</P>
<P>
   In that back-and-forth, something that even we had not realized
came into focus. Harlem cops and black residents had seen black
reporters before. But almost without exception those reporters
worked for black newspapers, mainly weeklies. This time we
represented mainstream white-owned daily newspapers and radio
stations, a major first.
</P>
<P>
   A small colony of reporters who were black had arrived in the
big leagues of New York City journalism. And this took everyone by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Having come from Rochester, I was as astonished as the police
and the blacks on the streets to see at least a dozen or so
reporters, all black like me, representing large and powerful
organizations such as The New York Times, the Associated Press, the
New York Post, the Daily News, United Press International, Newsday,
and Newsweek and Time magazines.
</P>
<P>
   In that week, I came to know reporters such as Gerald Fraser,
Austin Scott, Ted Poston, Tom Johnson, Les Carson, Claude Lewis,
Ted Jones, Junius Griffin, Wally Terry, Paul Hathaway, Gene Simpson
and Stan Scott.
</P>
<P>
   And on the streets of Harlem, between bursts of rioting, we
acknowledged with one another that we were a part of a bit of
history.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just that we were there. What was developing into one
of the biggest stories in America was largely in our hands. The
events unfolding on the streets of Harlem would make news all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been little more than a mere footnote but it was
still a piece of history in the making. Never had the major media
put so much of an important story in the hands of reporters who
were not white.
</P>
<P>
   Every chance they got, the cops would stare us down. It was as
though they could not accept that we were qualified and that our
reporting would be central to what people everywhere would read of
the Harlem riots.
</P>
<P>
   Some white reporters sought us out. They would shake our hands
and stay as close to us as possible. That put them closer to the
story. It also made them feel safer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a white New York Times photographer was jumped by a mob
and beaten so badly that the bones around his eyes were broken.
</P>
<P>
   The Times had two black reporters on the story, Junius Griffin
and Ted Jones, who set up a temporary bureau in the Theresa Hotel
at 125th Street and 7th Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin was a former Marine. He broke in as a journalist on
Stars and Stripes, the United States military newspaper. In Harlem,
he emerged a hero. He saw a group of blacks surround and threaten
three white reporters from the Journal-American, a Hearst
newspaper. He charged into the crowd, grabbed the reporters, and
walked them out unharmed. He knew that only a black reporter could
do that.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Jones made news too. He watched some cops chasing black
youths who had been throwing rocks and bottles. As the kids outran
the cops and got away, some in the crowd cheered derisively. In
frustration, the cops began to use their nightsticks at random.
Impulsively, Ted interceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people didn't do anything,'' he yelled.
</P>
<P>
   When the cops ignored him and continued swinging their batons
wildly, he pressed forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no right to beat these people,'' he insisted. ``You
cannot do that. You can't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' a cop barked, irritated.
</P>
<P>
   Ted grabbed his press card and held it out. ``The New York
Times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get out of here,'' the cop ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and heavyset, Ted refused to budge. As the cops continued
their attack, he was knocked to the ground. He wasn't injured, only
shook up, but what happened to him became a part of the news story.
</P>
<P>
   The riots raged through three nights, and at the end of each
day, long after the crowds and the cops had drifted away, the
reporters would still be on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   We could sense that something enormous was happening and that it
was our destiny to be at the center of it. Hanging together, we
quickly discovered the many paths we'd taken to get where we were
at that moment and the circumstance of timing that had opened the
door for us.

<P>
   PRELUDE TO PART THREE: Hours after the Harlem riot, thousands of
blacks streamed into the streets of Rochester, N.Y., in frenzied
mobs. They were followed by a horde of reporters. Still in his
hotel room in Harlem, Earl Caldwell received a frantic phone call
from Dick Dougherty, the city editor at the Democrat and Chronicle,
who ordered him to return to Rochester to cover the breaking
events. Here, Caldwell describes the social unrest that gripped
Rochester after the street rioting ended, his chance to meet and
talk with Malcolm X, and one of the most important lessons he
learned about being a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   A lot happened in Rochester before I was to say my last
good-bye. The riots had shifted the dynamic there. Blacks savored a
newfound power to force the white leadership to address
longstanding grievances. Whites were scared. Would future rioting
be confined to the ghetto, or would it spread downtown to white
areas of the city?
</P>
<P>
   Anxieties mounted when a coalition of religious groups brought
in Saul Alinsky, already a legend as a white organizer who taught
confrontational politics to ghetto activists. From this emerged
FIGHT, a militant direct-action group whose members were soon
marching into executive boardrooms demanding jobs and investments
in the black neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Rochester was getting a reputation. The ultimate confirmation of
that came when Malcolm X accepted an invitation to address a black
church there in February 1965.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Malcolm was involved in a dispute with Elijah
Muhammad's black Muslim organization. Four days before his
scheduled appearance in Rochester, his home in Queens, N.Y., was
firebombed.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X,'' Alex Haley told of how
Malcolm, ``barking commands and snatching up screaming frightened
children, got the family safely out of the back door into the
yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm was sure that his enemies in Elijah Muhammad's group
were responsible for the attack. That feud seemed to be turning
lethal.
</P>
<P>
   In Rochester, there was speculation that the speech would be
canceled. But Malcolm arrived at Corn Hill Methodist Church on Feb.
16 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   I was stunned when my editors assigned another reporter to cover
Malcolm's speech. They pulled me aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be trouble,'' I was told. ``We need you to handle
the street action.'' Although devastated, I accepted the
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the speech, a huge crowd was at the church. A
source whispered to me that Malcolm X wanted to meet later with
some local people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like you to be there,'' I was told.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm delivered a powerful speech, which I watched from the
back of the church.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he stood up, he was saying, ``My reason for being
here is to discuss the black revolution that is going on, that's
taking place on this earth. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone jammed into the church hung on his every word.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the problems of the black man here in this country today
have ceased to be a problem of just the American Negro or an
American problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a professor, he delivered his analysis in lecture style.
Then, about halfway through, he zeroed in on his target of the
night: the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're not against people because they're white. But we're
against those who practice racism. ... And because we're against
it, the press says we're violent. We're not for violence. We're for
peace. But the people that we're up against are for violence.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice, at first professorial, began to rise. ``This is what
the racists have always done ... And then they use the press to
make (it) look like the victim is the criminal, and the criminal is
the victim. ... They take the press, and through the press they
beat the system ... They use the press to get public opinion on
their side. ... They take statistics, and through the press they
feed them to the public. They make it appear that the role of crime
in the black community is higher than it is anywhere else. ... And
the whites go along with it. Because they think that everybody over
there's a criminal anyway. This is what the press does.''
</P>
<P>
   Through most of an hour, Malcolm X cited example after example
of how the press was used against black people. As he made his
case, many in the crowd stood and shouted their approval.
</P>
<P>
   I began to feel relieved that I was not covering his speech. I
also realized that I could not go to his hotel later with the
others. He was so damning in his indictment that I was convinced
that the meeting would be a ``get the press'' session. As a
representative of the local paper, I did not feel that I should be
there.
</P>
<P>
   As much as I wanted to meet Malcolm, I did not go.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, on Feb. 21, a cold and snowy Sunday, I was at
work at the Democrat and Chronicle. Sundays were always slow and I
was standing in the wire room, watching the various stories come in
over the teletype machines.
</P>
<P>
   I was there when the teletype bell began to ring, alerting
editors that a very important story was about to move. And that
day, when the bell began to ring, I hovered over the machine and
watched in horror as the bulletin came in that Malcolm X had been
shot and killed just as he was starting to deliver a speech at the
Audubon Ballroom in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the lesson driven home was that a reporter's job
required toughness and that journalism was not the place for one
easily embarrassed or intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   I had missed my chance to meet and talk with Malcolm X. I vowed
never to make a similar mistake.

<P>
   In Harlem on the Sunday that Malcolm X was killed, two
reporters, Stan Scott and Gene Simpson, were right up front in the
Audubon Ballroom, so close to the podium that when the shooting
started, they had to dive to the floor for cover.
</P>
<P>
   Being there changed a lot for Scott and Simpson. But how they
came to be in the ballroom that afternoon played a large part in
ushering in a whole new era for black reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In the epilogue to ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X,'' the
writer Alex Haley explained that on the day he was killed, Malcolm
X had specifically ordered that no press be allowed inside the
Audubon Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   When Scott and Simpson arrived for Malcolm's meeting, their
press credentials were in clear view. At the door, the men were
greeted by one of Malcolm's lieutenants. ``No press allowed,'' he
told them.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned, the two stood pondering the ``no press'' edict.
Malcolm's aide pointed to their credentials and offered a
suggestion. ``Put 'em in your pocket,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They complied. ``As black citizens, you can go on in,'' the aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   And that afternoon Stan Scott and Gene Simpson got what
reporters dream of _ the experience of being there, of being
wherever it is at the precise moment that something truly important
happens.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence in the Audobon Ballroom that day changed the two
reporters' professional lives, for the better. Scott, who was
working for United Press International, was lured away to join
WINS, New York City's leading all-news radio station. Simpson, a
reporter for WMCA radio, left to join CBS radio's all-news
operation.
</P>
<P>
   But more significant than what happened to those news reporters
was the action taken by Malcolm X's supporters in the wake of his
murder. What the supporters did brought a swift, definable change
to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm's aides had concluded that their leader's ``no press''
order was proof that the time had come in which the black community
and black meetings should be off limits to white reporters. And
they also believed that if Malcolm had made an exception for black
reporters, so should they.
</P>
<P>
   So, grieving and wanting to honor their slain leader, they made
it their cause to keep white reporters out of meetings among
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long after, as a reporter for the Herald Tribune, I
witnessed nothing more shocking than the tense confrontations that
ensued when white reporters showed up in Harlem and other black
communities to cover meetings and rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom did anybody ever bar them at the door. The reporters
would be allowed inside and even get seated. It was like baiting a
trap.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the meeting was about to begin, someone would shout,
``Wait, wait, wait,'' and, pointing toward the reporters who were
white, would ask: ``What are they doing in here?''
</P>
<P>
   And then the show was on. Voices got louder, people jumped to
their feet, and immediately they began shouting the demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``White reporters out! White reporters out!''
</P>
<P>
   When the white reporters did not leave fast enough or dared to
argue a right to stay, they would be grabbed and roughly ushered
out the door. Those of us who were reporters and black discreetly
put our notebooks and pencils away, but we did not budge from our
seats and nobody ever tried to force us out.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press, already embarrassed at being scooped by
UPI on the assassination of Malcolm X, responded by opening a news
bureau in the heart of Harlem. Gil Scott and Hollie West, both
blacks, were the two reporters assigned to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Scott, born and raised in Brooklyn, N.Y., began his career
in journalism in 1957 as a desk assistant at CBS. In 1959, he moved
to the Reporter-Dispatch in White Plains, N.Y., where he worked as
a sportswriter. His career was interrupted briefly when he was
recalled to active duty in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he joined the Newark News, where he and John Dotson
were the only black reporters on staff. Gil Scott stayed there
until he was hired by the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   An Oklahoma native, Hollie West, in 1963, became the first black
reporter on a daily newspaper in the San Francisco Bay area. That
paper was the Oakland Tribune. From Oakland, West went to New York
to work at the AP not long after Malcolm X was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the AP's Harlem bureau was up and running, the
summer of 1965 was fast approaching. Many news organizations
pondered the same question: ``What are blacks going to do?'' Little
did they know that black culture was about to take center stage.

</P>
<P>
   Mylus Martin hastened the call that brought me to New York City
and the Herald Tribune newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   It was the winter of 1966 and editors at the paper were in a
quandary. Claude Lewis, who had been recruited from Newsweek, had
left the paper for a job at the Philadelphia Bulletin. Lewis had
been the reporter the Trib counted on to cover the exploding story
of race. Now, the editors wanted a reporter to literally camp out
in Harlem and other ``Negro'' areas of New York to report and write
about what was taking place. A white reporter could not do that.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was the only reporter on the Trib, and he flat out
refused to cover the race story.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what I do,'' he argued. He said that he was trained
in music and that his skill was covering the arts. That was the
coverage he had come to the Trib to write, Martin said. ``Send
somebody else up to Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's steadfastness brought the call that I had been waiting
for in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have a problem covering that story?'' asked David
Laventhol, city editor of the Herald Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' I told him.
</P>
<P>
   And that was it. The story that Mylus Martin did not want became
the one that I could not get enough of. It was more than just a big
story. A massive redefinition of self was taking place in the
ghettos. Very little went unchallenged, and at the core was an
unprecedented embracing of blackness.
</P>
<P>
   The phrases ``Black is beautiful'' and ``I'm black and I'm
proud'' were said again and again on the streets. It was black
Africa, black America, black studies, black teachers, black
lawyers, black cops and black children. A whole world was exploding
around blackness.
</P>
<P>
   It was a revolution. As reporters, we were on the inside,
watching it all and telling of it as it happened.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just about skin color. This fact hit me with a bang
when, while covering my Harlem beat, I met two brothers, Elombe and
Kwame Brath.
</P>
<P>
   The Braths had been putting on the ``Naturally'' shows for years
_ shows that focused on black hair styles and fashions _ without
many people noticing. Still they kept going.
</P>
<P>
   But this was 1966 and times were changing. ``Naturally 1966''
caused a sensation. The shows featured women who were called ``the
Grandassa models'' (named after ``Grassaland,'' the name African
nationalist leader Carlos Cooks applied to Africa).
</P>
<P>
   The models had very dark complexions. And instead of
straightening their hair with hot combs, they wore ``naturals,''
later called ``Afros,'' which meant groomed and worn naturally.
</P>
<P>
   The Grandassa models were stunning. They were so dark that their
faces had a bluish shimmer. People described them as
``blue-black.'' You saw them and your mouth just fell open.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were ready,'' Elombe Brath recalled. ``The time was
right.'' And it was. A lot of women took to the ``natural'' look.
And nobody was neutral: You either liked it or you didn't.
</P>
<P>
   For us reporters, the ``race story'' was not simply about
covering riots. It was far more compelling than that, far more
socially significant. We realized we were at the eye of a profound
social shift.
</P>
<P>
   Our growing colony in New York City changed too, and in a
significant way. We were not all male anymore. Ruth Ross broke
through at Newsweek magazine. She started as a researcher in 1964.
In 1966, with the race story as important as any other, she became
the first woman to join our contingent as a reporter on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   And there was something else: A lot of black reporters also put
away the hot combs, the Dixie Peach, the Murray's hair dressings
and the stocking caps and showed up for work sporting ``Afro'' hair
styles.
</P>
<P>
   In more than a few newsrooms, all hell broke loose. At a TV
station where she was a reporter, Melba Tolliver was told that she
could not go on the air unless she first put on a scarf or
something to cover her Afro. She refused, but the station did not
back down until a black protest was mounted.
</P>
<P>
   At some other news outlets, editors ordered black reporters to
get hair cuts.
</P>
<P>
   It was not possible for me to separate myself entirely from the
movement that I had been thrust into. The ``roots'' that were being
examined were my roots too. And the activists pushing for this
change were young, many of them about my age. I gravitated to their
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   It rang true for me when they derisively attacked the word
``Negro'' (``knee-grow'') as something from cotton patches and
plantations. I was ready to shake ``Negro'' off too. The word
``black'' made sense. It linked black America to black Africa. I
wanted to be called black.
</P>
<P>
   I got rid of my hair grease and stocking caps. I let my hair
grow natural. The Afro I cultivated was modest, but that was the
way I wanted it. I could connect with the movement on the streets
and as a reporter, and still be considered promising by my white
editors at the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they understood.

<P>
   PRELUDE TO PART ONE: In August 1963, tensions between blacks and
whites in many cities across the United States were on the rise.
Crowds converged on the nation's capital for the historic March on
Washington. Earl Caldwell, then a reporter for the Lancaster
Intelligencer-Journal, joined his parents in the living room of
their home in central Pennsylvania to watch Martin Luther King Jr.
deliver what many call his finest speech. Ten days later, a bomb
exploded during Sunday services at a black church in Birmingham,
Ala., killing four girls. Across urban America, black populations
became restless, and newspaper editors began searching for
reporters who could get inside the ``ghettos'' to gather stories
from those black communities. The Democrat and Chronicle in
Rochester, N.Y., began to recruit Caldwell aggressively. In the
fall of 1963, he accepted the job. Here, Caldwell recounts his
first assignment for the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The story was boxed across the top of the front page of the
Sunday edition. It was even above the masthead. Of all the stories
I had ever written, nothing came close to this, my first story as a
reporter at the Democrat and Chronicle in Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the story herald my arrival, but there was also a
photograph of me, which was a way of letting readers know that for
the first time the newspaper had a reporter who was black.
</P>
<P>
   I'd arrived in town expecting the newspaper to make good on a
promise. Back when they were wooing me, I was told that if I
accepted the job, they would have an apartment waiting in a luxury
building not far from the newspaper. When I got to town and
mentioned all of this, I got a blank stare. Nobody knew what I was
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Dick Dougherty came up with his idea. He was the city
editor, and on my first day at the D&AMP;C, he told me that of all the
complaints that he was getting from blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say the housing here is really segregated,'' he said. ``I
don't know if that's true or not. You have to find an apartment. We
don't need to phony up anything. We can use your experience to tell
a true story of what the situation really is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you do it?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty was a tall, thin guy whose hair was white even though
he didn't look to be a day past 35. His style was low key but very
persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   I had never reported and written a story about race, and what
Dougherty was suggesting caught me off-guard. But I was just
starting out on a new job; there was no way I was going to say no
to my city editor.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty wanted two reporters on the story _ one white and one
black. The plan was for each of us to try separately to rent the
same apartment. The white reporter was Bill Vogler. He was a
veteran on the staff at the D&AMP;C and he liked the idea. The two of
us got newspapers and circled apartments in my price range. Then we
got started.
</P>
<P>
   After we had visited about five or six apartments, Vogler asked
me, ``Are you sure you're actually going into these places?''
</P>
<P>
   He did not understand. I would just reach the door and promptly
be told, ``The apartment has already been rented.'' Right after I
was told that no apartment was available, Vogler would visit the
same place and be invited inside. He'd get a whole spiel on how
great the apartment was, why he'd like it and what the neighborhood
had to offer.
</P>
<P>
   My experience was so different that at times it would be
downright embarrassing. One building had a big sign on the lawn,
Apartment for Rent. I was heading up the sidewalk when a window on
the second floor opened. A woman leaned out and hollered: ``If
you're coming for the apartment, forget it. It's already rented.''
</P>
<P>
   Once I explained all this to Vogler, we kept going. We visited
apartment after apartment. It was always the same: no to me, yes to
him. I just kept making notes of everything that happened. At the
typewriter, I got my chance to tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the story was published, blacks began showing up
in the newsroom ``to meet Earl Caldwell.'' Some would barge right
past the receptionist.
</P>
<P>
   These were not ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Some people called these visitors troublemakers. They called
themselves activists, which meant they were in the forefront of
stoking, shaping and channeling the anger they said was growing in
Rochester's two black communities, the Third and Seventh wards.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper itself was a target of their anger. They said they
never saw reporters in their neighborhoods ``except when there's
trouble'' and accused the newspaper of not covering the important
issues in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   They looked to me to change that. They said that they expected
to see me in their communities, to tell the stories that were not
being told. The irony was that in a sense, my editor and the
activists were saying the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find out what the facts are,'' Dougherty had
challenged me. ``We expect you to tell the story,'' the activists
said, inviting me to the ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   I was being handed what every reporter wants: a big and
important story.
</P>
<P>
   The front-page story of my experience in hunting an apartment
had given me the kind of notoriety that a reporter new in town
could only dream of. The reaction was overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Once the story was published, so many whites called to offer an
apartment that I had to write another piece just to tell that
story. One very nice woman, also white, did rent me a place not far
from the office.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I had settled in, black folks still hung a nickname
on me. They called me boll weevil. The name came from the title of
a popular song, and when they'd see me, they'd say, with a lot of
laughter, ``Here comes boll weevil. He's still looking for a
home.'''

</P>
<P>
   PRELUDE TO PART TWO: On a hot night in Harlem in July 1964, the
explosion came. After a white police officer had shot and killed a
black youth, riots erupted in the black neighborhoods in the
northeast _ a portent of what was to come. At the Democrat and
Chronicle, the city editor called Earl Caldwell to his desk. ``We
want you to go down to Harlem,'' he said. Although Caldwell had
visited New York, he had never been to Harlem. He grabbed a
notebook and a few clothes and headed for the airport, hoping that
his experience in Rochester had prepared him for the challenge in
New York City. Here, Caldwell describes what it was like for him
and other black reporters in Harlem during the riots, which raged
around them for three nights.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The rioting in Harlem came in furious bursts. Rocks and bottles
sailed from tenement roofs. Molotov cocktails exploded on streets
littered with broken glass.
</P>
<P>
   Cops fired salvo after salvo into smoky, pitch-black skies.
Police cruisers, sirens wailing, roared in pursuit of hit-and-run
looters.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds lined the streets, sometimes as many as a thousand
people, all of them black. They screamed, jeered, ducked, dodged
and _ when turned on by riot-weary cops _ scrambled and ran.
</P>
<P>
   And there we were, smack in the middle of it, with notebooks in
hand, dashing at the heels of the crowds, observing the battles and
trying as best we could to record it all.
</P>
<P>
   Frenzied as it was in those moments of battle, that's all they
were, moments. They would rise like a storm and then, just as
suddenly, dissipate. And with every inevitable lull in the action,
attention turned to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' people demanded. Some would reach for the press
credentials that dangled from our necks.
</P>
<P>
   We tried to explain ourselves. ``We're press,'' we said. But
that was not nearly explanation enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``What press?'' our inquisitors fired back.
</P>
<P>
   In that back-and-forth, something that even we had not realized
came into focus. Harlem cops and black residents had seen black
reporters before. But almost without exception those reporters
worked for black newspapers, mainly weeklies. This time we
represented mainstream white-owned daily newspapers and radio
stations, a major first.
</P>
<P>
   A small colony of reporters who were black had arrived in the
big leagues of New York City journalism. And this took everyone by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Having come from Rochester, I was as astonished as the police
and the blacks on the streets to see at least a dozen or so
reporters, all black like me, representing large and powerful
organizations such as The New York Times, the Associated Press, the
New York Post, the Daily News, United Press International, Newsday,
and Newsweek and Time magazines.
</P>
<P>
   In that week, I came to know reporters such as Gerald Fraser,
Austin Scott, Ted Poston, Tom Johnson, Les Carson, Claude Lewis,
Ted Jones, Junius Griffin, Wally Terry, Paul Hathaway, Gene Simpson
and Stan Scott.
</P>
<P>
   And on the streets of Harlem, between bursts of rioting, we
acknowledged with one another that we were a part of a bit of
history.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just that we were there. What was developing into one
of the biggest stories in America was largely in our hands. The
events unfolding on the streets of Harlem would make news all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been little more than a mere footnote but it was
still a piece of history in the making. Never had the major media
put so much of an important story in the hands of reporters who
were not white.
</P>
<P>
   Every chance they got, the cops would stare us down. It was as
though they could not accept that we were qualified and that our
reporting would be central to what people everywhere would read of
the Harlem riots.
</P>
<P>
   Some white reporters sought us out. They would shake our hands
and stay as close to us as possible. That put them closer to the
story. It also made them feel safer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a white New York Times photographer was jumped by a mob
and beaten so badly that the bones around his eyes were broken.
</P>
<P>
   The Times had two black reporters on the story, Junius Griffin
and Ted Jones, who set up a temporary bureau in the Theresa Hotel
at 125th Street and 7th Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin was a former Marine. He broke in as a journalist on
Stars and Stripes, the United States military newspaper. In Harlem,
he emerged a hero. He saw a group of blacks surround and threaten
three white reporters from the Journal-American, a Hearst
newspaper. He charged into the crowd, grabbed the reporters, and
walked them out unharmed. He knew that only a black reporter could
do that.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Jones made news too. He watched some cops chasing black
youths who had been throwing rocks and bottles. As the kids outran
the cops and got away, some in the crowd cheered derisively. In
frustration, the cops began to use their nightsticks at random.
Impulsively, Ted interceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people didn't do anything,'' he yelled.
</P>
<P>
   When the cops ignored him and continued swinging their batons
wildly, he pressed forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no right to beat these people,'' he insisted. ``You
cannot do that. You can't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' a cop barked, irritated.
</P>
<P>
   Ted grabbed his press card and held it out. ``The New York
Times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get out of here,'' the cop ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and heavyset, Ted refused to budge. As the cops continued
their attack, he was knocked to the ground. He wasn't injured, only
shook up, but what happened to him became a part of the news story.
</P>
<P>
   The riots raged through three nights, and at the end of each
day, long after the crowds and the cops had drifted away, the
reporters would still be on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   We could sense that something enormous was happening and that it
was our destiny to be at the center of it. Hanging together, we
quickly discovered the many paths we'd taken to get where we were
at that moment and the circumstance of timing that had opened the
door for us.

<P>
   PRELUDE TO PART THREE: Hours after the Harlem riot, thousands of
blacks streamed into the streets of Rochester, N.Y., in frenzied
mobs. They were followed by a horde of reporters. Still in his
hotel room in Harlem, Earl Caldwell received a frantic phone call
from Dick Dougherty, the city editor at the Democrat and Chronicle,
who ordered him to return to Rochester to cover the breaking
events. Here, Caldwell describes the social unrest that gripped
Rochester after the street rioting ended, his chance to meet and
talk with Malcolm X, and one of the most important lessons he
learned about being a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   A lot happened in Rochester before I was to say my last
good-bye. The riots had shifted the dynamic there. Blacks savored a
newfound power to force the white leadership to address
longstanding grievances. Whites were scared. Would future rioting
be confined to the ghetto, or would it spread downtown to white
areas of the city?
</P>
<P>
   Anxieties mounted when a coalition of religious groups brought
in Saul Alinsky, already a legend as a white organizer who taught
confrontational politics to ghetto activists. From this emerged
FIGHT, a militant direct-action group whose members were soon
marching into executive boardrooms demanding jobs and investments
in the black neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Rochester was getting a reputation. The ultimate confirmation of
that came when Malcolm X accepted an invitation to address a black
church there in February 1965.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Malcolm was involved in a dispute with Elijah
Muhammad's black Muslim organization. Four days before his
scheduled appearance in Rochester, his home in Queens, N.Y., was
firebombed.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X,'' Alex Haley told of how
Malcolm, ``barking commands and snatching up screaming frightened
children, got the family safely out of the back door into the
yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm was sure that his enemies in Elijah Muhammad's group
were responsible for the attack. That feud seemed to be turning
lethal.
</P>
<P>
   In Rochester, there was speculation that the speech would be
canceled. But Malcolm arrived at Corn Hill Methodist Church on Feb.
16 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   I was stunned when my editors assigned another reporter to cover
Malcolm's speech. They pulled me aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be trouble,'' I was told. ``We need you to handle
the street action.'' Although devastated, I accepted the
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the speech, a huge crowd was at the church. A
source whispered to me that Malcolm X wanted to meet later with
some local people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like you to be there,'' I was told.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm delivered a powerful speech, which I watched from the
back of the church.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he stood up, he was saying, ``My reason for being
here is to discuss the black revolution that is going on, that's
taking place on this earth. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone jammed into the church hung on his every word.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the problems of the black man here in this country today
have ceased to be a problem of just the American Negro or an
American problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a professor, he delivered his analysis in lecture style.
Then, about halfway through, he zeroed in on his target of the
night: the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're not against people because they're white. But we're
against those who practice racism. ... And because we're against
it, the press says we're violent. We're not for violence. We're for
peace. But the people that we're up against are for violence.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice, at first professorial, began to rise. ``This is what
the racists have always done ... And then they use the press to
make (it) look like the victim is the criminal, and the criminal is
the victim. ... They take the press, and through the press they
beat the system ... They use the press to get public opinion on
their side. ... They take statistics, and through the press they
feed them to the public. They make it appear that the role of crime
in the black community is higher than it is anywhere else. ... And
the whites go along with it. Because they think that everybody over
there's a criminal anyway. This is what the press does.''
</P>
<P>
   Through most of an hour, Malcolm X cited example after example
of how the press was used against black people. As he made his
case, many in the crowd stood and shouted their approval.
</P>
<P>
   I began to feel relieved that I was not covering his speech. I
also realized that I could not go to his hotel later with the
others. He was so damning in his indictment that I was convinced
that the meeting would be a ``get the press'' session. As a
representative of the local paper, I did not feel that I should be
there.
</P>
<P>
   As much as I wanted to meet Malcolm, I did not go.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, on Feb. 21, a cold and snowy Sunday, I was at
work at the Democrat and Chronicle. Sundays were always slow and I
was standing in the wire room, watching the various stories come in
over the teletype machines.
</P>
<P>
   I was there when the teletype bell began to ring, alerting
editors that a very important story was about to move. And that
day, when the bell began to ring, I hovered over the machine and
watched in horror as the bulletin came in that Malcolm X had been
shot and killed just as he was starting to deliver a speech at the
Audubon Ballroom in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the lesson driven home was that a reporter's job
required toughness and that journalism was not the place for one
easily embarrassed or intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   I had missed my chance to meet and talk with Malcolm X. I vowed
never to make a similar mistake.

</P>
<P>
   In Harlem on the Sunday that Malcolm X was killed, two
reporters, Stan Scott and Gene Simpson, were right up front in the
Audubon Ballroom, so close to the podium that when the shooting
started, they had to dive to the floor for cover.
</P>
<P>
   Being there changed a lot for Scott and Simpson. But how they
came to be in the ballroom that afternoon played a large part in
ushering in a whole new era for black reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In the epilogue to ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X,'' the
writer Alex Haley explained that on the day he was killed, Malcolm
X had specifically ordered that no press be allowed inside the
Audubon Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   When Scott and Simpson arrived for Malcolm's meeting, their
press credentials were in clear view. At the door, the men were
greeted by one of Malcolm's lieutenants. ``No press allowed,'' he
told them.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned, the two stood pondering the ``no press'' edict.
Malcolm's aide pointed to their credentials and offered a
suggestion. ``Put 'em in your pocket,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They complied. ``As black citizens, you can go on in,'' the aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   And that afternoon Stan Scott and Gene Simpson got what
reporters dream of _ the experience of being there, of being
wherever it is at the precise moment that something truly important
happens.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence in the Audobon Ballroom that day changed the two
reporters' professional lives, for the better. Scott, who was
working for United Press International, was lured away to join
WINS, New York City's leading all-news radio station. Simpson, a
reporter for WMCA radio, left to join CBS radio's all-news
operation.
</P>
<P>
   But more significant than what happened to those news reporters
was the action taken by Malcolm X's supporters in the wake of his
murder. What the supporters did brought a swift, definable change
to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm's aides had concluded that their leader's ``no press''
order was proof that the time had come in which the black community
and black meetings should be off limits to white reporters. And
they also believed that if Malcolm had made an exception for black
reporters, so should they.
</P>
<P>
   So, grieving and wanting to honor their slain leader, they made
it their cause to keep white reporters out of meetings among
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long after, as a reporter for the Herald Tribune, I
witnessed nothing more shocking than the tense confrontations that
ensued when white reporters showed up in Harlem and other black
communities to cover meetings and rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom did anybody ever bar them at the door. The reporters
would be allowed inside and even get seated. It was like baiting a
trap.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the meeting was about to begin, someone would shout,
``Wait, wait, wait,'' and, pointing toward the reporters who were
white, would ask: ``What are they doing in here?''
</P>
<P>
   And then the show was on. Voices got louder, people jumped to
their feet, and immediately they began shouting the demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``White reporters out! White reporters out!''
</P>
<P>
   When the white reporters did not leave fast enough or dared to
argue a right to stay, they would be grabbed and roughly ushered
out the door. Those of us who were reporters and black discreetly
put our notebooks and pencils away, but we did not budge from our
seats and nobody ever tried to force us out.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press, already embarrassed at being scooped by
UPI on the assassination of Malcolm X, responded by opening a news
bureau in the heart of Harlem. Gil Scott and Hollie West, both
blacks, were the two reporters assigned to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Scott, born and raised in Brooklyn, N.Y., began his career
in journalism in 1957 as a desk assistant at CBS. In 1959, he moved
to the Reporter-Dispatch in White Plains, N.Y., where he worked as
a sportswriter. His career was interrupted briefly when he was
recalled to active duty in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he joined the Newark News, where he and John Dotson
were the only black reporters on staff. Gil Scott stayed there
until he was hired by the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   An Oklahoma native, Hollie West, in 1963, became the first black
reporter on a daily newspaper in the San Francisco Bay area. That
paper was the Oakland Tribune. From Oakland, West went to New York
to work at the AP not long after Malcolm X was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the AP's Harlem bureau was up and running, the
summer of 1965 was fast approaching. Many news organizations
pondered the same question: ``What are blacks going to do?'' Little
did they know that black culture was about to take center stage.

</P>
<P>
   Mylus Martin hastened the call that brought me to New York City
and the Herald Tribune newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   It was the winter of 1966 and editors at the paper were in a
quandary. Claude Lewis, who had been recruited from Newsweek, had
left the paper for a job at the Philadelphia Bulletin. Lewis had
been the reporter the Trib counted on to cover the exploding story
of race. Now, the editors wanted a reporter to literally camp out
in Harlem and other ``Negro'' areas of New York to report and write
about what was taking place. A white reporter could not do that.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was the only reporter on the Trib, and he flat out
refused to cover the race story.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what I do,'' he argued. He said that he was trained
in music and that his skill was covering the arts. That was the
coverage he had come to the Trib to write, Martin said. ``Send
somebody else up to Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's steadfastness brought the call that I had been waiting
for in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have a problem covering that story?'' asked David
Laventhol, city editor of the Herald Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' I told him.
</P>
<P>
   And that was it. The story that Mylus Martin did not want became
the one that I could not get enough of. It was more than just a big
story. A massive redefinition of self was taking place in the
ghettos. Very little went unchallenged, and at the core was an
unprecedented embracing of blackness.
</P>
<P>
   The phrases ``Black is beautiful'' and ``I'm black and I'm
proud'' were said again and again on the streets. It was black
Africa, black America, black studies, black teachers, black
lawyers, black cops and black children. A whole world was exploding
around blackness.
</P>
<P>
   It was a revolution. As reporters, we were on the inside,
watching it all and telling of it as it happened.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just about skin color. This fact hit me with a bang
when, while covering my Harlem beat, I met two brothers, Elombe and
Kwame Brath.
</P>
<P>
   The Braths had been putting on the ``Naturally'' shows for years
_ shows that focused on black hair styles and fashions _ without
many people noticing. Still they kept going.
</P>
<P>
   But this was 1966 and times were changing. ``Naturally 1966''
caused a sensation. The shows featured women who were called ``the
Grandassa models'' (named after ``Grassaland,'' the name African
nationalist leader Carlos Cooks applied to Africa).
</P>
<P>
   The models had very dark complexions. And instead of
straightening their hair with hot combs, they wore ``naturals,''
later called ``Afros,'' which meant groomed and worn naturally.
</P>
<P>
   The Grandassa models were stunning. They were so dark that their
faces had a bluish shimmer. People described them as
``blue-black.'' You saw them and your mouth just fell open.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were ready,'' Elombe Brath recalled. ``The time was
right.'' And it was. A lot of women took to the ``natural'' look.
And nobody was neutral: You either liked it or you didn't.
</P>
<P>
   For us reporters, the ``race story'' was not simply about
covering riots. It was far more compelling than that, far more
socially significant. We realized we were at the eye of a profound
social shift.
</P>
<P>
   Our growing colony in New York City changed too, and in a
significant way. We were not all male anymore. Ruth Ross broke
through at Newsweek magazine. She started as a researcher in 1964.
In 1966, with the race story as important as any other, she became
the first woman to join our contingent as a reporter on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   And there was something else: A lot of black reporters also put
away the hot combs, the Dixie Peach, the Murray's hair dressings
and the stocking caps and showed up for work sporting ``Afro'' hair
styles.
</P>
<P>
   In more than a few newsrooms, all hell broke loose. At a TV
station where she was a reporter, Melba Tolliver was told that she
could not go on the air unless she first put on a scarf or
something to cover her Afro. She refused, but the station did not
back down until a black protest was mounted.
</P>
<P>
   At some other news outlets, editors ordered black reporters to
get hair cuts.
</P>
<P>
   It was not possible for me to separate myself entirely from the
movement that I had been thrust into. The ``roots'' that were being
examined were my roots too. And the activists pushing for this
change were young, many of them about my age. I gravitated to their
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   It rang true for me when they derisively attacked the word
``Negro'' (``knee-grow'') as something from cotton patches and
plantations. I was ready to shake ``Negro'' off too. The word
``black'' made sense. It linked black America to black Africa. I
wanted to be called black.
</P>
<P>
   I got rid of my hair grease and stocking caps. I let my hair
grow natural. The Afro I cultivated was modest, but that was the
way I wanted it. I could connect with the movement on the streets
and as a reporter, and still be considered promising by my white
editors at the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they understood.

 &HT;    Battling cellulite can be costly, ineffective
 &HT;    By Stephanie Allmon

<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Cellulite. For millions of women, it's an obvious
condition without an obvious solution; a universal enigma with no
universal explanation.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 99 percent of women in the world may be plagued with
the mysterious trenches that blemish pastures of otherwise smooth,
firm skin.
</P>
<P>
   Some women may not know exactly what it is, but they'll wrap it,
rub it, peel it, baste it and vacuum it to try and make it
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   For some, cellulite is a painful problem; for others, an ugly
annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cellulite is not a health issue. It's a beauty issue,'' said
Dr. Charles Verheyden, president of the Texas Society of Plastic
Surgeons and director of the plastic surgery division at Scott and
White Hospital. ``There's not a real good understanding of even why
cellulite happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellulite is not fat. In fact, even the slimmest, most toned
women can have ``cottage cheese thighs'' or ``dimpled derrieres.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellulite forms when circulation slows down and body fluids that
bathe fatty tissues and fibers are flooded with waste materials.
The liquid pushes away fat cells and hardens to form immovable
pockets between the skin and the deep layers of fat, said Mary
Haymore, who has studied massage and alternative medicine in Europe
and is president and CEO of The Spa at Canyon Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Water retention, lack of proper circulation, poor nutrition and
hormones further aggravate the problem, Haymore said.
</P>
<P>
   Because much of the problem has to do with retaining fluids,
advanced cellulite can result in painful swelling for some women,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   If the explanation sounds complicated, choosing a solution among
those in the $100 million cellulite industry can be even more
confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Verheyden said when women come into his office and want him to
banish their cellulite, he can't offer a sure-fire way to do so.
Not even liposuction, used to remove fat cells, can help in most
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes liposuction will help, particularly if it's done
close to the skin, but it can be overdone, and more dimples are
created because of the liposuction itself,'' he said. ``If they
really had a good technique for dealing with it, you could fill up
your office with women who want it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, women show up at spas to wrap themselves up with $85
seaweed concoctions and at cosmetic counters to rub themselves down
with $75 skin creams.
</P>
<P>
   Body wraps and creams work on the premise that applying minerals
and oils topically will seep through pores and into the body to
dissolve cellulite. A bottle of lotion or weekly seaweed wraps
might make the skin look smoother, but Haymore warns that they are
not overnight panaceas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most women in the United States want a quick fix,'' she said.
``But (cellulite) will come back if you don't change your
lifestyle. Cellulite treatments can help as long as you're doing
other things _ exercising and eating a healthy, natural diet.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the message that Van Smith-Davis tries to convey every
day in her job as fitness coordinator at Baylor University. She
said she is skeptical when she hears about cellulite treatments
because of the high-priced miracles that many companies promise.
</P>
<P>
   She recommends eating a balanced diet and exercising, especially
lifting weights, for a firmer, more toned figure.
</P>
<P>
   What about women who are in shape, exercise regularly, but still
have cellulite?
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Cromwell thinks she has finally found an answer. The
tall, slim owner of Formela Skin Care Center in Waco, said she
underwent thousands of body wraps for her cellulite without getting
the results she wanted.
</P>
<P>
   In October, she invested $40,000 in a computerized
``Endermologie'' machine that looks like a robot but performs the
same function as a household appliance _ a vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   The machine uses vacuumlike pressure to smooth out
cellulite-laden areas of the body. For most women, a minimum of 14
treatments of 35 minutes each are recommended, plus monthly
maintenance treatments. The cost? Anywhere from $75 to $100 per
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved
Endermologie, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons released a
statement saying, ``there is very little scientific evidence to
suggest that this mechanical method of massage is effective in
permanently changing the appearance and the shape of the skin.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a study by researchers at Vanderbilt University
conducted on Yucatan minipigs, whose skin structure is similar to
humans', found that those who received a full course of
Endermologie treatments actually formed new layers of smoother
skin.
</P>
<P>
   As with all new medical discoveries, more tests need to take
place to reproduce positive results, Verheyden said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can come out with some stuff, market it, tell women their
fat will go away and make several million bucks, but it's hard to
measure because the results are mixed,'' he said. ``For something
to be scientifically valid, it must be measurable and repeatable.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Cromwell said, even if Endermologie doesn't
produce drastic results in a woman, it can at least make her feel
better about herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I feel better, I'm more productive and a better person
if I feel like I look better,'' she said. ``But any kind of massage
is better for your health.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith-Davis said she feels it's unfortunate that so many women
try so hard to get rid of cellulite for beauty's sake. But if
cellulite makes them pay more attention to their bodies, they might
start paying more attention to their health, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern should not be about cellulite, it should be about
living a healthy lifestyle, and (reducing cellulite) could be
another benefit of exercise and eating right,'' she said. ``I would
say definitely worry about leading a healthier lifestyle, but not
to put cellulite at the forefront for a reason to work out.

 &HT;    A chance to tell the world of `The Kindness of Strangers'
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ I know some of you will not be at all
surprised that I might have a hand in helping inspire a television
series.
</P>
<P>
   No, I'm sure I'll get a call asking me the time and channel of
new series, ``The Creature From the Black Lagoon,'' or perhaps,
``Lost in Space.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not, but it is a pretty safe bet no one is going to
be thinking I inspired ``Hercules,'' either. Of course, that is a
good thing.
</P>
<P>
   I am not much of a television watcher unless it is sports or
rapidly breaking news of some sort. In my mind, those are the
things television does well. I'm willing to give the devil that
much of his due.
</P>
<P>
   But if Andy Rodriguez-McCradic has his way, the quality of
television is about to take a tremendous upswing and, I must admit,
I'm honored I might have played even a tiny part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiny'' is the operative word here.
</P>
<P>
   Last year I wrote a column about a friend of mine who found
himself blessed by spending $1.72 to commit a random act of
kindness by buying the take-out order of the person directly behind
him. That column was my weekly offering to the world at-large, sent
out via wire to several hundred newspapers for any who might have
wanted to use it.
</P>
<P>
   It just so happens that one of those newspapers was the Arizona
Republic, Phoenix's daily paper and one that Rodriguez-McCradic
reads. Editors there ran it and Rodriguez-McCradic read it.
Apparently, a seed was planted.
</P>
<P>
   He began thinking about it. Enough so that on Christmas Eve, he
performed a random act of kindness in the same way as my friend, by
paying for a drive-through meal. He got the same incredible charge
as my friend.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't need any more convincing that this is a feeling and a
movement that needs to sweep across the country and the world.
</P>
<P>
   And Andy Rodriguez-McCradic has just the way to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez-McCradic is a 16-year veteran of television and film
in the Phoenix area with eight of those years as a producer for an
NBC-affiliate. In 1993, he moved mostly to motion picture work, but
now he is looking to get back into the television-producing
business.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to do a program which he has tentatively titled, ``The
Kindness of Strangers,'' about the power of random acts of kindness
for both the giver, the receiver and even those who merely witness
them.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez-McCradic is convinced _ and so am I _ that viewers
would turn on to such a show in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time is right to do this show,'' he wrote me. ``I
absolutely guarantee 'Strangers' will be a ratings giant within
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   What Rodriguez-McCradic needs now is the opportunity to get it
on the air. He has some support for the program already promised
but pitching an unproved idea must not be easy in the television
industry. Now, if he were selling, ``The Kindness of Strangers _
Gone Bad,'' it might be another story.
</P>
<P>
   But Rodriguez-McCradic knows television and motion pictures _ he
has a Rocky Mountain Emmy to his credit and has directed one
action-adventure movie _ and long before he ever saw my column, he
knew about acts of kindness, random and otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 he saved an elderly woman from four attackers in Tucson
and he has been honored by the city of Tempe, Ariz., for rescuing a
man from a burning building.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to do a simple random act of kindness yourself,
here's an idea: Give Rodriguez-McCradic an e-mail at
newphx(at)juno.com and tell him you wish him well.
</P>
<P>
   He's standing up to make the world a better place and I, for
one, am ready to stand beside him.

Messenger. His e-mail is platham(at)coxnews.com.

 &HT;    Stop the whirl, get in step
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ I had planned the perfect evening, the stuff of
which memories are made, so of course things were bound to go
desperately wrong.
</P>
<P>
   I was taking my 17-year-old nephew, Scott, to dinner and the
theater _ Peasant Stock on the River and the Muse Machine's
production of ``My Favorite Year,'' starring several of his
Fairmont High School buddies. What a perfect opportunity to
introduce Scott to the fine dining and high culture with which we
adults habitually surround ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   The tragic flaw in my plan turned out to be the alternator on my
1989 Toyota Corolla. As I sailed down the street, my car died.
Suddenly. Completely.
</P>
<P>
   That was depressing enough, but it wasn't the most depressing
thing. The most depressing thing was the reaction of my fellow
motorists. Not so much the scores who ignored my plight _ how many
times had I done the same thing myself? _ as the ones who became
enraged by it. Drivers honked, scowled, zoomed around me. An
sport-utility driver passed on the right by driving on yards and
sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   My faith in humanity stood ready to plummet lower than the stock
market in '29, when he appeared, a good Samaritan in sweatpants. He
helped me to back my car into a nearby driveway and even offered to
push my car across four lanes of traffic to the UDF parking lot.
``This is a job for a tow truck,'' I insisted.
</P>
<P>
   What would become of us if there were no people like my rescuer?
If nobody had the time, or the patience, to lend a hand to those
who have fallen out of step?
</P>
<P>
   I could identify with the drivers who hadn't stopped, pressed
for time or concerned with safety. But I couldn't understand what
made people so angry, so impatient.
</P>
<P>
   Or could I? How many times had I become impatient with those who
had fallen behind, broken down?
</P>
<P>
   Had I never ignored someone calling out to me on the street _
only to find, in more than a few cases, they were telling me I had
dropped my hat or gloves?
</P>
<P>
   Had I never felt resentment at picking up a colleague's workload
when he had the bad timing to be stricken with the flu on deadline?
</P>
<P>
   Had I never lost patience with my children when they fell out of
step?
</P>
<P>
   Hmm, well, this morning comes to mind. My son sat at the table
for 20 minutes without touching his breakfast _ a fact I discovered
only as we were on our way out the door.
</P>
<P>
   I tossed the bagel to Alec like a lethal Frisbee. ``Eat your
breakfast or you'll never watch TV again for the rest of your
life!'' I barked.
</P>
<P>
   My yelling, he rebuked, was not improving his appetite. So
naturally, I yelled some more. ``I wasn't yelling until I found out
you didn't eat your breakfast!''
</P>
<P>
   Never one to miss an opportunity for the dramatic, Alec sniffed,
``When you yell at me, it's like I'm at the edge of a cliff, and
instead of helping me back up, you're pushing me off.''
</P>
<P>
   That made me laugh _ a step in the right direction. I finally
stopped yelling, and Alec finally started nibbling his bagel.
</P>
<P>
   Things have a way of turning out in the end, if you'll only be
patient. My car was on the road again the day after it broke down,
and my nephew chauffeured me to the Victoria Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Scott and I never made it to Peasant Stock that freezing-cold
night, but Subway never tasted so good. And young singers and
dancers never sounded so good.
</P>
<P>
   Scott beamed and cheered for his old classmates. They sparkled,
they dazzled, they never fell out of step.
</P>
<P>
   But if they had, I like to imagine we would have cheered them
all the same.

 &HT;    Good tool books always welcome
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You would think that there would be little room for
yet another book on the purchase, care and use of any major shop
tool, but here's one worthy of consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The Bandsaw Book, by Lonnie Bird, is a $20 paperback from The
Taunton Press with a great deal of interesting material.
</P>
<P>
   Bird discusses in considerable detail all the mechanical issues
of this most useful but temperamental tool. There are several
pages, for instance, devoted to the various kinds of blade guides,
including homemade ones, which the author favors.
</P>
<P>
   There's an entire chapter and great detail on choosing blades,
and another on tuning the saw _ a large measure of which is proper
tension on the blade. There are extensive discussions of various
cutting techniques and shop-made jigs for the bandsaw, and a
handful of projects thrown in to satisfy the endless demand for
such things.
</P>
<P>
   This is probably the best single book on the market for the
bandsaw user, and especially for someone considering the purchase
of a bandsaw.
</P>
<P>
   Another book of interest, on a subject not exactly flooded with
material, is one called Woodburning by Betty Auth. A $15 paperback
from Lark books, it advertises ``20 Great-looking Projects to
Decorate in a Weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of them, of course, are great looking, but some
certainly are, proving once again that even such a lowly technique
as woodburning can be raised to an art form through skill and
imagination. The book also delves into the technique of coloring
the woodburnt images, which is a surprisingly tasteful effect when
done with restraint.
</P>
<P>
   While this is a book of patterns intended to be executed on
purchased pieces, achieving the desired effects is going to be well
beyond the capacity of its audience. Certainly you can execute this
kind of thing in a weekend once you've learned the craft, but it
will take somewhat more than a weekend to reach that point.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot see photographs of woodburning without having the smell
of the process fill my nostalgic nostrils from my own childish
efforts 50 years and more ago.
</P>
<P>
   Every time this happens, I threaten to get the proper equipment
and try again.

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ My wife found two poodles by the side of the
road and brought them home. We already had eight dogs, all of which
came from either the side of the road or the pound, including a
little white poodle of our own. Our rule is to take all the dogs
God sends us. But how many, oh Lord, how many? (Murray, Cox News
Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   LATHAM-COLUMN _ MARSHALL, Texas _ A TV producer wants to do a
program which he has tentatively titled, ``The Kindness of
Strangers,'' about the power of random acts of kindness for both
the giver, the receiver and even those who merely witness them.
Rodriguez-McCradic is convinced _ and so am I _ that viewers would
turn on to such a show in more ways than one. (Latham, Marshall
News Messenger) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ The most depressing thing when
my car broke down recently was the reaction of my fellow motorists.
Not so much the scores who ignored my plight _ how many times had I
done the same thing myself? _ as the ones who became enraged by it.
(McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ The religious right was declared politically
dead last year but _ the mummy walks! That was the news from the
Iowa caucuses, not the fact that Republican front-runner George W.
Bush and Democratic front-runner Al Gore ran in front. (Tom Teepen
is national correspondent for Cox Newspapers.) MOVED THURSDAY FOR
SUNDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ In the Elian Gonzalez case, if you strip away
the drama, the chicanery, the tragedy of the situation, what you
have is an ideological struggle: She won't do this, he won't do
that, anti-Castroites are in the house next door, there's a Cuban
Interest Section man hiding in the plane, the nun is anti-embargo,
the nun favors the exiles _ every bit of bilge and drivel possible.
I do believe the Cubans involved _ both in the U.S. and Cuba _
could wage a similar brawl over possession of a cocker spaniel.
(Howard Kleinberg is a columnist for Cox News Service.) MOVED
THURSDAY FOR SUNDAY.
</P>
<P>
   GLASS-COLUMN _ No great outcry was heard the other day after a
hard-line member of the U.S. Senate, where the Republicans control
55 of 100 seats, denounced the United Nations to its face and
extolled the virtues of the former Reagan era. Jesse Helms' highly
confrontational debut before the Security Council raised two
issues. (Andy Glass is a columnist for Cox News Service in the
Washington bureau.) MOVED THURSDAY FOR SUNDAY.

by the late Robert Shaw for solo passages in recent symphony
recordings. She has been doing solo work in the area and had an

   VIRGINIA-STATESONG _ Maybe the Virginia Legislature should just

song, doesn't need one. After retiring ``Carry Me Back to Old
Virginia'' because of its anachronistic references to ``darkeys''

a year of heated controversy and name-calling _ the Legislature has

This year some metro Atlanta schools are doing something different.
They're allowing the Mormon kids to meet on the school premises

 &HT;    Florists: Order now, don't wait until the last minute
 &HT;    By Stephen J. O'Brien
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Even though florists spend their time delivering
gifts of love and romance for their customers, Kathryn Miele wants
you to know something now that Valentine's Day is just around the
corner: The flower people have feelings, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Valentine's Day is definitely one of the busiest times of the
year, and it all happens on one day,'' said Miele, director of
marketing for the California Cut Flowers Commission. ``There's only
a small window of opportunity, and florists have to work overtime
to get all the orders filled.''
</P>
<P>
   What Miele and other florists want flower buyers to do, men and
women alike, is order now. Don't wait until the last minute. Many
florists are expecting an even crazier time this year because
Valentine's Day, Feb. 14, falls on a Monday. Making a late order
the night before may be impossible, so the phone may be ringing
like crazy Monday morning at many florists.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times it's so busy on Valentine's Day, we can't even
get to the phone to tell people `No,''' said Mary Ann Tovar, owner
of L&AMP;M Gifts and Flowers in Waco. ``I think it's going to be pretty
hectic this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with additional employees added in February to help create
arrangements, take calls and make deliveries, the Valentine's Day
crunch means long hours and, sometimes, turning customers down,
Tovar said. Not only is time a factor, but many popular flowers,
like roses and tulips, are out of supply by the time some
procrastinators call. That's why people should order at least a
week or more ahead of time, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Reed, owner of Reed's Flowers in Waco, said the annual
Valentine's Day crunch has led him to suggest that customers order
_ and celebrate _ early if possible.

   ``We get calls for things that have to be prepared and delivered
immediately, and that makes it tough,'' Reed said. ``You do your
best. Delivery is the big problem. That's the reason we try to get
it spread out over two or three days.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that the major purchasers of flowers on
Valentine's Day are men, Miele said. She declined to call those of
the male gender a bunch of disorganized procrastinators, but
acknowledged a fairly strong correlation between men and late
flower orders nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll say this,'' Miele said. ``I think a lot of men don't
consider that Valentine's Day is just around the corner. They have
a lot on their minds, and many tend to just put it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Roses, a perennial Valentine's Day favorite, are expected to be
the top seller again this year. But no matter what kind of flowers
you're sending to that someone special, placing your order now is
the best way to ensure the right arrangement will be available.
</P>
<P>
   And, while you're at it, Miele suggests, sign up for a florist's
``reminder list,'' which will allow the florist to call and alert
you to certain dates, like mom's birthday or your wedding
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great service,'' she said. ``It helps out in case you
forget.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT DOES THAT BOUQUET REALLY SAY?
</P>
<P>
   What message are you sending with that bouquet of roses on
Valentine's Day? It might not be exactly what you mean.
</P>
<P>
   In Victorian times, flowers were assigned particular meanings
that were understood by the receiver. Here are a few from the book
``The Language of Flowers'' by Margaret Pickston.

 &HT;    Good tool books always welcome
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You would think that there would be little room for
yet another book on the purchase, care and use of any major shop
tool, but here's one worthy of consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The Bandsaw Book, by Lonnie Bird, is a $20 paperback from The
Taunton Press with a great deal of interesting material.
</P>
<P>
   Bird discusses in considerable detail all the mechanical issues
of this most useful but temperamental tool. There are several
pages, for instance, devoted to the various kinds of blade guides,
including homemade ones, which the author favors.
</P>
<P>
   There's an entire chapter and great detail on choosing blades,
and another on tuning the saw _ a large measure of which is proper
tension on the blade. There are extensive discussions of various
cutting techniques and shop-made jigs for the bandsaw, and a
handful of projects thrown in to satisfy the endless demand for
such things.
</P>
<P>
   This is probably the best single book on the market for the
bandsaw user, and especially for someone considering the purchase
of a bandsaw.
</P>
<P>
   Another book of interest, on a subject not exactly flooded with
material, is one called Woodburning by Betty Auth. A $15 paperback
from Lark books, it advertises ``20 Great-looking Projects to
Decorate in a Weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of them, of course, are great looking, but some
certainly are, proving once again that even such a lowly technique
as woodburning can be raised to an art form through skill and
imagination. The book also delves into the technique of coloring
the woodburnt images, which is a surprisingly tasteful effect when
done with restraint.
</P>
<P>
   While this is a book of patterns intended to be executed on
purchased pieces, achieving the desired effects is going to be well
beyond the capacity of its audience. Certainly you can execute this
kind of thing in a weekend once you've learned the craft, but it
will take somewhat more than a weekend to reach that point.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot see photographs of woodburning without having the smell
of the process fill my nostalgic nostrils from my own childish
efforts 50 years and more ago.
</P>
<P>
   Every time this happens, I threaten to get the proper equipment
and try again.

 &HT;    CHARITABLE BUSINESS GROUPS SEEM 'STALE' TO HIGH-TECH CROWD
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Jan. 30
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Strobe lights flashed and rock music pounded.
The speakers rode to the podium on mountain bikes. Participants
were urged to throw whiffle balls whenever they disliked what a
speaker was saying. A meeting of fraternity brothers?
</P>
<P>
   No, the noisy assembly was staged for about 300 technology
business leaders who wanted to discuss ways of helping their
community. ``We are extremely different,'' organizer Steve
Papermaster declared at the start of the 360.00 Summit, billed as a
gathering to spur a new era of community involvement.
</P>
<P>
   But while the tech executives made many references to the
uniqueness of their newfound spirit of generosity, the old-line
business leaders who meet every Tuesday for their Rotary Club
luncheon may not be so impressed. Since 1913, the Rotary Club of
Austin has been bringing together executives and professionals to
help raise money for abused children.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the second annual 360 Summit was different from a
Rotary meeting. The Pledge of Allegiance was not recited, no
rousing rendition of ``God Bless America'' sung, no reverent prayer
offered.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the underlying reasons for the gathering were the same that
drove Chicago businessmen to organize the original Rotary in 1905:
Some rich guys in a boom town wanted to foster camaraderie and
prompt good works.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of the 1900s, the Industrial Age was changing
every aspect of the U.S. economy. Millions of Americans were
leaving farms to find work in emerging industries involving autos,
steel, tires and rail. The technological breakthroughs that created
those jobs were generating immense fortunes, and spinning off
serious social problems, such as pollution, housing shortages and
traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   As in other cities around the country, a Rotary Club was formed
in Austin to help smooth out the rougher edges of runaway
capitalism. In the club's first year, ``they took up a collection
for Christmas gifts for poor children,'' said Nancy McCoy,
executive director of the Rotary Club of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   That early charitable effort continues today in the form of a
long-term relationship with the Helping Hand Home for Children, a
residential treatment center for abused youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   So with Rotary _ or the Lions, Optimists and the Junior League _
already helping the community, why don't the well-intentioned tech
titans of 2000 join up?
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that people involved in new technologies perceive
the meetings of traditional service organizations as ``boring,''
Papermaster said. ``That may or may not be fair ... but the old
organizations seem stale.''
</P>
<P>
   Summit participants agreed. If the same gathering had been
organized by a Rotary Club, Ross Garber, chairman of Vignette
Corp., said he would not have attended because he has so little in
common with Old Economy business owners. ``We don't know how to
talk to each other'' from across the digital divide, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At least on the surface, tech executives do appear to have very
different values and norms from members of more business service
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a Rotary meeting typically involves a lot of dark
suits, white shirts and formal speeches.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the 360.00 Summit featured many speakers in jeans
and open-necked shirts. The panel discussion featuring Michael
Dell, founder of Dell Computer Corp., was labeled a ``Happy Hour.''
Dell and other the panelists sat on bar stools while a blond
waitress brought out martini glasses for them.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kornblum, an associate with Austin Ventures and a summit
participant, said that irreverent tone suits the tech crowd. ``This
is a highly cynical group,'' hardened by long hours and intense
pressures, he said. Tech workers sometimes make overnight fortunes
but also ``face a lot of failures,'' he said. Such extreme highs
and lows leave them impatient with rituals and regular meetings, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, most old-line service groups flourished in the late
1940s and 1950s when returning veterans sought ways to rekindle the
camaraderie they felt in the military.
</P>
<P>
   For today's tech executives, feelings of camaraderie more likely
were formed in college dormitories than on battle fields. Pranks,
not prayers, tend to pull them together.
</P>
<P>
   Papermaster said the changes in attitude are so profound that
failure to recognize them will inhibit philanthropy and community
involvement by the tech community. If the 360.00 Summit had been
organized by an existing service organization, ``it would have been
over before it
</P>
<P>
   started,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the tech community is going to join in the business world's
long tradition of community service, ``we're going to need new
leadership.''

   UCALIF-ADMISSIONS (San Francisco) UC officials say new outreach
efforts may have contributed to the rise in freshman applications
this year from underrepresented ethnic groups. System-wide, 6.4

suitcase, hopscotching across the country from congressional

   PROFILE-ROBERT-DOWNEY-SR (Undated) _ In a filmmaking sub-stratum
that prides itself on youth, Robert Downey Sr., 63, is the closest
thing the independent film scene has to a gray eminence. An
adamantly independent writer-director whose output over the last 33
years has included satirical diatribes against Madison Avenue
(``Putney Swope''), organized religion (``Greaser's Palace'') and
corrupt priests (``Too Much Sun''), he's about as far from
mainstream cinema as any lifelong auteur is likely to get. By AMY

   ROAD-SALT (Albany, N.Y.) _ Salting since the 1930s has been the

annual damage estimates running in the billions of dollars. Now,

Obloquy is a necessary ingredient in the composition of all true
glory.'' That's how you get in the history books. Not by bribing
adamant adversaries, nor by bombing age-old enemies into temporary
accords. True heroism, a true profile in courage, means choosing
the harder right over the easier wrong. By ALEX A. VARDAMIS.

 &HT;    EMBRACE E-BUSINESS PRINCIPLES, DELL TELLS WORLD LEADERS
 &HT;    Moving in (i) international and (f) financial categories.

<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland _ Governments should cope with technology
change by ``embracing e-commerce'' practices, Dell Computer Corp.
chairman Michael Dell told leaders from around the world Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's advice came in a half-hour program with Prime Minister
Tony Blair of Britain before about 1,500 of the business and
political leaders gathered at this Alpine ski resort for the World
Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Blair had just delivered a major address to the annual meeting
on the need for governments to follow a ``third way'' if they are
to succeed in the technology-driven ``reverse oil shock'' climate
of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   When Blair asked Dell, who sat by his side on a stage flanked by
two huge closed-circuit television screens, how businesses could
help, Dell offered the model that has made his firm the leading
direct seller of computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many governments,'' Dell noted, ``require physical pieces of
paper to transact commerce,'' which tends to slow things down and
retard economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   As Blair nodded his head in vigorous agreement, Dell continued,
``We need to stay one step ahead of the (technological) changes and
be the disruptive force that moves things along.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You should not be scared in any way'' of technological change,
Dell told the leaders. ``Use information as successful businessmen
do in your society.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Blair advised Dell and his business colleagues in
the audience ``to practice a new sense of corporate responsibility
and help us share with people to understand the tough choices we
need to make down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, most of the Asian and European-based executives admit to
being computer illiterate. That was true of Blair, he admitted,
until he recently took a crash course in computer literacy near the
district he represents in northeast England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I flunked the first test,'' Blair said. ``And that made the
man who was working next to me and was unemployed very nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did very well,'' the man told me,'' Blair said. ``'And I'm
unemployed, and you're prime minister.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The Blair-Dell ``twin visions of leadership'' program was a
first in the 30-year annals of the forum, which often discusses
issues of global innovation but has been slow to innovate when it
comes to its own internal procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Blair arrived at this resort by helicopter, accompanied by about
15 aides and security guards. His modest entourage is due to be
eclipsed on Saturday when President Clinton, traveling with a party
of 250, delivers a speech on the same stage.
</P>
<P>
   Playing host to a U.S. president will also be a first for the
forum, although Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke here two years ago. By
all accounts, the first lady scored a big hit and encouraged her
husband to follow in her tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The bid to Clinton, as well as the highly polite and somewhat
stylized exchange between Blair and Dell was the brainchild of the
forum's founder, Swiss economist Klaus Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   The cast this year includes some 1,200 business executives who
control corporate assets of roughly $4.5 trillion _ a sum that
exceeds the collective net worth of all the member governments of
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Also here are about 500 politicians, including several key
members of the Clinton cabinet, and another 500 intellectuals
imported to Switzerland to lead the varied week-long discussion
program.

HIGH-PROTEIN, LOW-CARB DIET MAY BRING WEIGHT LOSS, BUT DOCTORS WARN

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Here's a typical daily menu for Tom Stansbury:
</P>
<P>
   A 12- to 14-ounce steak for breakfast, served with three eggs
and some Cheddar cheese.
</P>
<P>
   A broiled seafood platter and a salad for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Another steak or maybe some lean ground round for dinner, along
with a salad or vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   All told, he eats about 40 ounces of meat a day, making him a
poster boy for the nation's hottest trend in the war on flab:
</P>
<P>
   High protein. Low carbohydrate. No counting calories.
</P>
<P>
   Stansbury has lost 80 pounds since last spring _ down to 195
pounds on a 6-foot, 1-inch frame _ eating foods he likes and never
going hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason I like this diet is it's expensive but there's not
really a limit to how much I can eat,'' he said. ``I just eat what
I feel like eating.''
</P>
<P>
   Nutritionists may hate high-protein, low-carb diets, but they
can't deny their appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Stansbury, 56, follows Protein Power, a regimen described in
books by Colorado doctors Michael Eades and Mary Dan Eades,
including the just-published ``The Protein Power Lifeplan''
(Warnerbooks, $23.95).
</P>
<P>
   Other diets share the same philosophy and similar spots on the
best-seller list, including Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution, Sugar
Busters and the Zone. Even established weight-loss programs such as
Jenny Craig now offer low-carb options.
</P>
<P>
   Some restaurants have begun catering to the craze, and the
Internet is jammed with Web sites on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Eades sums up the attraction: ``They work quickly.
They're pretty easy to follow. You can eat out. You don't have to
make huge changes in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Details differ, but basically the diets call for lots of protein
_ meat, poultry, fish, cheese, eggs and nuts _ while drastically
cutting back on bread, pasta, rice, sweets, potatoes, carrots and
some fruits and other vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   That's a radical switch from the low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet
recommended by the American Dietetic Association, the American
Heart Association and other mainstream health groups.
</P>
<P>
   Nutritionists urge caution with high-protein, low-carb diets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they healthy? We don't know,'' said John Foreyt, director
of the nutrition-research clinic at Houston's Baylor College of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   He suspects they are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're unbalanced,'' he said. ``Presumably unbalanced eating
plans, in the long run, may lead to problems. But the truth is, we
don't have the data.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents claim the high-protein diets are safe and will lower
cholesterol and blood pressure, among other things. Foreyt and
other critics counter that case studies and testimonials from
satisfied customers do not amount to scientific evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Of course people like the diets, Foreyt said. ``Eat all the meat
you want, just stay away from white rice and carrots. OK, I'll
sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to their popularity, some nutrition experts say the
diets are fine when used briefly to jump-start a weight-loss
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need a mental, emotional change in lifestyle and
habits'' to lose weight, said Nancy Graves, a dietitian and
associate professor at the University of Houston's Conrad N. Hilton
College of Hotel and Restaurant Management. ``If they can break
their old routine and start with something that gives them positive
results, then they get excited.''
</P>
<P>
   But she and others pointed to drawbacks, including a risk of too
much saturated fat, which has been linked to heart problems. People
also need the vitamins and minerals in carbohydrates, Graves said;
while nutritional supplements can help, nutrients from food are
more easily absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, too much protein can damage the kidneys, critics
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not a good long-term, lifetime plan,'' Graves said.
</P>
<P>
   But the diets are proposed as a lifelong commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Higher levels of carbohydrates are allowed once a dieter reaches
``maintenance,'' Michael Eades said. But eat too many carbs, and
the weight will come back, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In general the plans are based on the theory that carbohydrates
are converted to sugar, which causes the body's insulin levels to
rise, promoting fat storage and weight gain. Protein, according to
the theory, stimulates the release of a different hormone, which
releases stored body fat.
</P>
<P>
   Side effects can range from bad breath and constipation to
fatigue, nausea and dizziness. Advocates say those problems can be
eased with nutritional supplements and generally disappear once
your metabolism adjusts.
</P>
<P>
   The Atkins diet restricts dieters to about 20 grams of
carbohydrates per day for the first two weeks. That's not much _
one slice of whole-wheat bread can have 11 grams; one-fourth cup of
orange juice has about 30 grams.
</P>
<P>
   Other high-protein diets allow more carbohydrates, but all fall
far below the recommendations in the federal government's food
pyramid, which calls for six to 11 daily servings of bread, cereal,
pasta and rice.
</P>
<P>
   High-protein diets have been around in some form for years; Dr.
Robert C. Atkins published his first diet book in the early 1970s
and has updated it several times.
</P>
<P>
   The public mania for low-fat diets took off in the intervening
years, and grocery-store shelves now groan under the onslaught of
fat-free foods. The federal government suggests that no more than
30 percent of calories come from fat.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans keep gaining weight. More than half of the
population is overweight, according to studies.
</P>
<P>
   So we sample diet pills and fad diets in an eternal search for
the perfect solution.
</P>
<P>
   Nutritionists suggest something simpler:
</P>
<P>
   Eat less.
</P>
<P>
   People gain weight when they consume more calories than they
burn. They lose weight when they burn more calories than they take
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your dog's fat, you take the bowl away from him,'' said
Michael Meyer, associate professor of sports physiology at the
University of Houston. ``Look in the mirror, and if you're too fat,
quit eating.''
</P>
<P>
   But losing weight is seldom so straightforward, and many people
want a palatable plan. Peer support helps, too.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Bokamper, a 28-year-old mental-health counselor in
Houston, started on the Atkins diet with a roommate three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   After nine months, she had lost 70 pounds, and she stuck with a
low-carbohydrate diet for the next two years. She's eased up lately
but compensates for extra carbohydrates by exercising more.
</P>
<P>
   She's a rarity in the dieting world: someone who's kept the
weight off. Standing 5 feet, 10 inches, she's holding steady at 165
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bokamper said she didn't worry about health problems from
Atkins' diet, partly because her diet had been heavy on fried food
before she started it.
</P>
<P>
   So when her cholesterol was ``borderline high-risk'' after she'd
lost the weight, she didn't know whether that was better or worse
than it had been.
</P>
<P>
   But she modified the diet, substituting oatmeal for eggs at
breakfast, and her cholesterol levels dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Stansbury hasn't had his cholesterol levels checked, but he said
he's sure they're better now.
</P>
<P>
   He feels better, too.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president of operations for a boiler service and
construction company, he's constantly on the go, visiting
construction sites and climbing ladders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't comfortable, and it was probably getting dangerous
to carry that weight at my age,'' he said. When he topped 270
pounds, just getting in and out of his car became difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Stansbury had lost weight with a high-protein diet 25 years ago.
He figured it would work again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like meat. I like cheese. I like salads,'' he said. This, he
thought, was a diet he could stick with.
</P>
<P>
   After carbohydrate cravings during the first few days, he said
he no longer missed the potatoes, pasta and rice he once loved.
</P>
<P>
   He's now up to 40-45 grams of carbohydrates a day and plans to
follow the diet for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``And on special occasions, I eat whatever I want to eat,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He does miss dessert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I buy this sugar-free Jell-O and whipped topping, and that
helps a little bit,'' he said.

MUDHONEY'S TWO-CD COLLECTION CLOSES THE BOOK ON GRUNGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL D. CLARK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometime in 1989, right around when Nirvana and Soundgarden were
defining grunge and making Seattle the center of the music
universe, little-known Mudhoney was releasing its first album.
</P>
<P>
   All three bands had the necessary off-key vocals and fuzzy
guitars. But while Nirvana and Soundgarden rode flannel fury to a
Trump-sized lottery payoff, Mudhoney never made it too far out of
the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years later, however, it is Mudhoney who gets the last
say on the dead genre with its double-disc compilation, ``March to
Fuzz.''
</P>
<P>
   (And those who are about to argue that Pearl Jam and
Soundgarden's Chris Cornell are still around, never knew what
grunge was. Both are currently about as edgy as soap.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Mudhoney's greatest deterrent was its inability to
create a completely cohesive album. ``March to Fuzz'' resolves that
problem by grabbing the strongest songs for the ``best of'' disc,
stripping away guitar dirges best left forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   From the loose-limbed early noodling of ``You Got It'' to the
much tighter percussion-driven ``I Have to Laugh,'' the progress of
the band's play is measurable. More amazing is vocalist Mark Arm's
consistent defiance of melody, a trait he either stole from Kurt
Cobain or vice-versa. Not to be missed is a shagadelic tribute to
the '60s, ``Who You Driving Now?''
</P>
<P>
   The rarities disc includes songs Mudhoney mostly did for
compilation albums and hard-to-find 7-inch and 12-inch vinyl. It's
a kick to hear a group of sneaker-gazers cover Motorhead's ``Over
the Top'' and Roxy Music's ``Editions of You,'' the latter
previously unreleased.
</P>
<P>
   Mudhoney daring to say ``March to Fuzz'' is one ``best of'' disc
and one ``rarities'' disc is a laugh. The band never really enjoyed
anything that could be called a hit, and all of its songs are rare
to most. If anything, ``March to Fuzz'' is a final tribute to a
decade of music by a band that deserved more credit for its
contributions to it.

much saturated fat, which has been linked to heart problems. People
also need the vitamins and minerals in carbohydrates, Graves said;
while nutritional supplements can help, nutrients from food are
more easily absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, too much protein can damage the kidneys, critics
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not a good long-term, lifetime plan,'' Graves said.
</P>
<P>
   But the diets are proposed as a lifelong commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Higher levels of carbohydrates are allowed once a dieter reaches
``maintenance,'' Michael Eades said. But eat too many carbs, and
the weight will come back, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In general the plans are based on the theory that carbohydrates
are converted to sugar, which causes the body's insulin levels to
rise, promoting fat storage and weight gain. Protein, according to
the theory, stimulates the release of a different hormone, which
releases stored body fat.
</P>
<P>
   Side effects can range from bad breath and constipation to
fatigue, nausea and dizziness. Advocates say those problems can be
eased with nutritional supplements and generally disappear once
your metabolism adjusts.
</P>
<P>
   The Atkins diet restricts dieters to about 20 grams of
carbohydrates per day for the first two weeks. That's not much _
one slice of whole-wheat bread can have 11 grams; one-fourth cup of
orange juice has about 30 grams.
</P>
<P>
   Other high-protein diets allow more carbohydrates, but all fall
far below the recommendations in the federal government's food
pyramid, which calls for six to 11 daily servings of bread, cereal,
pasta and rice.
</P>
<P>
   High-protein diets have been around in some form for years; Dr.
Robert C. Atkins published his first diet book in the early 1970s
and has updated it several times.
</P>
<P>
   The public mania for low-fat diets took off in the intervening
years, and grocery-store shelves now groan under the onslaught of
fat-free foods. The federal government suggests that no more than
30 percent of calories come from fat.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans keep gaining weight. More than half of the
population is overweight, according to studies.
</P>
<P>
   So we sample diet pills and fad diets in an eternal search for
the perfect solution.
</P>
<P>
   Nutritionists suggest something simpler:
</P>
<P>
   Eat less.
</P>
<P>
   People gain weight when they consume more calories than they
burn. They lose weight when they burn more calories than they take
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your dog's fat, you take the bowl away from him,'' said
Michael Meyer, associate professor of sports physiology at the
University of Houston. ``Look in the mirror, and if you're too fat,
quit eating.''
</P>
<P>
   But losing weight is seldom so straightforward, and many people
want a palatable plan. Peer support helps, too.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Bokamper, a 28-year-old mental-health counselor in
Houston, started on the Atkins diet with a roommate three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   After nine months, she had lost 70 pounds, and she stuck with a
low-carbohydrate diet for the next two years. She's eased up lately
but compensates for extra carbohydrates by exercising more.
</P>
<P>
   She's a rarity in the dieting world: someone who's kept the
weight off. Standing 5 feet, 10 inches, she's holding steady at 165
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bokamper said she didn't worry about health problems from
Atkins' diet, partly because her diet had been heavy on fried food
before she started it.
</P>
<P>
   So when her cholesterol was ``borderline high-risk'' after she'd
lost the weight, she didn't know whether that was better or worse
than it had been.
</P>
<P>
   But she modified the diet, substituting oatmeal for eggs at
breakfast, and her cholesterol levels dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Stansbury hasn't had his cholesterol levels checked, but he said
he's sure they're better now.
</P>
<P>
   He feels better, too.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president of operations for a boiler service and
construction company, he's constantly on the go, visiting
construction sites and climbing ladders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't comfortable, and it was probably getting dangerous
to carry that weight at my age,'' he said. When he topped 270
pounds, just getting in and out of his car became difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Stansbury had lost weight with a high-protein diet 25 years ago.
He figured it would work again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like meat. I like cheese. I like salads,'' he said. This, he
thought, was a diet he could stick with.
</P>
<P>
   After carbohydrate cravings during the first few days, he said
he no longer missed the potatoes, pasta and rice he once loved.
</P>
<P>
   He's now up to 40-45 grams of carbohydrates a day and plans to
follow the diet for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``And on special occasions, I eat whatever I want to eat,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He does miss dessert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I buy this sugar-free Jell-O and whipped topping, and that
helps a little bit,'' he said.

   SUTTON, England _ Shoppers are not greeted by pleasant folks
wearing yellow happy face pins, but the spirit of Sam Walton
abides.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Asda superstore in this leafy London suburb, the
familiar philosophy is etched _ literally _ in stone: ``Permanently
Low Prices Forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The simple, yet potent ethos that changed America now is working
its way through Britain _ and is poised to sweep the rest of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart purchased Asda,
Britain's No. 3 grocery story chain for $10.8 billion. The stage
was set for a retail revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart has been warmly welcomed by British shoppers, who pay
up to 40 percent more at the market than their European and
American counterparts. A 1997 survey found that Britons paid US$138
for a shopping cart of groceries that would cost about US$96 in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are all a bit weary of these truly horrible
prices,'' said Fiona Brindle, a housewife who drove eight miles
from the town of Bookham here, to Sutton to save on her weekly
grocery bill. ``We all know what people pay in America for things.
I've been to a Wal-Mart in Florida, so I know how it can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after Wal-Mart took control, prices at Asda's 229
stores plummeted. A 2-litre bottle of Coca-Cola dropped from the
equivalent of US$2.10 to US$1.06. A bottle of Pantene shampoo
dropped from US$3.28 to US$2.05. The company says it is slashing
its prices nearly US$170 million to attract customers.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the company dispatched 250 store managers to the
United States to meet with their counterparts and to be schooled in
the American model of customer service _ an alien concept to many
British store clerks who often seem to loathe customers.
</P>
<P>
   This all sends shivers down the spine of traditional British
retailers, who long have enjoyed high profit margins and only
modest competition. When the Wal-Mart deal was announced last
summer, Tesco, the country's No. 1 grocery chain, immediately
slashed prices and launched its own internet marketing service.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hyman, managing director of Verdict, the retail
analysts, said the American retailer's arrival on the British
shopping scene already has changed the landscape. ``It has raised
the ante,'' Hyman said ``(The atmosphere has) become far more
aggressive. It's injected a new level of price-led competition into
UK retailing.''
</P>
<P>
   Auberon Waugh, the columnist for the Independent, took note of
the depth of the cultural change required for British
businesspeople to embrace discount retailing. ``This must be seen
as deeply 'un-British,''' Waugh wrote. ``Prices in Britain are so
much higher than anywhere in the rest of Europe, let alone America,
because our government is greedy and nobody believes in
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   While Wal-Mart has a firm grip on the principals of retail
competition, its British juggernaut faces a more concrete obstacle:
The stores here are too small for high-volume sales.
</P>
<P>
   British stores tend to be about 50,000 square feet _ about a
quarter the size of an American Wal-Mart _ and are surrounded by
complicated, cramped parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Wal-Mart's practice is to obtain a huge
tract in a small town or at the edges of urban development. This
land tends to be cheap, taxed modestly and regulated minimally.
</P>
<P>
   But, such parcels are rare in Britain, which is a densely
developed island that is fiercely protective of its countryside.
Since 1996, British land-use laws have effectively contained new
development in central business districts.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Wal-Mart's move to replicate its American stores
probably would prick fears about the future of city shopping
districts, known as the High Streets. These remain the prevalent,
if endangered shopping areas across Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Spencer, the city planner in the central England town of
Gloucester, is decidedly cool to allowing a Wal-Mart into his
community. His concerns would sound familiar to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may offer cheaper prices in the short term, but as
planners we have to cater for our children's children,'' Spencer
said. ``Wal-Mart sells everything from cigarettes to cars. Every
shop in the city center would suffer. It would change the tone of
the city. We've got flower sellers and musicians on our streets.
There is a rejuvenation of civic pride. A retail conglomerate which
excludes people without cars, the young and those with rough edges
would change all that.''
</P>
<P>
   One potential way around British planning rules is for Wal-Mart
to buy existing retail parks and convert them into mega-stores.
Britain has an estimated 500 out-of-town retail parks, a third of
which are already authorized to sell both food and non-food items.
ASDA has stores at only three of these sites.
</P>
<P>
   The response at these sites is likely to be mixed. Norman
Davies, the deputy chief planner in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales,
said Wal-Mart could expect few problems if it were to obtain that
town's office park and seek to convert it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's an existing consent, I suggest that it's irrelevant
who trades there and what they do with the buildings so long as
what they sell represents a similar range of goods as before,''
Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart entered the European market in 1997 with the US$880
million acquisition of Wertkauf hypermarkets in Germany. Last year,
the company added the US$660 million Spar Handels chain, giving it
a total of 95 stores throughout Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of Wal-Mart's moving into France was enough to drive
that country's big rival retailers _ Carrefour and Promodes _ into
one another's arms in a proposed merger.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission approved the merger last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite concerns about the deeper consequences of the arrival of
another icon of America, shoppers here seem to welcome a break from
the tradition of high prices and rude service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's brilliant,'' said Margaret Phillips as she waits to
unload her cart at the Sutton Asda. ``It's all great to talk about
British and the High Streets, but we all have families to provide
for, don't we?''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, a male voice came on the store's public address
system to inform shoppers that pizzas were _ for a limited time _
two for one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that's brilliant!'' said Phillips, as she pulls out of
line to follow the lure of free pizzas.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ She's diminutive, soft-spoken and genteel.
</P>
<P>
   She's also an ardent feminist and one of Mexico's most powerful
political figures.
</P>
<P>
   Amalia Garcia, 48, is the first woman to be elected president of
a political party in this country where machismo still generally
rules. Born just before Mexican women won the right to vote in
1953, she was committed to politics by 1975 _ the year Mexico
finally erased a law declaring that husbands could forbid wives
from working.
</P>
<P>
   Since her election in a nationwide vote last July, Garcia has
led the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, founded 10
years ago in opposition to Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   To some, her rise to the top of one of this country's most
powerful opposition parties could signal a new age for women
leaders here.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's victory certainly set a trend. In November the PRI
appointed another woman, Dulce Maria Sauri, president of the ruling
party. It was a move widely acknowledged here as a nod at Mexico's
women, who represent 52 percent of the potential electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Both these women lead their parties during a competitive
election year when Mexicans will select a new president on July 2,
along with a new Congress and other top offices.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, the single mother of a college-age daughter, is a firm
believer in the liberal creed that government should intervene to
solve social problems and help the poor. But she's also so feminist
that she doesn't hesitate to criticize people within her own party
when macho attitudes threaten to keep women in secondary roles.
</P>
<P>
   She was instrumental, in fact, in a party rule that requires
that no more than 70 percent of any PRD administration be dominated
by one gender.
</P>
<P>
   Men make jokes about the policy, Garcia said, smoothing her
skirt primly as she sat down for an interview with Cox Newspapers
in her office at party headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They joke that the quota should guarantee that at least 30
percent should be men so they won't disappear,'' she laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-choice and a veteran politician who fought to upgrade laws
against rape and sexual harassment, Garcia is a woman on the
constant go and a regular front-page item in the country's
newspapers. She flies from city to city meeting constituents and
political leaders of all backgrounds, and she has been credited
with helping transform the PRD from a party on the margins to a
force to a reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's style has helped her party move toward ``the famous
middle road,'' a strategy that's worked for other leftist parties
in the world, said political analyst Joel Estudillo of the Mexican
Institute for Political Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amalia Garcia could be the PRD's future,'' Estudillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's ruling party, the PRI, has controlled the country's
presidency, its Congress and most state governments for 70 years.
It was only two years ago that the PRI lost full control of the
lower house of Congress here and the PRD began to gain more power.
</P>
<P>
   Out of 500 members of the lower house, the PRD now counts 123.
Mexico's oldest opposition party, the conservative National Action
Party, or PAN, counts 117. Nine members are independents or
affiliated with other opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia is considered one of the brains behind another successful
electoral strategy that is starting to boost the PRD presence in
the governors' mansions and mayoral offices in various states:
softening the party's militant image and forging coalitions with
unlikely partners, including the conservative PAN and dissident PRI
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, the party has been elected to governors' offices in
four of Mexico's 31 states. Last December, it sponsored a candidate
that won the mayoral election in the high-profile,
economically-powerful resort city of Acapulco.
</P>
<P>
   In Zacatecas, Garcia's home state, she and the PRD wooed a
dissident PRI leader and sponsored him as their candidate for
governor. They did the same thing in the state of Tlaxcala. Both
candidates won.
</P>
<P>
   The PRD also won the governorships of Baja California Sur and
Nayarit, where they established coalitions with the PAN to defeat
the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Both the PRD and the PAN are trying to drive the PRI from office
and label the ruling party corrupt, negligent and anti-democratic.
Their bedrock philosophies are worlds apart, however. The PAN is
considered pro-free market and socially conservative, and it
supports a continuing ban on abortion here.
</P>
<P>
   While it hasn't made choice a top issue in this largely Catholic
country, the PRD favors decriminalization of abortion and believes
in only limited free-market economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half years ago, the PRD had its first substantial
national victory when its leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas won the Mexico
City mayor's race. Cardenas left office last year to run for
president and appointed another PRD woman, Rosario Robles, his
successor.
</P>
<P>
   With Mexico City in its control along with four states, the PRD
now governs a territory with more than 20 million of Mexico's 93
million people. Even though Cardenas is lagging third in polls,
Garcia is convinced the party's experience will help him and other
party candidates in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six years ago, during the 1994 presidential election the PRD
didn't govern any entity,'' Garcia said. ``Now we govern five and
citizens have seen there is no chaos, no uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``It was said that businesses wouldn't trust (the
PRD). None of that has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   While she acknowledges that Mexico's presidency is the top prize
long coveted by this country's opposition parties, Garcia believes
that her party should also continue to try to win local elections
city-by-city, state-by-state.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mexico, everything has revolved around the figure of the
president,'' she said. ``We believe that we should put an accent on
each and every space in the government where there could be an
alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   For Garcia, politics is not only a passion but a birthright _
although her critical view of the PRI took her down a different
path than her family. Her father was diplomat and governor of
Zacatecas who belonged to the ruling party. The year 1968 was
pivotal for her; her father was posted abroad and she opted to
return to Mexico to continue studying when a student uprising for
more democracy was violently repressed.
</P>
<P>
   She studied sociology at the National Autonomous University and
history at the Autonomous University of Puebla. She fought for the
release of Mexican political prisoners in the late 1970s, and
plunged into the women's rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   After briefly joining the Communist Party and then the Socialist
Party, Garcia became a founding member of the PRD. As a federal
congresswoman, she led a successful fight to toughen rape and
sexual harassment laws. Afterward she served in Mexico City's
legislative assembly and fought police corruption, forcing a police
chief out of his job.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was also instrumental in reforms allowing Mexico City's
residents to finally elect their mayor, who, prior to 1997, was
always appointed by Mexico's president.
</P>
<P>
   Her campaign for party president last year, Garcia said, ``was
difficult in a in a country that has a tradition, or at least the
reputation, for being macho.'' She said she encountered more
resistance from male party leaders than from the party's
rank-and-file.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty percent of woman voted for me,'' she said. ``We've
decided that women shouldn't be (in the party) just symbolically. I
think that if we're able to get women to identify with the PRD then
that will bear a lot of fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But of course that commitment has to be real, not
artificial,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her party's relative success recently, Garcia's
experience hasn't been entirely positive. The first party election
that she ran in ended in disaster last July when the party was torn
apart by accusations of vote tampering from all sides. The PRD
annulled the election, but the party's reputation suffered. A
second election in July was smoother.
</P>
<P>
   As president, Garcia continued high-stakes negotiations last
year that would have established an historic alliance to pick on
opposition candidate for Mexico's July 2 presidential election. Had
it been successful, the coalition would be have included nearly all
of Mexico's opposition parties and posed a formidable threat to the
PRI.
</P>
<P>
   But the talks ultimately failed; while the conservatives and
leftists came up with a common platform, they couldn't agree on how
to select a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was disappointed by the coalition's collapse, but has no
lost love for the PAN _ particularly because she doesn't think the
conservative party gives enough opportunities to women.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled an observation that annoyed her while she sat in
negotiations in rooms filled with choking smoke from cigars
brandished by a PAN leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when we were in meetings during the negotiations
for an alliance _ four months of daily meetings _ the PAN was the
only party that never had a woman there,'' Garcia said.

&HT;     ROBERT DOWNEY SR.: THE GRANDADDY OF INDEPENDENT FILMS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Downey Sr. found himself at the Sundance Film Festival a
couple of years back, sitting in a schmooze-fest organized by
festival co-director Geoffrey Gilmore. The room was packed with
filmmakers. Gilmore, playing the proper host, asked the assembled
wattage to take turns introducing themselves. He suggested they
begin with ``the oldest independent filmmaker in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Downey looked around the room. He spotted a couple of likely
specimens filmmakers he didn't recognize and thought, Hey, they're
older than I am. Then he looked at Gilmore. Gilmore was pointing at
him: behold, the oldest independent filmmaker in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about those guys?'' Downey asked, nonplussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``One's from Mexico,'' Gilmore explained. ``And one's from
Spain.''
</P>
<P>
   Downey laughs when he tells that story a deep-throated laugh,
unpretentious and robust. He's been called the grandfather of
independent film, and while the label makes him itchy, he's not
about to refute it. ``I've heard it a lot, and I don't like to face
it, being that old,'' he says, in a recent phone conversation from
his New York City home. ``But it's OK by me.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing. In a filmmaking sub-stratum that prides itself on
youth, Downey, 63, is the closest thing the indie scene has to a
gray eminence. An adamantly independent writer-director whose
output over the last 33 years has included satirical diatribes
against Madison Avenue (``Putney Swope''), organized religion
(``Greaser's Palace'') and corrupt priests (``Too Much Sun,'' which
features Downey's son, Robert Jr.), he's about as far from
mainstream cinema as any lifelong auteur is likely to get. He was
tweaking the establishment before Paul Thomas Anderson was born.
(Whom Downey admires: He has a small part in ``Boogie Nights'')
</P>
<P>
   ``To have been able to do this for so long and to not have to
work a regular job is a thrill,'' he says simply. But he declines
to characterize his own legacy. ``I don't really know. I can't look
at myself,'' he protests.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences can get a look for themselves Saturday, when Time &AMP;
Space Limited in Hudson, N.Y., hosts a screening-cum-discussion of
``Sticks and Bones,'' Downey's 1973 television adaptation of the
Tony-winning David Rabe play. The film, a raw examination of a
wounded Vietnam veteran's return home, was produced by Joe Papp and
shot for CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the play ``was kind of a comedy, a nasty one, but a
comedy about a returning vet in America,'' recalls Downey. ``I
said, `This would be terrific but let's change it into a
nightmare.' Because right about that time the war was grinding down
a little. So (Papp) said, `Fine, let's take all the laughs out.'
They shot the play, sans humor. CBS balked at the finished product:
Too bleak to air.
</P>
<P>
   Papp accused CBS of cowardice _ on the air, to one of its own
reporters. A few months later, the network relented. It broadcast
``Sticks and Bones'' with no commercial breaks and prefaced by a
stern warning. ``Joe Papp, on the first day's shooting, he calls me
and says, `This is gonna be tough in a wind. I don't want the
frontiers, just take me to the window' meaning, don't make it too
surreal, too this and that,'' Downey says. ``But it is anyway. And
that's the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Downey's films ``were always, for me, benchmarks in terms of the
relationship of arts and politics,'' said Time &AMP; Space Limited
president Linda Mussmann, who saw ``Sticks and Bones'' at Papp's
theater in the early '70s. ``I talk to young kids now, and they
don't even know who Downey is. And for me those movies _ `Putney
Swope,' `Pound,' `Greaser's Palace' _ those movies were so
shocking. You think of what the movies were then, and in the middle
of all that they were pretty shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   On the phone, at least, Downey comes across as anything but an
adult _ terrible there's nothing bombastic about him. He seems
downright reasonable. ``He is very unpretentious, and you'd have to
work really hard to get him to ever give himself credit for
anything. There are so many egotistical people in our business, and
he's really the opposite of that,'' says Downey's wife, Rosemary
Rogers, an author (``Boomer Babes: A Woman's Guide to the New
Middle Ages'') and film-music producer. ``He doesn't like to blow
his own horn.''
</P>
<P>
   A high school dropout at 16 and an Army veteran at 19, Downey
waited tables, pitched in a semi-pro baseball league and tried his
hand at acting before striking out in the mid-1960s to make his own
films. His first, shot for $25,000, was ``Chafed Elbows.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1970 he wrote and directed ``Putney Swope,'' a scathing spoof
of the advertising industry in which black executives take over an
entrenched white firm. A year later came ``Pound,'' which cast
live-action homo sapiens as dogs in a pen. One of them, a puppy,
was played by 5-year-old Robert Downey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pound'' marked Downey's one run-in with a major studio. It
wasn't a happy junction. ``When I turned it into United Artists,
after the screening one of the studio heads said to me, `I thought
this was gonna be animated.' They thought they were getting some
cute little animated film.''
</P>
<P>
   As punishment, UA sent the film out on a double bill with
Fellini. ``I was in heaven,'' the director says.
</P>
<P>
   (Following its release, Downey slipped into a projection booth
and snipped out ``two minutes I couldn't stand. ... There was a
penguin who was placed in the pound by mistake. He died and went to
penguin heaven, and another guy broke into song.'')
</P>
<P>
   In the early '70s, he found cocaine, became seduced by it, and
managed to quit cold at the turn of the decade. He declines to talk
about it now. ``I'm just thankful I'm rid of it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His life has had its rough spots: divorce from his first wife,
the death of his second to Lou Gehrig's disease (which inspired the
sweet-natured ``Hugo Pool''), the drug conviction and imprisonment
of his enormously gifted son.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Downey doesn't dwell on the past. ``He's incredibly positive
as a human being,'' says the writer Rudy Wurlitzer, a longtime
friend of Downey's and a TSL board member. ``He's had a lot of hard
knocks, and his cup is always half full, you know. That's an
amazing quality, and that's just something he's always had. Because
you know he's a wacko, same as me.''
</P>
<P>
   Wurlitzer tells a story about Downey _ from the '50s or
thereabouts, during his youthful stint in the military. ``I was in
an Army jail, and the whole talk of the stockade was about this
crazy guy who was also in an Army jail in Okinawa for going AWOL.
This guy that everyone was obsessed about was like a legend over
there, because when the New York Yankees were touring the Army
bases in the Pacific, they stopped off in Okinawa. They let this
guy out to pitch against the Yankees because he had an amazing
fastball. And he struck out a few guys and Yogi Berra hit a triple,
and then they put him back in the slammer _ and that was Downey.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the director is at work on a new screenplay, ``Forest
Hills Bob,'' to be co-produced by Jonathan Demme and Peter Saraf.
He doesn't divulge details, but he will say he's pleased with the
script. ``I'm very happy about that one. I feel like it's my first
one,'' he says. ``It's a little different no satire.''
</P>
<P>
   No satire? ``Well, some _ I couldn't help myself,'' he
confesses. Old habits die hard. ``They do,'' he says. ``When you're
a writer.''

&HT;     ANOTHER `SCREAM' AMONG THE YEAR'S NEW MOVIE CHOICES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first quarter of the year is a tortoise-paced time for movie
releases.
</P>
<P>
   With the Oscar crush (mostly) behind us and behemoth summer
blockbusters months ahead, the tip of 2000 offers a bit of
breathing room to the exhausted cinephile. So stay home. Plant
paperwhites. Read a book.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there are plenty of interesting movies poised
for release in the weeks ahead _ and as winter melts into spring, a
few bona fide ``event'' movies will poke up with the crocuses. In
the spirit of nonstop moviegoing, here are a few picks for the new
year (release dates are tentative):
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   ``SCREAM 3'' (Feb. 4). Because the first two were such
self-reflective, smarty-pants fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE BEACH'' (Feb. 11). No, it isn't Leo. It isn't the ``Lords
of the Flies''-ish plot. It isn't the goofy, overheated trailer or
the exquisite Thai scenery. The reason to see this the reason we're
interested is Danny Boyle, who directed ``Trainspotting'' and
``Shallow Grave'' and here tackles subjects a bit less ... urban.
</P>
<P>
   ``WONDER BOYS'' (Feb. 18). Michael Chabon's novel about a seedy,
intoxicant-prone, meandering writer and his sundry human
relationships was such a delight that if Curtis Hanson's adaptation
proves half as funny, it'll be worth seeing. Hanson last directed
the testosteronal ``L.A. Confidential''; this one stars an
uncharacteristically scruffy Michael Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   ``MISSION TO MARS'' (March 10). Some of us are suckers for
sci-fi. Some of us are such suckers for sci-fi that the prospect of
a big, old-fashioned, deadly serious space quest sets our hearts
aflutter. Little green men are probably not in the offing, but Gary
Sinise, Tim Robbins and Kim Delaney are. Directed by Brian De
Palma, which is either a good thing or a bad thing depending on
one's reaction to ``Mission Impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``ERIN BROCKOVICH'' (March 17). Julia Roberts? In a Steven
Soderbergh movie? About foul water and a crusading divorcee, a la
``A Civil Action''? ``The Limey'' was such a tart, smart movie, and
``Out of Sight'' such a romp, that we'll follow Soderbergh
anywhere. (If you've never seen ``Schizopolis,'' do.) ``LOVE AND
BASKETBALL'' (April 21). Spike Lee on basketball: that's all.
</P>
<P>
   ``GLADIATOR'' (May 5). Oh, come on, who doesn't like a big fat
Roman epic? Director Ridley Scott (``Alien,'' ``Blade Runner'')
seems a perfect fit for this film, in which Russell Crowe plays a
disgraced general who becomes a slave, then a gladiator, then a
rebel. Smells like ``Spartacus''; can't wait to see the Coliseum
scenes.

&HT;     SALT ALTERNATIVES GAIN GROUND AGAINST WINTER ASSAULT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MICHAEL LOPEZ  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Road salt, its chalky residue a reminder of the
last snowstorm, doesn't really invite comparisons to the dinner
table, although what comes out of both the shaker and the plow is
sodium chloride.
</P>
<P>
   But new de-icers _ one experimentally derived from whey, the
other, a syrupy byproduct of alcohol distillation _ have intriguing
connections to the stuff of cocktail parties, like a cheese
platter, wine, beer and liquor.
</P>
<P>
   Salting since the 1930s has been the cheap, effective way to
clear snow and ice from roadways, although its corrosive properties
are clear. Salt kills roadside trees, pollutes wells and corrodes
cars, bridges and parking garages, with annual damage estimates
running in the billions of dollars. Now, researchers are harnessing
less toxic products to replace or reduce salt use.
</P>
<P>
   Some 600 New York municipalities for several years have been
using a mixture of magnesium chloride and the byproduct of
fermented grains, such as corn and cane, to help salt melt ice and
snow.
</P>
<P>
   A major manufacturer, Innovative Municipal U.S. Inc. of Rome,
markets the de-icer as Magic-0. The grain-based byproduct has
supplemented cattle feed _ and therefore has been part of our diet
_ for over a century, said Daren Crawford, vice president of sales
and marketing. The company calls it environmentally safe and
noncorrosive.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford lightly refers to his product as a ``byproduct of
booze,'' so that people are ``driving on the influence instead of
under the influence.'' The company has used the byproduct of beer,
and now gets the distilled byproduct mainly from rum producers.
</P>
<P>
   Magic-0 has several benefits, Innovative Municipal says. As an
additive, it allows the salt to work at lower temperatures. Too,
salt, wetted ahead of time with the molasses-like Magic, sticks to
the road, breaking the bond between ice and the pavement. Boosting
the effectiveness of salt ultimately means using less of it.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Department of Transportation uses the grain
product, along with several agents like magnesium chloride, calcium
chloride and brine, to melt ice at lower temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these products are trying to coat the road, so a bond
can't form between the snow and ice that lands, and the pavement,''
said Joe Doherty, the department's program manager for snow and ice
control. He likened the coating to cooking with vegetable spray.
</P>
<P>
   Whey, the watery part of milk that is also added to hot dogs and
aspirin, is now the experimental ingredient in another de-icer that
has long held promise as a substitute for rock salt.
</P>
<P>
   Calcium magnesium acetate, or CMA, is a compound of limestone
and acetate, the latter now produced using natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority saw
the advantage of substituting whey, produced in abundance here, for
fossil fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps the farmer dispose of cheese whey and become more
competitive in New York state. It creates a renewable resource
(and) it creates a product that can be made within the state,''
said Judy Jarnefeld, the authority's project manager. To deal with
excess whey, farmers may spread it on fields, but the state
regulates how much, since the runoff could cause weed growth in
lakes and streams. Dairies are looking for alternatives, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency contributed $160,000 toward research also sponsored
by the Federal Highway Administration. In research conducted at
Ohio State University, scientists used two types of bacteria to
convert the lactose in whey to acetate. (Separate research is
examining how to produce acetate from sewage sludge.)
</P>
<P>
   Federal researchers have studied CMA for more than 20 years,
spending several million dollars to show that it is nontoxic,
minimally corrosive and effective, said W.C. Ormsby, a Federal
Highway Administration consultant. Its cost _ up to $1,200 per ton,
compared with $25 to $50 per ton for salt _ has prevented
widespread use. Several states are using CMA pellets to treat
bridges and roads in environmentally sensitive areas.
</P>
<P>
   Using whey, instead of natural gas, to produce the de-icer cuts
that cost significantly, to a projected $200 to $300 a ton, said
Ormsby.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are now waiting for a prospective commercial vendor
to risk start-up costs to turn whey into the latest weapon against
icy roads.

&HT;     MINORITY APPLICATIONS INCREASE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KATHERINE SELIGMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In San Diego, Kmart customers carried their
purchases home in paper bags emblazoned with guidelines on how to
get into the University of California. In West Contra Costa County,
kids entering high school got tutoring and guidance to steer them
toward qualifying for UC-Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   UC officials say outreach efforts like these may have
contributed to the rise in freshman applications this year from
underrepresented ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   System-wide, 6.4 percent more Latinos and 3.6 percent more
African Americans applied for freshman slots at UC for fall of
2000, according to preliminary figures released by the university.
</P>
<P>
   The jump follows the dismantling of affirmative action programs
in 1997 and a widespread fear that minority high school seniors
would abandon their hopes for the most competitive tier of the
state's higher education system.
</P>
<P>
   Admissions officials said Thursday they were heartened by the
news, but added it's too early to tell if the statistics are a true
trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going in the right direction,'' said Richard
Black, assistant vice chancellor for admissions and enrollment at
UC-Berkeley. ``I'm pleased we're going up but we still have a lot
of hard work to do. One year does not make a trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the UC system, there were more applications from every
ethnic group except Native Americans, among whom there was a 2.6
percent decline. There were 2.6 percent more Asian American and 2.3
percent more Filipino American applicants. The number of white
applicants was relatively unchanged, with a 0.3 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   The UC regents voted to stop considering race in admissions in
1995, a change that took effect for the class entering in 1998. At
Berkeley, black and Latino admissions tumbled that year. Black
admissions, for instance, went from 545 in 1997 to 236 in 1998,
down 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last year minority admissions started to recover with black and
Hispanic admissions close to 1997 levels. However, that was due
mainly to more minorities going to lower-profile campuses. At the
flagship campus in Berkeley, 293 black students were admitted last
fall, still well below affirmative action levels.
</P>
<P>
   At UC's most sought-after campuses _ UC-Berkeley and UCLA, both
deluged with more applications than just about any other university
in the nation _ minority applications are up.
</P>
<P>
   At UC-Berkeley _ which had a record 5.1 percent increase in
applications for the freshman class _ 9.7 percent more African
Americans, 20 percent more Latinos, 7 percent more Native American
applicants and 7.3 percent more Asian Americans applied for the
fall. The number of white applicants grew 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The university has struggled with us to keep (the numbers) up
despite political will to keep them down,'' said Cathie Kosel,
coordinator of university partnerships for UC-Berkeley. The
Berkeley partnership program works with Bay Area schools to improve
student performance in elementary through high schools.
</P>
<P>
   Kosel said the program has had a great impact in increasing the
number of minorities who are qualified for UC.
</P>
<P>
   In West Contra Costa County, the program has provided staff and
curriculum development and tutoring at seven elementary, three
middle and three high schools.
</P>
<P>
   At UC-San Diego, officials realized they had to spread to a
broader audience information about UC requirements, said Richard
Backer, assistant vice chancellor in the division of student
affairs. So three years ago, the university began a campaign to
print fliers on paper shopping bags that told about UC
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The fliers got so much attention, Backer said, that the
university now distributes them to middle schools. School
representatives also attend church and PTA meetings to get out the
word about UC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very encouraged,'' said Backer. ``But of course the
proof of the pudding is when we process the applications.''
</P>
<P>
   While UC-Berkeley and UCLA had significant increases in
applications from underrepresented groups, UC-Riverside and
UC-Irvine had the biggest gains among those groups. Over the past
two years, UC-Riverside has received 33.7 percent more Latino and
36.3 percent more African American applicants.
</P>
<P>
   At UC-Irvine, the number of Latino applicants rose 35.6 percent
and African American applicants 27.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, UC demand is going skyward, driven by larger numbers of
high school students. This year there were 35,100 new students
enrolled, a 3.8 increase from the previous year. A total of 2.5
percent more students applied for freshman spots this fall.

&HT;     GAY SON'S DEATH STARTED CRUSADE AGAINST HATE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE COSTANTINOU  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ She used to be a housewife and a mom. But then
her son, gay college student Matthew Shepard, was fatally beaten in
a hate crime that shocked much of the nation and changed her life
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Judy Shepard, 47, lives out of her suitcase, hop-scotching
across the country from congressional hearings to gay pride parades
trying to put a face on anti-gay violence and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Shepard's crusade brought her to San Francisco to
lend her support against Proposition 22, a ballot measure known as
the Knight Initiative that is intended to ban same-sex marriages in
California.
</P>
<P>
   To Shepard and other supporters of the ``No on Knight''
counter-campaign, Prop. 22 can only result in gays being further
excluded from rights and comforts that others take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a parent,'' she said. ``Everybody has the right to be part
of a family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the exclusion I object to,'' she said. ``You don't have
to be for or against single-sex marriage. This is about families.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her son Matthew, who was killed at the age of 21 when he
was a college freshman, ``I would have been the happiest mother in
the world if he had found a person to love.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew was pistol-whipped, robbed and tied to a fence in the
Wyoming prairie in October 1998, then left there in the freezing
cold by his two assailants. He was found 18 hours later. He never
regained consciousness and died five days later, his parents at his
bedside.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, his mother can't bear to go see the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Shepard's life since her son's death and her views on hate
and discrimination and violence are featured in a documentary
titled ``Journey to a Hate-Free Millennium.'' The film was shown
Thursday night at the Regency Theater as a ``No on Knight''
fundraiser.
</P>
<P>
   A soft-spoken, private woman, Shepard is still not comfortable
talking to reporters and crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please understand,'' she said, apologizing for her
nervousness. ``I'm just a mom.''
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of just burying her son and going back to her old
life was not possible, she said. His brutal death compelled her to
speak, lest there be another Matthew and another mother with a
broken heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't do anything to help Matt anymore,'' she said. ``But
maybe I can use this platform to help others.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son would approve, she said. ``He would want me to be doing
it,'' she said. ``He always said I shouldn't have been a housewife,
I should have a career.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband Dennis moved back to Saudi Arabia and his job and
Shepard took to the road, going back to a studio apartment in
Casper, Wyo., ``long enough to wash some clothes and repack.''
</P>
<P>
   Her travels and conversations across the country, with gays and
lesbians, other families, activists and politicians, have helped
her better know her son. She also learned how naive she had been
about how deep-seated anti-gay hate, fear and ignorance was.
</P>
<P>
   She had heard of gay bashing and discrimination when her son was
alive and she said and she had always worried about his physical
safety and his feelings. She didn't know if her son had ever been
discriminated against but said she doesn't think he would have told
her to spare her from worrying.
</P>
<P>
   To help kids and young people like her son have an outlet to
speak about their fears and problems, the Shepard family has
founded the Matthew Shepard Foundation. The organization is still
in the planning stages, she said, but she wants it to provide
forums for all kids, not just gays, to learn more about themselves
and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are at risk,'' she said. ``They have no place to go to
talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard agreed to do the documentary _ which also features the
story of Columbine High School student Rachel Scott and James Byrd
Jr., who was dragged to death in Texas because he was black _
because its aim was to make viewers understand how devastating hate
crimes are, not only to the victims but to their families and
communities.
</P>
<P>
   With education and understanding, said Brent Scarpo, 37, one of
the two filmmakers, ``I believe that one day the world will be free
of hate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Matt Shepard's mom isn't so sure. ``My heart has to hope
it,'' she said. ``But my head tells me no.''

 UNDATED: ... intellectual powers.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Belichick's choice of colleges didn't alter the image. He wanted
to remain in New England, and he selected Wesleyan, which as a
Division 3 school does not offer athletic scholarships and is
renowned more for turning out English scholars, chemists, and
corporate CEOs than as a coaching incubator.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was something about this kid, and it certainly wasn't
his skill level.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was too small and too slow to be a real good football
player,'' says longtime Wesleyan assistant Peter Kostacopolous, the
defensive coordinator Belichick's senior season, 1974. ``The thing
that amazes me is that he hung in there for four years. I don't
think he ever started a game. But he took the pounding for four
years.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was more to it than masochism. ``He had a businesslike
approach to the game,'' says Kostacopolous. ``He just kind of stood
out. The other kids took it seriously, but not in a thinking man's
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if Belichick's major was economics, his minor was X's
and O's.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell he had a lot better idea of the overall scheme
we were doing than the other kids,'' says John Biddiscombe,
Belichick's position coach in '74 and now the Wesleyan athletic
director. ``The other kids were lucky if they knew where to line
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite later appearances to the contrary, there was a
personality behind the probing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows him as cerebral, methodical, always well
prepared,'' says Dave Whiting, a financial planner in Plymouth who
was Belichick's teammate in lacrosse and football and fraternity
brother in Chi Si. ``My recollection is different from the public
image. What I haven't seen mentioned is his quick-witted sense of
humor. It was very subtle. He'd make offhand comments that would
crack you up.''
</P>
<P>
   David Campbell, Belichick's football teammate and fellow
lacrosse captain who now is president of a lumber company in
Darien, Conn., remembers another quality about him. ``He was a very
loyal friend to a lot of people,'' says Campbell. ``And he was the
kind of person who could laugh at himself and with everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick's high school sweetheart, Debbie Clark _ now his wife,
with whom he has three children _ was attending college in Alabama,
``and you never saw her around much,'' says Campbell. That greatly
limited Belichick's recreational pursuits. ``I told you he was
loyal,'' Campbell says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   That is also reflected in his enduring school ties. Belichick
still socializes with former teammates like Campbell and Whiting,
either at school functions or during the summer on Nantucket. He
has returned often to both Andover and Wesleyan to address student
and alumni groups, and witnesses say he is charming in such
settings, in contrast to the public figure who appears decidedly
ill at ease in front of the media, as graphically illustrated
during his torturous introduction-turned-farewell press conference
as Jets coach.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Belichick helps both alma maters with fund-raising
and lends his services to Wesleyan as a recruiter and consultant to
Biddiscombe on personnel matters. And Miller, who has corresponded
with him occasionally through the years, still cherishes a response
he received from Belichick in which the coach said, ``My Wesleyan
economics training helped me stay under the salary cap in
Cleveland.''
</P>
<P>
   Just when Belichick decided that maneuvering around salary caps
and defending the red zone would be his life's calling is a matter
of conjecture _ and typical of his guarded public persona, he
declines to discuss such matters.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Forzano's preadolescent forecast, Steve Belichick
doesn't remember his son mentioning coaching as a career until the
second semester of his senior year at Wesleyan. But Bill
Macdermott, Belichick's head coach at Wesleyan and now an assistant
with the Canadian Football League Edmonton Eskimos, recalls that
his utility player ``made it very clear that was his goal, that he
wanted to coach someday in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Upon graduation, Belichick persuaded Baltimore head coach Ted
Marchibroda to give him a trial with the Colts, and he spent the
1975 season as assistant special teams coach, essentially breaking
down films, gratis, just like that 10-year-old at Navy. But now he
was on the fast track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Earl Morrall was one of the coaches with him up in
the press box,'' says Macdermott, ``and he told me that Bill did
everything exactly right.''
</P>
<P>
   So much so that Forzano grabbed him for the Lions the next year
for a salary of $10,000, handsome pay for an assistant back then.
``We started him out as a gofer, then put him with the special
teams, then had him in charge of the wide receivers and tight
ends,'' says Forzano.
</P>
<P>
   At 24, Belichick was younger than the great majority of his
subordinates, ``but the players never thought of his age,'' says
Forzano. ``They respected him immediately. And my other assistants
would come back and say, `Jiminy, this guy can coach.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So up the ladder Belichick went, from position coach in Detroit
to Denver to the New York Giants, where he eventually became the
defensive architect of Parcells's two Super Bowl champions.
</P>
<P>
   That earned him the top job in Cleveland, the first blot on the
portrait, one Belichick is still trying to erase.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mike Baab was a center on Belichick's first Browns team, or
gulag, as he recalls it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was probably the most difficult thing I've ever done in
football, making that team,'' says Baab. ``We were just terrible _
out of 75 guys on the roster (when Belichick came in), I think
maybe nine made it. He was the new tough guy, and we were the new
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick made that clear in his welcoming remarks, when he
warned the Browns that he'd worked too hard and long to let them
foul it up for him. Except he expressed the message in more obscene
terms, which Baab recalls as his basic method of communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the most profane coach I've ever heard,'' says Baab.
``I don't think he was interested in becoming your friend in any
way, shape, or form. He didn't endear himself to anyone at all.
There was nothing to love there, except the hope we would win.''
</P>
<P>
   That goal was realized only in relative terms. The Browns
improved, but only to 6-10, and Baab recalls Belichick riding them,
working them, mercilessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost horrifying,'' he says. ``We ran gassers until we
vomited. He never had a good thing to say to anybody. He didn't
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick's idea of public relations, according to Baab, was
``he said one time, `I don't give a damn what the fans think.'
Which is a pretty stupid thing for a coach to say in Cleveland.''
</P>
<P>
   The ex-player conceded that Belichick ``is a great defensive
coach. But the offense was just maniacally conservative,
ridiculously conservative. Our No. 1 play was the fullback
plunge.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the pain and failure and vitriol, Baab did find room for
genuine shock. During a preseason minicamp, the Giants came out to
visit. Baab and his teammates were dumbfounded when they witnessed
a tender reunion. ``The Giants players were coming over and
embracing him and joking with him and talking to him like they were
old friends,'' says Baab. ``We couldn't believe it. He never called
us anything that wasn't 12 letters. That first year, he was
completely lacking in people skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Baab is willing to give his tormentor his due. ``I was only
there that one year,'' he says. ``I heard from other guys after
that that he lightened up. I heard from some guys three or four
years later that he let the guys out of camp early, threw them a
beer party. I said, ` Belichick?'
</P>
<P>
   Baab has no doubts that there was a transformation. ``I'm sure
Belichick matured as a coach,'' he says. ``Everyone does. The
evidence is that fourth year, they went to the playoffs and they
were a pretty good passing team. By the end of his tenure, they
were throwing the ball all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a sense, that may have reflected Belichick's most
notorious problem. By then, the man doing the throwing was retread
Vinny Testaverde, because at midseason the previous year, with the
Browns owning a 5-3 record and first place in the AFC Central,
Belichick had released Bernie Kosar, a native Ohioan and as much a
Cleveland fixture as Lake Erie. Worse, at the time of the move,
Testaverde was injured. So third-string nonentity Todd Philcox
temporarily took the controls, the Browns staggered to a 7-9
finish, and Belichick cemented his stature as a civic pariah.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Cleveland are fiercely loyal,'' says Baab. ``They
never forgave Modell for firing (franchise founder and legendary
coach Paul) Brown, and they never forgave Belichick for waiving
Kosar, even though he was pretty beat up by then.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, one of the less antagonistic views is that of
Kosar, who apparently has softened his stance considerably since
the days when he incurred Belichick's lasting wrath by criticizing
the coach's confidant, Mike Lombardi, who the quarterback believed
had ``backstabbed (Browns executive) Ernie Accorsi, who had brought
him in off the street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the beginning of the rift,'' says Kosar. ``Until
then, after that first season, we'd gotten along great. It
obviously wasn't a positive experience for me. That's not
necessarily a shot at Bill. It just didn't work out for me. I
didn't think (being waived) was right at the time, but who does?''
</P>
<P>
   When Belichick took over, says Kosar, ``that wasn't anybody's
team. Discipline is not necessarily a bad thing _ to come on
strong, come on tough, come on grouchy. I'm not saying constant
swearing and belittling are necessary. Bill was a young guy. He
tried to do everything _ offense and defense, contract
negotiations, personnel negotiations. At any age, that's a
difficult job. I think bluntly he wasn't ready. But I do think that
no matter what he says, he mellowed some _ as he got some of his
players in.''
</P>
<P>
   And did those players actually like him eventually?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh sure,'' Kosar says emphatically.
</P>
<P>
   Kosar goes so far as to offer an indirect endorsement of
Belichick's latest posting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Kraft is a great owner,'' he says. ``He's a real smart
businessman, one of the guys I look up to. If he thinks (hiring
Belichick) is the right thing to do and the timing's right, then
that's a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Patriots must hope the signs of a generation ago from
Navy and Phillips Andover and Wesleyan weren't misleading.

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The stories float around from the distant past. Dick
Vermeil stories, all recited with a chuckle and a knowing smile and
maybe a wink, stories of a coach who was too much of a coach,
stories of a coach obsessed, stories of man burning himself out in
full public view, stories that are, well, so hard to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Go back to July 4, 1976. Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Vermeil had just arrived from UCLA, where his Bruins had
whipped Ohio State in the Rose Bowl _ after his players had
rebelled against long practices in the days before the game.
Philadelphia Eagles owner Leonard Tose had chosen Vermeil as his
head coach over Harvard's Joe Restic and Arizona State's Frank
Kush. Tose had been taken by the jutting jaw and the coachly
presence of Vermeil, seen in TV pictures from far off Pasadena,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil now had arrived in Philadelphia and, on the country's
200th birtday, was in his office at Widener College preparing for
his first professional training camp. Except there was a
disturbance outside. Loud noises. Cheers and huzzahs.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil asked a young Eagles executive, Carl Peterson _ now the
top football man with the Kansas City Chiefs _ about the noises.
Why all these fireworks? Why can't a man go about doing his job in
peace and quiet?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for the birthday,'' said Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whose birthday?'' Vermeil replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country's.''
</P>
<P>
   And, on July 4, 1976, in Philadelphia, Dick Vermeil said, ``I
don't give a damn whose birthday it is. Get them to stop all this
noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the time when the sofa in his office was his bed
for two or three days a week, and he would not leave the office,
too many X's and O's to decipher and not enough time. Christmas was
approaching, and devoted wife Carol entreated her husband that the
family needed to get into the spirit. Vermeil suggested that his
wife bring a Christmas tree to Veterans Stadium, and family
presents could be spread around under it.
</P>
<P>
   During the strike season of 1982, when finally there was some
free time in the fall, Carol Vermeil suggested to her husband that
they do something they had yet to do in their six years in
Philadelphia: take a trip to the Pocono Mountains. The Vermeils did
so, and the coach marveled that there were trees in the Poconos and
the trees had leaves and those leaves turned amazing colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew,'' he said after spending hundreds of dollars on
film to take pictures of this wonder of wonders _ trees with
brilliantly colored leaves that Dick Vermeil had never had time to
see.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, long after Vermeil finally had burned out and,
close to a nervous breakdown, had removed himself from coaching to
the safety of a college football television broadcast booth, his
wife suggested they take a vacation in France. The vacation was
wonderful, the chateaus beautiful and the wine savored, until one
day the phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   When Vermeil got off the phone, he informed his wife he was
returning to football as coach of the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you say `(expletive) you' in French?'' Carol Vermeil
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now Vermeil is in the Super Bowl, 19 years after his only
previous appearance. In the days leading up to that game at the
Superdome in New Orleans, whereas the Oakland Raiders were
carousing on Bourbon Street until 3 and 4 in the morning, Vermeil
had his Eagles in pads for double sessions of practice.
Philadelphia lost, 27-10.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ron Jaworski, the quarterback of those Eagles, has walked
around the Georgia Dome and other media sites this week like a
troubadour, singing Vermeil's praises, enthusing to one and all
about his former coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man is an icon,'' said Jaworski. ``And I love him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Jaworski is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First, some background. All pro football teams go through
vigorus ``double sessions'' in training camp, practicing in both
the morning and afternoon to get in shape. Once the games start,
though, practice is usually reduced to once a day, for the obvious
reason that the players are by now in shape and for a more
practical reason: Most pro football players have some injury or
another during the season, and their bodies need to recuperate.
</P>
<P>
   More background: Pro football teams usually practice for about
two hours during the season. Players also attend team meetings,
once again usually about two hours (although the length can vary
depending on the day of the week). Finally, most teams practice in
with the players wearing pads two or three times a week. On
Saturdays a ``walk-through'' is held, with players wearing shorts _
and no pads _ and walking through their offensive and defensive
game plans.
</P>
<P>
   Wilbert Montgomery is the running backs coach of the Rams, one
of three former Eagles players on the St. Louis staff, along with
defensive co-coordinator John Bunting and defensive line coach Carl
Hairston. All played for Vermeil, all share the ``once an Eagle,
always an Eagle'' bond, and all are very fond of Dick Vermeil.
</P>
<P>
   And all have stories to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us ever hated Coach Vermeil when we played for him,''
said Montgomery, ``no matter how hard he had us work.''
</P>
<P>
   Work?
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be five hours out on the football field,'' said
Montgomery. ``But it wasn't a hate-hate relationship. You could go
back to any of his ex-players in Philadelphia, and not one guy
would say they hated him. We believed in him. We'd go to parties at
his house and he'd come to our house; it was a family-type
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   A family whose father figure believed in work first, last, and
foremost. A father figure who was obsessed with work. Both for his
team and for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew he put in a lot of hours and we knew he had a sofa in
his office and he would sleep on it,'' said Montgomery. ``And I can
remember Coach Vermeil and the workouts he would have for himself
before he worked us _ Coach Vermeil would run 5 miles around the
Vet. And he would run that first mile at a certain time and he
would run that last mile at the same time. He would work himself to
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery chuckled. ``Coach Vermeil would have shin splints
from all the running,'' he said, ``and it wouldn't make no
difference to him. I believe that that leg, from running with the
shin spints, still bothers him from all the pounding.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil's players were pounded, too. Relentless practices of
four hours or more, often in full pads.
</P>
<P>
   What was on all the Eagles' minds, said Montgomery, ``was that
we knew we was going out there on the field and we'd be out there a
long time and it was, `How do we get through this?' So someone
would do something crazy to make you forget about the four-hour
practices. So you could get through the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunting, for his part, acknowledged that Montgomery's story was
almost true. ``Well, I had a leather helmet on, too,'' he said. ``I
wanted to loosen up the team because I thought the team was tight.
Every once in a while, I'd so something. I have a wild hair in me,
and I don't mind what consequences I might face. I'd do something
to try and stir those guys up and maybe take the edge off a bit.
Because sometimes it would get edgy, sort of tight.''
</P>
<P>
   As was Vermeil at the end. Edgy, tight, bug-eyed, burnt out.
Forced to leave football before his personality disintegrated.
</P>
<P>
   And when a generation or two of football had passed, with
Vermeil on the sideline watching, old ways and new ways collided
when Vermeil arrived in St. Louis three years ago. Montgomery had
more stories.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery had bought into Vermeil's way of coaching _ that once
football players relax they slack off, that players need to have
fear. ``As long as you play with fear,'' he said, ``you're always
going to play at your best.''

ON-LINE FIRM TO MATCH SMALLER INVESTORS WITH START-UPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve Fu is an advertising guy, not a venture capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong native spent several years with one of the hottest
on-line advertising firms in New York, Interactive Eight, which was
scooped up in a buyout and taken public. Now 32, he's a Web junkie
who wants to help entrepreneurs and bring venture capital to the
masses.
</P>
<P>
   Fu's startup company, Angeltips.com, is setting up a Web
``community,'' where entrepreneurs can post business plans and
investors can vote with their checkbooks on the merits of those
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Think on-line trading, VC-style.
</P>
<P>
   It's fashionable. You can do it yourself, broker-free. The
potential for profits seems too good to resist. And the risks are
easy to ignore when stocks are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum investment is $25,000, a mere fraction of the
$250,000 to $1 million traditionally required from individuals in
venture investing.
</P>
<P>
   For just $10,000, investors can get into Angeltips's Gabriel
Fund, a $5 million venture portfolio that will invest in
early-stage companies. The site's official launch is Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're presenting the American public an opportunity to invest
in start-up companies,'' said Fu, a Boston University alumnus,
whose first job was in corporate banking for the former Bank of
Boston. ``We're opening that arena up for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Opening it up, at least, for accredited investors, who federal
regulators say must have a net worth of $1 million or a regular
annual salary of at least $200,000. Clearly, this is still the
realm of the rich. But the relatively small size of the investment
could make angels out of less lofty investors than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   OffRoad Capital, a San Francisco firm that's also hooking up
venture investors and start-up entrepreneurs, has raised $16
million and financed three deals since September. In its first
deal, completed last month, OffRoad raised $4.5 million from 97
investors in 23 states for an on-line events company. The whole
process took 19 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're democratizing the capital markets,'' said Elizabeth
Pera, spokeswoman for OffRoad. ``You don't have to belong to the
country club or know somebody on Sand Hill Road to invest.''
</P>
<P>
   The allure of venture capital is, for most, to get in on the
ground floor when the companies they've backed sell stock to the
public for the first time. And in these frothy dot.com days, more
people than ever have fantasies of breaking into venture capital's
private club and ultimately landing shares in an IPO.
</P>
<P>
   But there are significant risks in venture investing.
</P>
<P>
   First, you can't quickly cash out of a venture investment like
you can with stocks. It takes three to five years, on average, from
the time you invest in a young entrepreneur until that company is
sold or goes public. As many as seven in 10 venture investments
fail, although Angeltips' Fu hopes to provide a success rate of
five in 10. Even when firms make it to the IPO market, there's no
guaranteeing they'll become hot stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Glovsky, head of Mintz Levin Financial Advisors in Boston,
says there's a growing demand among his clients to get into venture
funds. It's the stuff of cocktail-party banter among investors with
at least $1 million in their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But Glovsky said he'd steer investors away from small-time
venture fund-raisers and stick with Wall Street firms and
established venture players. The big firms tend to finance the most
promising entrepreneurs, he argued, while the new on-line players
may get the leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be careful that the greed side doesn't take over,
and that you don't put your money with people you shouldn't,''
Glovsky warned.
</P>
<P>
   Fu contends there are plenty of good companies out there that
lack access to the monied inner circles of Silicon Valley, New
York, or Boston. He said Angeltips will screen entrepreneurs'
proposals (there's a $250 fee to post a business plan) and toss out
those that don't meet certain specs, before putting them on the Web
site for angels to peruse and discuss on line.
</P>
<P>
   Fu admits he can't promise Angeltips will produce the next
Amazon.com. But he vowed there will be no fried-chicken stands in
the mix. Bad ideas simply won't be financed, Fu said: ``The
community is really going to police the ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   George Conrades, a partner at Polaris Venture Partners in
Waltham and chief executive of one of last year's hottest IPO
stories, Akamai Technologies, said the idea of using the Internet
to bring start-ups and investors together isn't bad. But even a Web
aficionado like him is leery of venture decisions that are made
entirely over computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one of those who sees a future where the Web replaces
human interaction,'' Conrades said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Garage.com, considered a leader in on-line venture capital,
raised $101 million last year and financed 40 companies. And from
the entrepreneur's perspective, one can see the attraction of
posting a plan on line and attracting money quickly _ even modest
money _ versus making pitches at crowded breakfasts in forgotten
hotels, shouting over piped-in Muzak and clinking coffee mugs.
</P>
<P>
   Some regulators worry that small or unsophisticated investors
may slip through the cracks and get into the on-line venture game,
unaware of the risks they're taking. Said Matt Nestor, chief of the
Masssachusetts Securities Division, ``When it comes to people using
the Internet to find accredited investors, sometimes there's a wink
and a nod.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a growing chorus of voices asking why even smaller
investors should be barred from venture capital, risks and all.
Observed Jim Laird, senior research analyst at the Yankee Group,
``There are a lot of lousy penny stocks out there you can buy. Why
in the world do you have to be rich to participate in the private
equity market?''

KEARSE RUSHING TO GLORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The surname is a form of savage mockery. Kearse.
Rhymes with curse. As in hearse.
</P>
<P>
   Those seemed to be the staples of Jevon Kearse's blighted
boyhood in North Fort Myers, Fla. Eight months before Jevon's
birth, his father was shot dead in a pool hall, and a violent,
tragic trend was established. His half-brother was later killed in
a drive-by shooting. A grandfather and an uncle also became gunshot
victims. Yet another brother is serving a prison sentence for armed
robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Jevon was helpless to prevent any of this. So he did the next
best thing _ he took it upon himself to become a survivor and to
ensure that his four remaining siblings did likewise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, there was nothing I could do about it,'' he says.
``Growing up the way I did, I had to take on a lot of
responsibility. I set goals for myself. Growing up with a single
mom, I didn't want to give her anything more to worry about.
Basically, with a single mom working all the time, I had to take on
a lot of responsibility _ cleaning, changing diapers, watching the
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   He found time to watch out for himself as well. Jevon became the
first member of the Kearse family to graduate from high school and
qualified for the National Honor Society in the process.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His nickname is a form of savage tribute. The Freak. As in a
preternatural physical specimen with blinding speed (4.43 seconds
in the 40-yard dash), skyscraper jumping ability (40-inch vertical
leap), a pterodactyl's reach (86-inch wingspan), and concussive
strength (6 feet 4 inches, 265 pounds).
</P>
<P>
   ``My teammates gave it to me at the University of Florida,''
says Kearse. ``Watching films, they'd see me running from right to
left, getting to the quarterback, blocking kicks, and I was
supposed to be too small. So that's what they called me. I don't
mind it.''
</P>
<P>
   By any name, the Tennessee Titans love him. They're here for the
Super Bowl, in which they'll meet the St. Louis Rams Sunday at the
Georgia Dome, and Kearse is a protean reason. He virtually defied
description in college, where he began as a strong safety, grew
into a linebacker (``I always wanted to be a skill player, but I
kept putting on weight so I couldn't do it,'' he says), and, after
being named national Defensive Player of the Year as a junior,
entered the NFL draft, leaving most personnel directors scratching
their heads as they tried to figure out where to put him.
</P>
<P>
   The answer: at the head of the class. While the rest of the
league was pondering, the Titans were drooling, considering Kearse
a gold mine as the No. 16 pick and determining that his NFL address
would be defensive end, period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Falling so far in the draft, I had my doubts about where I
could play,'' says Kearse. ``But I've become accustomed to the
position. My coaches and teammates were great in helping me get
acclimated. They've really made it fun. The year went by fast.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not over yet. Kearse has not one but two games left _
Sunday and the following Sunday in Honolulu, where he will become
the first AFC rookie defensive end ever to play in the Pro Bowl.
That's the reward for his NFL rookie-record 14 1/2 sacks, his
league-high 10 forced fumbles, his 85 tackles, and his utter
confounding of the skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   That last category does not include Titans head coach Jeff
Fisher and defensive coordinator Gregg Williams, who didn't believe
only one thing about Kearse _ that he was still around when
Tennessee's draft number was called.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some question in our mind about how he could handle
the point of attack,'' says Fisher. ``That's why we changed our
defense some. Obviously, he's done more than we expected. That's
why we resisted the temptation to move him around. We wanted him to
learn one position.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams concurs: ``The smartest thing we did was decide the day
we drafted him that we weren't going to move Jevon around.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearse does enough of that on his own. His agility makes him an
ambush waiting to happen regardless of the unfortunate
ballcarrier's location.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of having him be average at a bunch of positions, we
wanted to put him where they couldn't avoid him,'' says Williams.
``Even when the play is run away from him, he thinks he's going to
make the play. And in coverage, you can't get the ball by him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kearse didn't become the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year
merely because he's a force of nature. Determination is part of the
bargain, with some harsh prodding from Williams as an incentive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one place where he's exceeded expectations is being
physical against the run,'' says Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The coach believes that stems from a preseason goal-line drill
in which he felt Kearse's pursuit was lax _ and ripped him in front
of the entire team so he'd get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``He responded by making it a vendetta to play physical,'' says
Williams. ``He wanted everyone in the league to know he could play
physical against the run.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, public scolding is kid's glove treatment relative to
Kearse's background, which he believes prepared him to make a
singular impact _ both on opposing backs and the league _ at age
23.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming here as a rookie, I had to grow up quickly,'' he says,
``just like at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he somehow retains an innocence about what he calls ``a
magical year.'' His reaction to making the Pro Bowl is typical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, `How come you voted for me?' '' he says. ``There
are so many great defensive ends.''
</P>
<P>
   But none with more experience than Jevon Kearse, who finally
finds himself blessed.

ABC DROPS THE BALL BEFORE THE GAME STARTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's almost impossible to turn off viewers during the Super
Bowl. Fox tried last year by having a seven-hour pregame show. Not
even that onslaught deterred the die-hards determined to watch
every second of coverage. But give the folks at ABC some credit.
They have managed to figure out a way to make even the diehards
paint the trim around their windows until the game starts at 6:18
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has had plenty of time to prepare some interesting features
for its four-hour pregame show. It didn't. Another tear-jerking
story about the travails of the Cuban boy would be better.
Listening to Alan Keyes talk about his presidential aspirations
would be better. Watching lions eat zebras on the Nature Channel
would be better. Anything other than what ABC is serving up on the
NFL's holiest day.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the features are horrid; some are almost interesting,
but most are underwhelming, showing a lack of imagination in this
age of dot-com coolness. No wonder people can't wait for the
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Roberts's piece on Fritz Pollard, the first black player
and head coach in the NFL, is historically significant, but ``first
black'' stories went out with dashikis and Jesse Jackson's lame
protest of Ray Rhodes's sacking in Green Bay. But give Pollard his
due. He played and coached for the Akron Pros in 1921, at a time
when lynching brothers was one of the nation's favorite pastimes.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tirico has a feature on Vince Lombardi _ are the Packers in
the Super Bowl this year? _ and Brent Musburger has what ABC bills
as a ``compelling feature'' on the late Walter Payton. Both are
fine journalistic layups that would score low on the judges' tally
because they lack in degree of difficulty. Both subjects have been
well-mined, and uncovering any new anecdotal nuggets would be like
striking oil in Dorchester.
</P>
<P>
   The meat of ABC's lineup is of the tofu variety. Beano Cook, the
veteran college football analyst, has a story on the Cumberland
game. Remember that one? You know, the 1916 game in which Georgia
Tech beat Cumberland College, 220-0. Why is ABC doing a story on
that? Glad you asked. Because the Tennessee Titans are working out
at the same Georgia Tech stadium in which the Cumberland game was
played. No, Beano didn't cover the game, so he will not offer any
personal recollections. Stop being so silly.
</P>
<P>
   Cook's report will be followed by a chat among Roberts, Lesley
Visser, Barbara Walters, and the all-woman cast of ABC's ``The
View''; Dan Fouts hosting the ``Hershey's Million Dollar Kick''
from, yup, the new ESPN Zone restaurant in Atlanta; and ``Good
Morning America's'' Charles Gibson interviewing both Super Bowl
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the tofu is a magician, a chef, a performance by
Lynyrd Skynyrd at the NFL Tailgate Party, and Tina Turner singing
``Proud Mary'' at the Georgia Dome. Did you know Dan Marino adopted
a Chinese baby? Jimmy Roberts has that human-interest story. Did
you also know Marino is a multimillionaire who rountinely snaps at
reporters who make 50 grand per year and ask such questions as,
``Hey, Dan, after you threw four interceptions in one game and your
team lost by 50 points in a playoff game, have you thought about
retiring?''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah, there is some football stuff. Chris Berman lists his
top 10 Super Bowl plays of all time _ after he interviews rocker
Phil Collins. Al Michaels names the 30th anniversary team of
``Monday Night Football'' after Tirico hosts a roundtable
discussion with Fouts, Bob Griese, Jim Kelly, and Ron Jaworski.
</P>
<P>
   The best story that ABC offers is reported by Andrea Kremer, one
of ESPN's best and brightest. Her topic is concussions in the NFL,
and here's a story behind the story:
</P>
<P>
   While most of the ESPN guys are whining about Atlanta's cold
weather, Kremer is in an Atlanta hospital waiting to give birth to
a child at any second. From the hospital room on Tuesday, she
completed final edits.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Kremer's heroics could save this pregame nightmare.
What about a story on both franchises _ Los Angeles and Houston,
er, St. Louis and Tennessee _ that are actually playing in the
Super Bowl? How about something on how the Rams could have such a
great season after not one NFL analyst picked them? How about a
story on Trent Green, the Rams quarterback who by being injured
during the exhibition season inadvertently gave Kurt Warner his
shot? And how come the Rams are favored when they lost to the
Titans during the regular season? Who picked the Titans' colors and
designed those uniforms? Is Tennessee coach Jeff Fisher leaving
after the game _ and who is he, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   How come Boomer Esiason is not contributing any stories to the
pregame show? He played in a Super Bowl. (Hey, Boomer, watch your
back. Steve Young is knocking.) If Dick Vermeil is so good, how
come ABC is not doing a story on him? Oh, right, Gibson is
interviewing the coaches. Are the ratings on his morning show so
bad he needs more exposure?
</P>
<P>
   Viewers understand a network's need to promote itself during the
Super Bowl. Viewers also understand the need to attract casual fans
with softer, gentler features. But no one understands the need to
virtually ignore the game and the two teams. It is their stories
that are driving the economic windfall ABC is receiving, and very
few would be bored with their stories.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a suggestion: The next time ABC has the Super Bowl, it
should either let ESPN handle the pregame show with its army of
uniquely qualified reporters, or simply rerun Super Bowl tapes from
NFL Films.
</P>
<P>
   John Facenda still rules.

   But some things no longer were done the old way. When the Eagles
had played in Super Bowl XV, for instance, ``we had double
practices in the days before,'' said Montgomery, ``and we had pads
on in practice and we also had some meetings that went late at
night. But we had done that all year; it wasn't something that was
different for us. We'd never had a light practice all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Never.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never. Even on Saturday. Today, our guys go out in caps and
shorts on Saturday, but in our day we'd go out in helmets and
shoulder pads. And I remember the first time I was a coach and
they'd go through a walk-through on Saturdays. Me? I'd never seen a
walk-through until then.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither had Vermeil.
</P>
<P>
   So when he took over in 1997, it took a while for him to
understand that the 1990s were far different from the 1970s,
especially on the day before a game. ``For him to go through a
walk, it must be killing him,'' said Montgomery. ``It must like . .
. it's one of these.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilbert Montgomery then gritted his teeth and stuck an index
finger in his mouth and bit down. Hard. ``The man didn't know what
a walk-though was; he'd never seen a walk-through.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: In all of sports, there is no fiercer shark tank
for coaches than Philadelphia. Fans there eat their coaches with a
passion. Yet, there is one former coach of a Philadelphia team who
is still beloved in the City of Brotherly Love. Dick Vermeil.
</P>
<P>
   Years and years after Vermeil left the Eagles, his face would be
on billboards promoting Blue Cross of Pennsylvania. No name was
needed on the billboards; merely Vermeil's face. Even now, 18 years
after he left, Vermeil's face is still on Philadelphia billboards.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Jaworski uses a word to describe Philadelphia's relation
to Vermeil that probably never has been used for another
Philadelphia sports figure except maybe Richie Asburn: ``He's an
icon there. People still love him. And, as the years go by, that
love doesn't wane.''
</P>
<P>
   After arriving in Atlanta for this Super Bowl, Vermeil conceded
that his approach to football ``is pretty much the same,'' he said,
``but I'm a lot less intense person. I made the comment coming off
the plane, `Gosh, I can remember being wound up in knots when we
landed in New Orlans to play (Super Bowl XV).''
</P>
<P>
   Jaworksi, for his part, acknowledges the media cliche that the
Raiders defeated the Eagles in that game because the Philadelphia
players were locked in their rooms, tight as a drum, while the
Oakland players were carousing and loose. It might have helped,
said the former Eagles quarterback, ``if I wasn't so wound up
myself and if I hadn't thought I had to do everything myself to win
the game and if I hadn't thrown that pass right at the start that
(Oakland linebacker) Rod Martin picked off and ran back for a TD.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Eagles had won the Super Bowl, Jaworski said, ``it would
have been because of all the hard work and preparation that Coach
Vermeil put in. But since we lost the game, it's become, `The
Eagles lost because of all the hard work.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil is a different coach this time. ``I'm a little more
mature and have a little better approach,'' he said. This time his
team's practices are of normal length.
</P>
<P>
   Abnormal for Dick Vermeil. But normal for the rest of football.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was a near-revolt by the Rams players on the Monday after
the first game of the 1998 season _ after an admitted ``boot camp''
at training camp _ against Vermeil's continued long practices
(often nearly three hours), long meetings, and heavy contact. If
not quite close to mutiny, the players did grumble openly, and
rumblings of discontent were loud and getting louder. Eventually,
the complaints subsided after Vermeil promised he would shorten
practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I backed off this year,'' said Vermeil. But he says the
reason he did it was not because of player unhappiness but because
``two boot camps'' were enough for his team. ``If you take any
great fighting group, you don't keep them in boot camp the whole
time. You take the Navy SEALS, you take the great Marines and those
groups, and they don't stay in boot camp. It took us a while to get
out of boot camp.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bunting, Montgomery, and other assistant said they had to
convince Vermeil to try a lighter approach. Montgomery, in
particular, recalled the coaches meeting during which Vermeil
agreed that the Rams' 1999 training camp would not be a ``boot
camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil ``had a hard time dealing with that,'' said Montgomery,
``but he said he would give it a shot. But he mentioned in a
meeting with the coaching staff that `if the players don't respond
and the bottom starts to fall out, we're going back to the old
way.' But the players responded to the changes.''
</P>
<P>
   After the St. Louis assistants convinced Vermail to soften up,
he also came to understand that a grumbling, unhappy team is not an
enthusiastic team. ``We wanted to end training camp with a real
strong, high level of enthusiasm left in them,'' he said. ``I'd
drained 'em the first couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   So it went, back and forth, Vermeil conceding one moment that he
has lightened up but agruing in the next moment that his way of
tough coaching is the best way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know something? They wouldn't bitch even one minute,'' he
said, ``if we were undefeated or if we were 9-7. In my first year
here, we opened up and we beat New Orleans and that training camp
was hell. But we won the first game, and we didn't have a meeting
on Monday (with unhappy players).''
</P>
<P>
   The next season, Vermeil went on, ``we went through the same
training camp beating the hell out of each other and everything
else and we played poorly in the first game. And we had a meeting.
A good meeting. Good for me. Good for them.''
</P>
<P>
   At this time last year, there were rumblings in St. Louis that
Vermeil had to go after compiling a 9-23 mark in his two years
because he was ``senile'' or ``the game had passed him by.'' This
year, there are rumblings that Vermeil might go if the Rams win the
Super Bowl because it would be a most happy ending to a 40-year
coaching career that began at Hillsdale High in San Mateo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   And when he does leave, Vermeil will know he left after 40 years
of coaching his way. Perhaps he has adjusted a bit, perhaps he has
been persuaded to lighten up, perhaps at this Super Bowl his team
will not don shoulder pads but will ``walk through'' its plays in
shorts.
</P>
<P>
   But, Vermeil adamantly said, ``If I was starting a new program
tomorrow, I'd do it exactly the same way as I've done.''

KEEP ATTIC VENTS OPEN ALL YEAR LONG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 30, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have 1,800 square feet of attic space with only two roof
vents. I keep the vents open all year. Each vent has a hinged
cover. I never close them, but I can't convince my wife that they
should stay open. She feels they should be open in summer and
closed in winter.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE DiVIRGILIO, Swampscott, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, George, you just got the handyman stuck between husband
and wife, a very precarious position. Since I'm there, I'll jump in
with both front feet. You are right, George. The vents should be
open all year, to vent out moisture and heat.
</P>
<P>
   The covers on the vents are strange, but they may hark back to a
time when it was thought OK to close the vents in winter. I think
notion came from the practice of closing vents in crawl space and
basement in winter. OK for basements and crawl spaces, not for
attics.
</P>
<P>
   I think you should have more vents. The size of the attic and
the fact that there are just two vents lead me to guess that you
have a hipped roof, one that slopes down on all four sides. If that
is so, you can put a ridge vent on any ridge the roof might have.
If there is no ridge, go to more roof vents. Finish up wth soffit
vents, continuous 2-inch-wide louvered or perforated strips going
the full length of all soffits, the underpart of the roof overhang.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I plan to install oak floorboards over old tile. Can I do it?
I was concerned the tiles might crack. Is that a problem?
</P>
<P>
   CARLA DOOKAS, Windham, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. No problem. Yes, you can apply boards over tile, which I
assume is plastic. Even if they're vinyl asbestos (you are not
supposed to crack those tiles), and they crack from nailing, the
tongued-and-grooved boards seal in any loose asbestos fibers,
particularly if you lay building paper or tarpaper over the tiles
first.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am having my chimney relined. What is best: stainless steel
or clay? An installer proposed a seamless stainless steel tube
inserted in the chimney, estimated at $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   TOM MOONEY, Beverly, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It may sound high, but if it is a one- or two-story chimney
from basement to roof, it is not unreasonable. Metal liners
(stainless steel or aluminum) are popular because they are easy to
install, will last a long time, and are recommended for gas-fired
boilers and furnaces. A standard clay liner is difficult to
install.
</P>
<P>
   Another good liner is the Solid Flue system, in which a rubber
tube is inserted in the chimney and positioned so that a special
mortar is installed between the tube and the chimney walls. When
the mortar sets, the tube is removed and the liner is set to do its
thing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When I had a second story added, they extended the chimney
through the attic and roof. Now, I see lime leaching through the
concrete blocks. I would like to box in that chimney. Is that
acceptable? Should I parge the chimney before boxing it in?
</P>
<P>
   STEPHEN PICKETT, Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes to all questions, and that applies to the chimney in the
attic and that part sticking out through the roof. The lime
leaching out of the concrete blocks is efflorescence (literally,
``flowering'') caused by water. It is harmless and difficult to
prevent. To parge (applying a bed or mortar to the chimney), first
apply a bonding agent to the chimney; this is essential to prevent
peeling of the mortar. Parging may not stop the efflorescence, but
it may delay it. If the parging looks good, you can dispense with
the boxing-in.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I bought three overhead steel insulated doors with an enamel
finish and a poly film to keep them from being scratched. I hung
the doors and left the film on through the winter. Now the film
does not come off. I tried a heat gun, paint strippers, and other
solvents with no success.
</P>
<P>
   I called the people who sold me the doors, and they said they
never heard of the film not coming off. They also said that it is
our problem. Can you give me a solution?
</P>
<P>
   CHARLES KARR, Southington, Ohio
</P>
<P>
   A. I have a solution: throw the doors back in their faces; Their
telling you it's your problem is not great public relations. Even
if it is your fault, they could have offered sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what you can do: Mayonnaise or vinegar is used to take
off the backing paper from acrylic, Plexiglas, and other plastics,
so it should work for the film on painted steel doors. I don't
think you have to work with smelly mayonnaise; any oil will do.
</P>
<P>
   But first try the vinegar. Try to get the vinegar under the
plastic film, and pull the plastic off as you work more vinegar
under it. It will be slow and tedious. Use a putty knife to pry up
the film to get the vinegar under it.
</P>
<P>
   If the vinegar does not work, then use oil (any kind will do)
trying to soften the film and working it under the film to try to
break the cling, and pull and apply oil as you go.
</P>
<P>
   Oil will soften almost anything. When you apply it, let it sit
on the material for 15 minutes before trying to work off the film.
</P>

WHILE OTHERS STUMBLE, SAPIENT THRIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Things change.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Greenberg and Stu Moore, credit card capitalists who
turned their bootstrap investments into billion-dollar paper
fortunes inside a decade, can appreciate that.
</P>
<P>
   It was just a few years ago when the company they cofounded,
Sapient Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., was a small but credible
competitor in a sea of consulting businesses that helped their
corporate clients do more with technology.
</P>
<P>
   Now many of the old leaders like Cambridge Technology Partners
Inc. have fallen on tougher times, leaking stock market capital and
management talent. A new generation of competitors like Viant
Corp., devoted exclusively to corporate Internet projects, are
today's Wall Street darlings.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the fallout, Sapient thrived because its managers shifted
their business toward the Web earlier and more effectively than
competitors. The foresight, luck, and circumstances that led to
that initial decision in 1994
</P>
<P>
   turned Sapient into a closely followed leader today.
</P>
<P>
   ``As with any e-business, getting out there among the first is
definitely a plus,'' said Stephen Lane, a research director at the
Boston-based Aberdeen Group. ``There are dozens, if not hundreds,
of firms trying to repeat that model as we speak.''
</P>
<P>
   The rewards: Sapient said Thursday that fourth-quarter revenues
of $81 million were up 52 percent from the same period a year
earlier and the company earned $9.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of hyper growth, actually a bit slower than past
quarters, and real earnings have propelled Sapient stock in a
market enthralled by business-to-business companies tied to the
Internet. The shares, up 216 percent over the last year, now trade
at a nose-bleeding 211 times earnings. It closed Thursday at 119
1/2, up 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greenberg and Moore have done a great job of meeting or
beating'' Wall Street executations, said David L. Smith of Loomis,
Sayles &AMP; Co., the Boston money management firm. ``The market
clearly has rewarded companies that haven't disappointed.'' He sees
continued 40 percent sales growth as a realistic forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg and Moore, who met at Cambridge Technology Partners,
created Sapient in 1991 by kicking in $40,000 apiece and have
operated in the unusual roles of co-chief executives ever since.
Today, they still share a single office with side-by-side desks.
</P>
<P>
   Their modest start and lack of venture capital financing have
permitted Greenberg, 34, and Moore, 38, to each retain nearly 20
percent of Sapient's stock. They insist their stake, worth roughly
$1.2 billion apiece, hasn't dulled their ambition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand Stu and I have been fortunate to end up with an
insane amount of money,'' said Greenberg. ``But we could have hired
some other CEO to come in here. We've been in here working our
butts off for the last four years to continue to do what we set off
to do, to build a great organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Sapient's transition into an Internet-oriented company was as
much a decision about what the company's managers didn't want to do
in 1994. They didn't want to become implementers of very popular
but complex ``enterprise'' corporate software sold by leading
vendors like Germany's SAP AG.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, enterprise software was where the corporate world
seemed to be headed. But their own experience on the Internet
convinced Sapient managers to focus there instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked like fools for two years, in 1995 and 1996,'' said
Greenberg. ``People thought we missed the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Sapient's mix of business shifted gradually, from a broad
variety of technology projects to pure Internet plans. One
advantage: Sapient managers always thought of themselves as
business problem-solvers, not tech wizards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you have that mindset, you're pretty free to adopt new
things,'' said Moore. ``When we saw the potential of the Internet,
we didn't have to hold on to any legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   One job performed by the old Sapient: figuring out how to
automate hundreds of field service employees working for Public
Service Electric and Gas in New Jersey, deploying what Greenberg
said was the world's largest wireless cellular system at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Sapient points to new clients like iWon Inc. as the
places where they want to work. Sapient helped develop and launch
the company's heavily advertised Internet search site iWon.com,
which gives away $1 million a month to users, from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They delivered the world,'' said Bill Daugherty, founder and
co-chief executive of iWon. ``We built a portal that competes head
to head with Yahoo in 4 1/2 months.''
</P>
<P>
   The job launching iWon.com also gave Sapient the kind of role it
prefers: tech work mixed with business strategy, which is more
likely to forge an ongoing customer relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Sapient competes today with a growing number of heavily financed
``e-consultants'' created exclusively to work on the kind of
Internet-based jobs it performs, not to mention big, traditional
business consulting firms. In this fragmented field, no one can
claim a double-digit market share.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there is still so much new business to go around that it
won't matter for some time. Sapient is aggressively expanding in
Europe and has added senior managers, like former Pepsi
International executive Edward Golfinger as its new chief
executive, to oversee global growth.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue: Will Greenberg and Moore still be the right
people to manage a much larger company when they continue to own a
near-controlling amount of stock? Accomplished entrepreneurs aren't
necessarily the best choices to lead big companies and Sapient has
already grown to employ more than 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Moore and Greenberg said they discuss that issue with Sapient's
board and others regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no logic that says because Stu and I have gotten it to
here that we can take it further,'' said Greenberg. ``I worry on a
personal level whether I will be able to take this thing to where
we need to go, but from a company perspective it's an easy
decision. If I can't do it, then get somebody in here who can.''
</P>
<P>
   That won't be anytime soon. ``It could happen, but we're both
into this thing,'' Greenberg said.

FRANCIS STAYS SHIELDED FROM TYSON MANIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, England _ Steve ``Crocodile'' Finch was in rare form
Thursday, trying to inspire his fighter to victory. Long before the
arrival of Mike Tyson at a press conference at the MEN Arena,
Tyson's head cheerleader had mangled the language as savagely as he
hopes Tyson will mangle Julius Francis Saturday night, all in
support of his man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Steakspear said, `Let he who has not sinned cast the
first stone,' '' Finch babbled, apparently quoting William
Shakespeare quoting Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   That Tyson has sinned regularly and with great alacrity has been
verified not only by two courts of law but also by his own words.
For all his faults though, he also repeats stories of his own
insecurities and personal failures at least as often as he directs
threats of impending violence and doom at people like Francis, an
obscure British heavyweight who would appear to have little chance
of survival.
</P>
<P>
   They are stories that have long grown boring in the States, but
across the water everything is playing out well. Even Tyson's
contention Thursday that his rape conviction was a sham and that
the true victim all these years has been none other than Iron Mike
himself seemed more to titillate the assemblage than irk it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everybody loved me and everybody was my friend, I'd be an
enemy to myself,'' Tyson said. ``I've been wrongly convicted of
this bizarre rape scene. People act as if the jurisprudence system
never makes a mistake. People know better. That's why I've gotten
slack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you've got a record doesn't mean it's over for
you. It doesn't mean you're a piece of trash. It doesn't mean you
get tossed out like an old towel. Besides, I don't care what you
think any way. You haven't read my manuscript. You can't say
anything if you haven't investigated it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're Crocodile Finch, in which case you can say
anything without investigating it because nobody with any sense is
listening anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't no cheerleader, I'm a master motivator,'' Finch
declared. ``Give him his respect. Youngest heavyweight champion
ever. Greatest fighter of his error.''
</P>
<P>
   Oops, there it is.
</P>
<P>
   Error or not, Mike Tyson seems not to have made any mistakes
choosing England for a change of venue and Francis for a change of
victim. The one has gone wild for him and the other seems likely to
go early, as was evidenced by the reaction of a man named Mike
Jones when he saw Tyson's opponent standing atop a police van as
Tyson approached the Midland Hotel Thursday to a mob scene.
</P>
<P>
   As Francis pulled off his coat and flexed his muscles at Tyson,
Jones said, ``Look, it's that guy Francis Julian.''
</P>
<P>
   Oops, there it is again.
</P>
<P>
   The unbridled truth is that not even fight fans here know quite
who Francis is nor do they care. All they care about is the
swaggering Tyson, who walked into the MEN Center 40 minutes late
for his final prefight press conference after first telling his
handlers he wanted to do it from his hotel suite. Informed that
would be impossible, a truculent Tyson finally ambled in, declared
himself innocent of past crimes, happy to be rid of promoter Don
King, and loyal to Islam and mayhem, not necessarily in that order
of preference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been many religions,'' Tyson said. ``Catholic. Baptist.
Islam is who I am naturally without really trying. But that doesn't
necessarily mean I'm a good person because I'm a Muslim. We're all
judged by our deeds and our conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an animal in the ring. I don't know how he feels about
that. I'm an animal who follows the Marquis of Queensbury rules. I
never doubt who I am. All praise to Allah!''
</P>
<P>
   Allah is not getting all the praise around Tyson, however. At
least not when Crocodile is crowing and the adoring British press
and local fight fans are around, which is during Tyson's every
waking hour.
</P>
<P>
   During those times, never is heard a discouraging word about
Tyson. He is a new man, they all say. He is misunderstood, they all
say. He is just Mike, they all say. He is the best fighter of his
error, they all say.
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing to a protest comes from Tyson's own manager,
Shelly Finkel, who pointed out that while it might be true that the
33-year-old Tyson is not what he was when he first won the
undisputed title 13 years ago, he is still more than enough to
satisfy both the public and the public demands of his job.
</P>
<P>
   Beloved British middleweight ``Nigel Benn said it best,'' Finkel
said of Tyson Thursday. ``Mine may not be the fighter of 1989, but
they better be concerned about the fighter of 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   As Finkel said that he glanced down at Francis, who was sitting
at the other end of the dais with dark glasses on and a cassette
player headset jammed in his ears. Never was heard a discouraging
word in Francis's corner either. Except in whispers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy may not get out of the first round,'' said someone
from deep inside Francis's camp. ``He has no reason to think he can
win.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the idea all along, of course. To not only try to
recreate the myth of Tyson mania but rebuild the legend as well.
Who better than a man like Francis, who towered over Tyson Thursday
in what the Brits call a ``face-to-face,'' yet seemed to shrink in
his presence?
</P>
<P>
   Who better than a guy wrapped in a cocoon of silence, his ears
blocked by blasting music as Mike Tyson threatened him?
</P>

   ``He's ready to lose his bag,'' said Glenn McCrory, the former
cruiserweight champion, when asked his assessment of Francis's
headphones and sunglasses look. ``He can't even face the guy.''

   Oops, there it really is. Just what Mike Tyson and Crocodile
Finch have been looking for.
</P>
<P>
   Real boxing inspiration.

CRITICS SAY SKI AREA SNOWMAKING DRAINING AQUIFERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT BRAILE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in early December, when it seemed like New England would
never see snow this winter, the American Skiing Company made a bold
offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Maine company, America's largest operator of ski and golf
resorts, guaranteed skiers coming to its six New England resorts
that 70 percent of the trails would be blanketed with snow, a bold
promise given the balmy temperatures last month.
</P>
<P>
   If skiers found fewer snowy trails, they would get 25 percent
off their next visit there, and $500 in credit on a trip to two of
the company's resorts in Colorado and Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dearth of snow, all but one resort _ Maine's
Sugarloaf _ made it to 70 percent, and did so early in the week
when the deal was announced, said Skip King, American Skiing
Company vice president. How? By pumping water from rivers, ponds,
reservoirs, and wells, and making it into snow.
</P>
<P>
   New England finally has all the natural snow it can handle,
thanks to recent storms. But that snow came late, sparking concern
among environmentalists that resorts across the region may have
pumped an unusually large amount of water in an unusually short
period of time, imperiling the ecological health of New England's
rivers and ponds.
</P>
<P>
   The environmentalists would look to Maine, New Hampshire, and
Vermont state agencies to find out whether excessive pumping has
occurred and done any harm. But therein lies their second concern _
the agencies' lax oversight of the resorts, which in all three
states has left state officials clueless as to how much pumping has
occurred, and whether it has caused a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Permits are required of some resorts. And Vermont has set
minimum flow standards for rivers, although it did so in 1996,
after many permits had been issued and ``grand-fathered'' from the
standards. But that aside, the officials admit that compliance
monitoring is often loose, after-the-fact, and done by the resorts
themselves, at a time when many resorts are seeking to expand and
ecological concern over rivers especially is mounting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that water in New England is running uphill to the
ski resorts,'' said Mark Sinclair, the Conservation Law
Foundation's Vermont director and a former state official there
involved in snowmaking policy. ``Snowmaking is a good illustration
of the inadequacy of environmental regulation and enforcement in
the New England states.''
</P>
<P>
   One sign of a snowmaking surge came in New Hampshire, where the
Loon Mountain ski resort asked a federal court on Jan. 8 to approve
an increase in the amount of water it may pump this winter to 190
million gallons. The court had previously limited it to 159.7
million gallons. It cited ``extreme and unusual weather
conditions,'' which forced it to ``greatly increase its early
season snow production.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sign came this week in Vermont. There, a state official,
asked how much water the state's 16 resorts pumped in December,
learned after checking only two that one, Stratton Mountain, pumped
140 million gallons. In the prior three years, it pumped 66 to 117
million gallons a year, said Jeffrey Cueto, principal hydrologist
at the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly was a lot more pressure to get our snowmaking
systems going, because we had a shorter window than we usually have
to get as much terrain open as we usually do,'' King said. American
Skiing Company was ``literally running every snow gun at as much
capacity as we could'' late last month and earlier this month at
its resorts.
</P>
<P>
   But King said the company will not pump any more this winter
than it usually does and much of the snow will melt into the
rivers. It fills reservoirs at most of its resorts when rivers run
high in the spring, so it can make snow in the winter without
harming the rivers, which run low then, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists remain unconvinced. They say snowmaking, an
industry practice for about 30 years, is imperiling river and pond
habitats for fish and wildlife at a time of year when those
habitats are most vulnerable. It is also a risk to people who rely
on rivers for drinking water, not just depleting the amount of
water but reducing the capacity of rivers to dilute municipal and
industrial wastes dumped in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snowmaking is creating deserts out of our rivers,'' said David
Carle, executive director of the Conservation Action Project, a New
Hampshire group. Water withdrawals have ``been found to be harmful
with every industry except skiing, and that's because nobody's
looked.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire's 18 resorts must report their water use to the
state, but only at the end of the season, and so it is impossible
to know now whether any pumped excessively, said Rick Chormann, a
state Department of Environmental Services official. Also, the
resorts do the reports themselves, and the state lacks the staff
and resources to check on their accuracy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect the pumping will be greater than in past years,''
Chormann said. But estimating by how much, and what harm it may
have done, would at this point ``only be speculation.'' Loon
Mountain is an exception, as litigation over its proposed expansion
has resulted in a court order restricting its snowmaking and other
activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Vermont's 16 resorts must also provide the state with
their own water use reports, only monthly, said Cueto. But he said
the agency also lacks the means to keep tabs, unable for instance
to maintain a long-term data base on water use over many years. As
a result, ``I really haven't got a clue'' as to whether excessive
snowmaking occurred in December, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maine ``would have no way to know that'' either, said Jeff
Madore, a state Department of Environmental Protection official, as
its 21 resorts do not have to file any water use reports. Are the
environmentalists' concerns justified? ``I don't have an answer to
that, because I really don't know how much water the resorts are
using,'' he said.

GORE AND MCCAIN CARRY THE DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ This is the meat-grinder stage of the
make-or-break New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   The distant rumble of tanks and artillery draws near. It's
showtime. The final debates Wednesday night did nothing to alter
the terrain over which the surviving campaigns must navigate. Best
positioned to methodically deploy their core vote are Vice
President Al Gore and Texas Governor George W. Bush, who have the
preeminent armies in the field. Bill Bradley looked like no kind of
Happy Warrior accusing Gore of falsehood, distortion, selective
record-reading.
</P>
<P>
   Where has Bill been? This is how modern campaigns unfold. Bush
has had a lot worse things said about him by his GOP rivals, but
managed to grin and quip and wink his way through 90 minutes of
show-and-tell.
</P>
<P>
   But the 2-1 pasting he took in Iowa, though predictable, seems
to have taken some starch out of the old basketeer. His cardiac
whirlies, the grind of travel, and the pesky needles broadcast from
Camp Gore seem to nettle Bradley, a rookie on the presidential
circuit. He needed a big turnaround performance, but the debate was
a tractor pull. Which was all Gore needed.
</P>
<P>
   Just keep the debate close, make no gaffes, and wait for the
organization to take over. Tuesday is ``Let's Get Ready to Rumble''
day for the Gore operation. There's a list of 1,600
get-out-the-vote workers commanded by Bill Shaheen, the governor's
husband. Experienced operatives from around the country have their
assignments. Bradley is badly outgunned on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Dollar Bill tried to get tougher in the clinches. But he still
has trouble pulling the trigger. The differences between Bradley
and Gore are Byzantine. Al keeps biffing him along the ropes as
Bill keeps looking wanly for the ref. The post-Iowa lift Bradley
prayed for with his campaign finance reform pitch to New
Hampshire's independent voters may not materialize. That's because
John McCain's crusade on the GOP side seems to have taken hold, if
crowd size, enthusiasm, and combativeness in the candidate are any
gauge, and they typically are.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley got 35 percent in Iowa to McCain's paltry 5 _ but McCain
is the rage here. Bush knows it; that's why he's careful not to
slash ``my buddy.'' Bush shows surpisingly taut discipline in not
knocking his popular rival.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gore, Bush has a muscular home-grown political operation,
thanks to Senator Judd Gregg. With his establishment edge even more
pronounced than Gore's, Bush didn't have to win any debates, just
not get cuffed around too badly. McCain's precarious lead in some
polls is not supported by the same kind of trained infantry, for
all the contagious enthusiasm of the McCain Iirregulars.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had a good debate, capturing the second half, first by
telling off Alan Keyes for his dippy antiabortion diatribe, then
telling Bush to his chops that he, McCain, would be on more solid
moral ground admonishing Gore over campaign finance scandals than
Bush, the Poster Child for MegaBucks influence peddling. But Bush
countered skillfully: He massaged his twin themes of tax cuts and
state-centered education reform, which resonate with typical GOP
voters here.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's outsider act will play better with independents _ who
may not vote in heavy numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Phlegmatic tycoon Steve Forbes looked almost presidential,
standing next to Gary Bauer and Keyes, the Kharismatic Krank who
ran an astonishing third in Iowa and stole Bauer's antiabortion
thunder. Bauer, trying to claw his way back into parity in the
lower tier, ordered Chinese. He did the Yellow Peril motif, luridly
cited a ``disgusting act'' performed by the incumbent, and tossed
Keyes into the mosh pit for a truly bizarre trifecta.
</P>
<P>
   The irrepressible McCain had spent the day backpedaling from one
of those zany ``what if'' questions that trigger a media feeding
frenzy. Two years ago, he told me he'd love to run for president
but worried what the inevitable loss of privacy would do to his
wife and kids. I was two feet from him in the media pack dogging
him at the Merrimack Restaurant at lunch hour. A TV guy barked
questions about what if his 15-year old daughter got pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's answers were not good enough for Mr. TV. So McCain
leaned into the fellow's chops and asked menacingly: ``What is your
problem, sir?'' before breaking off eye contact and moving on.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy McCain, unblinking at her man's side, looked ashen. I got
the distinct impression that if Mr. TV had braced McCain privately
in a parking lot somewhere, those TV teeth would have been spread
on the pavement like Chiclets.
</P>
<P>
   That's politics for you. McCain spends five and a half years in
the Hanoi Hilton having bamboo shoots shoved up his fingernails, in
the honorable cause of defending America, so back home a
rabble-rousing, talk-show tongue-twister can try to make a chump
out of him and his daughter on national TV.
</P>
<P>
   What a country. As McCain winks in his happier mode on the
crusade, ``You gotta love it.'' He does. He proved it. That's why
I'm for him.

ON TWO FRONTS, NEW HAMPSHIRE IS A WINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ We interrupt this era of political apathy and
cynicism to bring you, of all things, New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   I came here this week expecting to find cardboard candidates
slashing one another to pathetic little pieces. I came here
expecting to find male voters who drive pickup trucks with gun
racks and have teeth growing out of the sides of their cheeks. I
assumed the women would too, and have tattoos on their forearms
proclaiming ``Billy Joe's Ball 'n' Chain.''
</P>
<P>
   But yet again, reality gets in the way of another good theory.
And the reality is that what's taking place in New Hampshire this
week is something to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, we're supposed to report the bad news on these
pages. We're supposed to pull things apart and let someone else put
them back together. We're supposed to kick those who've risen too
far. But now is not the time.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the four leading candidates _ Al Gore, Bill
Bradley, John McCain, and George W. Bush _ are all experienced,
talented human beings who've proven their mettle on the
battlefield, in business, and in the halls of government. No
moderate person should fear the leadership of any of these men.
</P>
<P>
   They are conducting themselves as presidential candidates
should, but too rarely do, making this an election not about who is
worse but who is best.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are these voters, reputed to be among the most
finicky and contrarian people to ever walk into a ballot booth.
</P>
<P>
   They may be that, but they're also something more. At a time
when an embarrassingly low number of people vote for president or
for anything else, New Hampshire residents take the privilege as a
responsibility. They talk to candidates in neighbors' homes. They
pack forums. They listen. And they render clear-minded judgments
based not on attack ads but on their personal sense of who these
men are and where they want to go.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, the media had declared an overwhelming
front-runner in each party _ men raising what seemed like a billion
dollars a day. Their polling numbers were sky high. ``Miles
ahead,'' Newsweek wrote of Bush in a June story.
</P>
<P>
   Not here, not now. New Hampshire voters told everyone to slow
the process down. And a good thing once again.
</P>
<P>
   Without New Hampshire, the nation never would have given
Bradley's health plan any heed, never would have paid proper
attention to the heroism of McCain and his 5 1/2-year stint as a
prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
   The country never would have seen Bush as anything but a
smirking front-runner, never would have watched a rejuvenated Gore
fight for his political life before his own party.
</P>
<P>
   It comes down to people like Mary Ann Edelman, a waitress at the
Capital City Diner. She's met Gore (``A real darling. . . . I wish
he was a stronger candidate''), And her daughter recently saw Bush
and said he was ``surprisingly warm.''
</P>
<P>
   She's learned more about Forbes from one brief encounter than
anyone could ever learn by watching him on television. He stopped
by the diner to eat and didn't utter a word to the people who
worked there. Enough said.
</P>
<P>
   For one final weekend, the candidates will blitz the state, the
voters will ponder their fate, and a nation awaits the outcome. And
once again, regardless of the results, the voters of New Hampshire
have done their job well.

A LOUD BOO FOR ST. LOUIS AND ITS RAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Super Bowl is an event where class is defined by two lizards
burping the name of a mediocre beer and a lingerie commercial that
hides few secrets. America's most watched sporting event rarely
allows for serious reflection, let alone an intellectual reason to
root for or against one of the two teams.
</P>
<P>
   This year the thinking football fan can spew honest angst at the
TV set. St. Louis is easy to root against. The Rams made the Super
Bowl. The city has already won the Civic Suicide Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis is a city in search of self-esteem. In 1950 it was the
nation's eighth-largest city with 856,800 people. It is now the
50th-largest, with 339,316 residents. St. Louis lost its pro
basketball Hawks to Atlanta in 1968. It lost its National Football
League Cardinals to Arizona in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Former US senator Thomas Eagleton of Missouri said the loss of
the Cardinals was ``devastating. It's both an insult and a hurt.
It's an insult that you're no longer a big-league city, and it's a
hurt because you no longer have football.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis was so hurt it became the mad scientist of sports. It
brought back the NFL with a bubbling test tube of cash. In 1992,
with no guarantee of a team, the city and the state broke ground on
a taxpayer-funded domed stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when the Los Angeles Rams moaned that their profits
were drying up in Anaheim, St. Louis offered the team control of
stadium revenues while extracting a mere $250,000 a year in rent.
When the Rams whined about the ``extras'' involved with moving to
St. Louis, fans and corporations raised $74 million through
personal seat licenses (for the mere right to buy a season ticket)
and luxury seating. The extras, such as paying off debts to
Anaheim, moving expenses, relocation fees, and a new practice
facility came to more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the public built the dome, the Rams got the vast
majority of the 20-year, $1.3 million-a-year deal for Trans World
Airlines to plaster its name on it. Only a quarter of all other
advertising inside the dome comes back to the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   With the stadium, hotel taxes, business deductions, and federal
exemptions on bonds, the total public subsidies for the Rams come
to $1.08 billion over 30 years, or $36 million a year. With all
this money to burn, you might think St. Louis has a lively downtown
and great public schools. It is the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   As the Rams' fortunes and fortune fly higher than a TWA 747,
public school children in St. Louis are grounded. The system is
under a state threat to lose its accreditation in two years if it
does not improve. While the top seven administrators have salaries
that total more than $500,000 yearly, there are 254 teacher
vacancies in a system in which the average salary is lower than the
statewide average. There are hundreds more teachers who are not
experienced or certified in the subject they teach.
</P>
<P>
   If you think that Metco is an indictment of the public schools
in Boston, with 3,500 children of color in a 55,000-student system
busing to the suburbs, try St. Louis, where 13,000 students in a
45,000-student system flee to the burbs. St. Louis's magnet schools
are such a crap shoot that only 2,000 of 6,000 applicants won spots
in a lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Clarence Harmon said the public schools are ``crumbling
before our eyes.'' A year ago, as the system faced the loss of $70
million a year from the state under old desegregation plans, the
city's residents passed a two-thirds of a penny sales tax to raise
$23 million a year for the schools. The tax triggered $40 million
more in state aid. But the total of $63 million was still $7
million short of the $70 million.
</P>
<P>
   So while the schools are $7 million a year poorer, the city is
on the hook for $720 million over the next 30 years to have pro
football. The $23 million a year the city voted to stave off
starvation for the schools is nothing next to the $36 million a
year in public subsidies for the Rams. This is not to mention that
despite the 10 or so game days for the Rams, downtown St. Louis
remains a blighted zone where few people spend much time.
</P>
<P>
   In an amazingly candid quote in 1995, Eagleton bragged how St.
Louis upped the ante for bagging an NFL team. Ever since, city
after city has been held hostage. The other Super Bowl team,
Tennessee, also has a taxpayer-funded stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have poisoned the well,'' Eagleton told the Los Angeles
Times. ``We are the new price of poker. . . . We paid a dear price
to get the Rams, but as a city we knew that. But to us it was worth
it because it had a lot to do with a seriously wounded pride. That
was a very big factor, the difference between being a first-rate
city and a second-rate community.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams are first-rate on the field. The city's civic suicide
makes it second-rate. Eagleton is right. The well is indeed
poisoned. Among the victims are children, staggering around in
illiteracy in the St. Louis public schools.

`ISN'T SHE GREAT' IS OVER THE TOP BUT ENTERTAINING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
ISN'T SHE GREAT 
Directed by: Andrew Bergman 
Screenplay by: Paul Rudnick (based on a article by Michel Korda) 
Starring: Bette Midler, Nathan Lane, Stockard Channing, David Hyde
Pierce, Amanda Peet, John Cleese 
Running time: 95 minutes

<TEXT>
<P>
   Like any decent, self-respecting American, all Jacqueline Susann
wanted was to be a star. She became one by being in the right place
at the right time with her sex-pills-and-debauchery novel ``Valley
of the Dolls'' _ the dolls of the title being drugs, not women. The
more the book was dismissed as trash, the higher up the best-seller
list it climbed and the longer it stayed there. It was a zeitgeist
book. There's always a place for trash novels, but this one came
along at a time when high and low culture were changing places in
America, and it reinforced a dynamic still going strong today.
Susann was hardly the only one who assumed the world is driven by
sex, but her years of showbiz experience as a wannabe sniffing
around the edges of success enabled her to put a believably
lascivious context around the steamy, gossipy prose one observer
likened to overhearing a ladies' room conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Although the idea of a Jacqueline Susann biopic is not the stuff
of elevated pulse rates, pop culture icon though she may have been,
``Isn't She Great'' turns out to be a surprisingly warm and
engaging entertainment _ brassy, schmaltzy, funny. Stars Bette
Midler and Nathan Lane are pros from way back who know exactly how
to sell this affectionately retro material with its rambunctious
Broadway showbiz flavor. It's belted, not crooned, with Midler's
Susann turning her spillover style into performing paydirt. She
does a savvy job of meshing her own trash-with-flash persona with
Susann's. Great trouper, this Midler-Susann. Crude, but lotsa
heart, baby. That, plus a big, chrome-plated show-must-go-on smile,
and an irresistible unstoppableness in the face of such potential
setbacks as worldwide indifference, giving birth to an autistic
child, and, eventually, the breast cancer that killed her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't She Great'' is more of a fairy tale account of Susann's
life than the recent TV biopic, but then Susann's life was a
self-made fairy tale, created and sustained by a will of steel. Two
wills of steel, actually. Susann's career was going nowhere until
she hooked up with press agent Irving Mansfield, who was devoted to
her, but, more important, whose skills complemented hers. She had
the drive, but not the connections. He was a professional schmoozer
who planted column items, was savvy to the ways of media
exploitation when the latter involved mostly print, a little TV,
and could be practiced on a small patch of Broadway turf bounded by
Sardi's on the south and Lindy's or maybe the Carnegie Deli on the
north.
</P>
<P>
   The early stuff is tiresome. Scenes in which Susann speaks her
mind to God (represented by a tree in Central Park) could
profitably have been omitted. On the other hand, they underscore
the essential innocence of the world view that regarded Susann's
relocation of Sodom and Gomorrah to this or that Brentwood cabana
as the ultimate decadence. She was plugged into America's ongoing
need to think of its stars' lives as wall-to-wall orgies. Although
Susann's characters popped pills freely, neither she nor anybody in
the film does, although little doubt is left of their comprehensive
sexual experience. Midler shoulders heartbreak bravely and makes it
impossible not to share Susann's naked joy in living large, with
big hair, big mouth, and enough billowing Pucci to keep her in
costume changes every five minutes. When she isn't reveling in the
joys of conspicuous consumption, she's having fun melting the
prissiness of her uptight WASP editor (David Hyde Pierce).
</P>
<P>
   Lane turns in a generously self-effacing performance as Irving
Mansfield, her second-banana husband, with winning affection for
the almost Runyonesque type Mansfield represented. He sulks when
her prominence has irrevocably eclipsed his, a conflict handled in
one convenient scene after he makes himself scarce at a Waldorf
tribute at which she's saluted by Steve Lawrence (looking
unnaturally young, but only until you realze that he's being
portrayed by his son, David _ Debbie Gravitte plays Eydie). You
expect something of a campfest from Lane, especially given
Mansfield's and Susann's lifestyle. Instead, there's something
muted, wistful, almost touching in his portrait of a man without a
high opinion of himself, who consoles himself for his satellite
existence, as so many women of the period did, by being something
of a clothes horse.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the funniest lines in Paul Rudnick's lively, witty
script go to Susann's sidekick, who, as played by Stockard
Channing, dispenses them with buckets of droll style. John Cleese
injects a welcome note of zaniness as Susann's publisher, a
fictionalized Bernard Geis. Given a chance, the lusty and highly
shagadelic ``Isn't She Great'' _ as uttered constantly by the
ballyhoo-savvy Mansfield, it's always an exclamation, never a
question _ will entertain you more than it has any business doing
and certainly more than you expect.

GORE RECORD ON ABORTION SCRUTINIZED FOR VERACITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON AND ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Wednesday night, Vice President Al Gore
stepped out on a limb where few politicians dare to venture:
``There has never been a time during this campaign when I have said
something that I know to be untrue,'' Gore declared in his
televised debate with former Senator Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the limb may have begun to crack.
</P>
<P>
   Several times during the debate, and again Thursday, Gore
insisted that he has always supported both a woman's right to
choose an abortion and Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision
that ensured that right.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's campaign asserted Thursday that on Wednesday night
alone, Gore made several misstatements of fact, and not just on
abortion. A review of Gore's congressional voting record shows
that, as a House member from Tennessee, Gore voted in 1977 for an
amendment that said, in part, that abortion ``takes the life of an
unborn child who is a living human being,'' and that no right to
abortion ``is secured by the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Gore also supported an amendment to a civil rights bill
that would, in one clause, have redefined the term ``person'' to
include ``unborn children from the moment of conception.'' The
amendment failed, but the National Abortion Rights Action League at
the time said its effect would have been to end federal funding for
hospitals that perform abortions.
</P>
<P>
   With Bradley's challenge to Gore, abortion has suddenly become a
contentious issue in both party's primaries. Among Republicans,
more conservative candidates like Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes have
challenged the sincerity of the antiabortion positions that
Governor George W. Bush of Texas and Senator John McCain of Arizona
both say they hold.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's direct assault on Gore's integrity during the
debate, and again Thursday in campaign appearances, is intended to
cut deep. It also underscores longstanding concerns _ voiced by
Gore's own presidential campaign aides in 1988, according to memos
obtained recently by the Boston Globe _ that Gore has a
predilection for embellishing facts to burnish his personal resume
or professional accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Since early last year, for example, Gore has said, without
foundation, that he created the Internet. He has also said that he
and his wife, Tipper, were the models for the movie ``Love Story,''
only to be contradicted by author Erich Segal. Last month, in a
lengthy profile in the Washington Post, Gore acknowledged his
memory had failed him when he once said that Hubert H. Humphrey
used some of Gore's wording in his 1968 acceptance speech at the
Democratic National Convention in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   To some who recall Gore's first run for the presidency in 1988,
such claims have a familiar ring: In that campaign, Gore appeared
to overstate his exposure to danger during his military service in
Vietnam; erroneously claimed that his investigative reporting at
the Tennessean in Nashville in the 1970s had sent people to jail;
and falsely insisted that half of his staff members were women.
</P>
<P>
   In two memos to Gore in late 1987 and early 1988, his press
secretary, and then his communications director, warned Gore that
he had developed a record for stretching the truth. ``Your main
pitfall is exaggeration,'' Arlie Schardt, the campaign's
communications director, warned Gore in March, 1998. In September,
1987, Mike Kopp, the campaign's press secretary, told Gore in
another memo that his image ``may continue to suffer if you
continue to go out on a limb with remarks that may be impossible to
back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other issues, both aides to Gore were concerned that Gore,
who was raised in Washington but spent summers on a family farm in
Tennessee, had overstated his farming background to appeal to
voters in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, Gore's campaign spokesman, declined to address the
1987 and 1988 memos, saying he was not aware of them. But he said
that Gore's statement in Wednesday's debate that he has always
favored abortion rights is correct, and that his House votes
against using tax dollars to support abortion are consistent with
his pro-choice position. He noted that Gore acknowledged, during
the debate, that he once opposed public funding for abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane, however, declined to answer a question about whether
Gore agreed with the language in the 1984 amendment; or the 1977
measure, the so-called Hyde amendment, that said abortion is the
taking of a life and is not protected by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who once had a high rating from the antiabortion movement,
condemned abortion in his own words in a letter to a constituent in
1987, according to a 1999 biography, ``Gore: A Political Life,'' by
former ABC News reporter Bob Zelnick.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, according to Zelnick's book, Gore wrote, ``During
my 11 years in Congress, I have consistently opposed federal
funding of abortions. In my opinion, it is wrong to spend federal
dollars for what is arguably the taking of human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Lehane challenged a reporter's reference to Gore's
claim last March to have invented the Internet. Gore, Lehane said,
never said such a thing. Later, when he was read Gore's quote _ ``I
took the initiative in creating the Internet'' _ Lehane noted Gore
had apologized for the misstatement in a debate in December.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, the debate Wednesday started on an adversarial note
when co-moderator Judy Woodruff of CNN began a question to Gore by
noting that ``your critics, including some Democrats, say that you
will do almost anything to win,'' and that ``newspaper editorials
here in New Hampshire and around the country accuse you of
distorting Mr. Bradley's record.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore took issue with her. But Bradley then spent much of the
debate accusing Gore of being dishonest. ``Why should we believe
that you will tell the truth as president if you don't tell the
truth as a candidate?'' Bradley asked his rival.
</P>
<P>
   The issues raised by the Bradley campaign illustrate the fine
line that candidates _ including Bradley, Gore has countered _
often tread when characterizing their opponents' records.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, for instance, said this on Wednesday: ``I didn't wait
until I ran for president to first speak up on campaign finance
reform.'' False, said the Bradley campaign, pointing to legislation
on the issue that Bradley sponsored or cosponsored between 1986 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane, asked whether Gore stood by the clear implication that
Bradley had not taken any public stance on the issue until this
campaign, said, ``The vice president was saying that he did not
play a leadership role.''
</P>
<P>
   In the debate's aftermath, Gore found himself closely questioned
on his abortion position on a  &UR; morning  &LR; call-in show on New
Hampshire Public Radio. The first caller, a woman who said she
watched the debate, declared, ``I understand if you've changed your
position during your career. I'm just having a hard . . . I don't
know how I can support your candidacy if you're dishonest about
such an important subject, and especially on national television.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore reassured the woman, saying he had always supported Roe v.
Wade, though he noted that ``sometimes early in my career I voted
to restrict federal funding of abortions.'' Nonetheless, he said,
``I've always supported Roe v. Wade. I've always supported keeping
abortions legal. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The caller told the moderator that she was satisfied with Gore's
response.
</P>
<P>
   More puzzling than Gore's metamorphosis on abortion, even to
biographer Zelnick, has been the vice president's tendency to add
details to his resume that are unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``My soft conclusion is that, where there are actual
accomplishments, as good as they were, that if he could embellish
them in furtherance of his psychic needs, then he did so,'' Zelnick
said in an interview last week. The author, who now teaches at
Boston University, writes in his book about the younger Gore's need
to meet the demanding expectations of his father, the late senator
Albert Gore Sr.

VOLUNTEERS GET READY TO GET OUT THE VOTE

<P>
   DOVER, N.H. _ They call it phone bank in a box.
</P>
<P>
   It is a blue plastic toolbox with cell phones and chargers on
the inside, and Bill Bradley bumper stickers on the outside. On a
recent night, it is sitting on Gary Gilmore's kitchen table, while
11 young volunteers chatter away throughout his 150-year-old
farmhouse, trying to convince voters of the righteousness of their
candidate and the importance of their cause.
</P>
<P>
   With four days to go until the New Hampshire primary, it all
comes down to field work. That's the unglamorous job of calling
voters, knocking on doors, dropping off campaign literature, and
getting people to the polls, even in the bitter cold and snow. It
could mean the difference between winning and losing, between the
Oval Office and a temporary teaching job at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could make a 2 to 5 percent swing in the final total,''
said Steve Duprey, the New Hampshire Republican chairman, surveying
polls showing races too close to call in both the Democratic and
Republican primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Because New Hampshire is a small state, it's possible for a
candidate to win or lose by a small number of votes. In 1976,
Gerald Ford beat Ronald Reagan by 1,587 votes. In 1996, Patrick J.
Buchanan beat Bob Dole by 2,136 votes. Secretary of State William
Gardner expects about 300,000 to 400,000 people to cast ballots on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Chris Goodnow, the Rockingham County chairman for
John McCain, stood on a platform at Salem High School the other day
and urged people to take a lawn sign from the back of the cafeteria
and stick it in their front yards. It is also why he asked the
crowd of about 400 if they would each take 20 pieces of campaign
literature and hand it out to their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be outspent,'' Goodnow told the people gathered
to question the Arizona senator. But that certainty on the airwaves
does not mean that McCain supporters will be outworked on the
ground, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While candidates are judged on the content and delivery of their
message, their campaigns are scrutinized for an ability to identify
and reach voters.
</P>
<P>
   Some campaigns _ those of Al Gore, George W. Bush, and Steve
Forbes _ are using paid phone banks to reach as many voters as
possible. Others, such as Bradley's and McCain's, are strictly
using volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's neighbor talking to neighbor,'' said Mike Dennehy,
McCain's New England campaign director. ``It's not professional
phone banks in Alabama talking to residents in Plymouth, N.H.
That's the difference. That's what the Bush campaign doesn't
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign estimates that, using a combination of paid
and volunteer phone banks, it reached 303,000 voters by the end of
December. Its goal is to identify who is supporting Gore, leaning
toward Gore, undecided, or supporting Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign, on the other hand, has made about 150,000
calls so far, said Kevin Keefe, the Bradley campaign field
director. His volunteers are doing more than identifying voters;
they're also trying to persuade, which takes much longer.
</P>
<P>
   At Gilmore's house here on the coast, Vedat Gashi, 21, is
sitting on a couch, wearing a powder blue knit hat to stay warm and
chatting on the cell phone with an undecided Democratic voter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley is the only candidate who's been consistently
pro-choice,'' says Gashi, a Connecticut College student from New
York. ``I'm going to send you some stuff on that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Gashi asks the woman if she has watched any of the debates
between Bradley and Gore, then offers his assessment of Bradley.
``He's the kind of guy who speaks frankly and speaks from the
heart,'' he tells her.
</P>
<P>
   While Keefe knows these phone calls take longer, he boasts that
the Bradley team is ahead of Gore when it comes to door knocking.
He dismisses the Gore volunteers as ``weekend warriors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley volunteers began canvassing the state well before
the Gore campaign. They've engaged in other high-visibility acts as
well. There's ``Beep, beep for Bill Bradley,'' where supporters
stand on street corners with signs in the early morning hours.
There's ``the light brigade,'' where volunteers carry flashlights
and canvass from 4 to 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   And this week, the Bradley campaign hopes to hit every Dunkin'
Donuts in the state with signs that say ``Slam Dunkin' for
Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can do every Dunkin' Donuts in the state, it's over,
we've won, because that's a lot of Dunkin' Donuts,'' said Keefe.
``And if we can get everyone who buys a Dunkin' Donut to vote,
that's a landslide.''

   WINTER-SOUTH _ ATLANTA _ Snow shovels and mittens are at a
premium in the Deep South. Parts of Arkansas and Mississippi are
buried under more than a foot of snow. It's snowing in Georgia and
forecasters warn that sleet could coat roads and power lines all
the way to the Carolinas by tonight. Snow removal vehicles are on
the roads in Alabama, and the National Guard had to be called out
to rescue more than a-thousand motorists stranded on a snowy
highway last night. The storm hammered Oklahoma and Texas
yesterday, closing schools and businesses and causing airline
cancellations in Dallas. An estimated 40-thousand customers are
still without power from an earlier storm in North Carolina _ and
residents of the Tar Heel state are bracing for more snow.

   BONFIRE _ After the A&AMP;M Bonfire collapsed in 1994, injuring no
one, a professor at the school compiled a paper and alerted the
head of student services of the school about a nagging concern that
he had about the design of the bonfires over the year:
structurally, they were unsafe, he told the university official.
The response, he tells the Statesman in the first extensive
interview on the subject since last year's fatal collapse, was that
he was told, ``This is a student matter.'' He tells the Statesman
that this conversation hit him in a flash of anger shortly after
being called at 5:45 last November and hearing about the tragedy.
He also details for us the gradual evolution of the bonfire
structure dating back to 1948, when he worked on one as a freshman.
The move from a pyramid-style structure to one built like a wedding
cake had some basic structural flaws and there were many red flags
pointing to those flaws over the years, he said, including how
quickly more recent bonfires collapsed after being ignited.

MR. DEATH: THE RISE AND FALL OF FRED A. LEUCHTER, JR. 
Documentary by: Errol Morris 
Running time: 91 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (thematic elements) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first, ``Mr. Death,'' Errol Morris's new documentary, seems a
continuation of his ``Fast, Cheap &AMP; Out of Control.'' That film was
about four men with four obsessions _ a lion trainer, a topiary
gardener, a researcher of naked mole rats, and a robot designer.
``Mr. Death'' starts as just another story about another guy with
another obsession. As a self-described, self-taught execution
technologist from Malden, Mass., Fred A. Leuchter Jr. built a
career fine-tuning electric chairs, gas chambers, and lethal
injection machines. In his nerdy, intense way, he chatters
compulsively into the camera, making sure we're fully aware of his
humanity in exchanging messy deaths for quick, neat ones. But
hanging over Leuchter's testimony is the subtitle of Morris's film:
``The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter, Jr.''
</P>
<P>
   We pretty quickly get a sense of the rise, especially in a scene
during which Morris and his crew are locked inside the leakproof
gas chamber Leuchter designed for the state of Tennessee, while
Leuchter chirps away about scientific method. What's much more
intriguing is Leuchter's fall, by his own hand. Although his is as
pure an example of self-destructive hubris as the last decade has
produced, the man and his moral universe somehow don't evoke
comparisons to Greek tragedy. He wound up being the pinup boy for
neo-Nazi Holocaust deniers, and the latest poster boy for the
banality-of-evil crowd. He was also drummed out of the capital
punishment business, which presumably felt unable to risk its
shimmering reputation by remaining associated with him.
</P>
<P>
   Leuchter's fall began when he signed on to support Ernst Zundel,
a Holocaust denier on trial in Canada for violating that country's
hate-crime laws. To bolster his defense, Zundel sent Leuchter to
Auschwitz, where an associate videotaped Leuchter meticulously
measuring what was left of the gas chambers, then chipping out bits
of wall and spiriting them away in plastic bags to be tested later
for cyanide content. Leuchter took along his new wife, on only what
is described as history's only known recorded honeymoon at
Auschwitz (the marriage ended in divorce). Leuchter concluded that
the atrocities at the concentration camp couldn't have happened.
</P>
<P>
   From that day on, his life fell apart. The neo-Nazis made him
and his so-called report Internet stars. Everybody else reviled
him. He still sounds bitter about what he calls persecution by the
state of Massachusetts for practicing engineering without a
license. Yet Leuchter looks sincere when he says he never was an
anti-Semite. It didn't help. Morris says he didn't make the film to
belabor the obvious. The Holocaust denial, including Leuchter's
``report,'' is conclusively demolished by the testimony of a few
witnesses with the historical, scientific, and intellectual goods.
This opens the door to what Morris has always done best in his
documentaries and, in fact, has reinvented the documentary doing,
namely weaving into his chronicle a reverberant meditation, in this
case on humankind's capacity for self-delusion.
</P>
<P>
   Leuchter's delusion ran into trouble, Morris concludes, when
fantasies and self-perceptions that functioned as long as they
stayed in the gas chamber moved onto the larger stage of world
history and assumed degrees of political, historical, and
scientific expertise he didn't have. One lingering question is how
people can persist in believing things that fly in the face of
fact. What role do ego and neediness play? Why did Leuchter think
his testimony on behalf of Zundel would crown his career? Finally,
from whence within the human animal does self-delusion arise? All
these questions come home to roost on the shoulders of the utterly
nondescript Fred Leuchter. In resisting the easy temptation to
demonize him, Morris shines a light on the seeds of future
Holocausts, the better to confront and combat them. His weaving
together of themes, reflections, and ironic angles of attack are
again accomplished in masterly fashion in ``Mr. Death.'' Like most
of his films, one's strongest reactions come not while watching it,
but later, when some depth charge or other comes floating up as if
from the ocean bottom.

WILLIAMS REFLECTS ON HIS APPROACH TO `ANGELA'S ASHES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Williams was about to head off to the dentist's, but he
sounded cheerful anyway Tuesday afternoon when he called in from
California to chat for a while about his score for the film
``Angela's Ashes.'' The soundtrack album appears on a current CD
for Sony Classical. The CD has the advantage of clocking in at 59
minutes, while the film lasts 2 1/2 rain-soaked, heavy-duty hours.
One of the ``Evening at Pops'' programs planned for taping next
spring is an ``Angela's Ashes'' segment, with Williams conducting,
author Frank McCourt appearing as narrator, and Yo-Yo Ma taking
over the prominent solo cello part.
</P>
<P>
   Williams's music for McCourt's story of grinding Irish poverty
does not rely on references to folk or commercial Irish music.
Nevetheless, Williams makes allusions to the feel of traditional
Irish music in the intervals of the melodies and in certain aspects
of the harmony, and the presence of the harp in the scoring also
evokes Ireland. In addition to the harp, Williams also highlights
the piano, oboe, and cello. The orchestration is strongly
string-oriented, and the main themes suggest the melancholy,
steadfast character of Vaughan Williams's beloved ``Fantasia on a
Theme by Thomas Tallis.'' The music supplies warmth to a chilling
tale, continuity to an episodic narrative; a pizzicato interlude
even adds to the mordant humor of the moment when McCourt's father
and brothers join him in trying to stomp the fleas out of a
mattress. At the end, as McCourt's boat sails past the Statue of
Liberty into New York harbor, the music surges and swells, and a
mournful harmonic progression we have heard throughout the film
turns triumphant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that using a sort of Irish vernacular music might
narrow the piece down,'' Williams says. ``Another way of going was
to take a more universal approach, a more emotional approach, if
you like, with the orchestra expressing the broad, human aspect of
the experience. There was no need, I felt, for the music to
emphasize the specifically Irish or Catholic aspect of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams had never worked with director Alan Parker, who wrote a
testimonial to Williams for the CD booklet. ``Before I finished
filming `Angela's Ashes,' I received a message that John Williams
had agreed to do the score. For a filmmaker, of course, this is
akin to winning the lottery, and once I had a first cut of the film
together, I nervously showed it to him. I have to say that however
knowledgeable one is of maestro Williams's massive talent, it is
still an extraordinary experience to watch him work. His
sensitivity, wisdom, graciousness, and total, effortless control of
the task of scoring for film is awe-inspiring. If I sound too
gushing, I make no apoloiges; the man is brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   In conversation, Williams returns the compliment. ``I enjoyed
him very much. He's a blue-collar Englishman, and I mean that in
the nicest possible way. He's an unpretentious, workmanlike chap.''
</P>
<P>
   For this film, Williams broke one of his usual rules: He read
McCourt's book. Usually he tries not to do this, because he wants
to come to a film with no preconceptions. ``I like Frank McCourt's
book very much, and I spoke to him about the film after he'd seen
it. So often when an author writes something, or when a reader
reads something, the subsequent film never matches the original
mental picture. But McCourt said he genuinely loved the film, and
felt that it represented his mother and his siblings in a way that
seemed true and real. I don't think the movie makes any departure
from Frank McCourt. What I love is the Irish lilt that lifts the
story away from the bleakest tragedy _ that line near the end, for
example, when he says, `There are three things an Irishman is
allowed to love: God, children, and a horse that wins.' Color and
humor like that help define a land in which the two great
institutions are the church and the pub, both of them offering
solace but not solutions. The Irish are good at writing, at poetry
_ and at acting. Alan Parker found such wonderful people for all
the little parts in the film _ the teachers, priests,
functionaries, and bureaucrats. And I thought Emily (Watson) was
extraordinary as the mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams produced the CD himself; the disc exists in two
versions. In English-speaking countries, actor Andrew Bennett
speaks a connecting narration, as he does in the film; in the rest
of the world, the record appears without the narration. ``There's a
broad foreign market for soundtrack recordings, and people felt the
narration would be a problem there.'' Williams is full of praise
for the solo instrumentalists on the album and says he has drawn
Seiji Ozawa's attention to the special qualities of oboist John
Ellis. But he also makes an almost-shy confession. The film opens
with a solo piano line. On the album, Randy Kerber is credited for
the playing, which is sensitive throughout, but some of the
sensitivity comes from Williams. ``I did some of the playing myself
_ that was my little effort for this thing. I started off the
picture with the piano by itself, playing a single line _ I thought
the simplicity, the directness of the voice, would be useful and
good.''
</P>
<P>
   The film also includes some ``source music'' _ Nat Gonella &AMP; His
Georgians contribute ``The Dipsy Doodle'' from 1938, and McCourt
and his family listen to Billie Holiday singing ``Pennies From
Heaven'' on the radio. ``Alan Parker started out using a reprise of
`Pennies From Heaven' at the end of the film,'' Williams recalls,
``but finally opted for a more opulent, orchestral ending. The
orchestra creates the final resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Another bit of ``source music'' heard in the film (although it
doesn't appear on the CD) is ``Bi mir bist du schoen,'' the Yiddish
theater song that became a big hit for the Andrews Sisters in 1937.
``When I heard it on the temporary soundtrack, I wondered what it
was doing there in the middle of Ireland,'' Williams admits. ``But
then Parker told me a cute story _ everybody knew that song back
then. As a kid growing up in Great Britain, he knew the song,
although he didn't have any idea of its Yiddish origins. He and his
little friends thought the title had something to do with `Mr.
Shane'!''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is very pleased with plans to showcase ``Angela's
Ashes'' on ``Evening at Pops.'' ``I've talked with Frank McCourt on
the telephone, and he's agreed to come and visit us and to read
some of his text, instead of the actor who does it on the CD. I'll
expand on some of the music, probably the piano part, and
particularly the cello solos, because Yo-Yo Ma will come to join
us. It should make for a very nice evening in Symphony Hall, and
also for television.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is an artist who works in a business, so he was careful
to ask how audiences in Boston are responding to ``Angela's Ashes''
and what kind of box office it's doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this film is going to do best in the cities and among
people with literary interests, and especially with people who love
the book, who are not going to be disappointed. Maybe it is not a
broad, general family picture that is going to be tremendously
possible, but I believe it is a film that will find its own
audience.''

TINA TURNER KEEPS HER EDGE WITH GRITTY SONGS OF SURVIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Soul queen Tina Turner lives in Switzerland these days, but her
voice is still steeped in American R &AMP; B and gospel. No matter how
producers try to polish her up, she still has a street edge dating
to her Nutbush, Tenn., youth. At an age-defying 59 years old (she
turns 60 in November), Turner comes through once again on her new
album, ``Twenty Four Seven,'' due out Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the scheming novelty acts clogging today's charts, it's
encouraging to hear someone as solid and as lasting as Turner,
whose new disc is filled with songs of survival and self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never be a diamond, but I'll never be fake,'' she sings.
``I've never been afraid of myself _ I don't wanna be nobody
else.''
</P>
<P>
   The song is ``All the Woman,'' which Turner has been for a long
time _ for a 45-year career, to be exact. She doesn't write any of
the tracks on the new album, but again chooses tunesmiths who
capture, in very adult terms, the emotions she's experienced. Terry
Britten and Graham Lyle, who have penned hits for her before, are
back, but the biggest news is that Brian Rawling and Mark Taylor _
the team behind Cher's megahit, ``Believe'' _ write and produce a
couple of songs.
</P>
<P>
   Cher, of course, can only dream of having the pipes that Turner
has. And while a number of new tunes are slickened with orchestral
strings and computer programming, Turner makes them breathe with a
voice that still cuts into the gut and isn't afraid to wail.
</P>
<P>
   The gems here are the dance track ``Absolutely Nothing's
Changed'' (``I'll live to fight another day/I'm bruised but I ain't
broken'') and the gospel-flavored ``Talk to My Heart,'' about
warming up to a new lover (``I'm losing my inhibitions with every
minute I share with you'') after being burnt.
</P>
<P>
   Turner remains a role model for picking up one's life and
refusing to succumb, which she could have done after her
tempestuous marriage to Ike Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Old friend Bryan Adams turns up to sing harmony on a track, and
Turner does a previously unrecorded Bee Gees tune, ``I Will Be
There.'' It might have been nice to have a bit more fire with, say,
a Mick Jagger (how come they don't duet anymore?), but Tina still
generates enough steam to make this album a satisfying, and
healing, event.

HART WORKS HIS DIGITAL MAGIC ON PLANET DRUM'S NEW ALBUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Mickey Hart made his mark as the Grateful Dead's tribal,
wild-eyed percussionist, but he also was the band's resident
computer freak. He has used that expertise in his post-Dead band,
Planet Drum, especially on its new album, ``Spirit Into Sound,''
which takes various world musics and creates fresh hybrids with the
aid of some sonic doctoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call it processed percussion,'' says Hart. ``Once you take
things into the digital domain, you can make whatever instruments
you want out of them. For a musician to paint on an easel like this
is just a great opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart's new album features ``my real inside stuff'' from a
massive database in a computer sampler he calls Ramu. It makes for
a trippy montage showing the softer, more bewitching side of Planet
Drum. Hart merges rhythms from Latin America to Africa, while
tinkering with tones and creating entirely new scales on exotic
acoustic instruments from Indonesia to South America, mixed with
acoustic guitars and real-time percussion. And all the while
keeping a tighter, more listener-friendly melodic sense than on any
previous Planet Drum record. Quite simply, this is his best yet.
</P>
<P>
   Hart triggers computer samples and can put them in any key he
wants. He features a Peruvian flute on ``Funky Peru,'' chimes and
vibes on ``Amazon Nguni,'' a jew's-harp from Bali on the
polyrhythmic ``Cloud Moss,'' and female chants on ``Shambolya,''
the title being a word he invented. ``These are just sounds that we
made up. There are no literal translations to these,'' Hart says.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a joyful, hypnotic touch is the scat singing of Rebecca ,
a ``soul sister'' and an ethnomusicologist who has worked with
Carlos Santana, Tito Puente, and Steve Winwood. She also adds a
tropical spirit (notably on ``Sueno Tropicale'') that is
intoxicating.
</P>
<P>
   The album is meant as a companion project to a book of quotes
that Hart recently released, likewise called ``Spirit Into Sound.''
It had quotes about music from the likes of Jerry Garcia and
Santana, all the way to Friedrich Nietzsche and President Woodrow
Wilson. The book has been on many best-seller lists and reflects
Hart's vivid, unbound imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Hart expects to tour in the spring with Planet Drum and also on
a revival this summer of the post-Grateful Dead Furthur Festival,
where he'll share a bill with Bob Weir's Ratdog, the Bruce Hornsby
Band, and likely other guests.
</P>

<P>
   Blue Floyd: An all-star cast of jammers has come together to
form Blue Floyd, a group playing Pink Floyd songs with a blues
twist. The band has been selling out everywhere, while jamming on
early Floyd tunes such as ``Set the Controls for the Heart of the
Sun'' and ``Grantchester Meadows'' (from 1969's psychedelic album,
``Ummagumma''), along with later tunes from ``Dark Side of the
Moon,'' ``Atom Heart Mother,'' and ``The Wall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a blast _ probably because none of us have a live-or-die
feeling toward it,'' says guitarist Marc Ford. ``This is just a
bunch of friends jamming together. There's no pressure. We're not
fighting about the little things that bands do.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Floyd is the brainchild of Michael Gaiman, who also put
together Jazz Is Dead, which plays jazz-inflected versions of
Grateful Dead tunes. He had no problem rounding up a fresh posse of
jammers.
</P>
<P>
   Past members of the Allman Brothers (bassist/guitarist Allen
Woody and keyboardist Johnny Neel) and the Black Crowes' (Marc
Ford), along with drummer Matt Abts (currently in Gov't Mule with
Woody) and singer/bassist Berry Oakley Jr. (whose dad was in the
Allmans) were enticed to join.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all Floyd fans,'' says Ford. ``First, we put together
12 to 13 songs we could do as no-brainers, and now, we're moving on
to learn other ones. It's a heaping chunk of Floyd. And we're
working on part of the show to be acoustic.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no one perceives this as a Pink Floyd `act.' We're not a
tribute band,'' adds Ford. ``Every town seems to have a Pink Floyd
tribute band, so that was a concern of mine. We respect Floyd's
music, but we're using the songs as launching pads and as safe
places to jam.'' Thus, the group has also incorporated jams on such
tunes as Stevie Wonder's ``Superstition'' and Bob Marley's ``Three
Little Birds.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Floyd is on a five-week tour, but it's woven around other
projects by the band members. Gov't Mule, for example, has a new
album next month entitled ``Life Before Insanity,'' and will tour
behind that. And Ford is putting an album out on his new band,
Federale. ``We'll have to arrange our schedules,'' says Ford, ``but
we hope to do this again.''

   ``Eye of the Beholder'' is yet another example of how bad movies
can happen to good people. Too bad, because it's stylish enough and
weird enough to keep you watching it in the hope that its loose
ends might arrive at some dramatically or emotionally satisfying
payoff. But whereas plenty of failed movies fall apart, this one
fails because writer-director Stephan Elliott never can make its
mismatched pieces come together, wasting a potentially involving
performance by Ewan McGregor, as a British security ace gone
bonkers since his wife and kid walked out on him, and an actually
quite involving performance by Ashley Judd as a vulnerable
murderess who, it must be said, is provided with ample reasons for
a shoot-first-ask-questions-later lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   McGregor's reclusive high-tech voyeur is known as The Eye, a
circumstance that serves writer-director Stephan Elliott as
springboard for a cascade of movie references, not all of which
have to do with voyeurism, and a few too many of which call undue
attention to themselves. Elliott, the mastermind of ``The
Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,'' is a visual
stylist, although his style here differs vastly from that
Australian comedy. Constant dislocation in a sunless atmosphere of
grave clarity frames the ever more erratic actions of The Eye, as
he becomes increasingly obsessed with Judd's whiplash stunner after
he spies on her vocationally when she's with the son of a highly
placed Brit.
</P>
<P>
   At first, we see The Eye in frequent conversations with his
young daughter while perched in this or that spyhole with his
snooping devices that look like high-powered rifles and throw their
gleanings onto computer screens. It soon becomes apparent that his
daughter is an imaginary presence, that he's obsessed with having
lost touch with her (is his departed wife even more elusive than
he, that he never has been able to track her down?), and that he's
switching his attention to Judd's lethal beauty, who changes
addresses as often as she changes wigs. But as the detective story
turns into a cross-country chase movie, hurtling from Washington to
Boston to San Francisco to Death Valley to Chicago to Alaska, it
snags on a few points of logic.
</P>
<P>
   If Judd's character is indeed his long-lost daughter, it doesn't
square with their roughly similar ages. If he only imagines she is,
it would still account for his insertion of himself into her life
as a sort of high-tech guardian angel, although sometimes he
intervenes with plain old gunplay and brass knuckles. But if he has
lost his grip and his effectiveness, impaled as he is on the loss
of his wife and daughter, would his superiors likely still allow
him roaming privileges with full field support? Scenes in which he
flirts via phone and computer with k.d. lang's Moneypenny parody
can't convincingly cover this base. Patrick Bergin's rich blind
Napa winemaker who loves Judd's character as long as he's able, and
the excellent Genevieve Bujold, as a reform school therapist, are
plusses who contribute to the film's offbeat skewed-reality
perspective. Judd projects a weight of pain as well as rage, and
McGregor throws himself with the right headlong impulse into the
spy's unhinging. But ``Eye of the Beholder'' never brings its
potentially intriguing plot strands into focus.

MACY GRAY'S 2 GRAMMY NODS SUGGEST SHE'S HERE TO STAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most newly minted pop stars fondly recall their prodigal years _
singing before they could talk, standing on chairs to take solos in
church choir, making it through five rounds on ``Star Search.'' Not
so Macy Gray. As a child, Gray was so self-conscious about her
voice that she rarely spoke, let alone sang.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never even occurred to me to sing,'' Gray says on the phone
from a hotel room in Tempe, Ariz., a stop on her current tour that
comes to Avalon on Wednesday. It's not hard to believe. Her voice
actually crackles over the line _ a raspy, high-pitched squawk
that's equal parts gritty and giddy, and undeniably strange.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why it came as something of a surprise to her when she
was asked to sing on a friend's demo tape. Gray, a Canton, Ohio,
native, was enrolled in the screenwriting program of the University
of Southern California Film School at the time, and had been
writing lyrics for some musician friends. When the ``real'' singer
didn't show up at the dorm-room recording session, Gray sportingly
agreed to fill in.
</P>
<P>
   To her further astonishment, Gray's accidental demo began
attracting attention, and she was invited to join a local jazz
band. ``I thought he was out of his mind,'' Gray says. ``But I
figured, hey, maybe my voice was weird for a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward 10 years. Macy Gray, now 30, has just been
nominated for two Grammy awards, in the Best New Artist and Best R
&AMP; B Vocal categories. The voice that Gray calls weird, others are
heralding as a beguiling and bewitching breath of air. ``On How
Life Is,'' Gray's debut album, is a blend of old-school soul and
modern hip-hop, and it's put her on the map as part of a new wave
of alternative black pop artists that includes D'Angelo, Erykah
Badu, the Roots, and Angie Stone.
</P>
<P>
   Gray wears her influences proudly on her sleeve: Stevie Wonder,
Sly Stone, James Brown, and Marvin Gaye are all over this album.
She wraps the straight-up funk with serpentine backbeats and a
stripped, organic aesthetic. Andy Slater, who produced Fiona
Apple's first album, managed to craft a radio-ready sound without
sacrificing Gray's after-hours vibe. It's earthy and street,
laid-back and urban, lush and raw, a heady mix that's anchored by
one of the most distinctive singing voices _ think Eartha Kitt,
Billie Holiday, Nina Simone, Louis Armstrong _ to come around in
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I do have a foot in both worlds,'' Gray says. ``But I
don't think the album is nostalgic. The most modern records, they
have samples. The music made in the '60s and '70s,'' she declares,
``it's just the best music so far. There weren't a lot of machines.
People had to play. They had to put their emotion into it.'' She is
also attracted to the topical wellspring that those artists drew
on. ``Back then, people talked about love, peace, sex, harmony,
war, and politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray is devoted to an older model of music-making; she holds
similarly idealistic notions about the music community. While
writing and singing in LA's underground scene during the '90s, Gray
and pals started a late-night club called the We Ours in a
Hollywood coffee shop. It became an instant hot spot, attracting
drop-in guests like Tricky, the Roots, and the Black-Eyed Peas.
``We had food in the back, and the DJ set up lights. People started
getting on the mike and freestyling, and then all of a sudden
people were doing poetry and break dancing. It became a sort of
artist's community,'' says Gray.
</P>
<P>
   Late nights at the We Ours also helped her hone a live show.
``It was small, so if someone yawned or walked out you knew it. You
knew what was working and what wasn't.'' Gray ``hustled around''
for most of a decade, playing live gigs, sending out tapes, and
trying to get a record deal. But labels, not generally known for
their willingness to take a risk on an artist who doesn't fit
neatly into a marketable category, passed again and again on Macy
Gray. ``I was in so many different offices, talking to so many
different people who said they were gonna sign me. And they
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   With an eclectic talent, it often comes down to one person in a
position of power who just . . . gets it. For Gray, it was Epic
Records president Polly Anthony, who signed her in 1998. ``She was
a really big fan from the get-go,'' says Gray. ``More than
anything, she knew ``I Try'' was a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony was right. In a few weeks Gray will be shoulder to
shoulder with fellow Best New Artist Grammy nominees Britney
Spears, Christina Aguilera, Susan Tedeschi, and Kid Rock. Whom is
Gray putting her money on? ``I used to say me. But my label didn't
like me to say that,'' Gray says, cracking up. ``I'm supposed to
say that I think everybody is really talented and anybody could get
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gray is doing a remix of ``I've Committed Murder,''
about which she's ``crazy excited.'' She'll return to Europe in
March for more touring, and is considering multiple soundtrack
offers. She's launched her own record label, and is working on a
script _ a love story about two people who fall in love, get
married, and get divorced.
</P>
<P>
   It's a story line that Gray is familiar with. She has three
young children from a former marriage, who are living for the time
being with her mother in Ohio. ``I miss them a lot. And I'll grab
them in the summer,'' she says. ``But my mom can really take care
of them, and Canton's a good place to grow up. They cook dinner
there every night. And nobody's trying to get a record deal.''
</P>
<P>
   There's not a little irony in the fact that Gray's rise to pop
stardom is separating her from her children, and yet she says it
was becoming a parent that finally allowed her to accept the sound
of her own voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having kids, having to make money . . . getting into all the
details of a real life, you're either gonna grow up and be
confident and make something happen,'' Gray says, ``or jump off a
cliff.''

FISHER HAS GUIDED TITANS FROM DISARRAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The man at the podium had just been asked if his team
should be considered the chosen ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chosen ones?'' he said almost incredulously. ``We're the
ones who were chosen not to be. It's been that way all year. We
always seem to be the underdogs. Maybe people just aren't used to
the uniforms yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Next question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, Steve . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Jeff,'' corrected the man at the podium. ``Jeff Fisher.''
Pause. ``You see . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, forget it. He let it go at that. So he wasn't Steve Fisher,
former coach of the NCAA basketball champion University of
Michigan; he was Jeff Fisher, current coach of the American
Football Conference champion Tennessee Transients _ oops, Titans.
So the interrogator's ignorance simply reinforced the man at the
podium's point about lack of recognition. So what?
</P>
<P>
   Really, this one barely even registered on the scale of
indignities he'd endured.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steve _ uh, Jeff _ Fisher and his team weren't supposed to be
here for the Super Bowl to face the St. Louis Rams Sunday in the
Georgia Dome. But that constitutes an upgrade: Fisher and his team
didn't know where they were supposed to be _ or who they were
supposed to be _ for the previous four years.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see . . . the Houston Oilers; no, the Liberty Bowl-based
Tennessee Oilers of Memphis; check that, the Vanderbilt
University-based Tennessee Oilers of Nashville; ah, that's it, the
Adelphia Stadium-based Tennessee Titans of Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Fisher says, ``If you write a book about what I've
been through as coach, it definitely would fall into the fiction
section at the bookstore.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. No reputable publisher would even put such an
outrageous plot on the presses. When Fisher, who somehow has
managed to reach age 41 with his wrinkle-free good looks,
coal-black hair, and debonair mustache intact, says
matter-of-factly, ``I guess I've been through a lot more than the
average coach in a short period of time,'' he's guilty of a gross
lack of self-promotion. He's been through more unimagined horrors
in five-plus years than the other 30 NFL head coaches have endured
in their cumulative careers.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly more than Fisher _ or any other nonmasochist _
could have envisioned when he stepped off the assistant's fast
track and into the head coaches' club in 1995. Bad enough that he
went 1-5 while completing a 2-14 debacle with the Houston team he
inherited from longtime coach Jack Pardee, whom he had served as
defensive coordinator. That was the easy part.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon, he forgot what sport he was coaching. In his first
full season, owner Bud Adams dropped a little surprise on him _
``We're moving!'' After 37 years in Houston, Fisher and his Oilers
had to endure the lame-duck abuse of an outraged Texas constituency
even as the vans were being loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Changing addresses once would have been daunting enough. But
while waiting for his dream stadium to be built in Nashville, Adams
kept his powder-blue troops, and especially his coach, on the go,
supplementing the team's traditional oil well logo with a map of
its new home state to reflect the utter lack of permanency. As they
set up temporary shop in makeshift, inadequate college facilities,
they were treated as unwelcome orphans in Memphis and suspicious
newcomers at Vanderbilt before they finally acquired a new
nickname, a new winged-T logo, new two-tone blue uniforms, and,
best of all, a new long-term address. They hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one would believe what we had to do,'' says Fisher. ``My
biggest desire was to get on the football field for two hours each
day. I had so many other things to do _ the design for the stadium
and practice facility, marketing, selling the team around the state
_ that coaching took a back seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Adversity was in the forefront, and that's why Fisher's coaching
skills were in fact imperative and invaluable. Through all the
tribulations, he somehow kept the disheartened, disheveled club
together, to such an extent that he believes the deed to the Super
Bowl actually was drawn up during the gypsy caravan. Implausibly,
the nearly extinct Oilers managed to forge records of 7-9 and 8-8
their last two years in Houston, followed by two more 8-8 finishes
as they barely missed the playoffs in each of their first two
vagabond years in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe all we went through before put us here,'' says
Fisher, trying to comprehend the rewards of a 13-3 regular season
and an upstart wild-card playoff disposal of Buffalo, Indianapolis,
and Jacksonville in his team's debut as the Titans. ``Typically,
the toughest time was Weeks 15 and 16. We'd start out 1-3 or so,
fight back to .500, have a shot at the playoffs, just miss out, and
try to convince the players that we were almost there. I thought
the players back then did a great job walking the fine line between
Houston and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we went through did a lot for this football team in
getting to the way we are now. It built a chemistry in the locker
room. They were frustrated. I think they weren't sure whether we
were really an 8-8 team or it was because of what we were going
through. I think we found out this year that what we went through
prohibited getting some things done. It's hard enough to win in the
NFL when everyone is on an even playing field. We weren't there.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Fisher might not have been anywhere by now. His bonus
for keeping the Oilers from unraveling, let alone competitive, was
an implicit ultimatum from Adams that the newly christened Titans
had better make the playoffs this season or he'd find another
ringmaster for his erstwhile traveling circus.
</P>
<P>
   Unflappable, if not benumbed, Fisher merely shrugged off the
latest burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel any more from a pressure standpoint,'' he says.
``There was an expectation level from within the coaches and
players. We expected to be in the playoffs last year but fell
short. We expected not only to get to the playoffs but do something
(this season). As far as pressure's concerned, no.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as the players' perception of pressure was concerned,
yes. They had acquired an abiding affection for Fisher and weren't
eager to lose the glue that somehow had kept them in one piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody on this staff loves Coach Fisher,'' says quarterback
Steve McNair. ``He's sacrificed a lot, dedicated himself to keeping
us together. It's been kind of tough for him, first with Houston,
then Memphis, then Nashville going on. We have a lot of respect for
Coach Fisher, and he has a lot of respect for us. When you have a
coach-player relationship like that, you want him to stay around.
And let's face it, when the owner says he's tired of going 8-8,
that's kind of an indication'' that a certain coach's job is at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least Fisher had plenty of practice with upheaval and
uncertainty. He began the coach's nomadic existence almost before
he was ready.
</P>
<P>
   An All-America wide receiver in Culver City, Calif., he switched
to defensive back under John Robinson at the University of Southern
California and was a seventh-round draft choice of the Chicago
Bears in 1981. For four years, he served them in the secondary and
as a kick returner.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Bears' Super Bowl championship campaign of 1985, he
was reduced to spectating by an ankle problem that landed him on
the injured reserve list. Wanting to help somehow, he spent the
season as an unofficial assistant to defensive coordinator Buddy
Ryan, whose renowned 46 alignment was considered the key to the
Bears' drive to the title, which they clinched with a 46-10
humbling of the Patriots in Super Bowl XX at New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, the defensive staff in Chicago consisted of
three guys,'' says Fisher. ``Buddy was on the sideline, and Jim
LaRue and Dale Haupt were in the press box. Having one guy handle
that defense on the sideline was quite a task. I helped Buddy
through most of the season on adjustments and substitutions and
those kinds of things.''
</P>
<P>
   So impressed was Ryan with the novice's work that during Super
Bowl week, he offered to take Fisher to Philadelphia as an
assistant if, as expected, Ryan got the Eagles' head coaching post.
But Fisher had every intention of returning to the Bears' lineup
the following season.
</P>
<P>
   So Ryan asked him a question: ``You and Juli getting married?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, this spring,'' replied Fisher. ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   The ever gentle Ryan told him, ``Why don't you tell your fiancee
to throw you a retirement party? You're done. You can't play
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, if you put it that way . . .
</P>
<P>
   Fisher kept resisting Ryan through the week after the Super
Bowl, then reconsidered and joined him as defensive backs coach in
Philly after Ryan was placed in charge. Two years later, Ryan made
him, at 30, the youngest defensive coordinator in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a coordinator, I was younger than some of the players,''
says Fisher. ``But I told them, `I'm still one of you. I'm just not
playing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He was one of them for three seasons, then reunited with
Robinson as his defensive coordinator with the Los Angeles Rams.
After a year there, he joined George Seifert's staff as defensive
backs coach of the San Francisco 49ers for two seasons before
becoming Pardee's lieutenant _ and, after 10 games, replacement _
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to take a little from each of them,'' says Fisher. ``I
wouldn't say I'm a Buddy Ryan disciple any more than you'd say
Buddy Ryan is a Weeb Ewbank disciple. There's something to be said
for being yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   For Fisher, that means employing a calm, steady hand, dwelling
on details, and exerting discipline when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think communication is the key,'' he says. ``You've got to
let them know what you expect from them. I don't think they make
mistakes on purpose. You've got to help them minimize mistakes. You
don't play the game on Saturday night. You've got to do different
things to help them through the week.''
</P>
<P>
   The players get, and endorse, the message. Fisher's reign has
been marked by a distinct lack of turmoil _ internally, at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a players' coach,'' says Pro Bowl running back Eddie
George.
</P>
<P>
   That's easy to say now during the high times, of course. But
George, like McNair, believes Fisher's credibility was established
during the rootless days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff kept his focus through all the drama we went through the
past few years, and a lot of guys bought into his philosophy,''
says George. ``He's not a guy who's going to call you out or yell
at you or chastise you. He treats you like a man, and you want to
win for him. He just treats us right, with respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Through all the identity crises, the evidence has been
documented. He's quite a coach, that Whatsisname.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Three years later _ three years late _ Patriot owner
Bob Kraft has decided to hire a tough guy to coach his football
team.
</P>
<P>
   For three years Bill Belichick's defensive schemes tortured Drew
Bledsoe &AMP; Co. As Jets defensive coordinator, Belichick showed the
entire NFL how to beat the Patriots and now it'll be his job to put
the Patriots ahead of the rest of the league.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick's behavior in recent weeks indicates he might be
enough of a wacko to be an effective NFL head coach. The Patriots'
new major domo is a man who accepted a $1 million bonus to stay
with the Jets after the 1998 season, signed a contract that would
keep in in New York through 2002, quit his job, lied about reasons
for quitting, then sued the league, claiming it was restricting him
from making a living. Oh, and then he asked the Jets if they'd take
him back.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Patriot fans, none of the above means he can't
do a good job coaching your team.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick should help the Patriots get back to the business of
winning football games. We expect he's not going to accept any lame
excuses from Terry Glenn, or allow players to run behind his back
to Kraft or Bobby Grier. He has a reputation for being direct with
players, which should be a healthy change in the wake of the ``I'm
OK, You're OK'' Pete Carroll era.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of Belichick in New England demonstrates what a
cutthroat business this is. The Patriots have had their eye on
Belichick for two years. Pocket Rocket Jonathan Kraft floated
Belichick's name as a Carroll replacement when Pats played
Jacksonville in the playoffs in 1998. New England decided to stay
with Carroll one more year, which resulted in a wasted season and
the loss of a first-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious that the Patriots and Belichick had some kind of
agreement in place by the time the 1999 NFL season ended. Within 24
hours after the Pats' final game, Carroll had been fired and the
Pats had faxed a memo requesting permission to talk to the Jets
about Belichick. A day later (Jan. 4), Belichick was secure enough
(about his Patriot job) to quit as new Jets head coach, despite the
three years remaining on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   In his infamous 28-minute Checkers speech _ Mini Me breaking
ranks with Dr. Evil _ Belichick repeatedly stated that he was not
attempting to get out of his contract. Within hours, he appealed to
the commissioner, then sued the NFL _ to get out of his contract.
Meanwhile, little was made of the $1 million bonus he took from
Leon Hess after the 1998 season. Belichick said he'd been paid the
bonus for doing a swell job. The Jets version was that he took $1
million in exchange for not talking to other teams and sticking
around to coach the Jets when Parcells stepped down. Commissioner
Paul Tagliabue agreed with the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   One can only wonder what Dom Capers, Marvin Lewis, Willie Shaw,
Steve Sidwell, and Gary Crowton think of the Krafts now that
Belichick has been hired. These are the men who interviewed with
the Patriots while the Pats fought to wrestle Belichick from the
Jets. Clearly all of these worthy candidates were used as stooges
and pawns in an effort to make the Jets lower their compensation
demands. Oh, well. That's the football business.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick went 37-45 in five seasons as head coach of the
Cleveland Browns. They were frosty years in the front office and on
the sideline. First- and second-round draft picks included
immortals Ed King, Tommy Vardell, Patrick Rowe, Dan Footman, and
Craig Powell. The Cleveland media despised Belichick and the
feeling was mutual.
</P>
<P>
   It matters not if Belichick gives good interviews or cooperates
with the New England media. His Jet resgination press conference
(which has been compared with the Farrah Fawcett meltdown on
Letterman) indicated he might be better off not saying anything,
and Kraft can always send Belichick to a friendly media
consultant/talk show host (Belichick's already getting Kraft
brownie points by referring to the owner as ``Robert'').
</P>
<P>
   What matters is winning football games. The Patriots three years
ago were a young Super Bowl team on the rise. Today they are a team
in dissaray, with a window starting to close on the professional
lifetimes of stars Drew Bledsoe, Terry Glenn, Ted Johnson, and Ty
Law. They need to win while their best players are still young and
strong.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick sounds like a guy who can get the job done. As for
that stuff about Kraft and Parcells burying the hatchet, and the
end of the New England-New York border war, we'll see.
</P>

<P>
   The Navy war room naturally was a deadly serious place in the
early 1960s. There was no accommodation for frivolity as enemy
intelligence was scrutinized, dissected, probed for the slightest
betrayal of weakness that could prove crucial on the battlefield.
Matters of national import were at stake, for the Midshipmen were a
true college football power back then, an annual major bowl
contender, and the pride of the academy, not to mention the futures
of the men gathered around the film projector, were a constant
backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   They were a grizzled bunch, Wayne Hardin's staff, which at
various times included future major college and NFL head coaches
like Rick Forzano and J.D. Roberts and George Welsh and Doug
Scovil. Steve Belichick, a career coach who in those less
specialized times doubled as a defensive assistant and advance
scout, a man who estimates that ``I wasn't at a Navy home game for
19 years,'' would return from the road to headquarters at
Annapolis, Md., with reconnaissance of the Midshipmen's upcoming
opponent, and the grim-faced group inspecting the film he brought
back consisted of men in their late 20s and 30s and 40s.
</P>
<P>
   And one 10-year-old kid.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Belichick's kid.
</P>
<P>
   Steve hadn't drawn babysitting duty. And his son wasn't
considered a nuisance, a distraction. He didn't squirm impatiently
in his seat or tug at his father's sleeve pestering him for dimes
to the candy machine or make rabbit ears in front of the screen. He
stared at the film just as intently as his elders, as much a part
of the tableau as the scouting reports strewn on the tables.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he knew his place, which was to be a silent observer. But
when one of the men, one of the professionals, would ask him, ``Did
you see what the tight end was doing in that situation?'' or ``Do
you notice where the quarterback looks first on third and long?''
the boy would nod solemnly. And then perhaps offer his
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   He knew. He understood. He got it. At age 10.
</P>
<P>
   Little Billy Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a genius,'' says Forzano, now retired from football after
a career that included head coaching stints with the University of
Connecticut, Navy, and the Detroit Lions. ``Ten years of age,
little Billy, that little son of a gun was in there breaking down
films. He had a knack for it. His dad was a great scout, one of the
best in the business. I don't think his dad ever pushed little
Billy into it _ he just took to it. Billy was always around us,
always around his dad, and he just picked it up.''
</P>
<P>
   And the coaches, the veterans, knew one thing: This was more
than a childhood phase, more than some youngster wanting to hang
out with the old man. At 10, little Billy Belichick was laying the
groundwork for a career, even if he didn't realize it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think,'' Forzano says, ``that anybody ever thought
he'd be anything but a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He's no longer little Billy. Bill Belichick is 47 years old now,
the new coach and general manager of the Patriots, grand prize in a
blood feud between Bill Parcells, the man he was contractually
obligated to succeed as coach of the Jets, and Bob Kraft, the New
England owner. Per edict of NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who
last week ruled that Belichick had breached his New York contract
Jan. 4 when he abdicated the day after automatically ascending from
assistant head coach to the retired Parcells's job, Kraft was
required to pay compensation to his former coach and once-mortal
enemy to secure Belichick's services. And he did so, however
grudgingly. That's how dearly he wanted Belichick, Parcells's
Patriots defensive coordinator during their Super Bowl season of
1996, to take over for the fired Pete Carroll _ and, more than
that, to run the entire New England football operation.
</P>
<P>
   It is the culmination of a career those grownups at Annapolis
considered inevitable: 25 years, Belichick's entire adult life,
spent in the NFL coaching ranks, from unpaid intern with the
Baltimore Colts to multimillion-dollar master of Foxboro Stadium.
Along the way, he has been hailed as a respected young position
coach, lionized as a wizardly defensive coordinator, and _ the one
blotch on his reputation, if not his resume _ vilified as an
unreasonable head coach in his one previous shot as the boss, with
the Cleveland Browns from 1991-95. There he turned the 3-13 pile of
refuse he inherited into an 11-5 playoff team in four years, but
along the way, he managed to antagonize most of Ohio. He was
perceived as intellectually arrogant, contemptuous of the media and
public and many of his early players, a profusely profane martinet
who watched his entire program implode in 1995 when owner Art
Modell _ who once had given him carte blanche _ clandestinely
transformed the Browns into the Baltimore Ravens and didn't invite
Belichick to hop in the moving van, instead leaving him dangling
from the cliff in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick spent the next four seasons trying to rehabilitate his
credentials as defensive coordinator under his longtime mentor,
Parcells, first with the Patriots and then with the Jets. And
Forzano, for one, believes he has done that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he went to Cleveland, he got on the bad side of the
press,'' says Forzano, who gave Belichick his first paying coaching
job, with the Lions in 1976. ``I think with another shot, he'll do
things differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew Belichick in his formative years consider his
Cleveland portrayal either unjust or an aberration, the antithesis
of the boy and man they knew while he was forging roots that are as
entrenched in New England as a cranberry bog. From the darkened
film room at Navy; to the rarefied social register of Phillips
Andover Academy, where he spent a postgraduate year after leaving
Annapolis High; to the elite campus of Wesleyan University in
Middletown, Conn., where he graduated in 1975 with a degree in
economics and letters in football, lacrosse, and squash, the
impressions are almost universal. Belichick is remembered as
cerebral, respectful, intense, competitive, and sociable. It would
shock his Cleveland critics to learn that he even was considered to
have a subtle, if only sporadically detectable, sense of humor. ``A
regular guy'' is the catchphrase from his past.
</P>
<P>
   To an extent, anyway. Just one of the gang, maybe _ but with an
analytical gift that belied his age and environment.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steve Belichick, now 81 and retired for a decade after 33 years
as a Navy assistant, would return to Annapolis from his weekend
trips and pore over the spoils of his scouting missions at home.
And little Billy, Steve and Jeannette's only child, invariably
would be at his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy saw his dad breaking down the films, and naturally, it
rubbed off on him,'' says Forzano. ``He took to it by osmosis. It's
like if your dad's a grocer and you hang around the store, you pick
up the business.''
</P>
<P>
   But you wouldn't necessarily have an intuitive awareness of the
inventory and its function in the marketing scheme the way little
Billy did. ``He had that uncanny ability not to have to write
things down,'' says Forzano. ``He could keep it all in his head.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't translate to his arms and legs. Through his football
career at Annapolis High and Andover and Wesleyan, Belichick was
variously a center and a tight end and a hybrid defensive
end-linebacker. There was one common denominator, regardless of his
position: He lacked distinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said he's the kind of player who'd get you fired as a
coach,'' Forzano says with a laugh. ``He wasn't much of a player.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was a superior student, scoring above 700 out of a
possible 800 on his college math boards. That's why his father
couldn't fathom why his son felt an extra year of preparation was
necessary when he graduated from Annapolis High.
</P>
<P>
   Forzano has a theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Billy felt young for his age,'' he says. ``He probably
wanted to mature himself a little. Sometimes a guy is actually more
mature but feels he's younger than other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   That turned out to be a distinctly minority opinion.
Nonetheless, Belichick enrolled at Andover in 1970, having acquired
an affinity for New England while spending junior high summers with
friends on Nantucket _ where he now owns three homes.
</P>
<P>
   At Andover, he enhanced his reputation as a sophisticated
student of games, if not a proficient practitioner of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very smart, intelligent,'' says Paul Kalkstein, the
assistant lacrosse coach that year. ``He had the ability to see
things before they developed. He didn't fit in well with a bunch of
free spirits. He was very serious about the game. He didn't fool
around, but he got along with everybody just fine. I can remember
him talking to me about what was going on while the other kids were
out there playing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kalkstein never envisioned Belichick patrolling the sideline
for a living. Not that he lacked the ability; he just didn't fit
the stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this school,'' says Kalkstein, ``it's so intellectually
demanding that the guys who become coaches usually are not among
the top students. I didn't see him as a coach because he was so
damn smart. I didn't think of Bill that way because he had such
wide interests and intellectual powers.''

support for handgun registration, universal health coverage and
abortion rights. Bradley makes a direct appeal to New Hampshire's

   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ This year's presidential campaign
demonstrates how disproportionately important opposition to
abortion and the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade ruling that legalized
it in 1973 have become to Republicans. In their debate the other
evening, the five Republican presidential hopefuls discussed issues
that one would require the attention of the leader of the world's
most powerful nation: taxes, trade, national defense, health care,
education, immigration, campaign finance reform and how to allocate
the budget surplus. But no issue generated more heat or triggered
more passionate declarations than abortion. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON.

   TIME-SHARES (Smugglers' Notch, Vt.) _ More than two million
Americans have bought vacation time shares since the concept was
imported from Europe in the early 1970s, according to the American
Resort Development Association, a trade group. But time shares
boomed in the '90s, vaulting the industry from a modest $300
million business in 1978 to an estimated $3.5 billion industry in
1999. Spurring that growth is not just time shares bought by
families, but also those bought by couples and even singles (who
last year accounted for almost 14 percent of purchases). Now that
the old two-week vacation has become a series of three-, four- or
seven-day getaways, time shares are increasingly regarded as a good

&HT;     ST. LOUIS RUNNING BACK IS BUILT RAM TOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the Tennessee Titans to win Super Bowl XXXIV, it's
simple. Just reduce the most prolific single-season offensive force
in NFL history to an afterthought. That's all.
</P>
<P>
   Theory and practice don't always coincide in football, however.
The Titans know what they have to do Sunday at the Georgia Dome.
Doing it is another matter altogether.
</P>
<P>
   During the season, Marshall Faulk of the St. Louis Rams broke
Barry Sanders' league record for most yards from scrimmage (2,358)
with a total of 2,429, and in the process became the first running
back since Roger Craig of the 49ers in 1985 to gain at least 1,000
yards rushing and 1,000 yards receiving.
</P>
<P>
   In helping the Rams to a 13-3 record on their way to their first
Super Bowl appointment in 20 years, Faulk rushed for 1,381 yards
and caught 87 passes for 1,048 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to run it,'' Faulk said. ``It's not a `rather.' I like
to run it. If they throw it to me, I like to catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   There's beauty in such simplicity. At 211 pounds, Faulk is big
enough to run between the tackles and he's fast enough to run away
from linebackers and defensive backs. Line him up at wide receiver
and it forces the defense to adjust with an extra defensive back or
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   With his background in Buddy Ryan's old ``46'' defense, Titans
coach Jeff Fisher likes to pressure an offense with blitzes to
augment the pass rush of ``The Freak,'' rookie defensive end Jevon
Kearse. Problem is, if Tennessee gambles with a blitz while Faulk
is lined up as a wide receiver and quarterback Kurt Warner gets the
ball to him quickly, it puts Faulk in the open field, with all that
space to maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Advantage, Rams. Especially against the Titans' 25th-ranked pass
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the key,'' Titans defensive end Kenny Holmes said. ``If
you can't run in the NFL, you can't win, even with a great passing
attack like they have. He's so explosive, you have to be focused on
him. If you don't focus on him, he can make your day miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   When the teams met Oct. 31 in Nashville, the Titans bolted to a
21-0 lead in the first quarter and held on to win, 24-21. Faulk had
184 yards from scrimmage divided nearly evenly between rushing (16
carries, 90 yards) and receiving (six catches, 94 yards). Faulk
scored on a 57-yard pass on the second play of the third quarter to
give the Rams hope of a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to tackle well,'' Holmes said. ``If we tackle well,
make him run between the tackles, we can contain him.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Titans can gain inspiration from Tampa Bay. Though
they lost to the Rams, the Buccaneers did limit St. Louis to 11
points and held Faulk to 49 total yards (44 rushing, five
receiving).
</P>
<P>
   It can be done.
</P>
<P>
   Added fellow defensive end Henry Ford, ``Marshall's the type of
back, you can't go out thinking you're going to stop him
completely. You want to contain him. You don't want him to take
over the game. If he does, it's going to be a long day for us.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The potential is there for just that. During the season, the
Rams averaged nearly 33 points per game (Tennessee averaged 24) and
had an advantage of 3 minutes, 40 seconds per game in time of
possession. That speaks to prolific scoring and ball control, a
tough combination to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to get into a scoring match with them,'' said
Ford, who did not sound too confident when he added, ``I believe
our offense will be fine. It's going to be an uphill battle. We're
not going to quit. We're not going to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like the Titans expect to be shoveling sand against the
tide. It might be good exercise but it's also an exercise in
futility.
</P>
<P>
   Things started to fall in place for the Rams at last year's
draft when they acquired Faulk from the Indianapolis Colts. In
return the Colts got the draft pick that enabled them to take
running back Edgerrin James. It was a rare example of a trade
benefiting both teams.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take the Rams long to discover what they had in Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew he was good,'' offensive coordinator Mike Martz said.
``We didn't know he was this good. Marshall helps in so many
different ways. He takes a lot of pressure off the wide receivers
because he's so good in the passing game. He causes the defense to
bring an eighth defender down there in the running game.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his physical skills, Faulk has the vision to see
things unfold around him and the ability to process what he sees
into what he does next. For that Faulk can thank his synapses for
firing so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm aware of what's going on on the field,'' he said.
``I know a lot about football. I know what everybody is supposed to
be doing. That helps me prepare for a game. It's my vision. I can
see everything that goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Jeff Robinson, a backup tight end, agreed that Faulk
has the eyes of a hawk when he takes the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marshall is by far the best position player I've ever seen,''
Robinson said. ``His football IQ is incredible. He understands the
game. He's not just a running back. He understands safeties are
coming down from which side and he understands the passing game
better than any running back I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans appreciate that to win Super Bowl XXXIV, they will
have to negate the most positive force in the Rams' offense. It's
as easy as shoveling sand against the tide.

&HT;     A SCHOOL'S `CUSTOMER' IS THE TAXPAYER, NOT THE STUDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN LYNCH  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Back in November, I came across a booklet
distributed to staffers by the administration of the suburban
Albany school district where I pay taxes _ taxes that are, by the
way, half again the national average.
</P>
<P>
   The booklet contained a disturbing perversion of the customer
service creed that guides almost every private business. You know
the one I mean. It's headlined, ``What is a customer?''
</P>
<P>
   It then goes on to remind employees that, ``The customer is not
an interruption of our work. The customer is the purpose of it ...
The customer is the most important person ... in person, on the
telephone or by mail.'' And so on and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Which is fine if you're in business. The customer is kept happy
because the customer pays the bills. The problem with this booklet
was that it substituted the word ``student'' for the word
``customer.''
</P>
<P>
   I pointed out in that column that the district had improperly
identified the customer. The true customer is me and you, the
taxpayers. We pay the freight for these public schools, and what we
demand is quality performance.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as I put it in that column, we demand, ``an educated
graduate _ somebody with a certain minimal level of skill in
reading, writing, math and science who can function effectively in
the workplace or in college.''
</P>
<P>
   That column seemed to seriously annoy the New York State School
Boards Association. They reprinted it in the latest edition of
their newspaper, ``On Board.'' They printed beside it an outraged
rebuttal by Harris Dinkoff, the vice president of the association's
board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Dinkoff characterized that column as ``vitriolic'' (Moi?)
and suggested that I should ``be visiting classrooms and looking
into the faces of children as they learn. Then he (That's me, by
the way) will know who the true customer really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, I know who the true customer really is. It's still me. I
pay for the product. That product is still the graduate. And, while
we're on the topic, quality control of the product isn't remotely
what it should be.
</P>
<P>
   The Higher Education Institute at the University of California
at Los Angeles recently completed its 34th annual, highly respected
national survey of college freshmen. These kids are the finest
examples of the product the public schools turn out. Take a look at
these findings, and decide how impressed you are with the product.
</P>
<P>
   More than one-third of today's college freshmen report that they
finished high school last spring with A averages. In the UCLA
survey of 1969, only 12.5 per cent of college freshmen finished
high school with A averages. Ask anybody who was in college in
1969, as I was. Getting into college was tougher then. Staying in
was tougher yet. I entered college with 4,500 freshmen. Because of
fierce academic competition, which is little more than a rumor
these days, only 1,200 of us graduated.
</P>
<P>
   When more than one-third of college freshmen report finishing
high school with A averages, you're seeing a rather blood-curdling
example of grade inflation. Also, these kids told the UCLA
researchers, fully 40 per cent of them did less than three hours of
homework a week in high school, and about 40 per cent reported that
their senior years bored them into comas. They weren't challenged
by the work. The result is record numbers of them now enrolled in
remedial college courses.
</P>
<P>
   That's what you get when you decide that you provide a service
rather than producing a product, when you identify the student as
the customer and not the larger community. In the school boards
association newspaper, Mr. Dinkoff proclaims that, ``There is no
status quo in education.'' He's right.
</P>
<P>
   Things have slipped rather conspicuously.

 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Tell me if you don't have the same reaction to
two stories that have dominated the news for the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   When I hear a TV anchor say ``Elian'' or ``Xiana,'' I lunge for
the remote and punch up a rerun of ``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   No thank you, I don't need all this child exploitation in my
living room, day after day after day.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to keep looking at those pictures of 7-year-old
Xiana Fairchild, who disappeared in Vallejo a month and a half ago.
I've seen enough of that pretty little girl to recognize her if I
saw her on the street. But it's hard to take another sad and
drawn-out story of a missing child, the kind of story that
frightens people into fascination.
</P>
<P>
   Let's be honest. The only reason to follow the Xiana story is to
hear the latest weird thing from her mother or her mother's
ex-boyfriend, the kind of people who wouldn't make the cut for the
Jerry Springer show.
</P>
<P>
   The last time I watched them was when they were still a couple.
The TV crew interviewed them while they were still in bed with
their hair going every which way. Let's just say they were no John
and Yoko.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since then, I've kept my trigger finger on the remote when
the local news comes on. I don't want to see any more of those two,
separately or together. And please, no more Marc Klaas.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, the national news opened with international
news instead of a child abduction story. These days the networks
have been doing both with the sad tale of Elian Gonzalez, the
6-year-old political football who floated from Cuba to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   So now I gingerly turn on Dan Rather, ready to flip to ``The
Simpsons'' at the first sight of grandmothers or chanting Cuban
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Simpsons'' are a downright functional family compared to
that Gonzalez bunch, and I'd rather watch funny cartoon characters
than the cartoon congressman trying to impose American citizenship
on a 6-year-old just to put Al Gore in a corner.
</P>
<P>
   That's what it's all about, folks, not pulling Fidel's beard.
</P>
<P>
   Let's call this by its real name. It's child exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   No 19th-century factory owner ever got as much out of a small
child as various politicians and pressure groups have gotten out of
Elian.
</P>
<P>
   This little kid has been pressed into service by American
politicians trying to make their opponents look un-American and
anti-Disney.
</P>
<P>
   He's become practically a religious icon to the old generation
of hard-line Cuban Americans who want to take back their homeland.
He's become a banner to wave by a graying dictator who finally has
a cause to rally his people. And of course, the American media
yearn for anything more interesting to put at the top of a program
instead of Gore and George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Elian is a good story, but the story seems like it's never going
to end.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the public, press and politicians call Elian by his
first name, just as we're all on a first-name basis with Xiana
Fairchild. These children are lost, but everyone has adopted them -
for various purposes.
</P>
<P>
   But then, we Americans love children, don't we? We sure say we
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do it for the children.'' That's a phrase we hear whenever a
politician or special interest group wants to do something that
usually serves adults' interests. I've used it myself, because it's
hard to get people to care about any social program unless children
are involved.
</P>
<P>
   Raising money to care for the homeless is hard, but it's easier
if they have children, which they increasingly do.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives claim they care about family values and raising
children right. They are sincere, but their sincerity doesn't
always extend to funding adequate nourishment and schooling for
less fortunate children.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals talk a lot about children, too. It takes a child to
raise a village's support for social programs. Americans see
children as innocent, and perhaps more worthy of our tax dollars
than their lazy parents.
</P>
<P>
   The younger the child, the more worthy he or she is. A group of
Hollywood liberals aims to create a national intervention program
for children under 3 years of age, on the premise that it will
prevent many problems later on in life.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with early childhood education or family
values, whatever that means exactly. But sometimes we have an
almost pathological fixation on children, such as when we equip
them with computers in preschool in the bizarre belief it will help
them get into Harvard - a bizarre goal, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the strange sexual fixation on children that led
to the hysteria about child abuse in preschools toward the end of
the last century. Isn't it great to be able to place all that
horrible stuff in the last century?
</P>
<P>
   There was all that publicity about all that child abuse in all
those preschools, and none of it turned out to be true.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, every night at the beginning of this century
we're watching the very real exploitation of children, live at 6 on
the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   Not me, though. I'm hitting that remote.

&HT;     PRESIDENT CLINTON SHOULD ESCORT ELIAN BACK TO CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALEX A. VARDAMIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARMEL, Calif. _ Dear Mr. President:
</P>
<P>
   I have heard that you are concerned with your historic legacy.
That is why you travel to so many faraway places in hopes of
leaving your footprints in the sands of time.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it would be wonderful if you achieved peace in any
number of troubled corners of the world. But while you are trying
to patch things up between folks in Israel and Syria, who are
showing very little inclination to go the extra mile to lasting
peace, something terrible is happening on your own shores.
</P>
<P>
   A little boy, Elian Gonzalez, is being used as a weapon in a
propaganda war. The citizens of Havana march in the streets
demanding that the boy be returned to his father and grandparents.
Relatives in Florida and the Cuban refugee community hold the child
captive in the name of freedom. His grandmothers plead for his
return. Things get worse day by day.
</P>
<P>
   I understand that an earlier president, John F. Kennedy,
inspired you to embark on your own political career. How would he
have handled the case of the Cuban boy who has landed on our
shores? With courage. That's how you make a name for yourself in
history.
</P>
<P>
   As you know, Kennedy's bestseller, ``Profiles in Courage,''
defined political greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy celebrated politicians who, despite ``the risks to their
careers, the unpopularity of their causes, the defamation of their
character,'' stood firm on principle, conviction and the national
good.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to take a stand.
</P>
<P>
   A great president is one who is willing to put his legacy in
jeopardy to solve an intractable problem that divides the country.
Your attorney general, Janet Reno, with your support, I presume,
has decided that the little boy should return to his father. I
agree.
</P>
<P>
   I am a grandfather and a great uncle. I cannot imagine that the
American justice system would allow me to steal my grandnephew from
his father and grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   The whole situation is bizarre. After all, material benefits _
puppies, toys and trips to Disneyland _ are not what a 6-year-old
needs. He needs his family.
</P>
<P>
   I, like you, am also a father. You want fathers to be
responsible? Then set an example. Teach the world that fathers are
important.
</P>
<P>
   I would suggest that you take a trip to Florida. Be the leader.
Do what is right. You are a personable and persuasive man. Knock on
the door. Gather the boy into your arms. Don't let the great uncle
thwart your mission.
</P>
<P>
   Personally escort Elian back to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   As you return the boy to his home, make peace with Cuba along
the way. Load Air Force One with medicine, food, and, yes, toys and
puppies. Deliver them to Havana.
</P>
<P>
   That way, you demonstrate compassion not just for Elian, but for
the tens of thousands of Cuban children who have been denied proper
nutrition and medical attention because of Washington's harsh
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, your action will not be popular with everyone in the
United States. You'll survive. As JFK shrewdly observed, a
president's ``constituency is not sectional, his losses in
popularity with one group or section may be offset on the same
issue by his gains from others.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the opposition grows shrill and unrelenting? Remember, as
Edmund Burke wrote, if anyone wishes to scale the summit of glory,
he must ``hazard his ease, his security, his interest, his power,
even his popularity. Obloquy is a necessary ingredient in the
composition of all true glory.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how you get in the history books. Not by bribing adamant
adversaries, nor by bombing age-old enemies into temporary accords.
True heroism, a true profile in courage, means choosing the harder
right over the easier wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Yours truly,
</P>

<P>
   It's incredibly easy to find tab _ by-ear transcriptions of
music _ on the World Wide Web. Basically, all you have to do is
point and click.
</P>
<P>
   To get a sense of the wide range of tab available, check out the
Jungle or Olga sites that archive thousands of songs simply
transcribed.
</P>
<P>
   The Jungle, for example, offers tab sorted alphabetically for
guitar and bass, covering country, pop and even classical music.
Olga operates as a specialty search engine where visitors simply
type in the title of the song they are looking for. Both sites
offer links to other sites.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are other ways to link to tab. You can also go
to any standard search engine like Alta Vista or Yahoo and type in
the name of an artist and the word ``tab'' or ``tablature,'' and
you will get a list of sites that you can link to for that
songwriter.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few of the tab sites we came across while researching
the accompanying story:

<P>
   1. guitarolga.net
</P>
<P>
   2. thejungle.hypermart.net/tabarc.htm

 &HT;    LETTER FROM MIAMI: SAD, SEXY, SURREAL, IT'S ALL IN A DAY'S WORK
COVERING ELIAN
 &HT;    With Photo mug.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (k) Commentary categories.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Janet Reno may have said it best: ``Has anybody ever
heard of such a case as this?''
</P>
<P>
   The saga of 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez has become a
media-fueled comet: a cross between the nastiest child custody case
in the history of the planet, a Tom Clancy plot filled with spies,
propaganda and paranoia and a legal battle of O.J. proportions.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's reunion with his grandmothers was surreal: a World
Event in our age of Instant Media, complete with wall-to-wall
coverage, helicopters following cars on the interstate, angry
protesters chanting in the streets and reporters offering
breathless commentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've taken a cell phone away from one of the
grandmothers,'' a rattled television reporter uttered. ``We'll have
more on this startling development in a moment.''
</P>
<P>
   And the network heavyweights, intoning each night on the latest
move by ``the grandmothers,'' as if the women held the key to
Armageddon and the whole country was waiting for the next
installment in this drama that is already on its way to becoming a
made-for-TV mini-series.
</P>
<P>
   I think we've lost our sense of perspective. I don't leave
myself out. I'm part of the pack, too.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it is a heart-rending story that grabs a lot of
people right in the gut. A really cute little boy who endured an
unimaginable horror at sea, watching his mother drown, then somehow
miraculously surviving, only to wade ashore into a hurricane of
rhetoric, posturing and scorched-earth media overkill.
</P>
<P>
   I can't decide which is stranger: the story itself, or the
frenzy over covering it. I think the two are working hand-in-hand
to create something ``Larger than Life. Elian the Symbol, the
summation of something profound about the human condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Which to some degree is true. But the coverage still worries me.
</P>
<P>
   It is an impressive spectacle, something like a powerful army's
assault: satellite trucks with huffing generators jammed
bumper-to-bumper, producers with cell phones running around
engrossed in the most important telephone conversation in the
world, reporters fixing their make-up, spectators hovering about
like moths drawn to a flame.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the street outside Sister O'Laughlin's home in the
barricaded media pen Wednesday, I was not left wanting for
information. Live coverage on a half-dozen monitors gave the
play-by-play: the Lear jet's take-off, the touchdown, the tense
moments with a camera trained on a door at the Opa-Locka Airport
where the two women disappeared, the growing anxiety as they didn't
come to Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Grandmothers? Lear-jets? Kibitzing with Congress members?
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, one station here actually sat a reporter
next to a monitor displaying the jet's flight path from Washington
to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to fly over North Carolina,'' the guy droned,
his comments apparently aimed at the geographically challenged.
Next he pointed to graphics charting the plane's air speed,
altitude and presumably the snack consumption of the weary
abuelitas.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, another Miami station aired this fed-up e-mail
from an exhausted viewer: ``We interrupt your local programming for
the 97th time to bring you the latest on Elian Gonzalez. Elian
sneezed today. Twice.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is quite a story.
</P>
<P>
   After their wait at Opa-Locka _ apparently triggered when
somebody _ Cuban spies, perhaps? _ complained after spotting
members of a leading exile group at the house next door to Sister
O'Laughlin's, the women were finally escorted to a waiting
helicopter. Live footage of the boarding, the take-off, the flight,
the landing, the motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   It must be the most bizarre but heartbreaking trip of the
grandmothers' lives. Their first time out of Cuba, first time in an
airplane, first time in a helicopter, first time seeing snow, first
time two little old ladies from Cardenas got a face-to-face
sit-down with the Attorney General of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, it seems, Elian's saga has grown all the more strange,
all the more magnified beyond the boundaries of common sense,
beyond all decency for what should be a private, family matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pity,'' said Betty Goldstein, who lives across the
street from Sister O'Laughlin's donated mansion. ``No matter where
the boy grows up, he'll have a hard time getting over this. The
family should've settled it privately.''
</P>
<P>
   I blame us media guys for part of it. Maybe if we didn't trumpet
every little twitch and twitter poor Elian makes, maybe if we
didn't spout the latest propaganda salvo leveled by each side, the
family rift wouldn't have ratcheted into this state of mini-series
melodrama. Give a normal, unassuming working-class family from
Little Havana _ or Tuscaloosa or Boise _ unchecked access to the
all-powerful, world-spanning Media Monster, and what do you expect?
</P>
<P>
   People have a hard time resisting the lure of being on TV. Add
in some deeply held beliefs, a doozy of a family conflict and a
cute little boy and it's all like rocks falling off a cliff.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the media isn't all to blame. Both sides have
manipulated, spun and choreographed, with the little boy left in
the middle like a rag-doll in a tug-of-war.
</P>
<P>
   It looks more and more like we will need a Solomon to solve this
case.
</P>
<P>
   But I still can't help wondering if the problem would've grown
this intractable without the cameras. Would it all be over by now
if it had been just two sides of a family sitting down at the
kitchen table, or on the phone, with a bad problem?
</P>
<P>
   The really sad part, of course, is the kid.
</P>
<P>
   While both sides of his family clearly love him, it's also clear
that both sides are loading more symbolic weight on Elian's tiny
shoulders than any 6-year-old should be asked to bear. In Little
Havana, they call him the ``Miracle Boy,'' with some claiming he's
sent by God as a prophet or a sign. In Old Havana, they call him
``Our Hero,'' and hundreds of thousands wear T-shirts bearing his
image.
</P>
<P>
   Maritza, the Nicaraguan-born housekeeper at my hotel, put it
well: ``He will have a better future with more opportunity here,
but he will be better off as a child with his family there. Los dos
_ both answers are best.''
</P>
<P>
   If only 40 years of history and hatred didn't stand in the way.
</P>

   I think we've lost our sense of perspective. I don't leave
myself out. I'm part of the pack, too.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it is a heart-rending story that grabs a lot of
people right in the gut. A really cute little boy who endured an
unimaginable horror at sea, watching his mother drown, then somehow
miraculously surviving, only to wade ashore into a hurricane of
rhetoric, posturing and scorched-earth media overkill.
</P>
<P>
   I can't decide which is stranger: the story itself, or the
frenzy over covering it. I think the two are working hand-in-hand
to create something ``Larger than Life. Elian the Symbol, the
summation of something profound about the human condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Which to some degree is true. But the coverage still worries me.
</P>
<P>
   It is an impressive spectacle, something like a powerful army's
assault: satellite trucks with huffing generators jammed
bumper-to-bumper, producers with cell phones running around
engrossed in the most important telephone conversation in the
world, reporters fixing their make-up, spectators hovering about
like moths drawn to a flame.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the street outside Sister O'Laughlin's home in the
barricaded media pen Wednesday, I was not left wanting for
information. Live coverage on a half-dozen monitors gave the
play-by-play: the Lear jet's take-off, the touchdown, the tense
moments with a camera trained on a door at the Opa-Locka Airport
where the two women disappeared, the growing anxiety as they didn't
come to Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Grandmothers? Lear-jets? Kibitzing with Congress members?
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, one station here actually sat a reporter
next to a monitor displaying the jet's flight path from Washington
to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to fly over North Carolina,'' the guy droned,
his comments apparently aimed at the geographically challenged.
Next he pointed to graphics charting the plane's air speed,
altitude and presumably the snack consumption of the weary
abuelitas.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, another Miami station aired this fed-up e-mail
from an exhausted viewer: ``We interrupt your local programming for
the 97th time to bring you the latest on Elian Gonzalez. Elian
sneezed today. Twice.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is quite a story.
</P>
<P>
   After their wait at Opa-Locka _ apparently triggered when
somebody _ Cuban spies, perhaps? _ complained after spotting
members of a leading exile group at the house next door to Sister
O'Laughlin's, the women were finally escorted to a waiting
helicopter. Live footage of the boarding, the take-off, the flight,
the landing, the motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   It must be the most bizarre but heartbreaking trip of the
grandmothers' lives. Their first time out of Cuba, first time in an
airplane, first time in a helicopter, first time seeing snow, first
time two little old ladies from Cardenas got a face-to-face
sit-down with the Attorney General of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, it seems, Elian's saga has grown all the more strange,
all the more magnified beyond the boundaries of common sense,
beyond all decency for what should be a private, family matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pity,'' said Betty Goldstein, who lives across the
street from Sister O'Laughlin's donated mansion. ``No matter where
the boy grows up, he'll have a hard time getting over this. The
family should've settled it privately.''
</P>
<P>
   I blame us media guys for part of it. Maybe if we didn't trumpet
every little twitch and twitter poor Elian makes, maybe if we
didn't spout the latest propaganda salvo leveled by each side, the
family rift wouldn't have ratcheted into this state of mini-series
melodrama. Give a normal, unassuming working-class family from
Little Havana _ or Tuscaloosa or Boise _ unchecked access to the
all-powerful, world-spanning Media Monster, and what do you expect?
</P>
<P>
   People have a hard time resisting the lure of being on TV. Add
in some deeply held beliefs, a doozy of a family conflict and a
cute little boy and it's all like rocks falling off a cliff.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the media isn't all to blame. Both sides have
manipulated, spun and choreographed, with the little boy left in
the middle like a rag-doll in a tug-of-war.
</P>
<P>
   It looks more and more like we will need a Solomon to solve this
case.
</P>
<P>
   But I still can't help wondering if the problem would've grown
this intractable without the cameras. Would it all be over by now
if it had been just two sides of a family sitting down at the
kitchen table, or on the phone, with a bad problem?
</P>
<P>
   The really sad part, of course, is the kid.
</P>
<P>
   While both sides of his family clearly love him, it's also clear
that both sides are loading more symbolic weight on Elian's tiny
shoulders than any 6-year-old should be asked to bear. In Little
Havana, they call him the ``Miracle Boy,'' with some claiming he's
sent by God as a prophet or a sign. In Old Havana, they call him
``Our Hero,'' and hundreds of thousands wear T-shirts bearing his
image.
</P>
<P>
   Maritza, the Nicaraguan-born housekeeper at my hotel, put it
well: ``He will have a better future with more opportunity here,
but he will be better off as a child with his family there. Los dos
_ both answers are best.''
</P>
<P>
   If only 40 years of history and hatred didn't stand in the way.
</P>

<P>
   Sheet music? To increasing numbers of amateur musicians, it's as
obsolete as the player piano.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, if you wanted to learn to play a favorite song
on the guitar, you had to trot down to the neighborhood music store
with fingers crossed, hoping the sheet music was still on the
shelf. And even if it was, chances are you'd end up singing the
blues due to the wide gap between what you heard on the radio and
the official printed page, because sheet music is often notoriously
inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   Today, of course, with the incredible, exploding Internet
gobbling up so much printed material, learning to play a hit single
_ or an obscure number by a cult artist _ has never been easier.
Just click onto a directory site like the online guitar archives
the Jungle or Olga. There you can look up a song or artist. You'll
then be linked to a page of tablature or tab (transcribed music for
guitar). The next step: Grab the guitar and play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tab is hacker music notation produced for hacker guitar
players _ an identity we embrace,'' says Toronto-based guitarist
Michael Shaye, 25, who runs a tab site devoted to Britpop. ``It's
musical notation for guitar players that can't read music _ which
is probably around 95 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   What he's referring to is a growing community of guitarists
brought together through cyberspace in the name of the artists they
love. Because guitar is a portable, ubiquitous and relatively
easy-to-play instrument _ unlike piano _ it can be taken outside or
strummed while sitting in front of a computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, learning guitar on an amateur level resembles
received wisdom. Before the online explosion, college kids learned
licks from each other by running down the hall to visit that
infamous dorm-room guitarist who knew a few more blues riffs than
anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Or you watched other players at gigs, then rushed home to
approximate what you just heard.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you can trade chords or finger-picking methods with people
you've never met all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   And it's being done out of love, not cash. Nobody gets paid for
interpreting a Bob Dylan tune for guitar and posting it on the
Internet. They do it because they admire the music and swapping
chords brings them closer to the artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can take anywhere from five minutes to five hours to
transcribe a song _ depending on the complexity of the music and
your attention to detail,'' Shaye says. ``Tablature on the Internet
makes the world of musical education smaller. Tabs are rough
musical interpretations to help bedroom guitar players learn songs
quickly _ the `can and string' of musical communication in the
digital age.''
</P>
<P>
   The tab on these sites ranges from cult artists like Richard
Thompson to arena acts such as Pearl Jam to the classical
compositions of Bach. By-ear transcriptions, though, depend on the
musical ability and organizational skills of the person putting the
music online.
</P>
<P>
   But even mistakes can sometimes be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I find tab that isn't correct, I can figure out what the
right chords are, which is easy if you know the song to begin
with,'' says bassist-guitarist Spencer Robinson, 22, of Hollywood.
``About 70 percent of sites are accurate. But you can use incorrect
tab as a framework to learn the right way to do things.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, free tab has become so commonplace, in fact, that music
companies now try and sell the official stuff over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While there have been a few border skirmishes between tab sites
and music publishers, it's probably precisely because amateur tab
is merely an interpretation of a song that it hasn't become an
issue to rival the onetime all-out war over MP3, which takes an
actual piece of music and places it on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tab sites are not accurate often due to the fact that many
artists use different tunings, and that throws most people off
right away,'' says guitarist Josh Jordan, 20, a sophomore at
Eastern Illinois University who runs a tab site devoted to the
music of Pearl Jam. ``Also, it's easy to miss chords if they are
anything other than major or minor. I've found the actual sheet
music is always more accurate than tab because professionals do it,
rather than college students like myself. However, most sheet music
is not overseen by the artists themselves, so it can be off as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Olga archive of more than 1,000 files _ ranging from Fatboy
Slim to Bach _ begun in 1992 at the University of Las Vegas (UNLV).
In 1996, UNLV was contacted by EMI Publishing, who alleged
copyright breach. The university responded by kicking Olga off its
server, but no threat was made against the site itself.
</P>
<P>
   A second threat from music publishers two years ago resulted in
Olga's brief closure and the site's incorporation, a maneuver
designed so Olga's owners can raise funds to pursue a resolution to
the question of the legality of by-ear transcriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Legality aside, there's still the question of quality. And it's
a big one.
</P>
<P>
   For basic guitar students, tab sites are generally fine as long
as they break songs down to basic chord patterns. Some even offer
intricate fingering and tuning suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Some fan-produced tab sites are not only complex, they're
conceptual. For example, there's Shaye's well-designed Britpop
site, which pulls together surprisingly accurate-sounding
transcriptions of songs by Oasis, Blur and more.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider the Lyle Lovett sites, which explain how to mimic
the eccentric songwriter's distinctive approach to fingerpicking.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the tab community helps each other. The bigger
sites, like Olga and the Jungle, have swollen to include many
thousands of examples of song tab precisely because fans contribute
their own transcriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say I've become close friends with anyone through
posting tab,'' Robinson explains. ``But I've added my two cents
when I've found something interesting or entirely wrong. That's the
great thing about this stuff _ everybody has a say.'' &QL;

A DONNE DEAL IN `WIT'
</HEADLINE>

Our rating: 3 stars

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Vivian Bearing, Ph.D., is the type of career-driven academic
who seems to be on permanent sabbatical from humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Imperious and patrician as her name suggests, this middle-age
English professor has measured out her life in test grades and
scholarly articles. She treats her students with chilly
condescension, and like her literary idol, the great 17th-century
British poet John Donne, she generally regards life as a giant
intellectual puzzle to be solved.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Vivian is an iceberg with tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite these temperamental flaws, Vivian is not without
wit, the precious commodity that happens to be the title of
Margaret Edson's dazzlingly written first play. She will need every
ounce of her prickly intellect to combat the stage-four metastatic
ovarian cancer she's just been diagnosed with. As Vivian (Kathleen
Chalfant) humorously deadpans to the audience in her opening
soliloquy, ``There is no stage five.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 75 minutes, the baseball cap Vivian wears to cover
her shorn head will become her red badge of courage, as this
fiercely exacting woman learns that sometimes life's greatest
lessons are also its simplest ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wit'' arrived Wednesday at the Geffen Playhouse in Westwood
after deservedly winning last year's Pulitzer Prize for Drama for
its author, an Atlanta kindergarten teacher.
</P>
<P>
   If, like me, you've haven't seen ``Wit'' previously, either in
New York or at its 1995 world premiere at South Coast Repertory
Theatre in Costa Mesa, you may find the current production
something of a letdown, despite Chalfant's rigorously honest,
hugely resourceful central portrayal.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is paradoxical: In the solitary stillness of the
printed page, ``Wit's'' gorgeous poetic conceits have room to
ripen; its philosophical ideas have time to mushroom. On stage,
those conceits must necessarily be harnessed to the mechanics of a
working piece of theater. That process, in my view, drains some of
the lyricism and hushed humanity from Edson's beautifully baroque
blank verse. Poetry tends to dissolve into TV-style melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, while the play's action moved briskly Wednesday
night, it also moved choppily, with sliding hospital curtains and
perambulating chairs creating a noisy choreography. Some of that
might have been due to the sad death of the play's director, Derek
Anson Jones, from AIDS-related complications on Jan. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, ``Wit'' frequently makes for an enriching evening of
theater _ smart, sensitive and seriously funny.
</P>
<P>
   Edson gently eases her audience into what's in store. The play
starts loose and jokey, and maintains its comic spirits even after
crossing into much darker terrain. Its opening exchanges establish
this tricky tone by mirroring Vivian's denial of her condition,
showing the intellectual armor she musters to ward off reality.
</P>
<P>
   Vivian reduces all human interaction to verbal swordplay, and as
a ``celebrity'' cancer patient, whose suffering could reap
scientific rewards, she finds two worthy sparring partners, first
in the smooth but compassionate Dr. Kelekian (well-played by Walter
Charles), and second in his ambitious star pupil Dr. Jason Posner
(Alex Phoenix). Her competitive instincts aroused, Vivian can't
help smirking when Jason reveals that as a pre-med student, he took
her class in Donne's poetry _ and received an A-. ``I wish I'd
given him an A!'' Vivian later blurts as she waits for Jason to
inspect her insides.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, student-teacher relationships in ``Wit'' are
constantly being flipped on their heads. We're meant to see Jason
as a younger, male version of Vivian, who dissects diseases with
the same intellectual passion and emotional detachment that Vivian
applies to Donne's spiritually angst-ridden verse. But Phoenix's
exaggeratedly obtuse, frat-boy demeanor makes Jason seem too glib
for the parallel to take hold.
</P>
<P>
   Donne (1572-1631), the dean of England's school of metaphysical
poetry (``he makes Shakespeare sound like a Hallmark card,'' Jason
quips), presides over ``Wit'' like a deus ex machina. Yet, true to
Edson's humanitarian viewpoint, it's people, not poetry, that
proves to be Vivian's salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Vivian's head nurse, Susie (Paula Pizzi), becomes a buffer
between Dr. Posner's brusque bedside manner and the antiseptic
tortures of modern medicine. Pizzi, reprising her New York
performance, gives Susie an inner glow as luminous as a votive
candle.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Vivian's wise old mentor Professor Ashford, beautifully
performed by Anne Pitoniak as a cross between Lillian Gish and
Yoda, who steals the play with just two brief scenes, one involving
a reading of the children's story ``The Runaway Bunny.''
</P>
<P>
   Sentimental? Sure it is _ and no less effective for that sunny
streak. Vivian's final outcome, like that of all human beings, is a
dark one. But through its quick-minded insights and dignified
spirit, ``Wit'' delivers its audience, and its steely heroine, into
the light. &QL;

   COMPUTER-COLUMN (Houston) _ There are some who lament that the
grass-roots days of the Internet are over. The network of networks
has grown too big and too commercialized, they say, to support the
type of populist movements that characterized its infancy. And then
along comes something like MP3 to prove them wrong. MP3 is a music

trade them with others, and it's revolutionizing the music
business. By DWIGHT SILVERMAN.

   WORKING-COLUMN (Houston) _ Most people don't know they can get
fired for just about anything at work. They're what are known as
``at will'' employees, a phrase that isn't exactly bandied about in
normal conversation. If you look in your employee handbook, chances
are your employer will let you know in a fairly prominent place
that you're an ``at will'' employee. That means your boss can give

   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ This year's presidential campaign
demonstrates how disproportionately important opposition to
abortion and the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade ruling that legalized
it in 1973 have become to Republicans. In their debate the other
evening, the five Republican presidential hopefuls discussed issues
that one would require the attention of the leader of the world's
most powerful nation: taxes, trade, national defense, health care,
education, immigration, campaign finance reform and how to allocate
the budget surplus. But no issue generated more heat or triggered
more passionate declarations than abortion. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON.

   NEW YORK _ The Hearst Corporation announced Friday that Roger
Oglesby has been named publisher and editor of the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer, succeeding J.D. Alexander, who has been named
an assistant to George B. Irish, vice president of the Hearst
Corporation and president of Hearst Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ken Bunting has been promoted to executive editor
of the Post-Intelligencer. The announcements were made by Irish and
Frank A. Bennack Jr., president and chief executive officer of the
Hearst Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Oglesby, 51, has a diverse background encompassing journalism,
business and law; he holds a bachelor of journalism degree from the
University of Missouri School of Journalism and a law degree from
the University of California's Hastings College of the Law in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger brings to the Post-Intelligencer a broad background with
impressive depth in both the business and editorial aspects of
journalism,'' Irish said. ``We are confident that he will build on
J.D.'s achievements at the helm of the Post-Intelligencer.''
</P>
<P>
   Irish added, ``His particular combination of abilities and
experience will be important during this period of transition in
the Seattle newspaper market.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 6, the independently owned Seattle Times, which has
been published in the afternoon, will begin publishing in the
morning, the same as the Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, 61, in his new capacity will provide a wide range of
assistance to the Hearst newspaper group, including working with
the editors of the 12 Hearst-owned dailies.
</P>
<P>
   ``J.D.'s new assignment will benefit the entire newspaper
group,'' Irish said. ``At the Post-Intelligencer, he was not only
an outstanding journalist, but a leader who assembled one of the
finest editorial teams in the country. Under his stewardship, the
paper won a Pulitzer Prize for the brilliant political cartoons of
David Horsey. Now all the Hearst newspapers will have the benefit
of his knowledge and experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunting, 51, was formerly managing editor, responsible for
overseeing all news content of the Post-Intelligencer. In his new
position, Bunting will assume added responsibilities for new media
and will serve on the newspaper's editorial board.
</P>
<P>
   Oglesby was most recently president of the Orange County edition
of the Los Angeles Times, a Times Mirror newspaper. Prior to this,
he held a variety of positions with Times Mirror, including editor
and vice president of the Allentown (Pa.) Morning Call and
president and chief executive of California Community News. He also
has held editorial positions with Knight-Ridder's San Jose Mercury
News and the Omaha World-Herald.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander joined the Post-Intelligencer as executive editor in
1986 and added the title of publisher in 1993. Previously, he had
been managing editor of the San Diego Union, and prior to that held
various positions at the Washington Post. He holds a bachelor's
degree from Wake Forest University.
</P>
<P>
   Bunting joined the Post-Intelligencer in 1993 as managing
editor. Previously, he held various positions including senior
editor for news, deputy managing editor, and assistant managing
editor at the Fort Worth (Texas) Star-Telegram. He also worked at
the Los Angeles Times, Sacramento Bee and Cincinnati Post. He holds
a bachelor's degree from Texas Christian University.
</P>
<P>
   Among Hearst's other newspapers are the Houston Chronicle, San
Francisco Examiner, San Antonio Express-News and the Albany Times
Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Hearst Corporation is one of the nation's largest
diversified communications companies, with interests in magazine,
newspaper and business publishing, television and radio stations,
newspaper comics and features syndication, cable television
networks, television production and syndication, and interactive

SEEKING A UNITED EUROPEAN HERITAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL Z. WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ When a group of prominent Europeans gathered
recently to discuss an ambitious plan to found a Museum of Europe,
a British participant suggested _ not entirely in jest _ that the
new institution might acquire one of Margaret Thatcher's notorious
handbags that became a symbol of her angry opposition to taxpayer
support for the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   That such an artifact would actually go on display is unlikely.
The museum aims to emphasize Europe's shared cultural heritage
rather than the rancorous conflicts that frequently plague European
integration. But the challenge facing the museum is considerable
because, as its mission statement admits, most Europeans regard the
15-nation European Union as a ``cold, bureaucratic monster, a
soulless producer of administrative edicts.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, banana import quotas and demands for agricultural
subsidy cuts are hardly the stuff of which dreams are made.
Advocates of the ``European idea'' are increasingly concerned that
it be perceived as more than a technocratic enterprise and acquire
democratic legitimacy in the eyes of the average citizen. ``We are
seeking a shared identity _ a new European soul,'' the European
Commission president, Romano Prodi, has declared. ``We need to
build a union of hearts and minds, a shared sense of common
destiny, of European citizenship.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum, which backers hope will open on a site fronting the
European Parliament in Brussels by 2003, is an attempt to reinforce
the idea of a common European identity. ``The European Union which
is taking shape before our eyes is not a recent invention born of
politicians' whims but the product of a long maturation of a
time-honored idea as old as Europe itself,'' the mission statement
argues.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the quest for the roots of Europeanness far predates
this late 20th century experiment in pooled sovereignty. Since the
political necessity that helped forge the community of West
European nations vanished with communism's demise, the examination
of these roots has intensified, yet just where the broader idea of
Europe began is proving open to contentious interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Greece, regarding itself as the cradle of
European democracy, has geared up to torpedo the museum project as
currently conceived. The Greek government objects that the core
exhibition is to have as its starting point not the classical era
but the Middle Ages. Museum organizers consider the ninth century
empire of Charlemagne and Latin Christendom as having set Europe
upon the path toward unification.
</P>
<P>
   Greek civilization failed to promote a larger European
consciousness, argues the museum's scientific director, Elie
Barnavi, because it discriminated between citizens and barbarians.
Roman civilization featured a similar dichotomy, he says, and
therefore the exhibition timeline should begin with the medieval
Holy Roman Empire, not ancient Rome. In response, the Greek
government lodged a formal protest against the museum at a meeting
of EU cultural ministers in November. Italy has yet to weigh in on
the treatment of the Roman world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe has had many different ideas of itself over time,''
said Anthony Grafton, professor of European history at Princeton,
whose survey course is sometimes dubbed ``Plato to NATO.'' In such
a course, or in a museum exhibition, Grafton said, it is important
to remember ``you're teaching a construct.'' He added, ``Eastern
Europe, for example, was at times central to European history in
ways we tended to forget earlier in the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Europe's geographic borders have shifted continually. In
a forthcoming volume, to be published by an EU think tank, Heinrich
Schneider, a professor at the University of Vienna, writes, ``How
far Europe will reach tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, or in
the next century and later, cannot be looked up in a historical
atlas of the Antique, the Middle Ages, of the 20th century, or of
the Cold War period.''
</P>
<P>
   Lack of consensus has not hindered the proliferation of museum
shows emphasizing that today's Europe is being built upon a shared
culture, however. An exhibition financed by the Council of Europe,
which promotes pan-European cultural cooperation, is currently
touring the continent, embracing the Greek view. The exhibit argues
that the story of Ulysses is European culture's founding myth, and
that even before people in this part of the world wrote down their
myths and legends, Europe could be distinguished as an emerging
entity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diversity is doubtless a richness, but it is not by stressing
our differences that we shall improve the lot of our children,''
the exhibition catalog reads. In Berlin, the Museum of German
Folklore reopened in June in a new incarnation, the Museum of
European Cultures. ``The founding of a cultural-historical museum
with a European orientation reflects political circumstances:
Europe is growing together and museums want to do their part,'' the
revamped institution states in its literature. And in Paris,
France's National Museum of Folk Arts and Traditions has proposed
undergoing a similar metamorphosis.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier efforts to inspire its citizens, the European Union
devised a repertory of symbols amounting to the traditional
trappings of nationhood: European flags, passports, automobile tags
and an anthem.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the European Parliament has called for a new
history textbook to be written for use in schools across the
continent that will place individual national histories in a
European context. The new Europe, supporters of revised textbooks
say, needs to develop its own set of shared heroes and villains,
battles and revolts.
</P>
<P>
   But others are wary that such reinterpretation is really a
rewriting of history. In a recent issue of the journal Antiquity,
the British archaeologist Mark Pluciennik cites increased financing
for academics from the EU and the Council of Europe as creating
``pressures to consider, write about and work on a pan-European
scale.'' He goes on to warn of the ``potential abuse of archaeology
as propaganda'' and that ``some academics have accepted the
challenge of rewriting the past with an alacrity that is far more
Orwellian than anything produced by the EU.''

   Still others worry about a loss of national distinctiveness,
fears that have only increased as concern mounts about
globalization as a homogenizing force. As the EU looks ahead to
negotiations to admit Turkey and Central and Eastern European
nations as members, the search for a clear-cut identity to
undergird the integration process grows more complex. The eastern
and southern boundaries of Europe are being heatedly debated and
the growing presence of immigrants from other continents throws up
questions about what qualities distinguish Europe from anywhere
else.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the authorities at the European Commission, the EU's
administrative arm, regard curriculum policy as the prerogative of
individual countries and are loathe to interfere after an earlier
EU attempt to create a new history textbook ended in failure. An
eight-language edition by the French historian Jean-Baptiste
Duroselle was published amid fanfare in 1989, but the Greeks vetoed
the commission's distribution of the text because they saw it as
giving short shrift to Hellenic influence in European civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ludlow, director of the Center for European Policy Studies
in Brussels, argues that grassroots awareness of Europe's shared
destiny is about to undergo a sea change. (Just under half of EU
citizens support their country's membership in the union, according
to a poll last spring.) He says the tangible catalyst for this will
arrive when national currencies are traded for newly minted euros
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Irving Mitchell, the EU official overseeing higher education
cooperation concedes that there is ``an underlying agenda.'' He
added: ``We have to learn to understand each other and to accept
diversity. It doesn't mean creating the `identi-kit European,' as
Mrs. Thatcher called it.''

   Several times this week, Al Gore insisted that he has always
supported both a woman's right to choose an abortion and Roe v.
Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that ensured that right. The
Bill Bradley campaign asserts that Gore is misstating the facts.
The Boston Globe did some research that backs up the Bradley camp.
The paper found that in the House in 1977, Gore voted for an
amendment stating that abortion ``takes the life of an unborn child
who is a living human being,'' and that no right to abortion ``is
secured by the Constitution.'' And in 1984, Gore supported an
amendment that would have redefined the term ``person'' to include
``unborn children from the moment of conception.'' The paper also
found memos to Gore in late 1987 and early 1988 _ from his press
secretary and his communications director _warning Gore that he had
developed a record for stretching the truth.
</P>
<P>
   TRICKY AL?
</P>
<P>
   Stepping up his assault on Al Gore's honesty, Bill Bradley said
today the vice president speaks in a ``tricky'' way that misleads.
``When you listen to Al Gore speak, you have to listen very
carefully, you have to look at every word and every clause,''
Bradley said. ``Words can be used in a tricky manner.''
</P>
<P>
   C-SPAN'S GOT IT ALL, ALL THE TIME
</P>
<P>
   C-SPAN will provide live, comprehensive coverage of the New
Hampshire primary, the nation's first, both Monday and Tuesday. The
cable channel will be on the air for two hours beginning 11 p.m.
Monday to report the traditional first voting from Dixville Notch
and Hart's Location. On Tuesday, C-SPAN will televise from 7 p.m.
until midnight. But you don't have to wait that long: C-SPAN will
provide 50 consecutive hours of live New Hampshire coverage,
beginning at 8 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   THE UNKINDEST CUT OF ALL
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush said today that President Clinton's State of the
Union address shows that the president and John McCain ``agree on
the size of the tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not significant enough,'' Bush said of the $350 billion,
10-year tax cut proposed by Clinton. McCain has proposed a $237
billion, five-year reduction. Bush has proposed greater tax cuts _
$483 billion over five years _ but McCain says more money should be
used for reducing the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S GORE IN THE STRETCH, GOING AWAY
</P>
<P>
   New poll numbers have Al Gore pulling ahead of Bill Bradley in
New Hampshire. The Dartmouth College-Associated Press poll shows
Gore leading, 54 percent to 40 percent. It also shows Republicans
John McCain and George W. Bush in a virtual tie.
</P>
<P>
   IN BASKETBALL, THAT WOULD BE CALLED A TURNOVER
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, a Rhodes scholar, scored a 485 on his verbal SAT,
lower than the 566 earned on the same test by George W. Bush, a
graduate of both Yale and Harvard who has had to defend his
intellect. ``He's acknowledged that he was an affirmative action
case for getting into Princeton,'' said Bradley spokesman Eric
Hauser. But, ``There are few people. ... who would doubt his
intellectual capacity.'' Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said he
could not confirm the 566 score originally reported by New Yorker
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   PASSED BALL ON ENDORSEMENT
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, a former Texas Rangers part-owner, has picked up
another big league endorsement. Carleton Fisk, a Hall of Fame
catcher for the Red Sox and White Sox, said he's supporting Bush's
candidacy, but slipped in referring to him. He said ``Senator
George Bush.'' Bush replied that he'll ``accept the demotion.''
</P>
<P>
   PRAISING THE HOME STATE HEROS
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the New Hampshire Legislature, Alan Keyes, the only
black presidential candidate, paid homage to Daniel Webster, the
19th-century abolitionist senator and New Hampshire native. ``If
Webster had not spoken,'' Keyes said, ``Lincoln would not have
succeeded. The heritage here in New Hampshire is awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   YA GOTTA HAVE HEART _ BUT BRAINS, TOO
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer insisted that he won't follow Orrin Hatch's lead out
of the race, but the now-last place GOP candidate did acknowledge
that he's not detached from reality. Asked by ABC News if there
would be a point at which he could concede that the plan isn't
working, Bauer said, ``Well, I mean look, I'm not an idiot. You
don't have to hit me over the head with a 2-by-4 over and over
again. But I still think my message is the best message in the
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   FAR AND AWAY _ BY FAR
</P>
<P>
   As of today, John McCain has far and away spent more time in New
Hampshire than any other presidential candidate. He's been in the
Granite State 61 days; the second-place squatter is Bill Bradley,
at 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE'S THE `LIBERAL NEWS MEDIA' WHEN BUSH NEEDS IT?
</P>
<P>
   The Manchester Union Leader, New Hampshire's biggest and most
influential newspaper, dubbed George W. Bush ``Gov. Smirk,''
derided him for ``his smug attitude,'' and endorsed Steve Forbes
four days before the primary. The front-page editorial called Bush
``an empty suit'' and said it had become clear why Bush's
``handlers'' had kept his pre-primary appearances in New Hampshire
``to a minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   DON'T BLAME `PORK'
</P>
<P>
   During one of the early debates, George W. Bush inadvertently
offended a hog farmer. John McNutt, president of the National Pork
Producers Council, didn't appreciate Bush's remark about government
waste: ``To get rid of pork, quit feeding the hog.'' In a letter to
Bush last week, McNutt said the ``verbal quip,'' while intended to
refer to pork as waste, ``besmirches a wonderful, nutritious health
food.'' McNutt would like politicians to find another way to say it
_ like waste, or excess, or unnecessary spending.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S RIGHT OVER THERE, BY THE CIA BUILDING
</P>
<P>
   The sign off the Garden State Parkway announces that West
Orange, N.J., is home to Bill Bradley's national presidential
campaign headquarters. But just try finding it. The Bradley office
is well camouflaged. There is no sign in front of the
brown-shingled, two-story commercial building at 395 Pleasant
Valley Way. But look for a free-standing basketball hoop around
back; that's the first clue.
</P>
<P>
   ON AGAIN, OFF AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   A New York state judge threw John McCain out of the GOP primary
in eight of New York's congressional districts, just one day after
two Democratic election officials helped him stay there. Most state
GOP officials are supporting George W. Bush. In the challenged
districts, McCain did not have the required number of petition
signatures, but his campaign argued that the signature requirement
shouldn't apply to him since he is a valid presidential candidate.
Judge Joseph Cannizzaro called the signature requirements
``reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORKER IN, JERSEY GUY OUT
</P>
<P>
   The squabbling continues in another example of New York's arcane
presidential primary ballot laws. Donald Trump, who's not an
announced candidate, won the right to compete for Independence
Party backing _ New York's version of the Reform Party _ and Steve
Forbes lost his spot on the Republican ballot in three Long Island
congressional districts. Forbes is trying to retaliate by going to
court and having George W. Bush removed from the GOP ballot in six
New York City districts.
</P>
<P>
   A LITTLE TIGHTER HEAD TO HEAD
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has closed the gap against George W. Bush in a potential
presidential matchup, says a new NBC-Wall Street Journal poll. The
poll showed Bush at 47 percent, Gore at 44 percent. With a 3
percentage point margin of error, that puts them in a statistical
dead heat. In December, Bush led 50 percent to 39 percent. When
Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan was included in the mix, Gore
and Bush both were at 43 percent, with Buchanan at 5 percent. In
December, Bush led 50 percent to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   TIME TO SEND OUT THE TROOPS
</P>
<P>
   With four days to go until the New Hampshire primary, it all
comes down to field work. That's the unglamorous job of calling
voters, knocking on doors, dropping off campaign literature, and
getting people to the polls, even in the bitter cold and snow. ``It
could make a 2 to 5 percent swing in the final total,'' said Steve
Duprey, surveying polls showing races too close to call in both
parties' primaries.
</P>
<P>
   A CAMPAIGN COMING-OUT
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is boasting of having more openly gay potential
convention delegates in New York than Bill Bradley. The Gore camp
said that while its slate of delegates for the state's March 7
presidential primary includes 11 openly gay candidates, Bradley's
delegation had just five openly gay people. The Gore side later
ended up wearing some egg when state party officials said Bradley's
campaign reported having seven openly gay prospective delegates _
not five as Gore had claimed. See, the Bradley camp pounced, ``The
Al Gore campaign continues to distort the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   THE MORE THE MERRIER
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire secretary of state, William Gardner, estimated
that 191,000 Republican ballots and 160,000 Democratic ballots will
be cast next week, more votes than in any previous New Hampshire
primary. He based his figures on absentee ballots, conversations
with town clerks and a bit of guesswork. ``Usually when the economy
is good, people don't vote,'' he said, but added that the closeness
of the races in both parties is likely to counter that truism.
</P>
<P>
   LOCAL DECISIONS _ THAT'S FAMILY FOR YOU
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole told students and teachers at an elementary
school in Grand Rapids, Mich., that George W. Bush has the
character and experience to help Michigan families. ``You look at
his family and how devoted he is,'' she said of Bush, citing his
promises to cut taxes and improve education by allowing more
decisions to be made at the local level. ``He's going to be
thinking of every way he can help families.''
</P>
<P>
   BATTLE OVER BATTLE FLAG
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan says no one should be offended to see the
Confederate battle flag flying over a public building. ``This flag
flew over the battlefields; it never flew over the slave fields,''
Buchanan said this week on a fund-raising swing through Alabama. He
said one of his great-grandfathers died at Vicksburg, Miss.,
fighting for the Confederacy, and another was captured outside
Atlanta. The Confederate battle flag was removed from the Alabama
Capitol dome in Montgomery in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   HOPING TO TIP(PER) THE SCALES
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore, Al's wife, will begin her final swing through New
Hampshire on Saturday. She plans to attend a series of events with
activists and undecided voters.

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `ANY GIVEN SUNDAY,' starring Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Dennis
Quaid, James Woods and Jamie Foxx. Directed by Oliver Stone (R, 160
minutes). Stone's brawling, hyper-macho professional football film
has enough in-the-thick-of-it playing-field action to satisfy the
fantasies of most armchair players. In the style of Stone's ``Wall
Street,'' the movie is also a crude morality play that pits the old
ways against the new with the veteran coach Tony D'Amato (Pacino)
embodying tradition and a young hotshot quarterback, Willie Beamen
(Foxx), the new. Although the acting is uneven (Ms. Diaz is
disappointing as a tough team owner), and the final scenes are
shamelessly ``Rocky''-ish, the movie delivers a credible,
action-charged vision of the frenzied world of professional sports
as a metaphor for the volatility of American culture (Stephen
Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `BOYS DON'T CRY,' starring Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny.
Directed by Kimberly Peirce (R, 114 minutes). This stunning debut
feature tells the strange and resonant story of Brandon Teena, who
despite being born Teena Brandon went on to create a charismatic
identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately wrenching tale may
sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into Theodore Dreiser's
idea of American tragedy. The film makes it hauntingly real and
even tenderly romantic, with the astonishing acting needed to make
it work. One of last year's best (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE END OF THE AFFAIR,' starring Ralph Fiennes, Julianne Moore,
Stephen Rea and Ian Hart. Directed by Neil Jordan (R, 105 minutes).
Jordan's intoxicating version of Graham Greene's 1951 novel, in
which an illicit affair becomes a far greater gamble than either
lover could have imagined. For this fearlessly eclectic filmmaker,
this is one more intelligent, brooding love story with a secret
twist. Fiennes and Ms. Moore breathe life into it with a dreamy,
erotic intensity that in no way trivializes the film's underlying
ideas about religious faith. Period detail (the setting is London
in the mid-1940s) is sumptuously heightened by the inspired costume
designer Sandy Powell (``Shakespeare in Love'') (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `FANTASIA/2000,' with James Levine and the Chicago Symphony
Orchestra and introductions by Steve Martin, Bette Midler, Levine,
Itzhak Perlman, James Earl Jones, Angela Lansbury, Quincy Jones and
Penn and Teller. Various directors (G, 75 minutes). The new
millennial version of Disney's 1940 groundbreaking fusion of
animation and classical music includes seven new segments and keeps
one from the original film (the wonderful ``Sorcerer's
Apprentice,'' starring Mickey Mouse). Despite the science-fiction
title and the Imax-size screen on which it is shown,
``Fantasia/2000'' is more backward-looking than futuristic. The two
best segments are ``Rhapsody in Blue,'' a witty
Manhattan-in-the-Jazz-Age homage to the caricaturist Al Hirschfeld
set to the music of Gershwin, and the finale (set to Stravinsky's
``Firebird Suite'') in which a cometlike sprite whooshes around the
globe explosively creating, destroying and renewing the planet's
life forms. Celebrity introductions lend the film the feel of a
deluxe corporate promotion. (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `GIRL, INTERRUPTED,' starring Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie.
Directed by James Mangold (R, 120 minutes). Except for being
several years too old for the role, Winona Ryder, an actress who
oozes high-strung intelligence, is ideally cast as Susanna Kaysen,
a precollege-age girl who lands in a Cambridge mental institution
in 1967 after a halfhearted suicide attempt. (The movie is based on
Ms. Kaysen's memoir.) The period details are perfect, and Ms. Ryder
has the courage to make her character a pain in the neck. But the
small, introspective movie is nearly stolen by Ms. Jolie as a
charismatic, brutally truth-telling sociopath who becomes Susanna's
best friend (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE GREEN MILE,' starring Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan,
David Morse, Doug Hutchison, Sam Rockwell and Bonnie Hunt. Written
and directed by Frank Darabont (R, 180 minutes). In adapting the
death row drama that Stephen King wrote in multiple installments,
the director of ``The Shawshank Redemption'' could have managed
more economy and fewer talky bits of business around the cellblock.
Still, this lengthy film is vivid and well played. Smooth ensemble
acting builds up to the discovery that a gigantic condemned man
(Duncan) is a prisoner with very special abilities, which gives the
film its mixture of religious overtones and mild horror. Hanks, as
a wry Southern prison guard, is so unaffectedly good that it's
redundant to say so (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `HOLY SMOKE,' starring Kate Winslet and Harvey Keitel. Directed
by Jane Campion (R, 95 minutes). Having roamed so gorgeously
through North Africa as a young hippie mother in ``Hideous Kinky,''
Ms. Winslet this time appears in India as Ruth Barron, a headstrong
young Australian seeking enlightenment. Eventually Ruth's mother
coaxes her home, where a ``cult exiter'' named P.J. (Keitel) is
waiting to wean Ruth away from her Indian guru. But as the film
moves from its early mix of rapture and humor into this more
serious, confrontational stage, it runs into trouble. It doesn't
help that Ms. Winslet's obvious strength and beauty leave Keitel's
P.J. looking overmatched (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE HURRICANE,' starring Denzel Washington. Directed by Norman
Jewison (R, 120 minutes). The life story of Hurricane Carter, a
middleweight contender who spent nearly 20 years in prison for a
triple murder he didn't commit, is a big, schmaltzy ballad of a
movie redeemed by Washington's moving, bone-deep portrayal of the
boxer from Paterson, N.J. But the movie plays fast and loose with
the facts, giving far too much credit to the members of a Canadian
commune who took up Carter's cause and all but eliminating his
heroic co-defendant John Artis from the story. And the minor
characters are either saints or monsters. Yet the story of a man
heroically fighting his demons and winning his freedom is still
inspiring (Holden). &QL;

</P>
<P>
   `THE LIFE AND TIMES OF HANK GREENBERG,' directed by Aviva
Kempner (not rated, 90 minutes). This unabashed valentine to
baseball's Hall of Fame slugger demonstrates how little mankind and
some of its sports figures have advanced since the 1930s and '40s
and reminds us how the persistence of bigotry stains a nation
founded on ideals like religious tolerance. The '30s and '40s were
the heyday of Greenberg, a son of Jewish immigrants who came out of
the Bronx to star with the Detroit Tigers, threaten Babe Ruth's
home run record and become the first man to win Most Valuable
Player awards at two positions, first base and left field. In
blazing his trail into the Hall of Fame, the tall, handsome
Greenberg became a target of anti-Semites. But his stardom, his
innate decency, his work ethic and his World War II record made him
a beacon of hope to many Jews. Taken as a whole, the documentary is
faithful to its title, valuable as history and resonant with
meaning for today (Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   `MAGNOLIA,' starring Tom Cruise, Melinda Dillon, Philip Seymour
Hoffman, William H. Macy, Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly and Jason
Robards. Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (R, 180
minutes). In ``Magnolia'' the colossally talented Anderson has set
up an artfully orchestrated symphony of intersecting L.A. stories,
with many of the cast members from his ``Boogie Nights'' assembled
to form a charismatic ensemble. The movie is saved from its own
worst ideas by the intimacy of the performances. Its single biggest
surprise is Tom Cruise in the role of a strutting,
obscenity-spouting cult figure named Frank Mackey (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `PLAY IT TO THE BONE,' starring Woody Harrelson, Antonio
Banderas and Lolita Davidovich. Directed by Ron Shelton (R, 124
minutes). This screwball sports comedy stars Harrelson and Banderas
as fading middleweight boxers and best friends summoned at the last
minute to fight each other as the opening act for a Las Vegas
heavyweight bout. The formulaic road movie follows them with their
pal and mutual ex-girlfriend (Ms. Davidovich) on their wisecracking
way from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, where they fight a brutal match.
The dialogue has sass, and the filmmaker's jaundiced vision of the
professional boxing world is very knowing, but the relationships
don't track (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `STUART LITTLE,' starring Geena Davis, Hugh Laurie and Jonathan
Lipnicki. Directed by Rob Minkoff (PG, 92 minutes). E.B. White's
1945 children's classic has been adapted into a lovely family film
about a little mouse (with the voice of Michael J. Fox) who is
adopted by humans but runs afoul of their fluffy white Persian cat,
Snowbell (Nathan Lane). The movie creates an enchanted storybook
version of New York and has what may be the most exciting toy-boat
race (in Central Park) ever filmed. Thanks to Lane's sly, wise-guy
vocal impersonation, Snowbell nearly steals a movie that is funny
and sweet but never cloying (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY,' starring Matt Damon, Jude Law,
Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Written
and directed by Anthony Minghella (R, 135 minutes). There are
diabolically smart surprises wherever you care to look in this
glittering thriller. Proving that the brilliance of ``The English
Patient'' was no fluke, Minghella shapes a hypnotic, sensually
charged adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's fascinatingly reptilian
murder story. The traffic-stopping cast includes Damon as the
dangerous chameleon of the title and, in a star-making role, the
English actor Jude Law as a rich dilettante who exerts a homoerotic
magnetism. Ms. Paltrow plays the odd woman out with the shrewdness
of a fine character actress, while Ms. Blanchett makes the
delirious most of her role as a needy American post-debutante. As
the story's odious playboy-snob, Hoffman is scene-stealingly
wonderful. Gorgeously photographed in Italy by John Seale (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TITUS,' starring Anthony Hopkins, Jessica Lange, Alan Cumming,
Harry Lennix and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Directed by Julie Taymor (R,
160 minutes). Ms. Taymor, the theater director and puppeteer who
created transfixing stage pictures in ``The Lion King'' and ``Juan
Darien,'' has turned Shakespeare's goriest tragedy, ``Titus
Andronicus,'' into a powerful contemplation of murderous revenge
enacted throughout history. Hopkins is ghoulishly funny and tragic
as the title character, whose political stupidity sets in motion a
devastating chain reaction of killing, torture and retaliation. Ms.
Lange is Tamora, the captured Goth empress who strikes back.
Although the movie's British theatrical and American film acting
styles don't mesh, Ms. Taymor's vision is realized with a
shattering force in time-traveling imagery that blends ancient Rome
with Mussolini's Italy and contemporary cyberpunk flash (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `TOPSY-TURVY,' starring Allan Corduner and Jim Broadbent.
Directed by Mike Leigh (R, 161 minutes). Leigh's grandly
entertaining ``Topsy-Turvy'' is one of those films that create a
mix of erudition, pageantry and delectable acting opportunities,
much as ``Shakespeare in Love'' did last year. Instead of a
love-struck young playwright, it presents the curiously matched
personalities of the librettist William Schwenk Gilbert and the
composer Arthur Sullivan in the midst of a robust, knowing,
frequently hilarious look at the musical theater over which they
held sway (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   FILM SERIES:
</P>
<P>
   `THE AMERICAN PLACE: LANDSCAPE IN THE EARLY WESTERN (AND A FEW
LATER CLASSICS).' An opportunity for a new look at the Old West is

by  &UR; The Kansas City Star &LR;  about AIDS in the Roman Catholic
priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   The Star's series, starting Sunday, will report that hundreds of
priests nationwide have died of AIDS and that hundreds more are
living with the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's installment will focus on a seminary in Missouri. Seven
of the 26 young men in the classes of 1967 and '68 were finally
ordained and of those, three eventually died of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In the final part, for Tuesday papers, The Star examines the
policies of the Catholic church, where the subject of a priest with
AIDS is so sensitive that it has yet to be fully addressed. Critics
suggest that the church should encourage more understanding of
sexuality and less secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   One reporter at The Star researched the entire series. The
reporter, Judy Thomas, began looking into AIDS in the priesthood
more than four years ago. She examined scores of death certificates
and church documents and interviewed hundreds of priests, church
officials and AIDS experts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thomas also visited a sex education school for priests in
Maryland and an AIDS hospice in Florida. The Star also conducted a
special survey of 3,000 priests to get their opinions on AIDs,
homosexuality and sex education.
</P>
<P>
   The three articles of about 1,200 words each will move today and
Saturday, with the slugs PRIEST-I, -II and -III, embargoed for use
in Sunday papers and thereafter.

 &HT;    CLINTON'S PROMISES PEGGED AT $1 TRILLION
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's State of the Union promises add
up to more than $1 trillion over the next decade and threaten to
soak up government surpluses, a private watchdog group said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For the coming year alone, Clinton's proposals would cost $140
billion, the National Taxpayers Union Foundation concluded in an
item-by-item tally from the Thursday night address.
</P>
<P>
   The highest costs for next year, about $38 billion, would be for
propping up Medicare and expanding federal health care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Without tax hikes and spending cuts elsewhere, the plan would
not only break existing spending caps for federal programs but
would ``dip into the so-called Social Security trust fund
surpluses,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Minarik, an economist at the White House budget office,
challenged that prediction at a forum Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should not think you take last year's budget and tack
the new things on it,'' he told a gathering at the Economic
Strategy Institute. The president's 2001 budget outline, to be
released Feb. 7, would show some cuts and tax adjustments, he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, William Hoagland, the senior staff member of the Senate
Budget Committee, concurred with the Taxpayers Union's findings.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton programs would spend all of the projected surpluses,
except for those in the Social Security trust fund, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Hoagland scoffed at Clinton's promise to eliminate the
government's publicly held federal debt by the year 2013.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big deal,'' the budget aide said. He said that that the
Congressional Budget Office has projected that the soaring
surpluses in Social Security will be enough to retire all of the
publicly held debt by 2012.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gross debt will continue to increase,'' he warned, because
the government will have growing liabilities for future pensions
and Social Security retirees.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Hoagland conceded that the Republican-led
Congress was also abandoning thriftiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to live by the (spending) caps,'' Hoagland
said. ``We have shown we won't do that.''

<P>
   LONDON _ Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the Irish
Republican Army's political wing, has ruled out the possibility
that the underground paramilitary force will move to meet a crucial
deadline Monday for the beginning of disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech on Thursday night that appeared to acknowledge the
setback his statement would represent for the Northern Ireland
peace settlement and the future of the fragile new government in
Belfast, Adams said that while he understood the broad wish for
immediate action, ``It is not easy to get the IRA, or indeed any of
the armed groups, to do this speedily. This is the reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday is the day that Gen. John de Chastelain, a Canadian who
leads the independent international panel overseeing the peace
accord, is scheduled to issue a progress report. There had been
widespread anticipation that he would be able to offer evidence of
IRA cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of Sinn Fein, Mitchel McLaughlin, Friday called
these hopes ``over-hyped expectations,'' and the Press Association,
Britain's domestic news agency, said security sources confirmed
that the IRA had told the general that no move on weapons was
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   A report of no progress will likely bring about the shutdown of
the two-month-old Northern Ireland Assembly, either through the
promised resignations of the leaders of its dominant party, the
Ulster Unionists, or a decision by the British government to
reimpose direct rule of Ulster from London.
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, the leader of the Ulster Unionists and the first
minister of the new Legislature, was able to persuade his
quarrelsome party to enter government with Sinn Fein in November
only by pledging that he and the other party members in the
Assembly leadership would step down if there was not sufficient
evidence by February of the IRA's willingness to put its arms out
of use.
</P>
<P>
   Even with that safety catch, he obtained only 58 percent backing
from his 860-member party council for entering the government with
Sinn Fein before any disarmament began.
</P>
<P>
   Many members of his party harshly criticized his decision to
abandon the long-held unionist ``no guns, no government''
disarmament demand, and he would have little chance of gaining
support for continued Ulster Unionist participation now in the
absence of any matching IRA move on arms.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists are in no mood to be conciliatory after the
British government announced last week that it planned to
reconstitute the Northern Ireland police force and retire its Royal
Ulster Constabulary name, which Protestants cherish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unionists have been stretched to and beyond limit after limit
after limit,'' Sir Reg Empey, a senior party member, said Friday.
``Our patience is completely exhausted in this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Unionists draw support from the Protestant majority who want to
keep the province part of Britain, while republicans, most of whom
are Catholic, represent those wanting to see Ulster establish
stronger links with Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   In the continual seesawing of power and favor in the politics of
Northern Ireland, it is the unionists who now feel they have been
making the most concessions and that it is time for the republicans
to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Since Trimble's bold gamble in November, unionists' frustrations
have been given a more sympathetic hearing in places like Dublin,
Washington, London and Belfast, where their resistance in the past
was more often characterized as obdurate nay-saying.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble has scheduled a vote of his party in Belfast on Feb. 12,
but the British government might act to suspend the home rule
government before then, rather than see him put his leadership at
obvious risk. Trimble has been a moderating force in the unionist
camp, keeping his party engaged in the crisis-ridden peace
settlement process in the face of strong opposition from associates
who have been against the accord from its original signing in
April, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson Friday appealed for
people to keep ``cool heads'' and said he would base his own
actions on Monday's report. ``If it reveals that decommissioning is
still on track, I will be guided by that,'' he said. ``If we are
going backwards in the process, I will draw the obvious
conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson has said he would suspend the assembly if the terms of
the review of the peace accord conducted last fall by George
Mitchell, the former U.S. senator, are not being met. The unionists
believe the Mitchell terms call for a start to disarmament by now.
</P>
<P>
   Seamus Mallon, a leading official of the province's largest
Catholic party, the Social Democratic and Labor Party, agreed,
saying: ``This is a time of choice for the republican movement. It
cannot continue to claim to act on behalf of the people of Ireland
while defying their clearly expressed will that decommissioning
happen now.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argue that the only deadline for disarming is the
May 2000 date in the original peace settlement. Adams, in his
remarks delivered Thursday night at the opening of a new Sinn Fein
branch in Newry on the Irish border, said it was ``a fundamental
mistake in strategy to try and force decommissioning.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to steer blame for a failure now away from his party, he
argued, ``The achievement of this objective has been set back by
the way it is be used as a political football by unionists at this
time.''

'BRACERO' WORK PROGRAM IS SHORTHAND FOR 'CHEAP' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By O. RICARDO PIMENTEL  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - A guest-worker program, it's argued, is a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   Economic sectors such as agriculture, hotels and restaurants
have jobs in want of workers. Mexican workers, of course, have been
running the border gantlet to find any work, illegally and at great
risk to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Let's return to some semblance of the Bracero program, folks
say, but this time we'll monitor and regulate it to prevent the
type of mistreatment workers suffered in that program's heyday,
1942 to 1964.
</P>
<P>
   High-ranking Mexican officials are nodding their heads in
agreement. Southwest governors _ including Arizona Gov. Jane Hull,
but absent California's governor _ have pushed the idea hard.
Several members of Congress have also championed the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Win-win, right? So why does this feel so very unsettling?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe because some folks have an aversion to formalizing what
amounts to a feudal relationship with a neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because it says outright what many have suspected was
running through people's heads all along. The program's message to
Mexicans: ``You're good enough to work here, to make us richer, pay
our taxes and to keep our goods and services affordable, but not
worthy to live here. Oh, and your families, particularly your kids,
they're just leeches.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because the operative word in this magic-bullet
solution is ``cheap,'' as in ``cheap labor''.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, maybe it's because after all is said and done, all
special interests taken care of, all cautionary language included
to avoid abuse and damage to domestic industry and workers, all
appropriate types of businesses anointed, it's quite likely this
sucker just won't work.
</P>
<P>
   We might just create a guest-worker program and still have
illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's approval is easy to understand. A steady, guaranteed
and reliable stream of dollars into Mexico is always welcome. A
guarantee of good working conditions for its citizens working here
is highly attractive. And, of course, the flight of workers would
continue to serve as a safety valve until Mexico can get its own
economic house in order.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing venal, either, about the desire of our own
governor and others for the program.
</P>
<P>
   Illegal immigration has long been a divisive issue in the
Southwest. This program offers the potential for quieting various
groups and, in the eyes of many, can be viewed as a humanitarian
effort to help poor Mexican workers and struggling domestic
industries both. Most hearts, I have no doubt, are in the right
places.
</P>
<P>
   But from this vantage point, there are perils aplenty, not the
least of which is the message.
</P>
<P>
   It's long been a suspicion in some quarters that we have a
wink-wink immigration policy. You know, wink-wink, we hate those
illegal immigrants, but isn't it grand our produce and services are
so ``affordable.''
</P>
<P>
   A guest-worker program says, yep, it's true and that's why we've
concentrated enforcement at the border and not in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, you've got to worry about the long-term effects of
creating a guaranteed low-paid, permanent, economic underclass.
These folks will be well outside the mainstream, different and here
merely to serve. Assimilation will cease to be a societal goal for
this particular immigrant class and will, in fact, be viewed as
counter-productive.
</P>
<P>
   Also, even now, businesses howl when anyone mentions the
possibility of trying to make the minimum wage a living wage. With
a guaranteed flow of workers here pleased as punch with the
pittance now paid _ because, as many have noted, they will still
earn more in an hour than they can earn in a day in Mexico _ where
will the pressure come for those periodic minimum-wage increases
that now occur?
</P>
<P>
   Will the domestic poor who fill some of these jobs simply go
away?
</P>
<P>
   And what do we tell the United Farmworkers Union and others
about longtime efforts to improve wages and working conditions for
domestic farmworkers? Agribusiness might love this program, but
Cesar Chavez is certainly rolling in his grave.
</P>
<P>
   The raucous protesters at the World Trade Organization meeting
in Seattle got the problem only about half right. They railed
against U.S. companies exporting jobs to keep costs down and
profits up without realizing that companies, under a guest-worker
program, will also be able to import workers and accomplish the
same thing. Workers as widgets. Ain't globalization grand?
</P>
<P>
   To say that we should have misgivings about a guest-worker
program is an understatement. &QL;

REACHING OUT TO LATINOS COULD HELP CHANGE GOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By O. RICARDO PIMENTEL  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The GOP is trying to attract Latino votes.
</P>
<P>
   And this a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   There are likely Latino Democrats out their right now shaking
heads and proclaiming that they'll switch when Lucifer needs a snow
blower.
</P>
<P>
   But, think about it, this is a very good thing even if you're a
die-hard Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Every institution that has broadened itself has been made
better, though not everyone will agree with this assessment.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing because it signals growing recognition -
finally - that Latinos are not some permanently encamped, foreign
occupying army. Latinos are simply potential voters, folks who
work, pay taxes, send their kids to school and go to church.
</P>
<P>
   It's good because it likely means the end for the forseeable
future of the sway social conservatives have had with the party of
Lincoln. Even the unusually thick Pat Buchanan has gotten the
message. He's unwelcome in the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   I'll take George W. Bush speaking accented Spanish any day over
a Buchanan wearing a sombrero and declaring war on ``Ho-zay.''
</P>
<P>
   It's good because a party that is more than just superficially
inclusive cannot ever go back to exclusivity.
</P>
<P>
   And this means how the party thinks could change as well.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean that we'll see a Contract with America from
the GOP that includes union feather-bedding language and day-care
centers in every pot.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos will be attracted for all the same reasons they are
attracted now. The difference will be that they will be more
comfortable with the attraction if the party continues to eschew
the language of division and scapegoating.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that there has always been a strong centrist streak
among Latinos, as many uncomfortable with a welfare state as were
with Reagan's characterization of recipients as welfare Cadillac
queens.
</P>
<P>
   Work hard and the rewards will come. Work hard, and even if
there are no grand rewards, you'll feel better for it. These are
the credos among the Latinos I know.
</P>
<P>
   These credos are good fits with moderate Republicanism,
particularly if the language of moderate Republicanism becomes
increasingly couched, as it has been, in terms like caring,
building community and - most important - helping the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   It is the language Bush and, to a lesser extent, John McCain are
employing.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Republicans, Democrats have been speaking the
language longer, are more fluent and have some claim to a track
record, even if the Nixon Administration was more progressive than
folks give it credit for.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos and others will undoubtedly be attracted by the language
of caring employed by GOP candidates. Many will get under the
so-called Big Tent.
</P>
<P>
   But, they should stay only if they see that such phrases as
``compassionate conservatism'' actually mean something. I suspect
that given the chance, they will work hard to make it mean
something more. As a concept, it has a lot of potential.
</P>
<P>
   This is part of what I mean when I say Latino Republicans could
change the party if their numbers become large enough.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Latinos should advance with eyes open. They should
not be fooled by simplistic blather about economic prosperity,
smaller government and tax-cuts-for-tax-cuts-sake as the panacea
for all ills.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos have seen their boats go significantly unlifted in what
folks say have been rising economic tides. They have seen
government play a positive role in what advancements have been
made. And, while being able to keep more dollars in the pocket is
always attractive, Latinos need to ask GOP candidates to first make
the case that tax cuts are as sorely needed as they make out.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities know better than anyone else that tax cuts have a
price, if only in what goes unfunded.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, however, this GOP outreach can't help but help the
party and the country. To have two parties talk of caring can't be
all bad even if they differ on how to get there.
</P>
<P>
   I'm puzzled, however, by what appears to be a rush to air
Spanish-language political ads in Arizona and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Last time the U.S. Census looked, the percentage of Latinos in
Arizona who speak only Spanish amounted to about 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This outreach appears to be more symbolic than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Telling us what compassionate conservatism means, in English,
would be far more useful. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Though you have to pass a metal detector to reach her
grim cinder block headquarters, a former darkroom at the High
School of Graphic Communication Arts on West 49th Street, Lt. Helen
Rossi, the hard-talking matriarch of New York City's truancy task
force, is a romantic at heart.
</P>
<P>
   The lipstick, eyeliner and hennaed hair (after she's happily
liberated it from her no-nonsense police cap) hint at it. So do the
diamond rings that decorate four of her fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody tries to steal my rings, I'll shoot 'em,'' she snarls.
But she doesn't mean it. Ms. Rossi, a 28-year member of the New
York Police Department and an icon in her specialty, truant
adolescents, has never once fired her weapon in the line of duty.
``Not ever,'' she emphasizes, knocking on the pocked wood of the
school desk that doubles as her desk. ``I don't even use handcuffs
unless I have to. I'm not about harassing kids. I'm about getting
them off the streets before they become crime victims themselves or
get involved in one.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, she's confiscated her share of guns and knives from the
hooky players she's corralled since her post was created in 1983 in
the bad old days when Times Square resembled Sodom and Gomorrah
instead of a Disney playground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then we were carting off 50 kids a day,'' she says of the
part she plays in a city where some 65,000 of its 1.1 million
students _ 35,000 of them high schoolers _ are classified each year
as truant. ``Back then 42nd Street was scuzzy, and scuzz drew
scuzz. These kids were buying drugs, getting preyed on by the
pedophiles and scavengers. I had one girl bite me in the leg, right
through my pants and socks, when we tried to drag her out of an
arcade,'' recalls Ms. Rossi, who got a tetanus shot, reported back
to work, and hoped the puncture wouldn't cramp the style of her
alter ego, an amateur ballroom dancer who once captured an East
Coast title. Now that's romantic.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rossi's truants tend to come in two varieties, criers and
cursers, but all fib with alacrity when explaining their presence
in Times Square on a school day. The lieutenant's Top 10 list of
excuses offered up by the legions of school skippers she has
``busted'' borders on the Lettermanesque.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll tell me they overslept, that they're suspended, that
they fell asleep on the subway train or the bus, that their school
is closed for the day, that they're sick, that they have a half
day...oh, boy, sometimes I get tired of the kids,'' she says. But
she's never asked for a change of assignment: ``The times you get
rewards from this job are the times you feel like you put the
pieces back together _ a family, a kid, a school. It happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately there are fewer truants, perhaps 20 to 30 a day, and 75
percent of them hail from beyond Manhattan: They are, in a sense,
tourist truants, sneaking in for a taste of the MTV studio, the
Virgin Megastore or the task force's new nemesis, the WWF New York
cafe, where just last week Ms. Rossi collared several as they
pestered ``the Rock'' in hopes of getting the professional wrestler
to exercise his biceps and give them an autograph. When bands like
'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys attract hundreds of kids to the
sidewalk outside MTV, Ms. Rossi and her crew of five don't bother
culling truants: too hopeless a task, and too dangerous. ``We'd
start a riot,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're getting a different kind of child,'' she says.
``These kids have cell phones, beepers, $150 Air Jordan sneakers,
platinum cards, the whole nine yards. They think they know
everything. Sometimes I think we're losing a whole generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully my kids would never do anything like this,'' she
says, adding, ``I was never big on truancy. I didn't do it and
neither should they.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rossi, a petite 53-year-old mother of two daughters, 15 and
11 and ensconced in Catholic school, lives in Queens with her
husband, Anthony, a bartender. She has never taken her gun home
from work. ``No guns in my house,'' says Ms. Rossi, who finds them
offensive to the romantic within and also does not want them around
her children.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents met in England during World War II in a variation on
those nurse-brings-soldier-back-to-health fairy tales. They married
in London and emigrated to Queens to open a ski shop when she was 1
year old. Just thinking about it makes her heart, well hidden
beneath the bulletproof vest her line of work demands, do a little
jig.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a great love story,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   When, after dating an officer who died in 1969, she joined the
NYPD in 1973, the first year the academy permitted women to
graduate as actual patrol officers rather than matrons, her role
model was Angie Dickinson from television's ``Policewoman'' series.
The job didn't turn out to be as romantic, or dramatic, as Ms.
Dickinson's scripts suggested, but Ms. Rossi isn't complaining.
That's bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   She adopted 13 as her lucky number because she was so happy in
her first 13 years on the force at the 13th Precinct on 21st
Street; was promoted to sergeant on a Friday the 13th; wore the
numeral 1313 on her shield, and tried to have her daughter's birth
by Cesarean section scheduled for the 13th. If it is the 13th, she
tackles the lottery. The day she rounds up just 13 kids instead of
the usual two dozen will be a lucky one, too.

   MARTHA'S-VINEYARD (Undated) _ This time of year, when the
interminable tourist season has gasped its last breath, and
retailers on this island seven miles off Cape Cod have squeezed the
last dollar out of visitors, residents like to ``get off the
rock,'' as they say. And where do many of them go? To the Bahamas,
Caymans, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica, Bequia, Iceland, the Azores,

   SUNDANCE-PARTIES (Park City Utah) _ So intense is the
socializing at the 10-day Sundance independent film festival that

networking and deal-making, can sometimes seem more important than

   GIFT-BAGS (Undated) _ The gift bag, aka the goody bag, was once
a simple token of thanks handed out at the end of a party. Remember
the favors looted from a friend's birthday in second grade?
Balloons! A Milky Way. Oh, happy day! But lately, whether at a
charity benefit, a movie premiere or a store opening, guests are
getting, even demanding, gift bags crammed with a mother lode of

should be planting the seeds right now. Outside, mind you. ``They
like cold,'' said Robert Nold, who grows 200 different species in
his Denver garden. ``Cold breaks down the germination inhibitors in
the seed.'' Nold is the author of a dangerous book called
``Penstemons,'' just published by Timber Press ($30), that through
its wry prose and the photographs and beautiful watercolor plates
may dare even the most levelheaded gardener to grow these
drought-tolerant natives. By Anne Raver. &QL;

PONTIAC'S SUNFIRE CONVERTIBLE LOOKS AS GOOD AS IT RUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Convertibles are great. I'm a big fan, having owned
several, and always glad to find one in my driveway for a road
test.
</P>
<P>
   The little Pontiac Sunfire is no exception. Usually a fairly
run-of-the-mill subcompact, generally an economic trade-off, the
Sunfire is enhanced immeasurably by its folding top.
</P>
<P>
   As a convertible, the Sunfire (and its Chevy clone, Cavalier)
becomes more sporting and more exciting than its coupe or sedan
brethren. Add to that an upgraded engine, GT suspension and a
face-lifted exterior for 2000, and the Sunfire looks like a lot of
driving fun for $21,000.
</P>
<P>
   The convertible top on the Sunfire is a slick piece of work. A
single handle is ingeniously used to unlatch the top from the
windshield and, pulling the handle back, to operate the mechanism
that folds the top down. Move the handle forward, and the top comes
up again.
</P>
<P>
   Once the top is down, someone has to get out to fasten the
tonneau cover to conceal the folded canvas. The top sits up rather
high behind the rear seat, but because it stays above the body
rather than dropping down inside, the trunk is still full-size.
</P>
<P>
   The convertible version of the Sunfire comes only as the sporty
GT, a cut above the standard-issue Sunfire. Like the Cavalier Z24
coupe reviewed weeks back, the Sunfire GT boasts a powerful
twin-cam four-banger instead of the 115-horse standard engine.
</P>
<P>
   With a five-speed stick shift, made by German manufacturer
Getrag, the Sunfire will get frisky, though hard acceleration is
accompanied by a harsh roar from the engine. Compared with the
slick four-cylinder engines in the Honda Civic, Ford Focus or
Volkswagen Jetta, the Pontiac's mill feels agricultural.
</P>
<P>
   The convertible doesn't get the fat performance tires on 16-inch
rims that are standard on the GT coupe, but on its 15-inch touring
tires, the Sunfire still feels responsive and sure-footed.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension is better controlled than the Cavalier's, but
steering and handling are still a step behind Civic, Focus or
Jetta. The dashboard jutters and vibrates over rough roads.
</P>
<P>
   Exterior styling has been updated, and the front of the Sunfire
convertible bristles with pods for fog lights and turn signals,
which gives it a fiercer appearance than warranted. This is a car
designed with young people in mind, particularly young women, and
the look is as important as the performance.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is not spacious, but not too bad for a small car.
The back seat is actually usable, a definite plus for a small
convertible. The seats offer little support, though they are better
than the Cavalier's. Switches and gauges are clear and simple.
</P>
<P>
   The test car came fully loaded, with the price lower than the
list price because the stick shift is cheaper than the automatic.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunfire convertible may not be the most sophisticated car on
campus, but it's a fun machine, and one of the cheapest top-down
rides out there. &QL;

<P>
   LONDON _ Mike Tyson arrived in England a week ago a convicted
rapist and notorious ear biter.
</P>
<P>
   He will leave a hero in the eyes of many, much to the chagrin of
the legion of critics who condemned the boxer's visit as an affront
to women and an insult the national sense of decency.
</P>
<P>
   The business part of Tyson's trip _ a match Saturday night
against British heavyweight champion Julius Francis _ is expected
to provide the heavily favored Tyson a paycheck of more than US$13
million.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another part, a tourist part, that has evolved into
an interesting subplot that has been dubbed mockingly ``Tyson's
charm offensive.'' With this, the 33-year-old fighter seems to
battling for something more elusive: retribution.
</P>
<P>
   Each morning, the newspapers have carried front-page stories
detailing the wanderings of Tyson, dubbed by the Evening Standard
as England's ``most shameful tourist'' _ and his menacing looking
entourage. Team Tyson has visited the shimmering jewelry cases of
Harrod's department store, the elegant greens of Hyde Park _ where
Tyson was busted for illegal jogging _ and the poor London
neighborhood of Brixton.
</P>
<P>
   The Brixton visit typified the parallel-universe quality of the
Tyson's tour: While city officials angrily condemned Tyson, the
neighborhood welcomed him rapturously. His triumph was compared to
visits by Muhammad Ali, Nelson Mandela and the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   In Manchester, the site of the fight, thousands of supporters
crowded outside his hotel Friday paying no mind to the City
Council's resolution saying that Tyson is unwelcome. The fight's
21,000 tickets were sold out immediately and the fight's promoter
said he could easily have sold 60,000.
</P>
<P>
   On television at night are scenes of children sitting wide-eyed
ringside at Tyson's workouts. After one session, the boxer waded
into the sea of fans for 25 minutes. He signed autographs, posed
for snapshots, got on his knees to shadow box and feigned a
knockout blow or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what anybody says about me,'' Tyson told the
adoring onlookers. ``I'm a totally different entity to what people
think.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelly Finkel, Tyson's advisor, told reporters that England was
seeing the real Mike Tyson. ``None of this is put on, this is just
his other side,'' Finkel said. ``This is the side of him that
doesn't get shown enough. He loves kids. When I went with him to
the hospitals in Phoenix and reporters were there he kicked them
out. He didn't want it as publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Tyson conceded during one interview that he would never be
regarded among the greats such as Ali because of he has been
``stigmatized by the world press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care no more,'' he said. ``There's nothing to lose,
and nothing to hide, and nothing to show to anybody. I just have
too much pain and hatred in my heart to really care what anyone
thinks about me. The only thing I have to do is love kids, and make
sure they have a better life than what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the seemingly non-stop adulation, many remained
uncharmed. Actress-turned-politician Glenda Jackson expressed shock
that Tony Blair's government would allow Tyson to enter the country
despite his 1992 rape conviction. Officials said they had no legal
basis for denying Tyson entry.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Jackson, a candidate for London mayor, didn't
relent in her criticism. ``It would be very good if Tyson were
thrown out of the country,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Irene Murray, a spokeswoman for the Rape Crisis Federation, also
was outraged that Tyson was allowed into the country. ``We have
been inundated by calls from rape victims who have found Tyson's
presence very traumatic,'' Murray said. ``Promoter Frank Warren
compared him the other day to Muhammad Ali. Tyson isn't a hero like
Ali _ he is a revolting rapist.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers have been relentless in their attacks.
</P>
<P>
   At midweek, the Tyson camp struck back, labeling the attacks as
racist.
</P>
<P>
   Warren, the fight's promoter, singled out the Evening Standard
and its editor, Max Hasting. ``The Evening Standard has run a
campaign here which borders on racism this last week, saying Mike
Tyson shouldn't be in this country and to say his people should not
be in this hotel,'' Warren said. ``It's the most disgraceful form
of racism.''
</P>
<P>
   In his response, Hastings showed no remorse: ``Mike Tyson is a
man with a ghastly record of violence,'' the editor said. ``The
fact he happens to be black has nothing to do with the case, unless
Frank Warren wants to make an excuse for Tyson's record.''
</P>
<P>
   People on the streets seemed either unconcerned about Tyson's
violent past or willing to forgive. Mark Lester, a white
28-year-old unemployed sports fan who was in Brixton to welcome
him, defended Tyson. ``Mike is a really nice guy who has done wrong
in the past but served his time.''
</P>
<P>
   The broad acceptance _ and forgiveness _ of Tyson in Britain has
moved the fighter to hint that he may make it his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sad, but I feel like a stranger in my own country,'' he
said after a training session in London. ``I feel more at home here
than I do at home.''

A NIGHT OUT WITH THE EMERSON STRING QUARTET  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 30) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af)

   NEW YORK _ What a party this is _ this is fantastic,'' said
David Finckel, the Emerson String Quartet's cellist, as he surveyed
the crowd of Columbia University students eating pizza and drinking
beer with natural collegiate aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   The incongruous scene on Thursday night at the Miller Theater at
Columbia _ a classical music concert that resembled a fraternity
party _ was no accident. The Emerson, which has won four Grammys,
was there to perform and discuss the Shostakovich quartets as part
of Deutsche Grammophon's 20/21 program, in an initiative to make
classical music hip on campus.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second event the record label had sponsored at
Columbia, enticing students to attend a concert with free
admission, food and drink. The event was also a promotion for the
quartet's new five-disc Shostakovich boxed set and for its concert
series at Lincoln Center next month.
</P>
<P>
   But while the goal was to give classical a cool makeover, the
evening started out as more serious than festive. Though the
Emersons dressed more casually than their usual black tie, they sat
solemnly on stage in front of a giant picture of a dour,
bespectacled Shostakovich.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 Shostakovich quartets are commonly regarded as haunting
sonic portraits of 20th-century Soviet life. Between excerpts,
George Steel, the Miller Theater's executive director, and Albert
Imperato, the marketing director of the 21C Media Group, gave a
running commentary on the music.
</P>
<P>
   Their interjections ranged from the glibly hip (``Stalin's still
alive, and he's living on Houston Street'') to the colorfully
metaphoric (``These staccato notes are like a ballet dancer in
hiking boots, who had a bit too much porridge that morning'').
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the crowd of about 550 was quieter and seemed more
engrossed than the silver-haired regulars at a typical Emerson
event.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the quartet signed autographs and mingled with
friends. There were more nose rings than one usually finds at a
classical concert. ``This may be the future,'' Lawrence Dutton, the
quartet's violist, said with a hint of uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the students lightly carried the burden of their
new roles as the guardians of an art form that some say is dying.
Asked why he came, Andrew Wan, an economics-philosophy major with a
Sierra Nevada beer in his hand, simply belched, and then added, ``I
live right next door.''

   Once the autographs were signed, the quartet did not linger.
With a group of about 20 friends and fans, they piled into taxis to
travel south. The distance was a mere eight blocks. The frigid air
could damage their instruments, they explained.

   During the cab ride, Finckel and his wife, the pianist Wu Han,
joked about Yo-Yo Ma's forgetting his cello in a New York taxi last
fall. ``I left mine in a hardware store once,'' Finckel said with
mock pride. ``But I didn't make it into the papers.''

   The destination was Dalia's, a tapas bar that opened last

<P>
   Eugene Drucker, one of the violinists, had gone home, and Philip
Setzer, the other violinist, gesticulated by the bar with a drink
in one hand, calmly explaining the pathos behind Shostakovich's
music.

 &HT;    AS HE READIES FOR FIGHT, TYSON SHRUGS OFF ATTACKS, SOAK UP
ADULATION IN BRITAIN

<P>
   LONDON _ Mike Tyson arrived in England a week ago a convicted
rapist and notorious ear biter.
</P>
<P>
   He will leave a hero in the eyes of many, much to the chagrin of
the legion of critics who condemned the boxer's visit as an affront
to women and an insult the national sense of decency.
</P>
<P>
   The business part of Tyson's trip _ a match Saturday night
against British heavyweight champion Julius Francis _ is expected
to provide the heavily favored Tyson a paycheck of more than US$13
million.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another part, a tourist part, that has evolved into
an interesting subplot that has been dubbed mockingly ``Tyson's
charm offensive.'' With this, the 33-year-old fighter seems to
battling for something more elusive: retribution.
</P>
<P>
   Each morning, the newspapers have carried front-page stories
detailing the wanderings of Tyson, dubbed by the Evening Standard
as England's ``most shameful tourist'' _ and his menacing looking
entourage. Team Tyson has visited the shimmering jewelry cases of
Harrod's department store, the elegant greens of Hyde Park _ where
Tyson was busted for illegal jogging _ and the poor London
neighborhood of Brixton.
</P>
<P>
   The Brixton visit typified the parallel-universe quality of the
Tyson's tour: While city officials angrily condemned Tyson, the
neighborhood welcomed him rapturously. His triumph was compared to
visits by Muhammad Ali, Nelson Mandela and the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   In Manchester, the site of the fight, thousands of supporters
crowded outside his hotel Friday paying no mind to the City
Council's resolution saying that Tyson is unwelcome. The fight's
21,000 tickets were sold out immediately and the fight's promoter
said he could easily have sold 60,000.
</P>
<P>
   On television at night are scenes of children sitting wide-eyed
ringside at Tyson's workouts. After one session, the boxer waded
into the sea of fans for 25 minutes. He signed autographs, posed
for snapshots, got on his knees to shadow box and feigned a
knockout blow or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what anybody says about me,'' Tyson told the
adoring onlookers. ``I'm a totally different entity to what people
think.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelly Finkel, Tyson's advisor, told reporters that England was
seeing the real Mike Tyson. ``None of this is put on, this is just
his other side,'' Finkel said. ``This is the side of him that
doesn't get shown enough. He loves kids. When I went with him to
the hospitals in Phoenix and reporters were there he kicked them
out. He didn't want it as publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Tyson conceded during one interview that he would never be
regarded among the greats such as Ali because of he has been
``stigmatized by the world press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care no more,'' he said. ``There's nothing to lose,
and nothing to hide, and nothing to show to anybody. I just have
too much pain and hatred in my heart to really care what anyone
thinks about me. The only thing I have to do is love kids, and make
sure they have a better life than what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the seemingly non-stop adulation, many remained
uncharmed. Actress-turned-politician Glenda Jackson expressed shock
that Tony Blair's government would allow Tyson to enter the country
despite his 1992 rape conviction. Officials said they had no legal
basis for denying Tyson entry.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Jackson, a candidate for London mayor, didn't
relent in her criticism. ``It would be very good if Tyson were
thrown out of the country,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Irene Murray, a spokeswoman for the Rape Crisis Federation, also
was outraged that Tyson was allowed into the country. ``We have
been inundated by calls from rape victims who have found Tyson's
presence very traumatic,'' Murray said. ``Promoter Frank Warren
compared him the other day to Muhammad Ali. Tyson isn't a hero like
Ali _ he is a revolting rapist.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers have been relentless in their attacks.
</P>
<P>
   At midweek, the Tyson camp struck back, labeling the attacks as
racist.
</P>
<P>
   Warren, the fight's promoter, singled out the Evening Standard
and its editor, Max Hasting. ``The Evening Standard has run a
campaign here which borders on racism this last week, saying Mike
Tyson shouldn't be in this country and to say his people should not
be in this hotel,'' Warren said. ``It's the most disgraceful form
of racism.''
</P>
<P>
   In his response, Hastings showed no remorse: ``Mike Tyson is a
man with a ghastly record of violence,'' the editor said. ``The
fact he happens to be black has nothing to do with the case, unless
Frank Warren wants to make an excuse for Tyson's record.''
</P>
<P>
   People on the streets seemed either unconcerned about Tyson's
violent past or willing to forgive. Mark Lester, a white
28-year-old unemployed sports fan who was in Brixton to welcome
him, defended Tyson. ``Mike is a really nice guy who has done wrong
in the past but served his time.''
</P>
<P>
   The broad acceptance _ and forgiveness _ of Tyson in Britain has
moved the fighter to hint that he may make it his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sad, but I feel like a stranger in my own country,'' he
said after a training session in London. ``I feel more at home here
than I do at home.''

SOME THINGS TOO OBVIOUS, OTHERS NOT AT ALL LOGICAL WITH WINDOWS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: This has been driving me crazy. I need to know two things
about Internet Explorer 5 in Windows 98. First, how do you
alphabetize your Favorites list? Second, is there any way to remove
an item from the auto-complete list that drops down in some online
forms?
</P>
<P>
   A: One of the maddening things about Windows is that the obvious
way to do something is not always the way it's done. And in other
cases, the way to do something is so obvious that it's easy to
overlook. Your two questions highlight this problem.
</P>
<P>
   You would think there would be a way, by clicking on the
Favorites button in Internet Explorer, that you could alphabetize
the list via the Organize Favorites box. But no _ there's no way to
do this from here.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, you must access your Favorites from a different place.
Click on the Start button, then Favorites. When the list of
favorite sites appears, right-click on it. One of your choices will
be ``Sort by Name'' _ click on it. Now, when you go back to your
Favorites in Internet Explorer, they'll be alphabetized.
</P>
<P>
   You can use this feature to alphabetize your program groups,
too. Click on Start, Programs, then right-click to see the ``Sort
by Name'' menu item.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's no way the average person would know this _
which is why I get this question so frequently from readers.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to your second question is just the opposite _ the
way you remove an item from this drop-down list is to just ...
delete it. Yep, highlight the item and hit the Delete key.
</P>
<P>
   It says something about Windows' often non-intuitive design that
most users presume it couldn't possible be that easy!
</P>
<P>
   Q: I thought the clocks in personal computers were supposed to
be super-accurate. My PC clock loses at least a minute or so a
week. Is this normal?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The clock in a PC does other things besides just tell
the time, and programs that access it can, over time, degrade its
accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   You can use the Internet, though, to keep your PC's clock
accurate. There are a series of servers online that keep time using
atomic clocks, and with the right software you can access them and
use them to set your PC's clock. They work best with an always-on
connection, such as a DSL or cable modem, but are handy for dial-up
users, too. (See www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/tech/344091.)
</P>
<P>
   You can find a bunch of different programs for doing this at
winfiles.cnet.com/clock.html. My favorite is SocketWatch from
Locutus Codeware.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am pretty good about keeping my virus software updated, but
I've never understood something: What is my software installing
when it gets updates from the Internet? What are ``virus
definitions''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most antivirus software includes a feature that scans
programs and memory and tries to match what it finds against a
database of known viral code.
</P>
<P>
   But virus writers are busy, busy people. These jerks churn out
new, malicious code on a daily basis, so that database must be
constantly updated.
</P>
<P>
   Virus programs such as Norton AntiVirus or McAfee VirusScan that
rely on these databases are updated constantly _ in some cases, on
a daily basis, but usually at least once or twice a week. You're
smart to keep up with it, because you never know when something new
is going to take you by surprise.

WAKE-UP CALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 30, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Health care in America seems to be in nearly permanent crisis _
a staple feature of the front page and political campaigns since
Medicare and Medicaid made their debut in 1965. Thirty-five years
of perpetual struggle is a long time, as living memory goes. What
if the Vietnam War was still going on?
</P>
<P>
   Then again, why shouldn't there be turmoil in this industry?
Life expectancy has risen from 47 in 1900 to 60 years in 1944 to 80
for a child born today. The only comparable success in an activity
directed at a universal fundamental human need is farming, and
there the costs have gone down instead of up.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the storm are the medical schools or, in their
more elaborate delineation, the academic health centers, meaning
teaching hospitals and schools of public health and dentistry as
well.
</P>
<P>
   That cumbersome catch-all term is as useful as it is unlovely,
for it reminds us of the compound nature of the thing. It was from
the schools of public health (and, to a lesser extent, the
hospitals) that the 20th century's greatest improvements came, and
those mainly in its early years: sanitation, improved living
conditions and nutrition. (Remember, Louis Pasteur died only in
1895!)
</P>
<P>
   Now, a revolution of similar significance looms, this one
emanating from medical schools themselves, the hospitals and their
new adjuncts, the biotech and pharmaceutical industries. In the
form of new drugs, tests and procedures, molecular medicine is just
now moving into the delivery system. Its deep understanding of the
basic mechanisms of the human body and disease promises over the
next 50 years to transform medicine yet again.
</P>
<P>
   But precisely at the moment of their triumph, medical schools
and teaching hospitals find themselves in danger and disarray,
thanks mainly to the advent of managed care. That's the emphatic
warning from a distinguished physician-historian, Kenneth Ludmerer,
author of the much-heralded ``Time to Heal: American Medical
Education from the Turn of the Century to the Era of Managed
Care.''
</P>
<P>
   Underwritten by a number of blue-chip foundations, Ludmerer's
book is being billed a ``the new Flexer report,'' recalling the
penetrating jeremiad whose appearance 90 years ago sparked the
eventual transformation of American medicine from a lagging trade
in personal services to one of the crown jewels of the American
economy.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if ``Time to Heal'' will achieve similar results. I
hope it does. Ludmerer, a professor of both medicine and history at
Washington University in St. Louis, may be (as Harvard intellectual
historian Donald Fleming says he is) ``the most eminent historian
of American medicine of his time and a notable figure in the
medical profession as well.'' Certainly he has had unprecedented
access to people and to archives. He writes with uncommon clarity
about an industry of unrivalled complexity and opacity.
</P>
<P>
   But Ludmerer is also a reformer bent on a mission _ rescuing
medical faculties, physicians and their patients from a return to a
souped-up version of the profit-driven system of commodity medicine
in whose grip the health care industry found itself when the
century began. And it is to that end that Ludmerer has written a
magisterial narrative of the profession's largely successful
struggle to escape that earlier system. Its eighteen chapters each
read about as smoothly as a magazine article.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1910 that Abraham Flexner wrote ``Medical Education in
the United States and Canada.'' His client was the Carnegie
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Muckraking in its most
sophisticated form, the report lambasted medical schools for their
commercialism and low standards, doctors for their parochial aims.
Nothing more was required for matriculation than the ability to pay
the fees; two four-month terms of lectures, the second
recapitulating the first, and presto! you were an M.D.
</P>
<P>
   Flexner's analysis won him a job as secretary of John D.
Rockefeller's rich and influential General Education Board. He
thereupon embarked upon a personal crusade to improve medical
education, building up university medical schools, encouraging them
to pursue basic research as part of their teaching, extending their
basic curricula for undergraduates to four years, building a
clinical clerkship _ an internship _ into the standard course. Tens
of million dollars in grants later, in 1930, Flexner reflected with
satisfsaction on the ``immense'' progress that had been made.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the 19th century, medical educators had understood their
unertaking as consisting of three intricately related tasks:
education, research and patient care. So Ludmerer divided his
history into three distinct but somewhat overlapping periods. The
first era, from 1910 to 1945, was basically about creating the
modern system of education. This was ``the Flexnerian Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The second epoch, from 1945 to 1965, saw research and
development surpass teaching as the dominant activity in medical
schools.The government-funded National Institutes of Health made
its entry onto the scene as a canny and geneous supporter of basic
science.
</P>
<P>
   The third era, ushered in by the advent of Medicare and
Medicaid, saw a sharp swing to an emphasis on clinical care. Almost
overnight in 1965, millions of ``ward'' (charity) patients became
paying customers. The government programs were a bonanza for
teachers. Faculties soon were earning 50 percent of their incomes
from private practice _ or more.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1980s, Ludmerer says, academic health centers were no
longer cohesive organizations; they had become giant enterprises
essentially out of control. The typical budget had been $1 million
in 1940; by 1965 it had grown to to $20 million, and by 1990 to
$200 million or more. Education, research and patient care no
longer could be readily balanced against one another.
</P>
<P>
   It was in this circumstance that the medical schools lost
control. With hospital costs soaring, the managed care industry
(meaning a whole array of related new approaches to financing and
delivery) stepped in, with a promise to purchasers to squeeze waste
out of the system. Instead, its MBA managers settled mostly on
time-honored strategy of the Speed-up. Doctors would have to see
more patients, and spend less time with each.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, it turned out to be possible to treat patients
more quickly and still keep clinical incomes high. Medical schools
became richer than ever, but only because more teachers practiced,
and more clinicians enjoyed faculty presige. The University of
Pennsylvania, among others, simply bought private practices and
gave the physicians faculty rank!.
</P>
<P>
   What was good for the schools has not been good for education,
writes Ludmerer. Once central to the enterprise, education has
become a byproduct in an increasingly commercial industry. Medical
school ties with the university have weakened; ties with the health
care delivery system have grown.
</P>
<P>
   Now managed care has begun dismantling the infrastructure of
medical education itself, running the system without oil, draining
it of time, precisely the resource most necessary to promote
healing, in the name of containing costs.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, education has surprisingly few outspoken
defenders. Arnold Relman and Jerome Kassirer, both ex-editors of
the New England Journal of Medicine, are prominent among them; now
Ludmerer has joined their ranks. ``Surprising little is heard from
medical educators about the need for doctors to remain their
patients' friend, counselor and advocate,'' he writes in reproach
to his colleagues. Look for the chorus to grow.

35-YEAR-OLD'S STAKE IN MUNI BONDS IS TOO HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 30, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a single 35-year-old man earning $70,000 a year. I have
the following investments: $54,532 in MFS Research fund; $97,988 in
Dreyfus Premier Massachusetts Municipal Bond fund; $127,674 in
Franklin Massachusetts Insured Tax-Free Income fund; $21,473 in a
traditional IRA in MFS Investors Growth Stock fund; $35,640 in
another traditional IRA in MFS Emerging Growth fund; a $8,250 Roth
IRA in MFS Emerging Growth; a 401(k) plan with $26,445 in Seligman
Large Cap Value fund, $40,764 in Vanguard Index 500, and $40,413 in
Janus Worldwide fund. Finally, I have $7,000 in US Savings Bonds. I
add the maximums of $10,500 to the 401(k) and $2,000 to the Roth
IRA, and buy a $100 savings bond each month. How well diversified
am I? Do I have too many funds? Is too much of the portfolio in the
municipal bond funds? How do I look for retirement at age 60?
</P>
<P>
   D.D., Fairhaven, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Aside for one factor, you're pretty well diversified
(although I'd suggest a few small changes). That factor, of course,
is the 49 percent of the total savings that is in the municipal
bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   If you have some fairly short-term purpose for the money, such
as perhaps a real estate purchase within the next five years, these
funds are not the best investment.
</P>
<P>
   Your smaller muni holding, the Dreyfus fund, has an
intermediate-term portfolio, but that didn't do too much to protect
it against the slings and arrows of the 99 bond market; it produced
a negative 5.3 percent total return for 1999. The Franklin fund has
a long-term portfolio (but better credit quality) and lost only 3.8
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   If this is short- to intermediate-term money, I would move it to
a money market fund _ either taxable or tax-exempt, if you are
convinced that your tax overall situation would make the latter
more rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   More important, if it's long-term money you would be much better
off putting a good portion of it into stock funds. If you want to
have a segment of the portfolio that you can view as the
conservative bedrock, why not consider offerings such as Vanguard
Star or Balanced Index funds? Over the long term, the returns on
such funds should make those of the municipal bond funds pale, even
considering the higher taxes you will pay in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   Another change I would make, if it's available within your
401(k), is to switch to an offering that holds an overseas
portfolio rather than a global portfolio such as Janus Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the attractive returns of recent years from Worldwide
have come from its sizable stake in US equities, but you already
have a lot of positions in large-cap US stocks, and the idea of
this diversification is to give you exposure to the overseas
markets. If the 401(k) offers Janus Overseas fund, that would be an
ideal substitution.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you leave the portfolio more or less as it is and
continue the contributions you outline, your total accumulation
would be around $4.6 million after 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, if the municipal portfolio grew at 5 percent, it
would reach $704,180. The stock portfolio plus the IRAs and 401(k)
would attain a value of $3,826,888, presuming 10 percent average
annual returns.
</P>
<P>
   I can't make a good projection for the US Savings Bond account,
because it's not clear from your letter whether you buy $100 face
value of bonds each month, or pay $100 a month into the bond
savings segment of the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you took my advice and moved the municipal
bond holdings into stock and balanced funds, achieving an average 9
percent return, you would accumulate $5,010,054 over 25 years _
plus whatever the Savings Bond account would be worth.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's your opinion of Nicholas fund as a long-term growth
investment? I have been an account holder for more than 10 years,
and have never been pleased with its performance measured against
similar funds. It seems every time I consider getting out of the
fund and review the Morningstar Mutual Funds rating, I change my
mind. Morningstar always seems to rate the fund high, regardless of
its performance. Is it time to get out? If so, what do you suggest
for long-term growth with moderate risk?
</P>
<P>
   J.C., Wellesley, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Maybe I'm doing the same thing you are _ reviewing the
figures and deciding it's not such a bad bet after all. At this
point, the best thing Morningstar can say is that Nicholas is a
decent long-term holding, which is the kind of faint praise you
expect of an average-rated fund.
</P>
<P>
   But I think the problem is more a matter of what the fund is
than how it has done relative to its peers. During the past decade,
the fund has migrated from a mid-cap blend portfolio to a large-cap
blend portfolio, and, while it remains in the large-cap blend
category with Morningstar, the portfolio is currently characterized
as large-cap value.
</P>
<P>
   Over a decade, the fund has had a 14.88 percent average annual
return. This compares to a 15.7 percent average for large-cap blend
funds through the '90s, to 14.0 percent for mid-cap blend funds in
the same period, and to 13.9 percent for large-cap value funds. So
you can more or less pick your comparison.
</P>
<P>
   It has several things I like: a low turnover rate, at 25 percent
of the portfolio; a low market-to-book ratio of 5.1, representing
60 percent of that of the Standard &AMP; Poors 500; and a fairly low
portfolio price-to-earnings ratio of 33.2 (low for this market,
that is), which is 90 percent of the PE of the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the price-to-earnings ratio would be lower but for a
heavy concentration in health care stocks, representing 1.8 times
the health care segment of the 500. This I like, especially for
long-term growth.
</P>
<P>
   What I don't like is its very heavy concentration in financials,
which represent 42.0 percent of the portfolio, and is 2.8 times
that of financials within the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing to dislike is that it's a fairly tax-inefficient
fund, with substantial capital gains distributions.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that a fund is migrating from a blend portfolio to a
value portfolio is a sign that the managers are thinking, hunkering
down for an end to the bull market. For that reason, I would hold
on for now.

   w/COKE-SIDE _ NEW YORK _ Coca-Cola's new leader, Doug Daft, say
the decision to cut 6,000 jobs was by far the most ``difficult and
devastating'' since he was named to take the helm of the company
eight weeks ago. ``That gave me sleepless nights,'' Daft told
reporters after speaking to analysts in New York. ``We haven't done
it before, and we''ll never do it again.'' (Unger, Atlanta

brand. 3. Company must strive to be known for serving all

Georgia-Pacific and two other large timber companies, claiming they
were underpaid after being recruited to come to the U.S. to plant
trees. The workers, mostly Mexicans, say International Paper,
Champion International and GP broke federal labor rules by not
paying the prevailing wages. As many as 6,000 workers may be

   ALLIEDHOLDINGS _ Allied Holdings is North America's leading
car-hauler, delivering more than 12 million new vehicles a year to
dealerships under contract to auto-makers. The problem with rising
demand for SUVs and trucks is that fewer of the bulky vehicles fit
on a trailer, cutting Allied's average load about 20 percent over
the last few years. That helped push the company's earnings into
the ditch for much of 1999 while Allied tried to adjust its pricing
structure, as well as recover from a mid-1998 strike at its biggest
customer, General Motors. (Thurston, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

MEMORY COMPETITION IS STEP TOWARD `MIND OLYMPIAD' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Fla., Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Will sporting events of the mind ever outdraw the
Super Bowl? Probably not. Still, that is the dream of Tony Buzan, a
British author and lecturer on the brain and learning.
</P>
<P>
   Buzan and two friends created the Mind Sports Olympiad, an
annual event in London, now in its fourth year, where ``mental
athletes'' vie for gold, silver and bronze medals in 40 events
including Scrabble, bridge and chess. One of the highlights of the
Olympiad is the World Memory Championships, and next Saturday in
New York, contestants will compete to see who will represent the
United States at this year's world competition in August.
</P>
<P>
   The national memory championship, which organizers call the
Memoriad, is in only its third year, but the Americans have come on
strong on the international level. Last year, Eric Chang, a high
school student from New Jersey who placed second in the national
competition, nearly became world champion after he memorized a
binary number _ a sequence of zeroes and ones _ to 2,745 digits in
30 minutes. But Dominic O'Brien of Britain, the defending champ,
battled back by memorizing the order of a deck of cards in 60
seconds and eventually retained his title.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Memoriad, which will take place in the Con Edison
Auditorium at Irving Place and is open to anyone willing to pay the
$25 registration fee, will consist of five events. Contestants will
be given 20 minutes to study 100 faces and names and then recall
them. They will be asked to memorize strings of words and numbers
and a 50-line poem, including punctuation. Finally, there is the
deck of cards, which seems to be the weakest event for the
Americans, according to Tony Dottino, a corporate consultant and
organizer of the Memoriad, who is a licensed instructor of Buzan's
memory-stretching and learning techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this competition is trying to promote is that there are
things you can do to exercise your memory that will improve it as
you get older,'' Dottino said.
</P>
<P>
   Sales pitch aside, there is a scientific basis for the notion
that memory, like the body, is something that can be improved with
exercise, rather than being determined at birth. Anders Ericsson, a
psychology professor at Florida State University who has been
researching people with exceptional memories for 20 years, said he
is now convinced that genetics play a minor part.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news seems to be that most people can improve their
memories more than they think they can,'' he said. ``But the bad
news is that there is no effortless trick to allow people to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The nurture-over-nature argument would appear to be belied by
Tatiana Cooley, the Memoriad's defending champion. Two years ago,
Ms. Cooley, then 26, walked in off the street and won the
competition after reading about it the day before. She won again
last year.
</P>
<P>
   But Ericsson pointed out that the people he studied who appeared
to be naturally gifted at remembering actually had a lot of
practice. Ms. Cooley played memory games with her parents as a
child. She also grew up speaking Portuguese, Spanish and English.
``From a young age,'' she said, ``I was forced to hold a lot in my
brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others with exceptional memories, Ms. Cooley also found
ways of encoding information to make it easier to recall. Her
system for remembering the order of a deck of cards is to tag each
one with a simple word. Each diamond card begins with a D, clubs
with a C, etc. A two is represented by the letter N because of its
two vertical lines. The letters are connected by a vowel so a two
of diamonds is tagged with the word ``den.'' Get it?
</P>
<P>
   After Ms. Cooley won last year, she told an interviewer that she
still used Post-It notes to help her remember things in her daily
life. That was enough for 3M Co., the maker of the sticky
reminders. It signed on to be the major sponsor of this year's
Memoriad. British Airways provides the only prize, which is a plane
ticket to London for each of the top three finishers so that they
can compete at the world championship.
</P>
<P>
   Dottino said he was expecting about 1,000 spectators on
Saturday, up from 400 last year. But compared to football, watching
people memorize would appear to be an acquired taste as a spectator
sport. ``You have to picture a room that is as quiet as you can
believe while 20 people are looking as intent as you can imagine,''
Dottino said. ``It is absolutely fascinating.''

&HT;     PENTAGON TO ISSUE GUIDELINES ON GAYS IN THE MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defense Secretary William Cohen said Friday that he
will issue broad guidelines next week for all military personnel,
emphasizing that the Pentagon's ``don't ask don't tell'' policy on
gays serving in uniform prohibits commanders from harassing
suspected homosexuals in the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the training and education guidelines will advise
officers and enlisted personnel, from high-ranking service chiefs
down to new recruits, ``of what the policy is and to make sure that
they hold people accountable, that they are required to alert
(superiors) any time there is harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines, which come in the wake of the murder of an Army
recruit who was believed to be gay, are designed to make sure that
the Pentagon's policy on homosexual troops ``is properly and
effectively implemented,'' said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no toleration whatsoever of any kind of
harassment,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The killing at Fort Campbell, Ky., has rekindled the debate over
the Clinton administration's seven-year-old ``don't ask, don't
tell'' policy, which allows homosexuals to serve in the military so
long as they do not engage in homosexual acts and keep quiet about
their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   While the policy prohibits commanders from asking military
personnel about their sexual orientation, gay rights organizations
have long complained that the policy is routinely violated _ and
they cite the Fort Campbell incident as a case study of the policy
gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Pvt. Calvin Glover, 19, was sentenced to life in
prison for killing Pvt. Barry Winchell, 21, with a baseball bat.
During the trial, soldiers testified that Winchell was regularly
taunted with anti-gay slurs, a violation of the policy, and that
superiors did not intervene when he complained.
</P>
<P>
   After Glover's conviction, President Clinton said the policy was
``out of whack,'' and Cohen ordered the Pentagon's inspector
general to investigate whether there is widespread harassment of
homosexuals at military installations.
</P>
<P>
   The policy also has emerged as an issue in the presidential
campaign. The Democratic presidential candidates, Vice President Al
Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, both called for
letting homosexuals serve openly. Gore went so far as to say he
would require a litmus test for senior military officers to ensure
that they held the same view, but he later retracted the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen told reporters Friday that he believes harassment of gay
personnel is an isolated problem. ``I am satisfied that the policy
generally is being implemented effectively,'' he said, adding that
``I want to make sure my judgment is correct.''

WHATEVER THE OUTCOME, MCCAIN FEELS HE'S DONE HIS BEST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 30, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ When you've done all that can be done, all
that you could possibly do, and done a whole lot better than
anybody but you and your mom ever thought you could do, there are
no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain has no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   He kicked back Friday before heading down to the seacoast for a
noon rally, swapping campaign yarns with his wife and staff,
chortling over the odd moments, leaning forward with zest to
describe the peaks of hand-to-hand political combat. Like a fighter
pilot debriefing after the last mission, the onetime Navy flyboy
mused on the tactics of recent engagements.
</P>
<P>
   He may not finish first when they count the votes Tuesday night.
But he will not have been beaten. His long-shot maverick candidacy
has flown farther and faster than anyone expected. He catapaulted
into a slim lead here in recent polls, but faced a strong finish
from Texas Governor George W. Bush, with the outcome to be
determined by the independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that, in the nightly polling conducted by the
Democratic campaign of Vice President Al Gore, about 40 percent of
the canvassed independents said they planned to vote, when in other
years far fewer actually did. And these independents are breaking
3-2 in favor of McCain, as opposed to the 2 in 5 who plan to vote
for Bill Bradley in the Democratic race.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news? Independents, or ``unenrolled'' voters, as they're
called here, can be fickle, faint-hearted summer soldiers, easily
put off by lousy weather, a last-minute negative ad barrage, or
congenital apathy. Media tracking polls suggested Friday that
Bradley's challenge was fading.
</P>
<P>
   The former New Jersey senator led Gore here by 15 points among
most-likely voters only a few weeks ago. But Gore's aggressive
campaigning, his solid 2-1 victory in Iowa's caucuses, and
endorsements uncorked by the likes of Ted Kennedy, former Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin, a host of labor unions, and, most
significantly, Governor Jeanne Shaheen, turned the tide. The
Shaheen blessing translates into a get-out-the-vote operation
Bradley's energetic volunteers seem unlikely to match.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is the hottest pol on the trail up here; his crowds would
pay to hear their guy take on the system of big-shot lobbyists,
greasy campaign contributions, and a deaf-and-dumb Congress hooked
on the crack cocaine of politics, special interest money.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, who leads everywhere else, is well-organized here. His
basic pitch is he is so well-heeled he can win in November. In
terms of crowd appeal and favorable press, Bush has improved
steadily as a campaigner and debater. McCain agrees on that point.
But he is baffled by the apparent sag in the fortunes of his fellow
senator, Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   McCain mused idly about why Senator John Kerry (D-Mass.), a
fellow Vietnam vet with whom he worked closely on the POW-MIA
issues, chose not to run. McCain is expected to be the beneficiary
of Bradley's swoon. Those independents who want to strike a blow
for campaign finance reform could pick either McCain or Bradley,
and indications are they going for the Arizonan.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be enough? McCain shrugged. Things that are out of his
hands are out of his hands. You learn a certain kind of fatalism
when you are a combat pilot, and then, for 5 1/2 years, a prisoner
of war. He cruises serenely above the fray. So Bush's friends in
New York conspire to knock him off the ballot? That's just cheap
politics. The reporters who clamor to ride along with him play a
daily game of stump-the-candidate? That's part of the game, too.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign has become a crusade, uniting disparate types
from all bandwidths of the political spectrum. Here's a guy who
tells it like it is, doesn't trim, and doesn't hide. He scorches
those practices of his own party he regards as corrupting _ sopping
up $7 million in tobacco industry soft money is one of his latest
pet peeves. But he's vitriolic on Clinton's character, and
genuinely irate over GI families on food stamps and shoddy
veterans' hospital care.
</P>
<P>
   Two uniformed soldiers, one male, one female, lurked outside
McCain's hotel Friday, waiting for their man to emerge. ``Good
luck, Senator,'' murmured a sergeant as McCain paused for a photo.
I spent an hour Friday morning fielding calls from viewer's of
C-SPAN's morning show, and from all points of the compass came the
same theme: I'm a Democrat, I'm a Republican, I'm an independent,
I'm an 18-year-old high school senior from New Hampshire, and I'm
for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans are. Me too. But if he does not flat-out
win here Tuesday, his campaign probably dies here in the wintry
terrain of the very first primary. Only a genuine prairie fire,
ignited here by a perfectly possible victory over Bush, can keep
the McCain phenomenon going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can feel it,'' he said matter-of-factly of his crowds, whose
size and fervor fgrow daily. ``I go to a town where six months ago
I got 40 people; now it's 400. You can absolutely feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a crusade. But you know what typically happens to
crusaders. They tend to die, valiantly, far from home and, as the
senator says every day of America's young soldiers, ``for a cause
greater than themselves.'' We already know how this man put his
life on the line, repeatedly, for a cause greater than himself.
</P>
<P>
   We find out Tuesday night how much that means to New Hampshire.
</P>

   NEW YORK _ Astronomers have always had trouble conveying the
excesses of the universe to the small human beings who inhabit it:
its huge celestial bodies, its vast lonely spaces, its unthinkably
long spans of time. As Dr. Neil de Grasse Tyson, the director of
the American Museum of Natural History's spanking new Hayden
Planetarium, puts it, astronomers are constantly comparing BBs to
beach balls to get across the bigness of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Representing hugeness is hard. So it is fitting that the new
planetarium, a big aluminum sphere floating serenely in a glass
box, doubles as a museum of representation, a gallery of attempts
to convey scale, space and time. And it is not surprising that even
scientists, who are visualizing their data for the first time, are
thrilled. By the end of a visit to the planetarium and its glass
mother ship, which together make up the Rose Center for Earth and
Space, Tyson says, you will, if nothing else, appreciate the
meaning of the much-abused adjective ``astronomical.'' The center
opens Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Hayden sphere floats in an Escher-like room with puzzling
passageways. A square catwalk surrounds the sphere at the
equatorial level, a circular ramp winds around the bottom, and a
bridge penetrates the center. Each passageway offers the experience
of a different aspect of the universe: the square walkway deals
with size, the circular ramp with time, the inside of the sphere
with place. And each one uses a different mode of representation:
algebraic, kinesthetic, virtual.
</P>
<P>
   From the square catwalk the sphere appears to be a sun. After
all, there are planets hanging around it. But soon it becomes clear
that the sphere is part of a vast algebraic gymnasium. Sometimes it
is meant to represent a cluster of galaxies, sometimes a brain,
sometimes a virus. It is a giant X.
</P>
<P>
   A stroll on this walkway, called Scales of the Universe, is
vigorous algebraic exercise. For example, you are asked to imagine
that the Hayden sphere is the size of our local group of galaxies.
This means that our galaxy, the Milky Way, is only the size of the
24-inch-diameter sphere sitting on the railing of the walkway. Then
you are told that if the sphere is the size of the sun, then the
nine-inch ball on the railing is the size of the Earth. Finally, if
the sphere represents the size of a whole atom, then the pinhead on
the railing represents the size of its nucleus. (When Ernest
Rutherford found how much space there was within an atom, between
the nucleus and its orbiting electrons, he was afraid to get out of
bed and step on the floor, Tyson said.)
</P>
<P>
   So much for the vastness of space. What about time?
</P>
<P>
   For that, the curators have devised a kinesthetic experience,
one that uses the body's sense of movement. On the Cosmic Pathway,
time has been transformed into footsteps. A descending circular
ramp the length of a football field tells the story of unfolding
time, from the Big Bang 13 billion years ago to the present. Every
time you move an inch, 3.6 million years go by.
</P>
<P>
   After a dozen strides, the first stars appear. It takes 60 more
strides before groups of galaxies form. And you will have walked
two-thirds of the way down the ramp before the solar system is
born. The first multicellular life, 650 million years ago, explodes
15 feet from the end of the ramp. The first dinosaurs appear 10
feet from the end. And the whole span of human history occurs
within a final sliver the thickness of a hair. And your own life?
Forget it.
</P>
<P>
   But the demonstration that really gets scientists jazzed is in
the inner sanctum of the sphere itself, which holds the planetarium
and its sky show. This is ground zero for representation. Conceived
by James Sweitzer, the director of special projects at the Rose
Center, the sky show is made to offer visitors the seamless
illusion of traveling through space, blissfully unaware of the
devilish process of representation.
</P>
<P>
   The seats in the theater, like those in a rocket, have high
headrests and they rumble. During the 25-minute space show, the
Earth recedes and planets buzz by. Then the virtual spaceship aims
for a blurry spot, a nebula in the constellation of Orion, and
visits a stellar nursery there. The ship leaves Earth's galaxy,
visits a neighboring one, then finds home again by way of a black
hole. The purpose is to learn our place in the vast universe:
planet Earth, solar system, Milky Way galaxy, Virgo supercluster.
That, as the narrator of the sky show (Tom Hanks) puts it, is our
``cosmic address.''
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of unreal things about the virtual journey. For
example, you would have to travel millions of light years a second,
way beyond the speed of light (impossible), to reach some of these
places. But at least this sky show has replaced the Ptolemaic,
Earth-centered view of space with a less self-centered, more
Copernican view. (The scientists at the Hayden are still working on
producing an Einsteinian view, which would show the effects of
relativity.)
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't just a spectacle. The space that one flies
through is not a fantasy landscape but a three-dimensional map. The
Hayden scientists, as Sweitzer explains, have taken data from the
Hubble Telescope, star catalogs and observatories and loaded them
into computers. From that data, they have modeled pieces of the
universe, turning them into illusions of three-dimensional worlds
for the first time. These images of planets, stars, nebulae and
galaxies, projected onto the inner surface of the dome from a
seven-headed star projector, are all in the right places. And the
current sky show is only one possible pathway through the 3-D map.
There are infinite pathways and new data can always be added.
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising that astronomers, who have amassed phone
books full of 0s and 1s representing the position, speed, mass and
temperature of celestial bodies, are getting excited. According to
Dr. Michael Shara, the curator and head of the new astrophysics
department at the planetarium, scientists will finally be able to
see high-resolution images of their data and move through them. All
the data are being turned back into things the human brain can
easily understand. It is, he said, the difference between reading a
phone book and reading a novel. With a visual image before them,
astronomers can do virtual thought experiments and model things
that haven't happened, like collisions of globular clusters of
stars millions of light-years away from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Science has finally caught up with science fiction. And that,
Shara said, is every bit as important a breakthrough as the
microscope or the telescope. A 20-second fly-through is worth a
billion bytes.

EMPLOYERS CAN FIRE WITHOUT A REASON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Most people don't know they can get fired for just
about anything at work.
</P>
<P>
   They're what are known as ``at will'' employees, a phrase that
isn't exactly bandied about in normal conversation.
</P>
<P>
   If you look in your employee handbook, chances are your employer
will let you know in a fairly prominent place that you're an ``at
will'' employee. That means that short of firing you for
discriminatory reasons or for your refusing to violate a criminal
statute, your boss can give you the boot at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's known as a good reason, a bad reason or no reason at
all,'' said Larry Clore, an employment lawyer with Fulbright &AMP;
Jaworski in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of ``at will'' employees surfaced recently at the
University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The university has long had a policy of ``adequate cause''
employment. That means that employees can be terminated only if
they consistently fail to perform their duties or do something
serious such as accepting a bribe or stealing university property.
</P>
<P>
   Once an employee has been informed of a problem and how to
correct it, he or she has the right to go through an involved
procedure, including counseling, progressive discipline and a
review by human resources officials, before being dismissed. That
sense of job security is important to some employees in a turbulent
work environment.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
UH CASE SPOTLIGHTS `AT WILL' ISSUE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the University of Houston also maintains in its employment
manuals that its employees are ``at will'' workers.
</P>
<P>
   They can't be both, said Houston lawyer Glenn Diddel. Diddel has
been researching that complicated part of employment law because he
is representing the university's chief of police, George Hess, in a
dispute with the university.
</P>
<P>
   Diddel said university officials told Hess that he was an ``at
will'' employee and fired him after he forwarded a criminal case
against a football player to the Harris County district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   University of Houston Chancellor and President Arthur K. Smith
said Hess was not fired.
</P>
<P>
   As for the issue of ``at will,'' Smith said the university
created grievance and termination policies a long time ago. It
follows them because it's the right thing to do, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that the policies don't create a legal expectation.
Employees don't necessarily have the right to go through grievance
and termination policies, he said. An example would be in an
egregious case in which an employee refused to do any work.
</P>
<P>
   Despite viewing employees as ``at will,'' he said, the
university would never terminate employees for arbitrary,
capricious or unreasonable reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is an interesting one because Texas law considers the
right to a job created in an ``adequate cause'' environment as a
property right, Diddel said.
</P>
<P>
   Once it has been created, he said, it becomes a federally
protected right, which means employers can't change it to an ``at
will'' arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PUBLIC EMPLOYERS SHIFT POLICY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, private employers have relied more
heavily on contract workers and employment agencies so they can
quickly add or discharge workers. That same trend is popping up in
the public sector, said Eliot Tucker, an employment lawyer in
Houston with Mandell &AMP; Wright.
</P>
<P>
   There are pressures on public institutions to act more like
efficient and nimble private employers, Tucker said. Public
employers have been chronically criticized for their inability to
get rid of poorly performing employees.
</P>
<P>
   To make top-level school officials more accountable for their
job performance, the Houston Independent School District has been
offering money to administrators who agree to give up their right
to job security and become ``at will'' employees.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for agreeing to leave if their two-year contracts
aren't renewed, the district offers superintendents a $15,000
premium in annual salary, principals $7,500 more and assistant
principals $5,000 more.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also allows the school district to fire the
officials during the middle of their contracts _ although they
would be paid until the end of the contract period.
</P>
<P>
   The change has allowed the district to make personnel changes
fast without spending a year or more going through progressive
discipline and then employee appeals.
</P>
<P>
   But it has come with a price. Last year, the school district
paid $2.5 million in higher salaries to 300 administrators who gave
up their job security.

FOR THOSE WHO TRULY LOVE THEIR PETS
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Monday, Jan. 31)  
(mk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people regret not having invested their money better.
</P>
<P>
   Others regret never having parachuted out of an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Me, I regret that I didn't attend the 12th Pat Pet Friend
Festival last November in Bangkok, Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   You would think they might have something cool like a Pat Pet
Friend Festival where I live once in a while, but noooo. We have
film festivals and jazz festivals and reading festivals and, of
course, the annual Hey, Look At Me! I'm A Highbrow! festival, but
nothing remotely as exciting as a Pat Pet Friend Festival.
</P>
<P>
   The Pat Pet Friend Festival is where you go when you want to
bring yourself, and of course your pat pet friend, up to speed on
the latest doggie fashions and accessories. The Japanese, who are
way ahead of us in so many ways, are very ``cutting edge'' when it
comes to doggie fashions and accessories, so they naturally make up
a big part of the crowd at the Pat Pet Friend Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new doggie designer fashions unveiled at last year's
festival were a red-and-black Michael Jackson-style military coat,
a yellow-and-black bike-racing jacket with matching helmet, a
silver space-suit-like cape and a blue silk gown.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's been two months now and I have yet to see a single
local dog done up in a Michael Jackson-style military coat or
draped in a silver space- suit-like cape, which just goes to show
you that people around here spend way too much time in the art
galleries and concert halls and not nearly enough time heeding the
winds of change blowing in from Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
   One has to wonder, too, what kind of emotional problems dogs
suffer knowing that dogs on the other side of the world are
strutting around in blue silk gowns and bike-racing jackets when
all they can boast of in the way of style is a frayed collar and
rabies-shot tag.
</P>
<P>
   But then again I've always thought of my town as more of a
``gadget'' town than a Michael Jackson-style military coat town,
which is why I see great potential locally for the hottest new
accessory to come out of the Pat Pet Friend Festival, cell phones
for dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Before you smack yourself in the forehead and shout, ``Of
course! Why in God's name didn't I think of that?'' be advised that
these phones are not the kind that the well-accessorized dog might
carry around in its pocket or purse or clip onto its belt. The
phones are actually sewn right onto the fabric of the racing jacket
or silver space-suit-like cape.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the convenience. Assuming the phones are
voice-activated (and why on earth wouldn't they be?), dogs can call
their friends or business associates without ever having to lift a
paw. As there is with motorists who talk on their phones while
driving, there may be some danger associated with dogs who phone
while walking or running. They may be focusing so much on the call
that they inadvertently walk in front of a car or maybe even trip
over the hem of their blue silk gown.
</P>
<P>
   Still, such risks seem a small price to pay for the convenience
cell phones provide.
</P>
<P>
   And if local dogs had their own stitched-on cell phones, they
could take calls while they're watching a Broadway road show,
which, around here at least, is the ultimate form of status.

MUSIC LOVERS SING FOR FILES OF FREEDOM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are some who lament that the grass-roots days of the
Internet are over. The network of networks has grown too big and
too commercial, they say, to support the type of populist movements
that characterized its infancy.
</P>
<P>
   And then along comes something like MP3 to prove them wrong.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 is a music file format that makes it easy to store tunes on
a hard drive and trade them with others, and it's revolutionizing
the music business. The use of MP3 files began among computer-savvy
music fans and gamers, not at the urging of some corporate
marketing department's ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As with every revolution, the status quo is under attack. The
traditional way of getting music from artist to listener _ through
a recording company _ is being challenged. There are two things an
industry can do when the wave of Internet begins washing away its
foundation _ it can try in vain to stem the tide, or it can grab a
board and surf along with it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
INDUSTRY PLAYS HARDBALL &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry has, for now, chosen the former approach,
using lawyers as its sandbags. First, it filed suit against Diamond
Multimedia in a failed attempt to stop the sale of the first
portable MP3 player, the Rio.
</P>
<P>
   The industry came up with its own, alternative file format for
music files that included a way to track ownership. So far, that
standard has failed to catch on and may be stillborn.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the music industry has gone after a pair of Internet
companies that have come up with two very different, very clever
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America claims its suits
against Napster, a San Mateo, Calif.-based software company, and
MP3.com, the leading MP3 distribution Web site, are attempts to
fight music piracy. What they're really about, though, is an
industry that is fighting a battle to retain control over the way
music is distributed.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that the association's piracy concerns are
completely without merit. Napster's software and MP3.com's new
services could indeed be easily misused to violate current
copyright law. But in the larger picture, that's incidental _ the
software and the service by themselves are not evil.
</P>
<P>
   Napster's free Windows software, which is available in
beta-testing form at www.napster.com, creates an instant community
among everyone who uses the program. Within that community, users
can trade MP3 files stored in designated, shared folders on their
hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
INNOVATIONS DON'T CEASE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Napster is one of those rare programs that gave me goose bumps
when I first used it. It makes finding MP3 files much easier than
the usual methods of tracking them down via FTP sites that make you
jump through hoops to get access.
</P>
<P>
   When you first launch Napster, it catalogs the MP3 files in the
directory you've set up as a sharing folder. It then connects to a
server on the Internet and adds your files to a list of available
titles. Your music is never stored on Napster's machines, but a
list of what you are making available is added to this database.
</P>
<P>
   You can then search the database for a song or artist, and the
results are posted in a list. This list shows who's got the file
you want and the speed and quality of their connection. You can
then download the file directly from their computer.
</P>
<P>
   Napster is what I call wink-wink-nudge-nudgeware. The company
claims it has no clue whether its users are trading copyrighted,
commercial music, or the kind of public-domain music from no-name
performers that you find on sites like MP3.com. There's even a
disclaimer. Of course, it's obvious why Napster is so popular: the
software makes it absurdly easy to find the music you really want,
which is going to be from top-name, commercially successful
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   (Interestingly, the recording industry has not filed suit
against the makers of a similar program, CuteMX, which is offered
by San Antonio-based GlobalScape _ best known for its CuteFTP
file-transfer software.)
</P>
<P>
   The case of MP3.com's new services, Beam-It and Instant
Listening, is even more interesting because here, MP3.com is
storing copyrighted tunes on its own servers and allowing people
who own copies of the songs on CD to listen to them over the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Beam-It works this way: You download a small Windows or
Macintosh application from MP3.com, then set up an account with the
Web site. Insert a music CD, and information about that disk is
sent to MP3.com. If the disk matches one of 40,000 the company has
stored online digitally, then you are granted rights to listen to
those songs over the Net. This enables you to place your favorite
CDs online, then listen to them from any computer connected to the
Net.
</P>
<P>
   Instant Listening is similar, but you don't actually need to
have the disk in hand. It lets you buy a CD from one of several
music sites and then receive rights to listen to the songs over the
Net before the disk arrives in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Beam-It works quite well, and its database has both popular and
obscure titles. For example, it recognized and added to my account
both R.E.M.'s ``Document,'' a popular title from the Georgia-based
band, and Savoy Brown's ``Looking In,'' a moldy blues-rock oldie,
circa 1970.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com argues that, because it must verify that you own a copy
of the CD, it is breaking no laws. You are allowed to make copies
of recordings you own for personal use, and MP3.com says it is
merely technologically facilitating that process with its database.
</P>
<P>
   But Beam-It has its own wink-wink-nudge-nudge factor, too.
What's to stop me from creating a generic account, giving the logon
information to my friends and creating our own shared repository of
music? In fact, this raises the intriguing concept of personal,
pirate radio stations. I put my music on the Web, and you program
which songs play for you when you connect.
</P>
<P>
   The record industry says MP3.com has no right to compile a
database for distribution of music, even if it's to get copies of
songs to verified owners of the identical CD.
</P>
<P>
   How these suits will shake out remains to be seen, though most
legal experts quoted in news stories about the litigation seem to
think the association's cases are weak. Either way, the core
technology that makes them possible, MP3, is catching on with more
and more people. This is a tide no lawsuit can stop.
</P>
<P>
   The genie is out of the bottle, and not only is there no putting
him back, but he's rockin'!

NO WET FEET, THANK YOU  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 30) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you want to grow penstemons, you should be planting the seeds
right now. Outside, mind you.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like cold,'' said Robert Nold, who grows 200 different
species in his Denver garden. ``Cold breaks down the germination
inhibitors in the seed. My wife has a picture of me out on the
patio, with the barbecue going to keep warm, sowing seeds in pots.
Around mid-May, I'll have seedlings coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   Nold is the author of a dangerous book called ``Penstemons,''
just published by Timber Press ($30). Dangerous because its wry
prose, and the photographs and beautiful watercolor plates by his
wife, Cindy Nelson-Nold, conspire to dare even the most levelheaded
gardener to grow these drought-tolerant natives, which number 270
species across North America.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers cover the rainbow and range in shape from fat bells
to slender tubes to phloxlike faces, blooming on willowy stems,
little cushiony plants or tall shrubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got interested in penstemons about 15 years ago, when I got
tired of having to water things,'' Nold said by telephone from
Denver, where he works for the local phone company when he isn't
growing penstemons. He hasn't watered his front garden for 12
years.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its altitude (5,280 feet), ``Denver has a light
intensity equivalent to Cairo,'' Nold said. And penstemons, he
writes, are ``well used to a sun that peels the paint off a house
in two years _ they not only tolerate it, they revel in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the genera are native to the Southwest. ``I think the
evolution of the species began in northern Arizona,'' Nold said.
They then fanned out into Utah, Colorado, California and Wyoming,
and south to New Mexico. There are a number of species in
Washington and Oregon. A woodland species, P. smallii, rambles
through the North Carolina forests. In fact, every state except
Hawaii can claim a native penstemon.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Northeastern gardeners is that penstemons
don't like cold, wet conditions (cold and dry is fine). They love
rocky soil and instant drainage. They thrive in drought. Which is
good for those of us who have survived a few Sahara summers.
</P>
<P>
   The first penstemon Nold fell for was P. strictus, a two-footer
with gorgeous blue-purple flowers, which is native from Wyoming
down to Colorado and New Mexico. His favorite this week is P.
cyaneus, which can reach three feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flowers are fairly large and mind-bogglingly, shockingly
blue,'' he said. ``You get addicted to blue when you grow
penstemons.''
</P>
<P>
   Another tall favorite is P. barbatus, with its bright red
corolla shaped like a shark's head, and P. cardinalis, whose red,
golden-fringed blooms are much loved by hummingbirds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grow all of mine in the worst clay soil imaginable,'' Nold
said. ``It dries out in summer just like a brick.'' He uses his
father's entrenching tool (an Army shovel that saw action in Korea)
to dig down a few inches, trickles a bit of water into the hole,
then scrapes a bit more with his shovel.
</P>
<P>
   Penstemons grow quite happily in what is known as a scree, or
gravelly area at the base of a rock outcropping. And it's easy
enough to mimic one with gravel, sand and some organic matter, to
allow for a bit of moisture but fast drainage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little rock-garden penstemons have done pretty well in the
East,'' Nold said. ``They're lower to the ground, and if growing in
scree, fast-draining. The heat radiates off the gravel, so they're
drier.''
</P>
<P>
   The only time penstemons like moisture is when they are actively
growing, which can be as early as January in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Nold's advice to Eastern gardeners is to experiment with the
shrubby penstemons native to the Pacific Northwest, which like a
lot of moisture in the summer. ``Those are some of the most
beautiful ones for a rock garden,'' Nold said, reeling off names of
species, like fruticosus, cardwellii and davidsonii.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love all the shrubby penstemons,'' he said. ``I like the
fact that they look like dwarf shrubs. The leathery green foliage
looks nice before they flower, and then they are just smothered
with huge flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   The evergreen rosettes don't shrivel up in winter's cold. And
some, like P. cardwellii, turn from pale green to dusty turquoise
or deep maroon after the first cold snap. ``My advice is to just
try to grow the ones you love,'' Nold said. ``Last time I was back
East, I was astonished to see things growing that I thought did not
like wet conditions. A lot of penstemons are grown in England.''
</P>
<P>
   Most penstemons germinate easily from seed and can be grown as
annuals where conditions don't suit them well enough for them to
grow as perennials.
</P>
<P>
   So why not start now? Nold fills peat pots with soilless mix,
sows the seeds on top, and covers them with about an eighth of an
inch of aquarium gravel or coarse sand, which keeps them damp but
won't let them wash away in the rain. He sets the pots in a dishpan
full of water, to moisten the soilless mix, then sets the pots in
an open cold frame, with a label in each pot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I just let them do their thing,'' he said. &QL;

   WINTER-SOUTH _ ATLANTA _ Snow shovels and mittens are at a
premium in the Deep South. Parts of Arkansas and Mississippi are
buried under more than a foot of snow. It's snowing in Georgia and
forecasters warn that sleet could coat roads and power lines all
the way to the Carolinas by tonight. Snow removal vehicles are on
the roads in Alabama, and the National Guard had to be called out
to rescue more than a-thousand motorists stranded on a snowy
highway last night. The storm hammered Oklahoma and Texas
yesterday, closing schools and businesses and causing airline
cancellations in Dallas. An estimated 40-thousand customers are
still without power from an earlier storm in North Carolina _ and
residents of the Tar Heel state are bracing for more snow.

   BONFIRE _ After the A&AMP;M Bonfire collapsed in 1994, injuring no
one, a professor at the school compiled a paper and alerted the
head of student services of the school about a nagging concern that
he had about the design of the bonfires over the year:
structurally, they were unsafe, he told the university official.
The response, he tells the Statesman in the first extensive
interview on the subject since last year's fatal collapse, was that
he was told, ``This is a student matter.'' He tells the Statesman
that this conversation hit him in a flash of anger shortly after
being called at 5:45 last November and hearing about the tragedy.
He also details for us the gradual evolution of the bonfire
structure dating back to 1948, when he worked on one as a freshman.
The move from a pyramid-style structure to one built like a wedding
cake had some basic structural flaws and there were many red flags
pointing to those flaws over the years, he said, including how
quickly more recent bonfires collapsed after being ignited.

Rudolph still is very much alive _ and very much a danger.

THE VERY IMPORTANT VIP GOODY BAG  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 30) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Md.)  (af) 
 By MONICA CORCORAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The gift bag, aka the goody bag, was once a simple token of
thanks handed out at the end of a party. Remember the favors looted
from a friend's birthday in second grade? Balloons! A Milky Way.
Oh, happy day!
</P>
<P>
   But lately, whether at a charity benefit, a movie premiere or a
store opening, guests are getting, even demanding, gift bags
crammed with a mother lode of gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   Anne-Marie Otey, who is the editor of FashionDish.com, a Web
site that assesses celebrity party attire, collects gift bags for a
monthly column called ``My Goody-Bag Diary,'' in which her
take-home haul on the Hollywood circuit is detailed.
</P>
<P>
   At a party this month announcing nominations for the Independent
Spirit Awards, she received a five-to-six-pound bag containing a
bottle of Turning Leaf Cabernet Sauvignon, a mug containing a
packet of coffee, four Stila lip pencils, one MAC lipstick, a
bottle of Aveda rosemary mint conditioner, a key chain, a
three-pack of Titleist golf balls, a chocolate Motorola StarTAC
phone and a copy of Entertainment Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Receiving such a big bag confirmed Ms. Otey's suspicion that the
Independent Spirit Awards had ``become players by hitting up the
corporate sponsors.'' She added, ``They want to be taken
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Motorola. At the opening of the company's new Los
Angeles store in December, revelers, mainly members of the news
media and people perceived as trendsetters, lugged home a box
loaded with Kiehl's lip balm, shampoo, conditioner and body wash; a
Calvin Klein brushed-nickel picture frame; a certificate for a
complimentary blow-dry at the Frederic Fekkai salon in Beverly
Hills; two nail polishes; lipstick; lip gloss; a day pass to the
Sports Club gym; the same chocolate Motorola phone; and a copy of
the book ``From Abfab to Zen: Paper's Guide to Pop Culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Excessive? Yes. Uncommon? Not at all. Gift bags have been
gaining weight for the last two years, as marketers take over a
practice that was once the province of children's birthday-party
hosts.
</P>
<P>
   The generosity is hardly selfless. In the commerce of
promotional party-giving, goody bags are a key component, designed
to lure guests, push products and indicate the party-giver's
status. The better the loot, the hotter the host. And often the
greedier the guest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great way to get your products into the hands of the
right people,'' said Lara Shriftman, whose publicity firm Harrison
&AMP; Shriftman put together the Motorola party. Like other press
agents, she fills the bags with products made by many of her
clients, not just Motorola, and they are assembled with as much
care as a guest list, to generate buzz.
</P>
<P>
   VIP guests, Hollywood stars and other celebrities get even
better bags. Leonardo DiCaprio got a real Motorola phone. And if
one day he uses it during an interview and the reporter writes,
``Leo's Motorola phone beeps and beeps during lunch,'' the freebie
will have paid off.
</P>
<P>
   So much lovely loot can also turn guests beastly, especially
when they outnumber the goodies. At the Los Angeles premiere party
last fall for ``The World Is Not Enough,'' the crowd panicked when
word got out that the bags were running out.
</P>
<P>
   A line formed. There was jostling. Martinis were spilled.
Bystanders were splashed. When Andrea Bocelli sang at a Hollywood
benefit late last year, attendees stormed the gift-bag distribution
area during his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe what I saw,'' said Britt Johnson, a guest.
``It was like a stampede at the opera.''
</P>
<P>
   Being rewarded for donning a stylish dress and socializing dates
to the early 19th century, said Michael Batterberry, a co-author of
``On the Town in New York,'' a sociological history of partying. He
recalled a Manhattan millionaire who passed out miniature solid
gold replicas of his yacht at a party in the mid-1800s. ``Giving
out favors has always been a vehicle for expressing not only
hospitality, but wealth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Batterberry said he had seen ``very
sophisticated'' guests at New York charity balls ``wafting by
tables and very gracefully, but surreptitiously, stealing goodies
from other people's bags.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those who have it all apparently want a bit more. At a
fund-raiser sponsored by an Italian designer, Marina Rinaldi,
Sharon Stone urgently mouthed ``gift bag'' to her companion before
sweeping out. The bag contained an ivory-colored, pebbled-leather
pocketbook.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stone wasn't interested in talking about the psychology of
gift bags, her publicist said. But Jennifer Tilly, the best
supporting actress of the Hollywood party scene, couldn't say
enough on the subject. She adores them, she said. Her only
complaint is when she doesn't get one, like at a ``Star Wars''
premiere and charity benefit last summer where the bags were
intended for children only.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't even get a `Star Wars' ballpoint pen,'' she said.
``If there's no gift bag, you get very bummed out.''
</P>
<P>
   Another common peeve is the new one-bag-per-couple trend. ``I
hate that, because you have to split the goodies with your date,''
Ms. Tilly said. ``You have to be really generous and say, `No, you
have it,' when you really want it for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   She's not alone. David Washinsky, an account executive at Peggy
Siegal's New York publicity firm, said: ``Now, people aren't happy
with just one gift bag. They want two or three.'' To thwart these
double dippers, he often metes out the bags by hand, one per
attendee.
</P>
<P>
   Like a third-grade teacher, he has grown weary of the wheedling
entreaties from guests. ``Sick relative, busy boss back at the
office _ you name it,'' he sighed. ``Some people will say anything
to get two.''
</P>
<P>
   Others show up just for the handouts. Jessica Paster, a wardrobe
stylist in Los Angeles, said, ``At this point, I only go to parties
to get a gift bag.'' Guests like her are one reason that publicists
and promoters hide the bags until the end of an event.
</P>
<P>
   And guests aren't the only ones acting ungraciously. The
organizers of benefits who approach companies for gift-bag
donations expect more than mere samples. Armed with a list of
high-profile and affluent attendees, they can demand that donors
cough up quality goods.
</P>
<P>
   Jami Morse-Heidegger, the chief executive of Kiehl's, said:
``Lately, they are becoming quite picky and choosy about donations.
I have heard, `If you want to be in our gift bag, we want your
backpack (italics)and(end italics) products.'''
</P>
<P>
   She admitted that she will play the gift-bag game. Kiehl's
donated nearly $500,000 of products to charities last year, she
said. She gets about 20 requests for donations a day, she added,
and employs two full-time staff members to handle inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Like product placement in movies and television, gift-bag
placement has become its own cottage industry. In 1998, Johnson
founded the Los Angeles-based Media Placement, a company that
introduces clients' products to celebrities and trendsetters.
``Neutrogena won't be in the same bag with Kiehl's products,''
Johnson said. ``We ask for a guarantee that we get an exclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Johnson was the host of a holiday party and
decided not to have a gift-bag table, because, he said, ``people
get crazy over them, and I didn't want a riot in my house.''
Instead, women doled out tubes of Smashbox lipsticks.

   And what about the little charity that can't deliver designer
scarves, leather goods and styling gels to its supporters? Daniel
Borochoff, the president of the American Institute of Philanthropy,
a charity watchdog agency in Bethesda, Md., has heard grumblings
about gift bags from charities that tend to keep a lower profile.
``It's really not fair,'' Borochoff said, ``because they don't have
prominent members and they can't get anyone to donate goods.'' &QL;

<P>
   The home video version of ``Star Wars: Episode 1 The Phantom
Menace'' will hit stores worldwide the first week of April, 20th
Century Fox Home Entertainment and Lucasfilm Ltd. loudly trumpeted
this week.
</P>
<P>
   It's something of a movie distribution landmark, the companies
noted, given the challenges getting versions of the film in all the
appropriate languages shipped to all the appropriate sales
locations at one time.
</P>
<P>
   What Fox and Lucasfilm didn't mention, however, was a release
date for a DVD version of 1999's biggest grossing film. That's
particularly odd, given that creator George Lucas made history with
the movie's digital projection in theaters in Burbank, Northridge
and New Jersey last summer.
</P>
<P>
   And Lucas plans to make yet more history with the
high-definition digital video shooting of the next ``Star Wars''
episode. It'll be digital all the way, from whiz-bang effects shots
to the most straightforward close-up of a plain old human, using
special cameras built by Sony and Panavision.
</P>
<P>
   So why no digital version of ``Phantom Menace'' for the home?
It's a question that's consumed a lot of Internet bandwidth in
recent days among the remarkably single-minded fans of the series.
But Fox officials say there's a simple answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that George wants to do something really great
with it, and he doesn't have the time,'' said Fox spokesman Steven
Feldstein. ``He's in preproduction with the next sequel, and is
doing the writing on it. He starts shooting on it this summer. The
DVD format provides the opportunity to do a lot of different
things, but it takes time, and that's the one thing nobody around
here has.''
</P>
<P>
   So despite grossing $922 milllion worldwide so far on ``Phantom
Menace,'' Lucas apparently can't afford to hire decent help to get
the DVD version done.
</P>
<P>
   And don't hold your breath waiting for anything else from that
galaxy far, far away to appear in the new format. Feldstein said
not to anticipate a DVD version of ``any of the Star Wars movies,
clearly not for 2000 or the foreseeable future.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PLAYSTATION 2 BUZZ &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With its Japanese debut just a couple of months off, Sony's
PlayStation 2 is starting to generate buzz in lots of places, even
in other cutting-edge corners of the vast Sony empire.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Williams, president of Sony's Digital Studios Division, is
already salivating over some of the possibilities the machine may
hold for his group, which includes the visual-effects house Sony
Imageworks.
</P>
<P>
   Imageworks, already beaming over the warm reception given its
``Stuart Little'' release, may in the future take some of the
digital characters and other resources it creates for films and put
them right in PlayStation 2 games and other kinds of entertainment,
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, gaming machines weren't really powerful enough to
actually port over the gorgeous animated work of, say, a ``Stuart
Little'' or Pixar's ``Toy Story 2'' characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years, people talked about being able to migrate that
sort of animation into games,'' Williams said. ``The reality was
that by the time you dumbed down the models and shaders to fit
within a conventional gaming environment, there was very little
left. You might as well start over.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney Interactive has come closer than anyone so far to such a
direct transfer, using some of Pixar's motion data from ``Toy Story
2'' to guide the movements of Buzz Lightyear and other characters
in the excellent Toy Story 2 games for PlayStation, PC and Nintendo
64.
</P>
<P>
   But the PS2 could change all that. Its remarkable graphics power
should make it easier to take, say, the red sports car that Stuart
Little drives in the movie and put it directly into a racing game,
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, with the PS2 we actually see an
opportunity for this higher-quality work to be used for gaming,''
Williams said. ``The sheer computing power seems to be there. I'd
hope you'd be able to see the wind rippling through Stuart's hair
over the (car's) windscreen.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he hopes developers will use the PS2's graphic and
computing power to create characters with compelling emotion and
personality, something he said is largely lacking from most current
games.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, ``it could reinvigorate the female sector'' of
the gaming world, Williams said. ``Now you're talking about new
markets, expanding markets, to people who have not picked up on
gaming as we define it today.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams also expects players will have much more control over
their gaming experience, with the ability to custom design the
avatars that represent their characters _ and include much more
interactivity, over the Internet in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the original PlayStation's history is any guide,
it'll be a couple of years before developers fully exploit the new
machine's capabilities. Only now, five years into the PlayStation's
existence, are developers regularly using 95 percent or more of the
aging machine's power, milking surprisingly good graphics and game
play from a relatively decrepit technology. &QL;

 &HT;    McCain campaign hoping 4-state strategy will chip away at Bush
lead
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Everything could go wrong for George W. Bush over
the next few weeks and he still would have primaries in Texas and
Florida to help right his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   These states, which have the second- and fourth-largest
delegations to the Republican National Convention, are governed by
a pair of men named Bush, the candidate and brother Jeb. Their
constituents almost certainly will provide Bush a wealth of
delegates to the Republican National Convention in the March 14
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   And what does John McCain have to fall back on should he
stumble? His seat in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Before McCain can get to the point of contemplating winning the
nomination, he must win in New Hampshire on Tuesday. Then, he must
do very well, if not win, South Carolina on Feb. 19. Three days
later, he must win Arizona, his home state, and make a respectable
showing in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   None of these outcomes is assured, although McCain leads in most
polls in New Hampshire and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain's initial four-state strategy is successful, his
advisers are confident Bush's national campaign will unravel. They
frequently and mockingly cite Bush's campaign office in Guam as an
example of organizational overkill.
</P>
<P>
   Bush strategist Karl Rove has flatly stated that McCain's
four-state approach is fatally flawed. He maintains that a
presidential candidate can be successful only by building a broad
base of support nationally.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, McCain faces a tough road through the nation's
largest states.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, McCain may not be on the March 7 ballot in large
portions of the state because of Bush-backed challenges to his
qualifying petitions. McCain has sued in federal court to get on
the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   In California, by far the biggest prize, McCain's forces are
putting together a volunteer network and are considering an
advertising strategy that would put the candidate on cable
television in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and on over-the-air
stations in smaller inland markets that are rich with GOP voters,
said Frank Riggs, the former California congressman who is backing
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of work ahead of us,'' McCain told California
volunteers by telephone last week following the Republican debate
in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will raise money in the state and speak at the California
Republican convention the first weekend of February. His state
headquarters are in San Diego to stress his Navy career and to
reach out to the many veterans who live there.
</P>
<P>
   His support for campaign finance reform and Bush's record $70
million in campaign donations may work to McCain's advantage in
California, where voters have punished big money candidates before,
said Jack Pitney, a political science professor at Claremont
McKenna College outside Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's appeal to independents and Democrats is all for
naught in California. They can vote in the state's open primary
March 7, but only the votes of registered Republicans count toward
awarding delegates. And California is a winner-take-all primary for
the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Pitney said it is hard to envision McCain winning the nomination
without winning California's delegates.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain were to win the overall popular vote, but lose among
Republicans, he ``could claim a moral victory as he puts on his
Bush button,'' Pitney said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's hopes rest, in part, on his agenda of reform and
compelling personal story. But the campaign also proceeds on the
belief that Bush's support is ``a mile wide, but only an inch
deep,'' said Ken Khachigian, a veteran California political
operative and McCain adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Early victories, in their view, will strip away Bush's halo of
inevitability and help to negate his huge advantage in campaign
money and organization. No one in McCain's campaign disputes that
he trails Bush by wide margins in most states. A new California
poll gives Bush a 33-point lead over McCain, 49 percent to 16
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But they point out that McCain has cut Bush's lead in every
state in which he's campaigned. ``The trend is positive
everywhere,'' campaign manager Rick Davis said. ``Everywhere people
get a look at both of them, McCain's numbers go up and Bush's go
down.''
</P>
<P>
   And Khachigian reflected the widespread belief of McCain aides
that those poll numbers would change even more dramatically if Bush
were to lose a number of primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phenomenon most people don't understand is that Bush is a
candidate with 60 percent in the polls, monster money and high name
ID,'' he said. ``So Mr. 60 Percent got 41 percent in Iowa. He'll
get 34, 35, maybe 36 percent in New Hampshire. That's going to be a
slight wake up call to the public. The alarm is buzzing very
lightly. `Wait a minute, we thought he was at 60 percent.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio voters, who go to the polls March 7, may be among those who
would begin to take notice, said Eric Rademacher, co-director of
the University of Cincinnati's Ohio Poll.
</P>
<P>
   Bush held a whopping 45-point lead over McCain in the most
recent Ohio Poll, 64 percent to 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the survey also turned up ``a wait-and-see attitude'' among
many voters that a string of McCain victories could affect,
Rademacher said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Mike DeWine, a McCain supporter, said he would
advise the campaign not to make any decisions about television
advertising until March 7 nears. ``The average voter is not focused
yet and the reality is that by time that happens, this will be a
national campaign,'' DeWine said.
</P>
<P>
   Also on March 7, McCain could make a strong showing in New
England, his aides said. In Massachusetts, in particular, McCain
already has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on Boston
television because it reaches into southern New Hampshire.

<P>
   In the late 1950s, Sir Alec Issigonis of British Motor Corp. set
out to design the smallest possible car that could hold four people
comfortably, plus luggage. He came up with the Mini, just 10 feet
long, 4 feet high and 4 feet wide.
</P>
<P>
   To open up space in so small a package, Issigonis tried
something new, mounting the tiny engine sideways. This layout _
transverse engine, front-wheel drive _ gained credence over the
following decades and is commonly used today.
</P>
<P>
   Although the $1,295 car reached the market in the chrome-finned
year of 1959, the British public gave the Mini a collective hug. It
became a national symbol, a fashion statement _ Mary Quant's
miniskirt drew on its name _ and a favorite of enthusiasts, who
celebrated its simplicity, its direct handling and its infinite
possibilities for customization. ``Even members of the royal family
were seen around town in the cheeky autos,'' said Tom Purves, U.S.
chairman of the BMW Group, which now owns the Mini through its
Rover subsidiary. Celebrities like Peter Sellers and Sir Paul
McCartney got their own.
</P>
<P>
   After years of rumors, BMW recently announced that in 2001 it
would introduce an all-new Mini _ the car's first complete redesign
_ and that it would be sold in the United States. The original was
imported for only seven years, ending in 1967; some 20 owners'
clubs keep the flame alive.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the BMW Group, Dave Buchko, said the company had
not decided whether to sell Minis through BMW or Land Rover
dealers, or both. Only the highest-performance version, the Mini
Cooper S with 155 horsepower (the original had 35) is likely to
reach the United States. The Volkswagen New Beetle, which generally
sells for less than $20,000, is a natural target.
</P>
<P>
   About 5.3 million Minis have been sold since '59; the original
is still built in Birmingham, England. The car is so highly
regarded that international auto writers recently ranked it second
to the Ford Model T among the most significant cars of the 20th
century.

DO ADDITIONAL ROADS INCREASE CONGESTION? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., N.C.)  (js) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Faced with a chronically congested two-lane road,
many highway departments send in construction crews to expand it.
Within a few years, they have a chronically congested four-lane
road instead.
</P>
<P>
   As congestion increases, many people are calling for bigger
roads and bridges, but some engineers and researchers who oppose
highway construction say those new miles of lanes will draw new
traffic, in a phenomenon that they call `induced travel.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of transportation experts from around the country spent
three hours debating the topic at the recent annual meeting here of
the Transportation Research Board. They argued about definitions
and about what was the cause and what was the effect. They did not
agree on how much of a problem induced travel really is. They did,
however, lay out reasons to suspect that it is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, a new lane is good, because it reduces the cost of
travel. That is because, according to one paper presented at the
meeting, a new road or new miles of lanes reduce congestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some level of congestion, any given driver will choose to
avoid dealing with that congestion, either in favor of an
alternative route, an alternative mode, changing the departure time
of the trip, a shorter trip to a similar activity, or avoiding the
trip entirely,'' said the paper by Lewis M. Fulton, a researcher at
the International Energy Agency in Paris, and three colleagues, two
American and one British. But if the ``cost'' of that travel is
reduced, they wrote, it is like cutting the price of an item in a
supermarket; demand for it will suddenly rise.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as a Kevin Costner movie once surmised in a different
context, ``If you build it, they will come.''
</P>
<P>
   Another researcher, Lawrence Barr, of the Volpe National
Transportation Systems Center, a Transportation Department research
office in Cambridge, Mass., said census data showed that of the
time drivers saved with new roads, they spent 30 percent to 50
percent of it driving farther. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In their study, Fulton and his colleagues used figures on the
growth in road-miles and the growth in vehicle-miles traveled in
Maryland, Virginia, the District of Columbia and North Carolina.
Deciding which is the cause and which is the effect is complicated,
the authors acknowledged, because roads are built either in
anticipation of new traffic or as a result of increased traffic. Or
the roads may themselves stimulate more development, leading to
congestion.
</P>
<P>
   But the study found that in the short run, adding lanes would
increase demand for road space by 20 percent to 60 percent. In the
long run, it could raise demand by 100 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One result, Fulton said, is that a city that expands a road to
eliminate an area of stop-and-go traffic _ where idling cars
produce extra pollution _ may be taking the wrong tack. ``You're
not going to reduce either emissions or congestion as much as you
think, because you're going to trigger this additional travel,'' he
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But others suggested that if a new road filled quickly with
traffic, it could be relieving congestion elsewhere, and that no
road in a network could be examined in isolation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some highway engineers doubt that the induced-travel phenomenon
exists, or say that if it does, it is not a big cause of
congestion. The number of miles driven rises by 2 percent or 3
percent a year, but beyond roads there are many other reasons,
including population growth, more women in the work force and an
economic boom that has raised the number of cars in each
household. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two researchers at the University of North Carolina at
Charlotte, David T. Hartgen and Daniel O. Curley, studied the 65
largest metropolitan areas from 1990 to 1997, to see which had
built beltways in that period. Beltways are often linked to sprawl,
but the researchers found no links between beltway construction and
traffic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``No-belt and partial-belt cites have grown faster in area,
population and employment than full-belt and mostly belt cities,''
Hartgen said. All of the cities, with beltways or without, became
less densely populated, meaning that people were dispersing to a
larger area.
</P>
<P>
   One speaker from outside academia, Neil J. Pederson, planning
director of the Maryland State Highway Administration, said that
induced travel clearly was taking place but that recent experience
showed this could not be used as a tool for development. Maryland
had built improved roads in its western panhandle, the part
squeezed between West Virginia and Pennsylvania, to try to
stimulate economic growth there, but the growth failed to follow.
``Providing highway capacity will not in and of itself cause growth
to occur if there is not latent demand,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And the county in his state that has shown the greatest growth
in the last 10 years, St. Mary's, south of Washington, has had no
new highways at all.
</P>
<P>
   Over all in the state, travel is growing twice as fast as the
population and about 10 times faster than the number of lane-miles,
he said. One factor driving growth was a loss of jobs in Baltimore
and growth in the Washington area, leading people to drive between
the two urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Pederson said that Maryland backed ``smart growth,'' an effort
to limit congestion and encourage a balanced transportation system,
but he gave two reasons that growth must include new roads. One is
that if the highways in an urban area become too congested,
developers will start building farther and farther out, which will
make people drive even more. The other, he said, is that developers
would not build offices and shops near transit stations unless they
also had highway access, since the commercial buildings have to be
served by trucks.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Norwegian officials say they have found a way to cut teen-age
highway deaths substantially: teach them to be back-seat drivers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A campaign called Speak Out urges young passengers to complain
if the driver goes too fast or behaves recklessly. Studying a rural
coastal county, Sogn og Fjordane, which began the program in 1993,
researchers found that the number of passengers from 16 to 19 years
old who were killed or injured fell by about 30 percent. The number
of drivers in that age group who were killed or injured did not
change, however.
</P>
<P>
   The program, including videos, lectures and T-shirts and key
rings with the Speak Out slogan, is a version of ``Friends don't
let friends drive drunk'' campaign but focuses on how people behave
once they are in cars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rune Elvik, a researcher at the Institute of Transport Economics
in Oslo, said that the campaign might have made some drivers act
more prudently and might have persuaded some teen-age passengers
not to ride with drivers who take risks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elvik, in an e-mail reply to the question of whether it was
difficult to encourage teen-agers to criticize each other or older
drivers, said that they were quite willing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign did not preach morals,'' he said. ``It simply
appealed to the fact that many young girls are afraid of riding
with slightly drunk boys who drive very fast. The girls are not
impressed by such behavior, contrary to what many boys think.''

OFF THE ROCK: MARTHA'S VINEYARD RESIDENTS ENJOY OTHER ISLANDS IN
WINTER

<P>
   In a few days, Mick Stevens, a New Yorker magazine contributing
cartoonist and a year-round resident of Martha's Vineyard, will
return for five weeks to the Caribbean island where he has spent
the last four winters.
</P>
<P>
   A generally affable man, Stevens categorically, unconditionally
refuses to divulge the name of the island, fearing that publicity
will lead to the despoilment of his hideaway. ``I'm an island snob,
an elitist,'' Stevens, 57, said. ``I don't want it to become
another tourist trap.''
</P>
<P>
   He tries to travel only to islands. ``I love islands because I
like being away from malls and all the other commercial aspects of
America,'' he said. ``I like the sense of a small community on
islands. I like waving at people on the road from my pickup. I just
came back from a trip to the mainland. I don't like it out there.''
</P>
<P>
   This time of year, when the interminable tourist season has
gasped its last breath, and retailers on this island seven miles
off Cape Cod have squeezed the last dollar out of visitors,
residents like to ``get off the rock,'' as they say.
</P>
<P>
   And where do many of them go? To the Bahamas, Caymans, Turks and
Caicos, Jamaica, Bequia, Iceland, the Azores, Puerto Rico, Bali,
Rhodes, the Canaries, Florida Keys, Galapagos, St. John, Eleuthera
and the Seychelles, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   Vineyard residents, who might be expected to relish the chance
to drive two hours without circling round to their starting point
or to have a choice of more than two movie theaters, take vacations
surprisingly often on other islands. Why they do so says much about
why they live on Martha's Vineyard and about the ways island life
grows on you until no alternative seems sane.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Logue, who retired to West Tisbury three years ago after
having spent many summers on the Vineyard, will spend a month on
St. John, in the U.S. &UR;  &LR; Virgin Islands, as he and his family have
done for nine years. ``I don't know what the Vineyard would be like
12 months a year, and I don't intend to find out,'' said Logue, who
last week shipped three cartons of books to himself to read on
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Wilbur, of Oak Bluffs, who supervises a program for the
elderly and has lived here for more than 20 years, will also go to
St. John, for the seventh year. Jan Schulze, owner of Free Spirit
Travel in West Tisbury, said island travel, from first class to
budget, is the bread and butter of her business.
</P>
<P>
   And no fewer than three Vineyard librarians _ Patricia Carlet of
the Edgartown School's library, Cathy Thompson of the Chilmark
Public Library and Mary Jo Joiner of the West Tisbury Public
Library _ are frequent island visitors. ``Islands have discrete and
well-defined boundaries,'' Ms. Joiner said. ``Librarians like that.
We're anal compulsive.''
</P>
<P>
   The tendency of Vineyarders to visit islands seems
counterintuitive, but only to those whom islanders call
landlubbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a remarkably high number of islanders here who are
afraid to leave,'' said Dr. Charles Silberstein, an attending
psychiatrist at Martha's Vineyard Hospital, who has lived on the
Vineyard since 1995. ``When they go to the other side, they find
they can't drive, they have panic attacks, they have trouble
socializing, they have trouble coping. Some have such a phobia,
they go years without leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   When they do leave, he added, it makes sense that they would be
most secure on other islands. ``There's something comforting and
reassuring about an island to islanders,'' Silberstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is circumscribed geographically and in the ways islanders
tacitly agree to behave,'' he continued. ``Life seems predictable,
though that's not always as true as it feels. There's long been a
sense of being safe surrounded by water. In medieval Europe, they
created islands of safety by building moats around their castles.
I'd be surprised if there aren't some psychoanalysts who would
associate that comfort on islands with memories of being in the
womb, also surrounded by water.''
</P>
<P>
   Coco Adams of Chilmark said, ``Who wants to go to a city?'' She
has been to most islands in the Caribbean. ``If you gave me a suite
at the Plaza in New York, I wouldn't go,'' she continued. ``The
pace of life is too frenetic. You see homeless people sleeping on
the street. Islands, and island people, are pleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Adams, who juggles jobs as a chef, bartender and travel
agent, is one of many Vineyarders who visit warm-weather islands in
winter to enjoy some of what they love here but never seem to have
time for in summer. ``It gets so crazy here now in the summer,''
she lamented. ``I work so hard I don't even see a beach for three
months.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Islanders point out the special milieu of a life surrounded by
water. ``People on islands have a reputation for not being
conventional,'' said Ms. Joiner, the librarian. ``We have our share
of characters here. Sometimes I feel I'm walking on the set of a B
movie. But we appreciate and tolerate those differences. We assume
that when we go to another island, we'll also be appreciated in the
same way, and they know we'll do the same for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carlet, the Edgartown School librarian, who has lived on the
Vineyard since 1972, said: ``Everyone here knows everyone else's
business. One of the big pastimes is raking everybody over the
coals. If you can't deal with that, then you'll have a rough time
living on an island. But when there's a crisis, everybody helps out
everybody else. It doesn't matter what background or neighborhood
you come from.''
</P>
<P>
   She finds the same is true on St. John, where she is building a
house with her husband, David Ferraguzzi, a contractor and soccer
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Among other assumptions islanders make is that their
counterparts on other islands are generally laid back, but harried
by tourists. ``When I'm on another island, I'm aware merchants I'm
interacting with may have an ambivalence or even a love-hate
relationship with me as a tourist, because I know people here feel
that way,'' said Steve Fox, a medical writer based in Chilmark. ``I
tend to cut people on other islands a lot of slack because of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   To Paul Theroux, the travel writer, who owns homes in Hawaii and
Cape Cod, the appeal of island life is elemental. ``An island isn't
just the land,'' he said. ``It's also all the water that surrounds
it. People who land on islands and don't swim or boat don't
appreciate islands. The Phoenicians thought that every day spent on
water was a day not subtracted from the end of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Theroux's latest book, ``Fresh Air Fiend,'' to be published in
May by Houghton Mifflin, includes an essay about paddling his kayak
across Nantucket Sound to Martha's Vineyard. ``Islands are such
salubrious places,'' he said. ``It's no mystery why one goes from
one salubrious place to another. It's a much bigger mystery why
people go to big cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all islanders go to warm climes. Arlan Wise, an astrologer
who lives in Chilmark, went to the Isle of Wight, off the south
coast of England, one December. ``Islanders know that the best time
to go to an island is in the off-season,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Vineyarders can't help comparing their own island with the
one they're visiting. The Vineyard does not always win.
``Vineyarders love some of the islands we send them to because they
remind them of the way it used to be here,'' said Bette Decoteau,
who owns Avenue to Travel, in Vineyard Haven.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. John is laid back,'' Ms. Wilbur said. ``The beauty reminds
me of this island many, many years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Furlong, of Chilmark, who plans corporate meetings
around the world (on islands as frequently as he can get away with
it), has traveled to Kauai, Maui, Lanai, St. Martin, St. Bart,
Puerto Rico and the Bahamas with his wife and three daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go looking for the perfect island but come home realizing
it's the one we live on,'' he said.

 &HT;    At the dawn of each school day, Mormon teenagers around the
nation gather to study their faith before heading off to secular
classes
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The rest of Northgate High School's classrooms are
dark when a custodian lets Donna Clark and her students into the
room at the end of the hall decorated for classes in French and
German.
</P>
<P>
   Clark is here in this Coweta County, Ga., school at 7:30 a.m. to
teach a group of 15 another subject _ religion. The students are
mostly Mormons, as members of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints are commonly known. And Clark is an instructor
for the church's seminary _ its religious education program for
high-schoolers.
</P>
<P>
   In metro Atlanta, 108 volunteers teach 1,067 Mormon high school
seminarians. Across the country, 237,302 youth are enrolled in the
program, meeting each weekday to study the Bible, the Book of
Mormon and other church literature and discuss how to apply the
works to their lives.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Clark, plump and motherly with a biting sense of
humor, leads her pupils through a discussion of the Ten
Commandments. She rewards them with bags of Skittles if they catch
a mistake (a ``not'' left out of one of the ``Thou Shalt Nots'' on
the board, for instance). Between the singing, Scripture readings
and interpretation, a few personal nuggets come out.
</P>
<P>
   Take ``Honor thy father and thy mother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know my mother and I don't get along,'' one girl blurts
out. Clark takes the comment in stride and asks in a nonaccusatory
tone, ``Do you think your attitude might have something to do with
that?''
</P>
<P>
   From there, talk gets around to the need to show respect for
one's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel comfortable saying things to the class and knowing it
will stay in the class,'' said Russell Jensen, 15, a 10th-grader at
Northgate.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, the second oldest of seven children in his family, is
in his second year of seminary at Northgate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a few mornings when I just don't want to get out of
bed. It's just too early,'' he admits. ``A lot of times I'm late
because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, participating in seminary ``kind of keeps me
living righteously. It's nice to be there with other people
thinking the same things, who are there for the same reason.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps your day start a lot better,'' said Jenna Konnad, 15,
also a sophomore at Northgate. ``When you finish, you go right to
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenna, the middle of five children in her family, is carrying on
a family tradition. Her two older siblings and both her parents
finished four years of Mormon seminary in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Northgate Principal Wayne Outlaw, a Southern Baptist, agrees
with his Mormon students' assessment of seminary.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about some very relevant issues to today's youth,''
he said. ``I think to an extent, it prepares students to get into a
good frame of mind for the day's classes.''
</P>
<P>
   Teaching church doctrine is the first step toward forming a
church community that lives by what it believes, said Elder Henry
Eyring, the Mormon leader in charge of the church's international
educational programs. ``If you can know the doctrine and believe
it, the rest will come,'' he said during a visit to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Eyring estimates that 65 percent of Mormon youth in the United
States are enrolled in seminary programs _ up from years past.
</P>
<P>
   In heavily Latter-day Saints states such as Utah and Idaho,
students are released for church classes during the school day.
Elsewhere, they usually attend in the early morning hours before
school begins.
</P>
<P>
   In some metro Atlanta systems, they meet in school buildings _
but like other religious groups are not sponsored by the school or
any member of its faculty. In other neighborhoods, they meet in
nearby Latter-day Saints churches or in private homes.
</P>
<P>
   Eyring said he believes the success of the seminaries will be
measured in the next world by the number of today's youth who are
``sealed'' with their families forever, according to church
doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints puts great stock
in marriage and teaches that a husband and wife who have had their
relationship ``sealed'' by the church can be married throughout
eternity. This can be done only in a Mormon temple, and temple
admission is restricted to church members who are certified by
their leaders as leading moral lives, dealing honestly in business
and being faithful in their tithes to the church.
</P>
<P>
   In this world, participating in seminary not only teaches youth
what their church expects of them, but also builds relationships
between participants, some seminarians say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually you'll see your church friends Wednesday nights and
Sundays,'' said Andrea Whipple, 17, a junior at Salem High School
in Conyers, Ga. ``When you see them every day, you get to know them
a lot more. There's a lot of interaction in class. You get to see
what they're really like.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of helps you become friends with everybody else there
that early in the morning,'' said Brad Wilcox, 17, a junior at
Centennial High School in Roswell, Ga. That extends even to his
classmate and sister Ashley, 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become closer friends and stuff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, 42, a homemaker who has four children of her own, ages 9
to 18, is realistic about her students. Asked how she helps them
handle crises, she replies, ``At 7:30 in the morning in a
teenager's life, I believe every day is a crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   She came into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
during her own teenage years when she was invited by a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was searching for answers to really important questions,''
she said. ``I found every answer here. The doctrine of the church
just fits.''
</P>
<P>
   She was chosen and trained by the church for this role and, in
her second year of solo classroom work, said she thrives on the
spirit, abilities and potential of her students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about them, I worry about them, I pray about them,''
she said. Addressed by her students as Sister Clark, the typical
title for a Mormon woman, she said she strives to gain and keep
their trust.
</P>
<P>
   Her own beliefs were put to the test last year when she had to
guide her students through the Scriptures after the shooting at
Columbine High School in Colorado and threats at Northgate that
followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sort of set lessons aside and discussed faith, not fear,''
she said. ``It was a time when I had to say, `OK, do I believe
this? Am I firm in my belief? Then I need to help these youth
become firm in theirs.'''

 &HT;    Same old song: Virginia postpones picking anthem
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 30.
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe the Virginia Legislature should resurrect ``Carry Me Back
to Old Virginia'' as the state song but leave out the lyrics and
call it the official state hum.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it should choose the lyrically fuzzy ``Louie Louie.''
Or Beethoven's ``Ode to Joy'' in its original German.
</P>
<P>
   Or just decide that Virginia, the only state without an official
ditty, doesn't need one.
</P>
<P>
   Such ideas are being bandied about now that, after a year of
heated controversy and name-calling, the Legislature has put off
until next January the adoption of a new state song.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carry Me Back'' was retired three years ago, because of its
references to ``old massa'' and ``darkeys.'' A 12-member panel of
lawmakers and musicians was named to find a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   The panel was deluged with 339 entries, which it whittled down
to eight finalists. But when the time came to pick a winner this
month, the panelists balked.
</P>
<P>
   By the committee's reckoning, an anthem titled ``Virginia,'' by
entertainer and sausage mogul Jimmy Dean and his singer-wife,
Donna, rated first among the finalists. But writers whose songs had
been axed accused Dean of peddling influence with ``sausage money''
and complained that the committee didn't follow its own contest
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Now the panel is looking for a way to finish its job without its
own members having to make the decision. Ideas include getting
schoolchildren to cast ballots for their favorites.
</P>
<P>
   But that leaves the writers whose songs lost out demanding that
the whole process start over. Candie Lamaire, whose song didn't
make the cut, says the process was tainted because Dean is a
longtime contributor to Republican causes and donated to the
campaign of a legislator on the song panel. So the Legislature
seems stymied over what should be a simple matter, says Jay DeBoer,
a House of Delegates member.
</P>
<P>
   ``This and other time-drainers occur because individual
legislators attempt to respond to individual constituent
requests,'' he says. ```Make my song the official song, clay the
official dirt, the tiger swallowtail the official insect, milk the
official drink, oxygen the official gas and ``Why can't we go to
Disney World?'' the official whine.' Sometimes, the best response
is `no.'''
</P>
<P>
   In a tongue-in-cheek protest, DeBoer once nominated ``Louie
Louie'' as the new state song. Now he quips, ``If you want a truly
objective song, program a computer to write it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean, who won a Grammy Award in 1961 for ``Big Bad John'' and is
the largest stockholder in Sara Lee, which makes sausages under his
name, says he won't be too upset if his song doesn't make the final
cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, every day of my life is `Groundhog Day,''' Dean
laughs. ``We'll just keep making sausage and go on.''

 &HT;    Music strikes right note with Arietha Lockhart
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Arietha Lockhart's lovely voice is her calling card.
</P>
<P>
   It can be heard on one of the first Robert Shaw Institute
recordings from Dordogne, France. It can frequently be heard
soloing with groups such as the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the
Michael O'Neal Singers in metro Atlanta. On Sunday, she sings at
Spivey Hall in Morrow, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't stop there, though. She plays at least one instrument
from every musical family, from piano (her major at the University
of Alabama) to baritone to flute. She started on the flute in fifth
grade because ``our school had a band but didn't have a chorus.''
At Alabama, the Million Dollar Band that accompanies the Crimson
Tide had too many woodwinds, so she picked up the baritone (and a
fingering chart) and learned to oom-pah in three weeks. At Medlock
Elementary School in Decatur, Ga., where she's taught for two
years, she plays recorder with the fifth- and sixth-graders and
percussion instruments with the younger kids.
</P>
<P>
   Only the baritone proved difficult, she says. Not in learning
how to play it, but in carrying around all that brass. And she
found out the baritone plays more than oom-pah accompaniments. At
her first game, the band played a Sousa march and ``it was all
chromatic scales!''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people didn't understand me. I didn't understand me
too well, either,'' she says, citing her college music calendar,
which included band, several choruses, a piano ensemble and private
lessons in flute, piano and voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved music so much that I wanted to soak it up like a
sponge,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Today, at 38, her calendar is still packed _ with 360 children.
At Medlock, she changes classes every half-hour, carrying
instruments and teaching materials around to classrooms of all
seven grades and two sections of developmentally challenged
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a full day,'' she says, ``and a lot of the teachers'' _
herself among them _ ``teach from the time they walk in the door in
the morning till the time the kids leave in the afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Her schedule is so crammed that she could talk about her life
and music only on the holiday celebrating the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr.'s birthday. So she honored the day by wearing a sweatshirt
emblazoned with King's face and ``Let Freedom Ring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A true teacher is like a true minister,'' Medlock principal
Betty Rucker says of her colleague. ``They are called to this
profession. Arietha is a true teacher. I pat myself on the back
whenever I watch her, because I was responsible for hiring her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a teacher, you become super special to the kids, and they
will try anything you ask them to try,'' Lockhart says. ``They
don't care if you're having a bad day or look awful. They love you
because you're bringing them the music. They see you in the hallway
and ask: `Is it our day for music?!' They give you more than you
can ever give back.''
</P>
<P>
   The child of two teachers, Lockhart grew up in south Alabama in
a small town called Brewton. Her father, George Hubert Lockhart
Sr., a former Negro League baseball player with the Atlanta Black
Crackers, taught physical education and English literature for 42
years at Alabama State University, where he also was head football
and baseball coach. Her mother, Ruth, was a public school teacher
for 35 years, handling all grades from kindergarten to high school.
</P>
<P>
   Though her father was a good amateur tenor who sang at church,
as well as playing piano and organ, he died when Lockhart was 8.
``I don't remember hearing him play, and I never heard him sing,''
she says. ``But he had a large record collection, with Caruso and
Rosa Ponselle _ and Art Tatum and the jazz greats, too.'' She was
the only one of five children to inherit the musical gene.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first memory of singing is when I was about 4 years old,''
she says. ``I sang `It Is No Secret,' a gospel spiritual, in
church.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 she graduated from the University of Alabama and ``came
straight up here (to Atlanta) and have been here ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   For that, she had advice. A summer scholarship had taken her to
the Chautauqua Institute in upstate New York, where her principal
coach was Stephen Blier, now co-artistic director of the New York
Festival of Song and a commentator on Metropolitan Opera
broadcasts. He found out that she had applied to teach in Atlanta.
``When you're there,'' he said, ``you must hook up with the Atlanta
Symphony and Robert Shaw.''
</P>
<P>
   She joined the ASO Chorus almost as soon as she arrived. ``It's
my stress-buster from teaching,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She happened to be seated right behind Caroline Shaw, the
conductor's wife, who turned around during the first rehearsal and
said: ``I've got to have Bobby hear you.'' He did, and Lockhart
became a member of the elite Chamber Chorus as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arietha Lockhart is a young artist of taste and intelligence
with a very beautiful high soprano voice,'' Shaw wrote in one of
his rarely issued references.
</P>
<P>
   Between the ASO Chorus, the Chamber Chorus, the Shaw Institutes
in France and New York, and solos in several works, Lockhart may
have more kinds of experience with Shaw than most other singers.
``It was impossible to spend any time with Shaw and not come away
richer,'' she says. ``He wasn't satisfied to tell you just to fix
something that was wrong. He wanted to find a better way.''
</P>
<P>
   He influenced her as a teacher as well as as singer. ``What I've
absorbed from working with Robert Shaw was how to break down
something to its most elemental level and bring it back up.'' There
was something else. ``You don't have a whole lot of time in
elementary school _ and Mr. Shaw never wasted anyone's time.''
</P>
<P>
   As her solo singing has become more in demand, Lockhart has made
trade-offs. For a while, she taught piano; she's since given it up.
For 10 years, she was minister of music at Decatur AME Zion Church,
near her home. But the demands of the job were finally too much.
These days, she is artist-in-residence with First Christian Church
of Atlanta and sings solos at other churches. She has been guest
artist with the Alpharetta Chamber Singers, Augusta Choral Society
and Chattanooga Choral Society. She has sung the role of Frasquita
in the ASO's 1998 concert version of ``Carmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Last March, she had the unprecedented challenge of singing _
within 24 hours _ the solos in both of Haydn's oratorios. She
shared those for ``The Seasons'' with ASO Chorus member Patricia
Nealon, learning them in record time when Canadian soprano
Dominique Labelle called in sick at 5 on the afternoon of the
performance. The next day she sang the solos in ``The Creation''
with the Michael O'Neal Singers.
</P>
<P>
   The last time she saw Shaw, after the 1998 ``Christmas With
Robert Shaw'' concerts, he told her: ``Lockhart, you done good,
kid.'' If he'd been around for the Haydn double bill, he'd no doubt
have said the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart fits her out-of-town work around her school schedule.
When she sang at Carnegie Hall with Shaw's choral workshops, she
took personal days to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But she has never been able to take the plunge into full-time
singing. ``I've tried to kick her out of here on several
occasions,'' says Elizabeth Colson, the teacher with whom she's
worked since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about it,'' Lockhart says. ``And I'm still
thinking.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With one arm around each of the grandmothers of
Elian Gonzalez, Sen. Dianne Feinstein on Friday reassured them that
American law is on their side and predicted their grandson will be
returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting for 45 minutes with Raquel Rodriguez and Mariela
Quintana, Feinstein described them as ``heartbroken'' and
``sobbing'' and said she would do ``whatever I can'' to protect
their rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have just spent some time with two women who were very
intimidated, very fearful and very concerned,'' Feinstein,
D-Calif., said outside her Senate office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandmothers should not have to go through this and politics
should not enter into it,'' she said. ``I believe that justice is
going to find its way. I just hope it's soon because politics and
political movements shouldn't use children to meet their
priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered the
American relatives of Elian Gonzalez, 6, to return the boy to his
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian Gonzalez, who was 5 at the time, was found clinging to an
inner tube off the coast of Florida on Nov. 25 after the boat
carrying him to the United States capsized, killing his mother, her
boyfriend and nine other people.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Friday, the Florida nun whose Miami Beach home was
used earlier in the week for a meeting between the boy and his
grandmothers abruptly threw off her impartiality and came out in
favor of keeping the boy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Following a meeting with members of Congress in Washington,
Dominican Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin said: ``The child has been in
the torment of the seas and now he's been in the torment of
political agendas. Somehow we must find for him calm seas, at least
for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin also met with Attorney General Jane Reno in hopes of
persuading her to withdraw the INS order to send the boy back to
Cuba. But Reno, who oversees the immigration agency, refused to
budge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I continue to believe, based on all the information available
to me, including the information that Sister Jeanne shared with me,
that the person who speaks for this child is his one surviving
parent _ his father,'' Reno said in a statement released after the
meeting.The grandmothers spent a third day Friday meeting with
lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Besides Feinstein, the women met with
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Reps. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., and
George R. Nethercutt Jr., R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said she told Rodriguez and Quintana that U.S. law and
immigration policies are on their side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian has a father who loves him and has a home for him in
Cuba. In our society there are basic rights _ that includes the
right of a father to have a son back.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein called congressional efforts to grant Elian Gonzalez
citizenship so he can remain with his Florida relatives are
``terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's relatives in Florida are fighting to prevent his
return to Cuba, arguing that it was the wish of his mother for the
boy to live in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, however, said ``a gold chain, a baseball cap, a trip
to Disney Land and American razzle-dazzle'' are confusing the
6-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   She added that if the Cuban boy returns home and the father
decides to bring Elian back to the United States ``on his own
volition, that's another story.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Snow and ice will plague a large area from the central
Mississippi and Ohio Valleys to the southern Appalachians as a
broad flow of moist air is forced to rise over chilly air in place
over these regions. Meanwhile, sprawling high pressure will keep
most of the North and West dry with ample sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Early Saturday, ice will cling to cold objects near the ground
in many valleys of the interior Southeast as rain falls into a
shallow layer of subfreezing air near the ground. The shallow chill
will gradually be eroded over portions of the eastern Tennessee
Valley during the day, allowing temperatures slowly to rise above
freezing. In valleys east of the crest of the Appalachians, winds
from the northeast will continually renew the shallow cold-air
mass, heightening the risk of damaging accumulations of ice on
trees and power lines. Meanwhile, showery rain will fall across the
southern Gulf Coast states. A line of strong thunderstorms will
move off the east coast of Florida early Saturday, but light
showers will linger in northern Florida for much of the day.
Farther west, low clouds will persist in the southern Plains and
Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   After a frigid dawn in the Northeast, plentiful sunshine will
help boost temperatures to seasonably cold levels by afternoon.
Readings will fall rapidly again after sunset as high pressure
promotes another night with clear skies and light winds.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, the interior will be dry and chilly with ample
sunshine. Clouds will increase near the California coast later
Saturday as a disturbance approaches from the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Cold Air Damming
</P>
<P>
   Ice and snow in northeast Georgia would often not occur were it
not for the Appalachians. Indeed, the mountain range makes it
possible for cold air associated with a high pressure system over
the northern Middle Atlantic or Northeast states to drain farther
south than it otherwise would. As cold air from high pressure laps
against the mountainous dam posed by the eastern slopes of the
Appalachians, it sloshes south toward the Carolinas and Georgia.
Such a process of ``cold air damming'' will set the stage for ice
and snow in the region Saturday.

 &HT;    NUN SPLITS FROM RENO AND ABANDONS NEUTRALITY, SUPPORTS U.S.
CITIZENSHIP FOR ELIAN
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, the nun who hosted the
meeting between Cuban shipwreck survivor Elian Gonzalez and his
grandmothers, came to Washington Friday to urge lawmakers and her
old friend, Attorney General Janet Reno, to let the boy remain in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin, president of Barry University in Miami, said that
after witnessing the interaction between 6-year-old Elian and his
grandmothers, she now supports the Congress granting the child U.S.
citizenship so his fate can be decided by a state court.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional leadership, however, continued to back-pedal
Friday away from taking action anytime soon as a spokesman for
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said he would
likely await a federal court decision before considering the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   And after meeting with Reno, O'Laughlin noted that she and the
attorney general differ on what should be Elian's future. Reno
supports an Immigration and Naturalization Service ruling that only
the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez _ who remains in Cuba _ can
legally speak for Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would only change her mind if she could find a legal
reason to change her mind and could find adequate evidence to do
so,'' said O'Laughlin, who has known Reno since the nation's chief
law officer was a state attorney in Miami two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said in a statement issued after the meeting that she would
``always consider new information.''
</P>
<P>
   ``However, I continue to believe, based on all the information
available to me, including the information that Sister Jeanne
shared with me, that the person who speaks for this child is his
one surviving parent _ his father,'' she said. ``This case is now
before a federal court. I continue to hope that the matter will be
resolved as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler on Friday moved
up the hearing date for a crucial part of the lawsuit filed by
Elian's Miami relatives in their bid to keep him in the U.S.,
saying lawyers should be ready to argue the matter of jurisdiction
on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Hoeveler had set the hearing for sometime after
March 6, but told attorneys Friday that the issue of whether his
court has jurisdiction shouldn't take as much time to prepare.
Lawyers will still have until March to prepare for the other parts
of the case, which revolve around the Miami family's request that
the boy be granted an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Elian's grandmothers, Mariela Quintana and Raquel
Rodriguez, continued meeting with lawmakers sympathetic to sending
him back to Cuba. The grandmothers were scheduled to return to Cuba
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't care about politics, we care about our grandson,''
Quintana, his paternal grandmother, said.
</P>
<P>
   There are currently three bills _ one in the Senate and two in
the House _ that would grant Elian either citizenship or permanent
residency status. In addition, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., has
introduced a non-binding resolution urging Elian's return to his
father in Cuba. The resolution has 41 co-sponsors, including five
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin met separately Friday morning with Florida Sens.
Connie Mack and Sen. Bob Graham, Republican and Democratic sponsor
and co-sponsor of the citizenship bill, respectively, to explain
her reasons for wanting Elian to remain here.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that prior to Wednesday's meeting at her home on the
Barry University campus, she firmly believed Elian should be
returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to doubt that as I experienced Elian in my home and
felt the body trembles of Elian and the grandparents,'' O'Laughlin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Peggy Albert, a child psychologist who witnessed the
reunion at O'Laughlin's home, said Elian's apprehension prior to
the reunion ``was extreme. He was extremely fearful of coming into
this ... meeting with his grandmothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert said Elian _ whose mother and 10 others died after a
shipwreck during their Thanksgiving week attempt to reach Florida _
has apparently bonded with his 21-year-old cousin and primary
caregiver, Marisleysis Gonzalez, and that taking him from her would
cause further trauma.
</P>
<P>
   ``The child has been in the torment of the seas and now he's
been in the torment of political agendas. Somehow we must find for
him calm seas, at least for a while,'' O'Laughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   While O'Laughlin was meeting with senators, Elian's grandmothers
were meeting with House members including Rep. Maxine Waters,
D-Calif., who denounced O'Laughlin's activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am bewildered,'' Waters said. ``Never in my wildest
imagination would I think that a nun who was supposed to be a
neutral party would undermine that neutrality.''
</P>
<P>
   Waters, who traveled to Cuba earlier this week for a healthcare
exhibition and met with Elian's father, said that ``upon completing
my visit with Mr. Gonzalez, I am now more convinced than ever that
Elian should be reunited with his father, immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack conceded that the grandmothers' efforts had ``affected some
of my colleagues,'' and eroded support for his bill, but Graham
said O'Laughlin's observations would have an ``impact'' on
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of House and Senate bills to grant Elian citizenship or
permanent residency status remained unclear Friday, with
indications in both Houses that action would be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said Senate consideration could slip beyond next week
because the Senate has other business including the banking bill on
the floor.

<P>
   Albert said Elian _ whose mother and 10 others died after a
shipwreck during their Thanksgiving week attempt to reach Florida _
has apparently bonded with his 21-year-old cousin and primary
caregiver, Marisleysis Gonzalez, and that taking him from her would
cause further trauma.
</P>
<P>
   ``The child has been in the torment of the seas and now he's
been in the torment of political agendas. Somehow we must find for
him calm seas, at least for a while,'' O'Laughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   While O'Laughlin was meeting with senators, Elian's grandmothers
were meeting with House members including Rep. Maxine Waters,
D-Calif., who denounced O'Laughlin's activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am bewildered,'' Waters said. ``Never in my wildest
imagination would I think that a nun who was supposed to be a
neutral party would undermine that neutrality.''
</P>
<P>
   Waters, who traveled to Cuba earlier this week for a healthcare
exhibition and met with Elian's father, said that ``upon completing
my visit with Mr. Gonzalez, I am now more convinced than ever that
Elian should be reunited with his father, immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack conceded that the grandmothers' efforts had ``affected some
of my colleagues,'' and eroded support for his bill, but Graham
said O'Laughlin's observations would have an ``impact'' on
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of House and Senate bills to grant Elian citizenship or
permanent residency status remained unclear Friday, with
indications in both Houses that action would be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said Senate consideration could slip beyond next week
because the Senate has other business including the banking bill on
the floor.

 &HT;    Cox executive announces retirement
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nick Trigony, the longtime president of Cox
Broadcasting and a major industry figure, announced Friday that he
is retiring at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   He will be replaced by Andrew S. Fisher, who now serves as
executive vice president of television affiliates. Effective Feb.
1, Fisher will serve in the interim as executive vice president of
Cox Television.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Radio, which was spun off as a public company two years ago,
will remain under Robert F. Neil. Trigony is currently chairman of
Cox Radio.
</P>
<P>
   Neil and Fisher will both report directly to David Easterly,
president and chief operating officer of Cox Enterprises Inc.,
which owns Cox Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   A privately held, Atlanta-based media conglomerate, Cox also
owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Trigony spent the last 14 years of his 32-year career with Cox
Broadcasting and the last 10 as president of the unit.
</P>
<P>
   He has presided over the unit, which owns or manages 11
stations, including Atlanta's WSB-TV, at a time of great change at
both Cox Broadcasting and in the television industry.
</P>
<P>
   Under Trigony, Cox Broadcasting spun off its radio stations into
a publicly traded company. It rebuilt the company's top stations to
air the digital signals of High Definition Television. Cox
Broadcasting also created a Web presence for many of its stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not be the industry leader we are today were it not
for his contributions,'' said Easterly.
</P>
<P>
   Trigony has served as a director of most of the industry's major
trade groups, including the National Association of Broadcasters
and the National Association of Television Program Executives
(NATPE). He has also been NATPE's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Trigony served at a time of great consolidation in the media
industry, with radio and television station groups fetching
enormous sums of money. Cox Broadcasting remains one of the last
large independent groups of stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to run radio, and I never envisioned having the
big job,'' said Trigony, 59. ``I'm grateful to have had the
opportunity. I feel that Cox Broadcasting is a much better company
today, and I feel good about what we've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Trigony came to Cox in 1986 as executive vice president of
radio. Four years later he was promoted to executive vice president
of Cox Broadcasting. He became president in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Trigony moved to Cox from Viacom. He has also worked at ABC
Radio in New York. His career began in 1968 at the John Blair
Company as an account executive.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher is also a longtime executive of Cox Broadcasting. He held
positions as vice president and general manager of WSB-TV. He began
his career as a television reporter and news executive.

RARE SNOWFALL BRINGS WINTRY CALM TO JERUSALEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A rare snowstorm in the Holy Land left ridges of
white powder Friday on the ancient Herodian stone of the Western
Wall, the holiest site in Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   It covered the cobblestones of the Via Dolorosa, the path that
tradition holds Jesus walked before he was crucified.
</P>
<P>
   And it frosted the golden Dome of the Rock, Islam's principal
shrine in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The storm dumped some 15 inches on Jerusalem Friday and left the
Negev Desert with a sprinkling of snow for the first time in a
half-century. In Jerusalem the snowfall seemed particularly
dramatic; in a land where history is often measured by conflict and
violence, the paralyzing storm gave the city of three faiths a
sense of calm, tranquility, and light heartedness.
</P>
<P>
   With temperatures just below freezing, the wet snow hung on
pines and citrus trees. The sound of branches cracking under the
weight could be heard in the morning stillness, and many streets
were blocked by fallen trees.
</P>
<P>
   Public transportation was shut down, and municipal tractors and
bulldozers rumbled down the streets trying to clear them.
</P>
<P>
   In the narrow alleys and pathways of the Old City in Jerusalem,
the snow did not stop the faithful. At noon, Muslims wrapped in
kaffiyehs, the traditional red-and-white checked scarves, trudged
to prayers Friday at the Dome of the Rock's Al Aqsa Mosque.
Christian pilgrims tromped down the Via Dolorosa carrying a wooden
cross to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre as they traditionally do
on Fridays. And at sunset, Jews rushed across the slippery slush on
the cobblestones to make it to Shabbat, or Sabbath, prayers at the
Western Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Yakov Horowitz, 41, wearing a ``Shtreimel,'' the fur hats worn
as part of the centuries-old dress of Polish and Hungarian Hasidic
Jews, was on his way to prayer at the wall. He remarked that in
Jerusalem, especially in the heat of summer, the fur hats seem
ridiculously out of place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in a while, they work in our favor,'' he said, laughing
and adjusting his hat against the cold as the sun began to set.
``My wife said to me today, `It's too bad they don't come with
earflaps.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There were many who couldn't resist the temptation to toss
snowballs. Sporadic battles broke out throughout the city. On one
corner, a group of teenage Palestinians held the high ground on a
rooftop and were engaging tourists in a test of arms.
</P>
<P>
   German tourist Martin Meyer, 32, laughed as he returned fire.
``They are just kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For residents, snow prompts memories of earlier storms and
provides a benchmark by which they gauge time, and therefore the
level of conflict. There was the legendary storm of 1992, which
left more than 2 feet of snow and occurred when the Palestinian
intifada was burning out and peace was just being kindled. The most
recent storm occurred in early 1998 and left about 12 inches, when
the peace process had been faltering under Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Looking out from the doorway of his shop near the Jaffa Gate in
the Old City's Christian Quarter, Terry Abu Hassan said: ``Snow
calms everyone down. You forget everything with the snow. But
tomorrow the snow goes and everything you think you forgot comes
back.''

   WOODSTOCK, N.Y. _ There aren't many Sharks or Jets (or Bloods or
Crips) in this Catskill Mountain village, but there are street
gangs of sorts, wild marauders like the Deer, the Raccoons, the
Wild Turkeys.
</P>
<P>
   Drive a wooded road at dusk and they dart out, ready to rumble.
The larger of them can do serious damage to a car, but they
inevitably end up faring the worst in any confrontation with two
tons of speeding machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Roadside dangers don't end there. There are joggers and
cyclists, children chasing balls, motorists changing tires on
narrow shoulders. Even the best headlamps have a limited range, and
the glare of approaching traffic can momentarily blind any driver.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be nice to have an early warning system for the
dangers ahead?
</P>
<P>
   This year, Cadillac has come up with one, called Night Vision.
Developed by the Raytheon Systems Co. and adopted for military and
police work, it uses an infrared camera mounted in the grille to
capture the heat of objects in its beam. Driving with Night Vision
calls up memories of the Persian Gulf war and televised images of
smart bombs gliding into chimneys.
</P>
<P>
   The Cadillac camera, about the size of a one-pound can of
coffee, is mounted in the center of the grille of the DeVille DTS
or DHS. The thermal images it captures are projected by a heads-up
display onto a roughly 3-by-7-inch area on the lower part of the
windshield. The driver can brighten or darken the image, shut off
the screen altogether or adjust the projection up or down.
</P>
<P>
   A $1,995 option, Night Vision makes a fine conversation piece,
inevitably impressing passengers and curious passers-by. That will
change, of course, as infrared cameras become more common on
vehicles, as they surely will.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac has exclusive rights to the technology for two years;
it may appear on a Cadillac sport utility before long.
</P>
<P>
   After driving three cars with Night Vision, I found it both
impressive and a little frustrating. The system works only at
night, and the display appears faint on well-lighted streets. It
works best on dark country roads.
</P>
<P>
   Because the camera senses heat, not light, animate objects show
up on the screen as ghostly images _ rather like a photo negative.
Driving a DTS in Kansas in October, I was impressed by the sheer
numbers of critters lurking along rural highways _ cats, dogs,
rabbits _ that would have otherwise gone unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   And on a dark thoroughfare outside Topeka, the camera called
attention to a person walking along the shoulder. Because he was
wearing dark clothes, and because of the glare of approaching
headlamps, I wouldn't have seen him otherwise until the car was
virtually at his back.
</P>
<P>
   This points up what may be a selling feature: home security. The
camera senses body heat, so one cannot hide from its gaze. A
motorist approaching her house could instantly see an intruder in
the shrubbery. Suddenly, anyone can have X-ray vision.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cadillac says that a driver should use the display like
a rear-view mirror, glancing at it from time to time, novice users
a tendency to stare at the projection, not at the surrounding
windshield, while driving. While this tendency fades with repeated
use, but one wonders if one's gaze will be elsewhere at the instant
when Night Vision reveals danger ahead.
</P>
<P>
   I also wished for a wider field of vision. In normal
circumstances the camera catches the road and a bit of the area on
either side, but the image may not be wide enough to show a herd of
deer in a meadow, dashing toward the road. And, most irritating,
the camera needs a better self-leveling mechanism. As it is, when
one descends a hill the camera points at the pavement; on ascents,
it peers at birds' nests in treetops.
</P>
<P>
   Winding roads pose a similar problem. Because the camera does
not swivel independently of the car, on a sweeping right turn it
looks to the left of the road, rather than toward where the car is
heading.
</P>
<P>
   Is Night Vision worth the price? For the short-lived wow factor,
or commuting in cities, probably not. For rural driving, possibly.
Even with its limitations, this swords-to-plowshares technology
could save a lot of wildlife and perhaps a few pedestrians.

FREE-SPEECH FEARS RISE AS GOVERNMENT PRESSURES JOURNALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Two weeks ago a crusading radio journalist who angered
the Kremlin with his reports from war-torn Chechnya disappeared.
Friday, law enforcement officials acknowledged that he had been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a newspaper reporter known for exposing corruption
among Russia's rich and powerful was confronted at his home by
machine-gun-toting police and ordered to take a psychiatric
examination. He went into hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Incidents such as these have human rights groups in Russia
worried that free speech may be endangered under acting Kremlin
leader Vladimir V. Putin, a former Soviet KGB officer.
</P>
<P>
   With Russia's war against separatist rebels in Chechnya raging
on, and with a presidential vote in two months, the Kremlin is
taking extra measures to control information.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media should take into account the challenges the nation
is facing now,'' Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the Kremlin's spokesman on
the Chechen war, told a Russian newspaper last week. ``When the
nation mobilizes its strength to achieve a goal, this imposes
obligations on everybody, including the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Babitsky, 35, a reporter for US-funded Radio Liberty,
learned about these ``obligations'' the hard way. Law enforcement
officials in Moscow announced Friday that Babitsky, who disappeared
in Chechnya's capital Jan. 15, had been arrested for lacking
accreditation to work in the war zone.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Oleg Aksyonov was quoted by Reuters as saying
Babitsky was in jail also ``because of information that he
allegedly spent time with illegal armed groups.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After some necessary formalities he may be released,''
Aksyonov added.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky's wife, Ludmilla Babitskaya, said the Russian
authorities, unhappy with his critical coverage from Chechnya, were
harassing her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of country is this? What kind of consciences do
these officials have if they can hold my husband for two weeks
while I worry whether he is alive or not?'' she said. ``I am just
happy to hear that he is alive.''
</P>
<P>
   She also ridiculed the idea that Babitsky, who had good sources
among the Chechen commanders, had joined the militants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andrei is a religious man. He has never held a weapon in his
hands in his life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Journalists' Union has released a statement
demanding Babitsky's release. His reports from Chechnya have
challenged official claims that Russian troops were defeating the
rebels, reported higher casualties than the Kremlin had
acknowledged, and focused on the plight of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   And Babitsky's detention in Chechnya was not his first
confrontation with authorities. On Jan. 8, police searched
Babitsky's Moscow apartment and confiscated photographs he had
taken of Russian soldiers killed in Grozny, Chechnya's capital.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Russian military's press center had accused him
of siding with rebel leaders Shamil Basayev and Khattab.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon Babitsky will be ready to exchange his profession as a
journalist for that of an executioner and will serve in the
detachments of his idols Basayev and Khattab,'' said the statement,
released on the military's Internet site. ``Russian citizens must
know that Radio Liberty has long been fighting a war against them
on the side of bandits and terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio Liberty is a US-funded station that broadcasts in the
former Soviet Union. Jeff Trimble, the station's broadcast
director, said he planned to meet with Russian officials Saturday.
Trimble declined to comment on whether he thought Babitsky's
disappearance was related to his reporting, which has angered
Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
   In another case that frightened free press advocates here,
police showed up at the Moscow apartment of investigative reporter
Alexander Khinshtein on Jan. 18 with an order that he undergo
psychiatric testing.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old journalist for the newspaper Moskovsky
Komsomolets, which is witheringly critical of the Kremlin, had
written a series of articles alleging corruption among Russia's
elite. Claiming that Khinshtein had lied on his application for a
driver's license by hiding a history of mental illness, police
ordered him to undergo a psychiatric testing, the reporter's mother
was quoted as saying. Khinshtein has since gone into hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Rights advocates here say that Russia's fledgling press freedoms
are being steadily eroded. Last week, the Kremlin targeted foreign
journalists, too, accusing them of pro-Chechen bias in their war
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, authorities briefly detained seven foreign
journalists, including the Globe's Moscow bureau chief, David
Filipov, on allegations that they did not have the proper
accreditation to report from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our leaders love to go to the West and talk about democratic
principles and then not observe them in Russia,'' said Oleg
Panfilov of the Glasnost Defense Fund, a Moscow-based free press
advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am afraid,'' Panfilov said, ``the repression of the free
press will become official policy.''

 &HT;    NOTEBOOK _ Fisher feeling relaxed
 &HT;    Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tennessee Titans coach Jeff Fisher was relaxed enough
Friday in his last news conference before the Super Bowl to take a
jab at the Jacksonville Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher was asked about his Titans having been forced to play in
``five home stadiums'' during the transition period after their
departure from Houston. He responded, ``Some have said we've had
five home stadiums if you include Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville,''
where the Titans won twice this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans and Rams conducted workouts inside the Georgia Dome
on Friday because of the threat of snow. Fisher said the Titans,
while not as quick as the coach with the one-liners, were holding
up well under the advance pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our club is relaxed,'' Fisher said. ``They are poised. They're
enjoying themselves. They're taking the same approach that we've
taken all year to preparing. I told them last week prior to the
start of the week that if they sensed that any of the coaches were
beginning to tighten up a little bit, just let me know, that I was
going to send the coaches home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans' looseness was indicated yesterday during special
teams practice at Georgia Tech, when several players rolled a large
pipe across the field with an offensive lineman inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe our team is confident,'' Fisher said of the Titans,
who began the week as seven-point underdogs. ``I believe that our
team expects to play well. Our team is not going to peak today or
tomorrow or Sunday morning. They're going to be ready to play at
kickoff. . . . I think you can lose a game like this during the
during the week if you don't focus and you don't take the right
approach to preparation -- if you allow the distractions to get the
better part of you.''
</P>
<P>
   _Thigpen still undecided
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said that the official status of Titans wide receiver
Yancey Thigpen, who suffered a hairline fracture of his right foot
in last week's AFC title game, won't be determined until Sunday's
pre-game warm-up. Thigpen has not practiced this week. He has worn
a protective boot on the foot while watching practice or sitting in
on meetings. He would be replaced in the Titans' staring lineup by
Isaac Byrd. Titans trainers are trying to fit Thigpen's shoe with a
supportive split to take some pressure off the fractured area.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he convinces me that he can play 35 or 40 plays with the
foot condition the way it is right now, then he will play,'' Fisher
said. ``If it is less than that, I think it's unlikely that he
plays. But that's going to be left up to three hours prior to
kickoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher was remidned that Byron Boston, the line judge who was on
the field for the miracle lateral at Buffalo in the wild-card game,
would be part of the Super Bowl crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it has anything to do with irony,'' Fisher said.
Jerry Seeman (director of officials) grades his officials and he
rewards those that are, in his mind, that best from this season . .
I thought Byron has done a good job all year. Obviously, he was
involved in the big play, buy Byron was doing his job.''
</P>
<P>
   _No changes in Titans' pre-game routine
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said the Titans are not moving from their team hotel, the
Buckhead Grand Hyatt, to another site prior to the game, as is
often the case with the Super Bowl teams. The players and coaches
wives are staying at a hotel across Peachtree Road. ``We will stay
in our same normal routine that we would normally do on a Saturday
night and Sunday. . . . Fisher said the Atlanta Falcons' NFC
champion 1998 season served as motivational tool for all the other
teams yet to experience such success. ``I think the Atlanta Falcons
were an inspiration to everyone in the league last year because of
the road they took to put a consecutive streak together at the end
of the previous year and then to have the season they had last
year.'' . . . ..We kind of took the approach, if there's nobody out
there, why not make it us?'' . . .Titans defensive end Josh Evans,
on Fisher's low-key leadership: ``Coach Fisher is cool and calm. He
just rubs off on the players. ...I hear they (the Rams) are talking
a lot, but there's no reason for that. I think we're going to show
everybody in America Sunday what type of team we are.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Super Bowl `34' for Payton
</P>
<P>
   Surely, it's fitting that the first Super Bowl since the death
of Walter Payton would be No. XXXIV -- same as Payton's Chicago
Bears jersey. ``I have a ring from the `85 season (with the
Bears),'' said Fisher, ``but the thing that I cherish most from my
years with the Bears is not necessarily that ring, it's the fact
that I was able to be Walter's teammate and friend.''. . . Among
those wandering through the media center Friday were former AFC
Super Bowl stars Joe Namath of the New York Jets and Mean Joe
Greene of Pittsburgh. . ...Titans cornerback Denard Walker, on how
much meaning should be placed in the regular-season meeting won
24-21 by Tennessee: ``It's just like the Jacksonville game. It's a
brand new game and anything can happen. That's just part of the
NFL. Every Sunday something different can happen.'' . . .Titans
runniung back Eddie George, comparing Houston, his former home, to
Nashville, his current one: ``It's taken time for me to adjust to
coming from Houston, which is a faster city, to a slower-paced
city. A lot of people know each other in Nashville. You could run
into somebody that works in the ball that knows your maid.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Goldberg a huge Kearse fan
</P>

   Wrestling star Goldberg, who was known as Bill Goldberg when he
played for the University of Georgia and briefly in the NFL, calls
Titans defensive end Jevon Kearse ``a breath of fresh air to a
sport that has become such a business. He brings it back to the
Saturday playground game. He makes it fun for me to watch football
again.'' Goldberg, who played three years with the Falcons _ ``I've
got more friends with the Falcons than anyone'' _ said he was
pulling for the Rams, ``even though they cut me twice'' after
drafting him out of Georgia.

 &HT;    Warner conjures memories of Unitas
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ All around the Western Illinois campus, where the Rams
get in trim for the season, they were feeling good about the new
quarterback. Probably even Georgia Frontiere, who wouldn't know a
Statue of Liberty play if she saw one. Matter of fact, not many of
us would. It went out of style with the Hudson Hornet.
</P>
<P>
   This kid was looking great, and if he wasn't a kid, he looked
like one. Tweny-nine years old, though, six seasons in the NFL, but
most of them a string of zeroes. This was the guy Dick Vermeil
wanted, and he was looking fit for the part.
</P>
<P>
   Trent Green had completed 37 of 41 passes in exhibition games,
two of those dropped, a coach with a statistical eye was quick to
point out. One more game to go, then into the real stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Then it happened. The 29-year-old kid went down with a thud. His
season was over in August, and on the 30th he went on the dreaded
injured reserve. Now what, with only a rookie from Ohio State named
Joe Germaine and a pickup from the Raiders, Paul Justin, and
another guy who had passed for all of 39 yards in the NFL? And who
had spent part of the year seeing the sights of Europe as an
Amsterdam Admiral, which has nothing to do with the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   His name was Kurt Warner, 28 years old, out of Northern Iowa,
which has no great reputation as a producer of stars. If that
wasn't question enough, check his career in the Arena League, which
he himself describes as ``like a basketball game, except you're
playing football.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hanifan is the offensive line coach, once coach when the
Cardinals nested in St. Louis, later a Falcons assistant. ``We were
in shock when Green went down. We had centered everything around
him. He was the quarterback we wanted _ then this, to face the
season with a backup.''
</P>
<P>
   There was one game left on the exhibition schedule before the
scheduled opener against Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, he went out and did a good job in the first game,''
Hanifan said. ``Our bye week came next, then Atlanta came to town.
He had another good one, completed passes to seven different
receivers. And another good one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd gotten by this far OK, and we were feeling pretty good.
But to expect a backup quarterback to wind up throwing for 41
touchdowns and 4,000 yards and taking us to the Super Bowl, nobody
could ever have expected that. I'd like to say I saw that in him,
but I didn't. I don't think anybody did.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the heart-thumping story of the sports year. And Warner is
just as real as his story is unbelievable. Married into a
ready-made family, adopted the kids, the family's religious leader,
good-natured, even-tempered, just too much to be real. Horatio
Alger wrote stories about guys like Kurt Warner, titles like ``From
Rags to Riches'' and ``Striving to Succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been nothing close to it since Johnny Unitas rose from
the ashes and passed himself and the Baltimore Colts into the Hall
of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Shaw had been the No. 1 draft pick, rookie of the year
and he came down hurt,'' Hanifan said. ``Unitas had been released
twice, and after Pittsburgh let him go, went back home and played
some semi-pro ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The story is that Unitas cost the Colts a $1.90 telephone call.
That's what it cost Don Kellett, then general manager of the Colts,
to put in a call to him, and the rest is history. George Shaw was
never the same again, not that the Colts ever needed him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if Warner can keep this up or not, not to
Unitas' level. Johnny kept it going for years. Kurt is sound, solid
and dependable,'' Hanifan said. ``In fact, I don't know that I've
had a more exciting experience in my whole career.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the man of the moment stood before a roomful of sports
jurists at the Crown Plaza Hotel, wearing a sweatshirt with
``Crosseyed'' across the chest and handled his questioners with
grace, received another of his many awards and won more unofficial
votes for man of the year.

   NEGATIVE-CAMPAIGN (Manchester, N.H.) _ These days, the
candidates see the nabobs of negativism everywhere. Taking
advantage of polls that indicate voters are fed up with negative
campaigning, the contenders are daily trying to pin the negative
label on their opponents. The tactic has replaced attack ads as the
attack strategy of choice this season, a move that has confused
voters, who see the tone this season as being relatively mild. A
look at the cries of ``attack,'' and what constitutes one, in a
civil season. By Peter Marks.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-GUNS-ASSESS (Undated) _ A news analysis: President
Clinton's proposal to license all new handgun purchasers is
unlikely to get through Congress, and even harder to implement
around the country. But he has opened what many regard as the next
battleground for gun control. Gun licensing is anathema to the
National Rifle Association. But it is also the kind of easily
understandable and potentially appealing strategy that gun control
researchers and advocates have lacked since they finally won
passage of the Brady Law in 1994. By Fox Butterfield.
</P>
<P>
   NIRELAND-TALKS (London) _ Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein,
the Irish Republican Army's political wing, has ruled out the
possibility that the underground paramilitary force will move to
meet a crucial deadline Monday for beginning to disarm. By Warren
Hoge.

   JAPAN-BORROW (Tokyo) _ In a striking demonstration of how
precarious the Japanese government's finances have become, the
Finance Ministry plans to borrow money directly from banks to
fulfill its obligations to local governments. The size of the
shortfall, 8 trillion yen, or roughly $76 billion, and the
unorthodox way the government plans to cover it has stunned
economists and other market watchers. By Stephanie Strom.
</P>
<P>
   AIRPLANE-BEDS (Undated) _ The battle among airlines for the
first-class passenger by offering luxury more typical of a cruise
ship has risen to this: One airline will soon introduce the first
private cabin equipped with a double bed. The cabin, on Virgin
Atlantic, will go for about $9,000 for one _ or about $18,500 for a
couple. The airlines have good reason to be concerned about their
passengers' comfort. Surveys of business travelers _ who buy only
20 percent of all airline tickets but account for about half of the
industry's profits _ have revealed that executives would rather
have a sound snooze during long flights than dine on Cabernet and
caviar. By Dwight J. Morrow.

KAFELNIKOV BELIEVES HE CAN HANDLE AGASSI 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ The air gets rarefied in the semifinals
of a Grand Slam tennis tournament _ particularly for those
unaccustomed to breathing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to tell myself that it's just another match, but it
actually was a little bit more than just another match,'' Magnus
Norman conceded apologetically.
</P>
<P>
   The 12th-seeded Swede had played so well from the baseline and
service line throughout January, but when he took the court against
Yevgeny Kafelnikov on Friday it was suddenly gone: the rhythm, the
focus, the assurance required to slug a small yellow ball into the
right places. The final score was 6-1, 6-2, 6-4. And now the
second-seeded Kafelnikov can start concentrating on someone who is
breathing very comfortably at altitude: Andre Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to play him, that's the bottom line,'' Kafelnikov said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a comment seldom heard these days about Agassi, who is
looking and performing like a man on a quest, and the comment seems
all the odder coming from Kafelnikov, who has lost to Agassi three
times in a row.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russian, who often speaks his mind and sometimes suffers
for it, believes that he can handle Agassi's fine serving and
quick-striking pace and precision from the backcourt. ``I can play
with him on the baseline all day long,'' Kafelnikov said. ``He
dominates against other players, because they don't know what they
have to do to use his weaknesses, and I know how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov does not have a gift for prediction. Last September,
when he came to Australia for the semifinals of the Davis Cup, he
boasted before the final day that he was going to give Lleyton
Hewitt ``a lesson'' and that Hewitt was ``going to learn it the
hard way.'' Kafelnikov also called the grass court the Australians
were using in Brisbane ``a potato field.'' All this did not endear
him to the locals, although his straight-set loss to Hewitt
certainly helped.
</P>
<P>
   The public in Melbourne seems to have forgiven or forgotten, but
it is hard to imagine their cheering him on against Agassi on
Sunday. The American holds only a 5-4 career edge on Kafelnikov,
but two of Kafelnikov's victories have come on clay. On an outdoor
hard court like the one in use in Melbourne, Agassi holds a 4-2
edge. He also won their most recent match in a major in four sets
in the semifinals of the last U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll see a very different Yevgeny than at the Open,''
said Kafelnikov's coach, Larry Stefanki. ``That day he was
exhausted. He had played six weeks in a row, but now he's fresh,
and his attitude is fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Stefanki is paid to think positively, but he does not think that
playing Agassi from the baseline is going to work. ``Yevgeny must
be aggressive. He can't expect the errors that the old Agassi used
to make,'' he said. ``From the first point, Yevgeny must attack,
put the ball in the corners, come in and not push. Every short
ball, he has to hit angles and come in.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with playing the new Agassi is that short balls are
extremely hard to come by, and that Kafelnikov, excellent at the
baseline and very good at net, is not as good in transition. But if
he can find a way to win, his stature will increase considerably.
Kafelnikov already has won two Grand Slam singles titles. The first
came at the French Open in 1996, when he beat Michael Chang in the
final; the second was here last year, when he disposed of Thomas
Enqvist in the final. But though Chang and Enqvist are fine
players, Kafelnikov has yet to beat Agassi or Pete Sampras in the
final of a major.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in Melbourne, he good-naturedly thanked Sampras for
choosing to miss the tournament. It was part joke, part window into
his psyche, and it is easy to believe Kafelnikov when he says he
was delighted to see Agassi beat Sampras in five sets in the
semifinals. ``If Pete's serve is working, you have got no shot of
beating him, but with Andre at least you have a chance,''
Kafelnikov said.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras did have his chances against Agassi in the Thursday
night match that drew considerable interest worldwide and a large
television audience here: Nearly one in six Australians watched it.
But after failing to convert three break points in the fourth set
and then losing it in a hotly contested tiebreaker, Sampras faded
meekly in the final set, losing it 6-1. It became clear on Friday
that his oddly muted play down the stretch was not simply because
of disappointment, fatigue or the force of Agassi's shots or
personality. It was because he had torn his right hip flexor.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras said he first felt the injury during a baseline rally in
the fourth game of the match, when he led 0-40 on Agassi's serve.
Sampras ended up losing the game but would win many others despite
the injury, and he said he never considered retiring. But a
magnetic resonance imaging scan conducted on Friday morning
revealed a significant tear of the muscle, which is expected to
keep him sidelined for three to four weeks and will keep him out of
next week's first-round Davis Cup match in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly didn't help with my moving, but I'm not taking
anything away from how he played,'' Sampras said of Agassi. ``He
played great, and he's got a great chance of winning the whole
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras' chances of winning a record 13th Grand Slam singles
title remain reasonably good, but his health is a growing concern
at age 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm struggling to walk normally at the moment,'' he said on
Friday. He has had minor injuries in the past, but last year he
retired or withdrew from four tournaments with physical problems. A
herniated disc in his back forced him to pull out of the U.S. Open
and miss two months, and now he must rehabilitate his hip flexor
instead of joining forces and egos with Agassi to play for new
Davis Cup captain John McEnroe.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, who has declined to play Davis Cup for much of the last
four years, informed McEnroe of his withdrawal by phone. ``It
probably wasn't the best news he heard,'' Sampras said. ``I'm sure
he's disappointed like I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Levering, the president of the U.S. Tennis Association who
hired McEnroe after consulting with the players, said she hoped the
team would be complete later in the season. ``I wouldn't want Pete
to risk getting hurt in Davis Cup again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   What once looked like a fairly straightforward road trip for the
Americans is now getting complicated. Sampras is out and Todd
Martin, who could have been asked to play singles and doubles in
his absence, is ailing and not certain to make the trip. ``There is
concern there,'' Levering said of Martin, without specifying the
nature of his illness or injury.
</P>
<P>
   That means that McEnroe may have to call on Jim Courier, Vince
Spadea or Chris Woodruff, who lost to Sampras in the quarterfinals
here. Whomever is called, Agassi will now have a much more
essential role to play than planned after he finishes with
Kafelnikov on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Martina Hingis' combined 50-match winning streak in singles and
doubles at the Australian Open ended Friday when she and her new
partner, Mary Pierce, were beaten 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 by the No. 1 seeded
team of Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs. Hingis, who will face
Lindsay Davenport in Saturday's singles final, had won the singles
and doubles in Melbourne the last three years.

presidential rival John McCain in the final weekend before the New
Hampshire GOP primary, the Texas governor got a boost Friday from
one political institution and a front-page blast from another.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was endorsed by former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, who
with Bush's help, was fired as President Bush's chief of staff in
1992. On Friday, Sununu downplayed his hot-and-cold history with
the Bushes, calling the younger Bush the candidate that
conservatives ``should be and would be most comfortable with.''
</P>
<P>
   The broadside came from The Union Leader, a Manchester paper
with statewide circulation that has endorsed Steve Forbes. The
newspaper called Bush ``Gov. Smirk'' and a ``double-talking
Texan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now clear why his handlers wanted to keep Texas Gov.
George Bush's pre-primary appearances in New Hampshire to a
minimum,'' Publisher Joseph McQuaid said in the signed editorial.
``They were rightly concerned that his smug attitude and smart
remarks would not do him any good.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show Bush running second to McCain in the Granite
State, but within striking distance as Tuesday's primary nears. A
CNN-USA Today tracking poll showed McCain with 40 percent to Bush's
35 percent on Wednesday, though McCain's lead was shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   McCain built up his lead while Bush was campaigning elsewhere.
The Arizona senator, behind Bush in fund-raising and support from
Republican Party officials, skipped the first voting in the Iowa
caucuses last week and has concentrated on New Hampshire, where he
is counting on a win to transform his candidacy from also-ran to
viable contender.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has campaigned all week in New Hampshire after his
Monday win in Iowa, is hoping to win but working to downplay the
significance of a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I am going to do well here,'' he said, quickly
spinning down the road to the next contests. ``I'm in it for the
long pull. I've got organizations in states beyond New Hampshire.
I'm well-funded, and I can survive. But I intend to win here.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the Sununu endorsement shows that ``the
establishment is very worried. That's why you see a parade of
people backing Bush.'' Sununu was a key to President Bush's 1988
victory in New Hampshire and was a national co-chairman of Dan
Quayle's ill-fated 2000 presidential bid
</P>
<P>
   The next battles will be Feb. 8 in Delaware and Feb. 19 in South
Carolina. Polls show Bush with solid leads in both contests. A big
Bush win in South Carolina could knock McCain from the race. Steve
Forbes has enough money to keep going as long as he wants.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is preparing to pick up Secret Service
protection for its candidate on Feb. 19. Usually, presidential
candidates request such protection once they become their party's
nominee. The Texas Department of Public Safety currently handles
Bush's security.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Gov. Bush made several campaign stops around the
state, including a news conference to renew his criticism of what
McCain's tax plan would do to deductions for some charitable
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also spoke to employees at Liberty Mutual in Portsmouth.
The audience listened attentively but didn't laugh at the jokes or
clap at the applause lines _ including the one in which Bush
promises a major tax cut. Bush got a polite standing ovation when
he finished.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, meanwhile, is broadcasting a new television ad in New
Hampshire, stressing his reform message, promising to return
government ``to whom it belongs, the people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he can run stronger against a Democratic ticket led by
Vice President Al Gore because ``Bush stands mute on campaign
finance reform...
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much easier for me to attack Clinton and Gore because I
have the high ground,'' said McCain, who reissued his challenge to
Bush to run a positive campaign. The two promised to do just that
with a hand shake earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also criticized a New York state judge's decision to
throw him off the March 7 primary ballot in eight of the state's 31
congressional districts. McCain is taking the issue to federal
court.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, Forbes' campaign brought several current and former
Texas education officials to New Hampshire to criticize Bush's
record back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that Governor Bush's record on education is
one of broken promises and politics as usual,'' said Bob Offut, a
member of the Texas Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's reaction: ``I have got a great record in the state of
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about negative campaigning,'' Bush said. ``Mr. Forbes
tried to do the same thing to Bob Dole in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes also began a new ad in which he talks about his plans for
Social Security and taxes. He tells voters if conservatives unite,
he can win.

ELF AQUITAINE INQUIRY EXTENDS TO FRANCE'S FORMER FINANCE MINISTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Judges looking into possible corruption at the formerly
state-owned French oil company Elf Aquitaine have notified a former
French finance minister that he is being investigated in connection
with payments made to his secretary, his lawyer said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The former finance minister, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, considered
one of the architects of France's economic recovery, was forced to
resign last year because of accusations of corruption in an
unrelated matter involving fees he was paid by a student health
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Suave and affable, Strauss-Kahn was a powerful figure in Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin's government and was often talked about as a
future prime minister. In recent days, a public appearance with the
prime minister fueled speculation that Strauss-Kahn was about to be
cleared in the first inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday his lawyer, Jean Veil, confirmed a report in the
newspaper Le Monde that Strauss-Kahn had been notified by mail that
he was being investigated because his secretary, Evelyne Duval, was
on the Elf payroll in 1993 though she did no work for the giant
company.
</P>
<P>
   The new investigation is not directly related to the growing
investigation into whether Elf helped finance the political party
of Helmut Kohl, the former German chancellor. Officials of the
French oil company are suspected of having funneled as much as $40
million to representatives of Kohl's Christian Democratic Union.
</P>
<P>
   Television reports in France and Germany have suggested that the
payment of large sums of money to secure a contract for Elf in
eastern Germany were prompted by former President Francois
Mitterrand of France, who wanted to help Kohl, who fought a bitter
campaign for re-election in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But the investigation into payments to Strauss-Kahn's secretary
may open another window into the actions of Elf between 1989 and
1993, when appointees of Mitterrand were in control and the company
was subsidizing politicians and carrying on semiclandestine
missions on behalf of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial inquiries have already revealed embezzlement, shady
commissions and wasteful management on a grand scale. But
investigations into corruption at Elf, which was acquired last year
by the other French oil giant, TotalFina, continue. The oil company
acknowledged Friday that it lost about $3.5 billion during the
1989-1993 period.
</P>
<P>
   According to Le Monde, Strauss-Kahn is being investigated on
suspicion of ``being an accomplice, by giving instructions, to the
abuse of corporate funds.'' Ms. Duval apparently received about
$29,000 from Elf.
</P>
<P>
   Notice of being under investigation does not necessarily result
in charges. Strauss-Kahn's wife, Anne Sinclair, told Agence
France-Presse that her husband would not comment on the new
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Duval, who worked as Strauss-Kahn's secretary from 1991 to
1993 and then from 1997 to 1999, is also under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   When he stepped down as finance minister on Nov. 2, Strauss-Kahn
was under investigation for possible fraud in his role as a lawyer
in a property deal executed in the mid-1990s for the student health
insurance group MNEF.
</P>
<P>
   According to several newspaper accounts, the investigation
centered on accusations that Strauss-Kahn, 50, was paid about
$100,000 for the deal, but did no work. There are also accusations
that documents were created to cover up wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss-Kahn has denied receiving unjustified legal fees, but he
has admitted that there could have been some technical
irregularities.

ARMS ISSUE BRINGS IRISH SITUATION TO NEW CRISIS POINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Northern Ireland plunged to the verge of crisis again
Friday, just eight weeks after the hopeful and historic formation
of the first government to share power between those determined to
maintain union with Britain and Irish republicans long sworn to
smash it.
</P>
<P>
   An international commission charged with overseeing the
disarming of paramilitary groups is set to deliver its report
Monday. Sources familiar with the commission said the panel has
concluded that the Irish Republican Army is no nearer to disarming
than it was when the power-sharing government was formed in early
December.
</P>
<P>
   A negative report from the commission, headed by Canadian
General John de Chastelain, is likely to lead Ulster Unionists to
walk out of the power-sharing government, causing its collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Under an elaborate compromise hammered out by George Mitchell,
the former US senator from Maine, unionists had agreed to form a
power-sharing government that included two cabinet members from
Sinn Fein, the IRA's political allies.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the understanding was that the IRA would soon begin to
turn in its arsenal. Under terms of the agreement, the IRA dropped
its refusal to discuss disarming and appointed a representative to
talk to de Chastelain, but those discussions have not yet yielded a
commitment to turn in weapons, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, pressure on the IRA was increased when Seamus Mallon,
the nationalist who is deputy first minister of the Northern
Ireland Assembly, urged the IRA to begin disarming or else take the
blame for causing the power-sharing government to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   It was fitting that on Thursday, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams
chose Newry, the city closest to South Armagh, to announce that the
IRA would not begin turning in weapons by Monday, the deadline set
unilaterally by Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble.
</P>
<P>
   For it is in South Armagh, long a bastion of militant Irish
republicanism, that resistance to the idea of turning in weapons is
strongest among rank and file members of the Irish Republican Army.
And it is those ordinary IRA members who consider turning in
weapons an act of surrender, not the confidence-building measure
that the unionists, many Irish nationalists, and the British, Irish
and American governments see it as.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any chance that the IRA would make a gesture on
weapons, Sinn Fein leaders said, it was dashed when Trimble
effectively demanded that the IRA do so by the end of January,
saying that otherwise he would resign as first minister of the
power-sharing government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experience, just common sense, tells us that the IRA are not
going to respond to deadlines set by the unionists,'' said Sinn
Fein party chairman Mitchel McLaughlin.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble said the only way he was able to sell his party the idea
of forming a government before the IRA showed it was serious about
disarming was to postpone a final decision on whether to stay in
that government until a Feb. 12 meeting of his 860-member party
council. In the interim, the IRA was expected to turn in weapons,
or at least commit to doing so.
</P>
<P>
   But Adams said the only deadline that Irish republicans
recognize is the one in the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, which
set May as the deadline when all paramilitary groups were supposed
to have turned in their arsenals. Adams said the IRA needs more
time.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon's statement suggested the republicans have run out of
time and are becoming politically isolated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time of choice for the republican movement,'' Mallon
said. ``It cannot continue forever to hedge its bets, to claim the
benefits of the ballot box while at the same time denying the
imperative to decommission. It cannot continue to claim to act on
behalf of the people of Ireland while defying their clearly
expressed will that decommissioning happen now.''
</P>
<P>
   A miffed Adams later said that Mallon's statement ``flies
totally in the face of what Mr. Mallon knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Unionists have been pleading with the Social Democrat and Labor
Party, of which Mallon is deputy leader and which represents the
majority of Catholics in Northern Ireland, to take a tougher stand
against its nationalist colleagues in Sinn Fein, the political
allies of the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon seemed to respond, saying, ``A report which fails to give
confidence that decommissioning is on course will damage faith in
the Good Friday Agreement for those unionists who have stood
steadfastly by it.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at his London office last week, British
Secretary of State Peter Mandelson was upbeat, denying suggestions
that the peace process was headed for another crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will take our cue from General de Chastelain, and we will
act accordingly in consultation with the Irish government,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the IRA had to make its intentions clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``No more excuses from the IRA, no more manana,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mandleson said the IRA did not have to hand over weapons,
hinting that it only had to prove to de Chastelain that it was
making weapons ``permanently inaccessible.'' Such an elastic term
means the IRA could destroy the weapons itself, or seal off arms
dumps.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson would not speculate on what he will do if de
Chastelain reports there is no progress on disarmament. One course
would be to move immediately to suspend the Northern Ireland
Assembly and several joint agencies that were established by the
Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland last month when London
transferred power back to Belfast after 28 years of direct rule.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have suggested that if Mandelson acts to suspend
the assembly and the new institutions and reestablishes direct rule
from London, it would be easier to revive the power-sharing
government later than if he waits until Trimble walks out and lets
it collapse.

CONFIDENT BUSH PICKS UP SURPRISING ENDORSEMENT IN N.H. 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
and CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ George W. Bush tried to recapture some lost
ground in his tightly contested first-primary race Friday, picking
up a surprising endorsement but fighting off an impression that he
is taking New Hampshire lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was endorsed Friday by John Sununu, a former New Hampshire
governor, whom Bush reportedly fired as White House chief of staff
in the elder Bush's administration.
</P>
<P>
   Sununu, who stepped down from his White House job after a
closed-door meeting with the president's son, said he has never had
any hard feelings over the incident and believes the Texas governor
is the best choice as the nation's next president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is in tight race in the primary with Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, and with millionaire Steve Forbes closing in on them. Bush
said he believes he can win, but he is confident that his
presidential campaign could survive a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'll have a bump in the road here. I think I'll
have a pretty good chance,'' said Bush, but added: ``I'm in it for
the long pull. I've got organizations in states beyond New
Hampshire. I'm well funded. I can survive. But I intend to win
here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush was greeted Friday morning with a front-page editorial
in the Manchester Union Leader headlined, ``Bush insults NH.''
</P>
<P>
   The editorial by the paper that has endorsed Forbes called Bush
``Gov. Smirk'' and a ``double-talking Texan'' who has belittled New
Hampshire voters by talking down to them about his tax-cut plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Union Leader has made its decision to support Steve
Forbes, and I disagree with their decision,`` was Bush's only reply
to the column.
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed to be making up for the perceived insult when he
told a news conference, ``I would suspect that those who say the
voters of New Hampshire are voting just on name ID don't understand
the constituency here. This is a constituency that pays close
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Sununu said he believes Bush still has a good chance to win New
Hampshire, despite numerous polls showing McCain ahead.
</P>
<P>
   A new USA Today/CNN/Gallup tracking poll published Friday showed
McCain leading Bush, 40 percent to 35 percent, in New Hampshire,
tighter than the 9-point lead that McCain enjoyed in the same
survey before Bush won Iowa's nominating caucuses Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing like a surge at the end, which the governor
now has going for him,'' Sununu said. ``He's in the streets. He's
shaking hands. He's visiting people. He's talking to people face to
face. This is see-me, feel-me, touch-me campaigning at its best.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush also engaged in some freeze-me campaigning Friday as
well when he took a break to go snowmobiling with New Hampshire
Sen. Judd Gregg.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, wearing a black and blue winter jump suit, boarded his
first snowmobile and took four spins around an open field in
Hooksett, N.H., allowing him to remind voters that he flew jets in
the Texas Air National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an exhilarating experience. I like speed. I used to fly
F-102 fighters. When you put the throttle to one of these, you get
a real sense of exhilaration,'' Bush said. ``I just wanted to come
out here and have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a former Vietnam POW and front-runner for Tuesday's
primary, hammered away at campaign-finance reform before more than
1,000 people packed into a high school gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   He said he couldn't understand why his opponents could defend a
``pernicious,'' money-driven political system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some other candidates are saying this (donation limits) would
harm the Republican Party. My friends, I've always believed what's
best for America is best for the Republican Party.``
</P>
<P>
   McCain didn't mention any of his opponents by name, but Bush
opposes McCain's proposed crackdown on ``soft money.'' Bush argues
that it would harm the Republican Party because it wouldn't stop
labor union contributions to Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   And in media interviews, he continued to blame Bush for his
continued struggle to get on the March 7 New York primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
   A New York state judge threw McCain off the New York primary
ballot in eight of the state's 31 congressional districts. That
means McCain won't be on the ballot in at least 13 congressional
districts, unless the state action is overturned by a federal
court.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled that McCain had failed to gather enough valid
signatures on nominating petitions required under New York's
restrictive laws governing candidates' access to its ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Challenges against McCain were brought by New York's Republican
establishment, which is supporting Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain told reporters in Manchester, N.H., that he was ``very
disappointed'' that Bush didn't tell Gov. George Pataki and his
other New York backers to drop their challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's communism. That's not democracy,'' McCain said, vowing
to take his dispute to federal court.
</P>
<P>
   During a town hall meeting with about 1,000 employees of Liberty
Mutual Insurance Group in Portsmouth, Bush defended his role in not
asking the New York Republican Party to put McCain on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe local parties, like our party in the state of Texas,
ought to be able to run our primaries as we see fit,'' Bush said.

 By JUDY L. THOMAS  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hundreds of Roman Catholic priests across the United States have
died of AIDS-related illnesses, and hundreds more are living with
HIV, the virus that causes the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The actual number of AIDS deaths is difficult to determine. But
it appears priests are dying of AIDS at a rate at least four times
that of the general U.S. population, according to estimates from
medical experts and priests and an analysis of health statistics by
The Kansas City Star.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri and Kansas alone, at least 16 priests and two
religious-order brothers have died of AIDS since early 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths are of such concern to the church that most dioceses
and religious orders now require applicants for the priesthood to
take an HIV-antibody test before their ordination.
</P>
<P>
   For the nation's 60 million Catholics, served by 46,000 priests,
the AIDS issue goes straight to the heart of church doctrine _ a
doctrine that teaches compassion and forgiveness but also considers
homosexual relations a sin and opposes the modern practice of
``safe sex.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nationwide confidential survey of 3,000 priests by The
Star, two-thirds of the more than 800 responding lauded the church
for being caring and compassionate to priests with AIDS. Often, the
church covers medical costs, gives them a place to live and cares
for them until they die.
</P>
<P>
   Most priests, however, said the church failed to offer an early
and effective sexual education that might have prevented infection
in the first place. Two-thirds said sexuality either was not
addressed at all or was not discussed adequately in the seminary.
Three of four said the church needed to offer more education about
sexual issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexuality still needs to be talked about and dealt with,''
said the Rev. Dennis Rausch, a priest with AIDS who runs an AIDS
ministry program for Catholic Charities in the Archdiocese of
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to get into the seminary here for the last
several years to do an awareness course for the guys, so when they
come out, they at least have some knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Other findings of the survey, which had a margin of error of 3.5
percentage points, include:
</P>
<P>
   Six of 10 Roman Catholic priests in the United States know at
least one priest who died of an AIDS-related illness, and one-third
know a priest currently living with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of those responding _ about 1 in 114 _ said they either
have HIV or AIDS or might have but haven't been tested. That would
translate into about 400 priests nationwide, an estimate supported
by members of the National Catholic AIDS Network. In the general
U.S. population, according to figures from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, between 1 in 300 and 1 in 420 people are
infected.
</P>
<P>
   Many priests and behavioral experts argue that the church's
adherence to 12th-century doctrine about the virtues of celibacy
and its teachings on homosexuality have contributed to the spread
of AIDS within the clergy. Unwittingly, the church has kept
fledgling priests _ some of whom were as young as 14 when they
entered seminary in the '60s and '70s _ uneducated about the
reality of a sexual world and its temptations.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, by treating homosexual acts as an abomination and the
breaking of celibacy vows as shameful, the church has scared
priests into silence, some say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this speaks to a failure on the part of the church,''
said Auxiliary Bishop Thomas Gumbleton of the Archdiocese of
Detroit. ``Gay priests and heterosexual priests didn't know how to
handle their sexuality, their sexual drive. And so they would
handle it in ways that were not healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``How to be celibate and to be gay at the same time, and how to
be celibate and heterosexual at the same time, that's what we were
never really taught how to do. And that was a major failing.''
</P>
<P>
   Roman Catholic cardinals in the United States and high-ranking
church officials in Rome declined requests to discuss the issue or
the newspaper's findings.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican, which has no policy on dealing with priests who
have AIDS, referred questions about the issue to local bishops.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Raymond J. Boland of the Diocese of Kansas City-St.
Joseph in Missouri said the AIDS deaths show that priests are
human.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much as we would regret it, it shows that human nature is
human nature,'' Boland said. ``And all of us are heirs to all of
the misfortunes that can be foisted upon the human race.''
</P>
<P>
   Boland thinks church leaders now are doing a better job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel today that a lot of our men get many opportunities _
the standard of spiritual direction, the standard of formation is
much higher,'' Boland said.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, the issue of AIDS deaths among priests has
been so sensitive that many of those who later died kept their
illnesses a secret. Some death certificates listed AIDS-related
conditions such as pneumocystis pneumonia but never mentioned the
disease itself. Other certificates were falsified.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church clearly is not alone. Clergy in other
denominations also struggle with sexuality and have died of AIDS.
But the Catholic Church's condemnation of homosexual acts, its
requirement that priests be male and its unique demand of celibacy
make the issue all the more vexing for its followers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some very strong social implications behind this,''
said Robert Goss, a former Jesuit priest who is now chairman of the
Department of Religious Studies at Webster University in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Gays are in the priesthood, and not all of them are celibate, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of those issues are explosive issues that superiors and
bishops don't want to deal with publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   Goss himself left the priesthood after 11 years when he fell in
love with a seminarian who was just shy of ordination. The two
became longtime partners. The former seminarian died of AIDS in
1992.

<P>
   ...former seminarian died of AIDS in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Several church leaders respond that the church is dealing with
the issue forthrightly. Any criticism, they say, must be tempered
by the realization that many priests wish to keep their medical
condition private, as do many AIDS sufferers outside the church.
</P>
<P>
   Seminary education on sexuality has been slow to evolve, but so
has the acceptance of homosexuality and the understanding of AIDS
in the general population. Many of today's priests, whose average
age is about 60, entered the seminary in the 1960s, the age of
``free love'' and sexual experimentation _ not HIV awareness.
</P>
<P>
   The church hasn't abandoned its priests who have HIV or AIDS,
some say, and often celebrates their accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are priests who are gay, there are priests with AIDS,
there are priests who are different that are doing wonderful
ministry,'' said the Rev. Jim Nickel, director of pastoral care for
Damien Ministries in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what their frailties, no matter what their history,
no matter what their differences, there are people out there who
are making a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how many priests have died of AIDS or are infected with
HIV is unknown, in part because many suffer in solitude.
</P>
<P>
   When priests do tell their superiors, the cases generally are
handled quietly, either at the priests' requests or because church
officials are reluctant to discuss them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Bishop Emerson J. Moore left the Archdiocese of New
York and went to Minnesota, where he died in a hospice of an
AIDS-related illness. His death certificate attributed his death to
``unknown natural causes'' and listed his occupation as ``laborer''
in the manufacturing industry.
</P>
<P>
   After a Minnesota AIDS activist filed a complaint, officials
changed the cause of death to ``HIV-related illness.'' The
occupation, however, has not been corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Farley Cleghorn, an epidemiologist with the Institute of Human
Virology in Baltimore, said it was common practice with early cases
not to disclose AIDS as a cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first priest that I saw with AIDS _ this was back in 1982
_ we did not put AIDS on the death certificate, because they wanted
us not to,'' Cleghorn said.
</P>
<P>
   Cleghorn said he has treated about 20 priests and
religious-order brothers with AIDS, all of whom had kept it a
secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church and religious orders need to acknowledge that there
is a problem _ that priests have sex and they are susceptible to
all sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS,'' Cleghorn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most important message is that, just like every
other part of the population, priests need sex education and sexual
disease prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, experts who counseled and treated priests
with AIDS estimated that about 200 in the United States either had
died of AIDS or had contracted the disease. Now, those who work
with infected priests say the numbers are higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking several hundred,'' said the Rev. Jon Fuller, a
Jesuit priest and physician who serves as assistant director of
Boston Medical Center's Clinical AIDS Program.
</P>
<P>
   The Star alone _ through death certificates and interviews with
fellow priests and family members _ found information on about 100
priests who have died of AIDS nationwide since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   And many priests and medical experts now agree that at least 300
priests have died. That translates into an annualized AIDS-related
death rate of about 4 per 10,000 _ four times that of the general
population's rate of roughly 1 per 10,000 and about double the
death rate of the adult male population.
</P>
<P>
   Other statistics and experts suggest that those estimates are
too conservative.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the annualized death rate of priests confirmed by
The Star to have died of AIDS in Kansas and Missouri from 1987 to
1999 is 7 per 10,000, or seven times that of the general
population.
</P>
<P>
   That death rate is consistent with the rate calculated by The
Star after reviewing death certificates of priests who died in
California, Missouri and Massachusetts in 1995. The finding: six
priests _ or 7.3 per 10,000 _ died of AIDS in those combined states
that year. The AIDS death rate of the general population in those
three states in 1995 was 1.8 per 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   A.W. Richard Sipe, a former priest who has spent more than 30
years studying sexuality issues in the church, thinks that about
750 priests nationwide have died of such illnesses. That would
translate into an AIDS-related death rate eight times that of the
general population.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Barone, a New Jersey psychiatrist and AIDS expert, puts
the number of U.S. priests who have died at 1,000 _ nearly 11 times
the rate of the general population.
</P>
<P>
   Barone directed an AIDS ministry from 1983 to 1993 for students
at North American College in Rome. While there, he set up an
underground AIDS testing program. Over seven years, he tested
dozens of seminarians. Barone gave them false names, drove them to
their tests in an unmarked car and paid for the tests himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know who they were; they didn't know who I was,''
Barone said.
</P>
<P>
   Of those he worked with, he said, 1 in 12 tested HIV-positive.
By the time Barone left Rome, he had treated about 80 priests with
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy is many of them have been so duplicitous and so
closeted,'' said Barone, a member of the National Catholic AIDS
Network. ``They didn't realize what they were doing, not only to
themselves, but to other individuals, because of the exponential
transmission rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Isola, a New York City social worker and
psychotherapist, said all the priests with AIDS that he has treated
are gay men in their 40s to early 60s who became infected through
same-sex relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them had sexual contact in the seminary which
continued after ordination, and some of the men had their first
sexual contact with other priests or with laymen after they were
ordained,'' Isola said.
</P>
<P>
   Three-fourths of the priests responding to The Star's survey
described themselves as heterosexual, 15 percent said they were
homosexual and 5 percent bisexual. Estimates of the percentage of
homosexuals in the general population have been widely debated, but
those who conduct research on gays and lesbians say the figure is
between 5 percent and 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of education and inadequate preparation on sexual issues
continues to be a problem in the seminaries, many priests and
behavioral experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my experience, the great majority of the priests who take
that vow are really not developed enough psychosexually,'' Isola
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``During seminary, the questions about sex or homosexuality or
sexual feelings were usually dealt with by the novicemaster or the
head of training saying, `If you say the Mass every day and say the
rosary every day, the rest of it will take care of itself,' which
for many of them just doesn't work.''

 &HT;    Abernathy to serve fours years in prison
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A judge said Friday that former state Sen. Ralph David
Abernathy III has a good sense of humor and a lot of talent, all of
which he can put to use in the service of the community _ after he
serves four years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting Senior Judge L.A. McConnell Jr. sentenced Abernathy to
10 years, six on probation, on 18 counts of stealing state money,
violating his oath as a senator, false swearing, forgery and
influencing a witness.
</P>
<P>
   All of the criminal convictions stemmed from turning in false
expense vouchers while a senator. Abernathy was convicted last
month in his second trial in Fulton Superior Court. The first ended
in a mistrial when, jurors said, a single juror refused even to
consider the case against Abernathy.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell said being the son of a civil rights hero may have
been at the root of Abernathy's problems. Abernathy's father, the
late Rev. Ralph Abernathy, was the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s
best friend and most trusted confidant. King and the elder
Abernathy marched, prayed and went to jail together during the
civil right struggles of the 1950s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Abernathy, who showed up a half hour late for his sentencing,
showed little emotion in the courtroom. He and his attorneys had
seen the Fulton County Probation office report that McConnell
ordered, and the suggested sentence the judge followed.
</P>
<P>
   Abernathy hugged his mother, Juanita Abernathy, and smiled
before deputies led him away to the Fulton County Jail. McConnell
said he would conduct an appeal bond hearing for Abernathy next
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it,'' rasped veteran civil rights leader Hosea
Williams. ``He shouldn't get this much time.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Mrs. Abernathy and Williams begged the judge to let
Abernathy off with probation.
</P>
<P>
   Williams repeated his charge that Abernathy did nothing that
other legislators don't do. ``I helped raise him,'' said the aging
Williams, his arm in a sling and his voice barely audible. ``He has
never done anything corrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Abernathy's mother implied her son was the victim of racial
persecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot believe this is justice,'' she told McConnell before
the sentencing. ``These are the kind of inequities we protested 44
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son is not a criminal,'' she said. ``He is not a crook.''
</P>
<P>
   In a long preamble to his sentence, McConnell praised Mrs.
Abernathy as a ``gracious, kind and caring woman'' and said her son
was ``a very likeable person and a very talented person. I think
he's got a lot to offer the community, maybe as a minister, once he
gets this behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Abernathy's father, the judge said, ``was certainly one of the
most admired men we have had in the last century.'' The children of
such men, he said, often carry expectations based on their father's
greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tragically, these expectations can be beyond attainment, and
often breed acts of desperation, which is what I see here.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell, a senior Superior Court judge in Houston County, said
he asked for the probation office guidelines because he did not
want to impose the attitudes of middle Georgia on a Fulton County
case.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wanted to hand down a sentence ``that the citizens of
Fulton County think would be appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge indicated he would deny, at least in part, the
defense's plea for first offender status. In fact, he wondered
aloud if he should have given a heavier sentence on the
witness-influencing count, in which Abernathy was tape-recorded
begging and bullying his former public relations adviser to lie and
say he had paid her money that he had not.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you listen to those tapes, it's about as egregious a case
ever presented to this court in an attempt to subvert justice,''
McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   If Abernathy's bond is denied next week, he will be sent to the
Diagnostics and Classification Center in Jackson, where his health
needs and security level will be evaluated before he is assigned to
a prison.

   Rudolph's fate remains a mystery
</P>
<P>
   By Kathy Scruggs
</P>
<P>
   and Ron Martz
</P>
<P>
   Emily Lyons musters up a laugh from her gut _ about her missing
eye _ not something just anyone whose life was changed by a maiming
bomb would joke about.
</P>
<P>
   But as the second anniversary of the bombing of a Birmingham
abortion clinic approaches, the 43-year-old nurse who worked at the
clinic talks about where she will be to ``celebrate'' today
_somewhere in Northern California on a whirlwind seven-day,
seven-city speaking tour.
</P>
<P>
   The nail-laden bomb shattered Lyons' face and legs, but not her
spirit. She was given the Margaret Sanger Women of Valor award from
Planned Parenthood in April.
</P>
<P>
   She jokes about everything and concedes that her sense of humor
is now a ``little more warped'' than before the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people that I haven't found that eye yet,'' she said.
``I keep a fake one on the shelf _ one that you can roll around _
and it's always looking up.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the alleged bomber, Eric Robert Rudolph, 33, is a subject
for her humor. Lyons says she dreams of finding the North Carolina
fugitive and dragging him in _ tied to the bumper of her BMW
convertible: ``He's not good enough to put in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph, meanwhile, continues to elude authorities and build on
his survivalist legend in the mountains of western North Carolina,
where he was last seen and where the Southeast Bomb Task Force,
headed by the FBI, continues to hunt for him. Some think he's
probably dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut instinct is that he is still there, in a cave, and he's
dead. That's only my opinion,'' John MaGaw, former director of the
U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said last month.
</P>
<P>
   But many other investigators think Rudolph is very much alive _
and very much a danger
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good enough to say he's dead and go home,'' said
Terry Turchie, the FBI official who led the Rudolph case for a year
and who headed the investigation that finally landed the Unabomber
after 18 years of searching.
</P>
<P>
   Turchie, now associate special agent in charge in San Francisco,
thinks Rudolph is still playing hide-and-seek with agents in the
North Carolina mountains. ``We have no information that puts him
anywhere else,'' Turchie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I think back to the Unabomber investigation,'' he
said. ``Between 1987 and 1993, no one heard from the Unabomber. A
lot of people out there were saying, `Why are you still spending
money on that?' That's the best modern-day example I can think of.
We are where the trail ended, and that's where we need to stay.
Most people are creatures of habit. They stay where they are
comfortable. They go where they know.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Killorin, special agent in charge of the Atlanta ATF
office, tends to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still my sense he most likely would remain in that area
of North Carolina. But if he got out of the area and needed to go
to ground again, he would return to that area,'' Killorin said.
``We've learned that he feels that he's safer in that kind of rural
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph demonstrated his ability to hide for long periods of
time during the six months between the Birmingham bombing and when
he last surfaced taking supplies from an acquaintance in North
Carolina in July of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a pretty substantial amount of time. And there are
indications he could go longer,'' Killorin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph is charged with building and triggering the Birmingham
bomb remotely from a nearby alley. He is believed to have watched
as Robert DeWayne ``Sandy'' Sanderson, 35, a Birmingham police
officer moonlighting as a security guard at the clinic, leaned over
to inspect a package left near the entrance to the New Woman All
Women Health Care clinic the morning of Jan. 29, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A man was seen about two blocks away right after the explosion.
He slipped off a blond wig and got into a pickup that was
registered to Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   Some time laer, after parts of electronics had been surgically
removed from her, Lyons learned that she was injured and Sanderson
was killed by a remotely detonated bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI came over that day,'' Lyons said. ``I just cried.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph is also charged with three Atlanta bombings, beginning
with the 1996 bombing during the Olympics, which killed an Albany
woman, contributed to the death of a man, and injured 111 people.
Three bombs of galvanized steel pipes packed with smokeless powder
and taped together with concrete flooring nails were left under a
bench in Centennial Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph allegedly bought the smokeless powder for the park bomb
from a licensed dealer in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Later bombings in which he is charged employed dynamite instead
of powder. They were at a Sandy Springs abortion clinic in January
1997, at a nightclub catering to lesbians on Piedmont Road in
February 1997 and at the Birmingham clinic in January 1998. The
constant worry is that the bomber might strike again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is a person committed to carrying out these bombings. I
believe that was what his mission was,'' Killorin said. ``This is
not a crime from which he reaped great profit. This is a crime
committed because of a twisted belief system, so we believe it
would be hard for someone to walk away from that. This is a very
canny individual.''

YELTSIN ASSOCIATE DENIES INVOLVEMENT IN SWISS MONEY LAUNDERING 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A senior aide to former President Boris Yeltsin,
apparently charged in a Swiss money-laundering case, said Friday
that the accusations were slanderous and that he would face
questioning in Switzerland if asked.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Russian prosecutors cast doubt on the nature
of the charges, saying a Swiss warrant for the aide, Pavel Borodin,
seemed to call only for his testimony and not, as the Swiss have
said, for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   News reports Thursday quoted Swiss investigators as saying an
international arrest warrant had been issued for Borodin, who
oversaw Russia's half-trillion-dollar portfolio of property and
national treasures under Yeltsin's rule.
</P>
<P>
   Borodin has long been a target of a Swiss inquiry into
accusations of kickbacks tied to contracts awarded by his office to
renovate the Kremlin. Hundreds of millions of dollars in Kremlin
work went to a Swiss company, Mabetex, which is at the center of
the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Mabetex officials have strongly denied that the company did
anything illegal to obtain the work. Borodin and Kremlin spokesmen
have repeatedly said the contracts were above-board.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, Borodin said he had yet to receive
any demand from Swiss officials in connection with the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no warrant for my arrest,'' he said. ``There is no
warrant of any kind. Nobody has summoned me anywhere in any form.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian general prosecutor's office, which has also been
investigating the Mabetex case, told the Interfax news service that
its own unofficial contacts with the Swiss suggested that the
warrant called only for Borodin to be questioned in the affair.
</P>
<P>
   The senior investigator in the Russian inquiry into Mabetex,
Ruslan Tamayev, said he had asked the Russian branch of Interpol to
look into the issuance of a warrant for Borodin. But the news
service quoted the deputy chief of Interpol's Russian office as
saying the agency had yet to receive any Swiss documents.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Borodin said he would have ``no problems
whatsoever'' going to Switzerland for questioning in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would definitely go,'' he said. ``I have great respect for
Switzerland.''
</P>
<P>
   His attorney said later that international conventions would
guarantee Borodin's safe return to Russia should he agree to be
questioned in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Borodin was a top Kremlin aide until Vladimir Putin became
acting president Dec. 31 after Yeltsin resigned. In one of his
first personnel moves, Putin appointed Borodin secretary of a
council overseeing an economic union of Russia and neighboring
Belarus.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last September, at the Michael Kors spring fashion
show, three sets of sisters, reed thin and crisply dressed,
threaded their way past curious publicists and editors before
piling into the front row. The Lauder, Boardman and Miller sisters
may as well have been on the runway for all the frantic camera
clicking, notepad filling and neck craning of bystanders angling
for a closer look.
</P>
<P>
   A minute later, when the lights dimmed, the impression was
redoubled, for there on the catwalk were the young women's mirror
images: models with enormous towels sweeping up their hair, as if
they'd just stepped up from the cabana in Palm Beach. The fashions
were inspired by Lilly Pulitzer's bold colors _ lemon, tangerine
and aqua _ and Pucci's psychedelic swirls. There were also
baby-blue cable-knit sweaters and zebra-stripe blouses.
</P>
<P>
   Designers have always had their muses _ the women they fantasize
about dressing while sitting at the drawing board _ but rarely has
the connection between front row and runway seemed so direct as at
Kors' show, which looked like the moment of critical mass for this
spring's strongest trend: the return of discreet, ladylike
dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Not just at Kors, but also at Louis Vuitton, Ralph Lauren and
even cutting-edge Prada, the Park Avenue princess is the new
fashion icon. Designers have revived blouses tied with a bow,
shirtdresses, A-line skirts and other staples of postdebutante
style. They have turned their backs on the overt sexuality of
Hollywood, rock stars and supermodels and embraced the glamour of
swan-necked, icily poised socialites.
</P>
<P>
   It is no coincidence that this is occurring when a new
generation of daughters and wives of Manhattan's superrich have
emerged on the social scene. Their names are filling the night life
columns of newspapers and magazines, elbowing aside traditional
stars of movies and pop music.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen so much rock 'n' roll sequins and heavy eyeliner
from Donatella Versace and Tom Ford and Tommy Hilfiger,'' said
Alexandra Kotur, Vogue's party coverage editor. ``We needed a new
theme.'' She includes many of the young socialites in her pages,
along with traditional celebrities. ``It's so much more fresh to
show a real mix _ a photo of an edgy singer like Lil' Kim next to a
social young woman like Marina Rust,'' she said. ``They have great
flair, and we always want to know what they're wearing and what
they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The polished young women sitting in today's fashion hot seats
include, besides Ms. Rust, Samantha and Serena Boardman, Sloan
Lindemann Barnett, Lauren duPont, Jane Lauder and Aerin Lauder
Zinterhofer, Brooke de Ocampo and the ubiquitous Miller sisters _
Alexandra von Furstenberg, Pia Getty and Crown Princess Pavlos of
Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've achieved their own kind of celebrity,'' said Patrick
McMullan, whose party pictures appear in New York magazine and
Vanity Fair. ``They walk into the room, and I mean, they own it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not since the 1960s reign of Slim Keith and Babe Paley, the
original beautiful people anointed by Diana Vreeland, have social
figures so influenced fashion and culture.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' with its plot line of socialite
envy and aping, Gwyneth Paltrow plays a gloss on her own life as a
privileged child of the Upper East Side and the Spence School. The
model Carolyn Murphy is a similarly aloof young society daughter in
the Grace Kelly mold in ``Liberty Heights.'' Offscreen, Ms. Paltrow
is in a Dior ad for a boxy ladylike handbag, set on a balcony
overlooking Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Glossy magazines are stepping up coverage of young socialites.
Harper's Bazaar has hired away W's society reporter, Melissa Ceria.
Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair, is considering a feature
on young socialites in the mold of his annual young Hollywood
fold-out cover story.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the love life of James Truman. Truman is editorial
director of Conde Nast, which entails knowing which way the
cultural tide is running. Since late last year, he has been dating
Samantha Boardman, 28, a medical student, who lays claim to several
generations in both Locust Valley and Palm Beach. The couple have
been out in New York, they attended the Metropolitan Museum's
Costume Institute gala last month, and this weekend, Ms. Boardman,
who is descended on her mother's side from the founder of the First
National Bank of New York, plans to take Truman on his first visit
to Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, she posed with seven other members of her set for
a two-page fashion spread in the current Talk magazine, everyone
dressed in the spring Michael Kors collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Palm Beach _ they trim those privet hedges with nail
scissors out there,'' Kors said. ``This season is about looking
pretty and groomed, with a little flag-waving thrown in. All that
coupled with a boom economy, and suddenly it's OK to be looking
back at those stylish icons of the '50s and '60s. They make a great
reference, and then what you do is make it modern.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It's a lifestyle that sells, because no matter
what's coming around the corner in fashion, people will always
crave a look that is glamorous, beautiful, sexy and rich.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, people have not always craved the look, or the life of
country clubs and charity galas that the look implies. A decade
ago, once-prominent socialites like Pat Buckley, Susan Gutfreund
and Gayfryd Steinberg had faded from the front rows of fashion
shows and the covers of society magazines. They had made their mark
as leaders of philanthropy, supporting New York's hospitals and
museums, but no younger generation took their place.
</P>
<P>
   The pendulum is swinging back. Aerin Lauder Zinterhofer, 29,
fronting for her family's cosmetics empire, was the youngest
co-chairwoman ever of the Costume Institute gala. Ms. Rust, 34,
whose great-great-grandfather was Marshall Field of the department
store chain, spent part of her childhood on an Oregon commune, but
now she embraces the blueblood tradition to which she is heir, with
a Mark Hampton-designed apartment and her own foundation.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 25, Ms. Rust; Aerin Lauder; Ms. duPont, 28; and Ms. von
Furstenberg, 28, will be chairwomen of a new junior society ball
for the Frick Collection, the Fifth Avenue museum whose paintings
and parties are culled from the era of Mrs. Astor's 400. Guests are
requested to wear Edwardian clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when the emulation of one's parents'
generation was anathema,'' said Amy Fine Collins, a fashion writer
and special correspondent for Vanity Fair. ``The conservatism
implied by dressing in golf clothes was hopelessly dated and square
and shallow. This was true for my husband's age group, and he's 44.
People just 10 years younger are embracing again what was once
rejected by his preppy peers. Clubs, bastions of tradition, which
not long ago wondered if they would survive, are suddenly
experiencing a resurgence of memberships.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons that being a young socialite was out of style
through much of the 1990s was the stigma of the word itself,
suggesting a woman who didn't work and had few interests beyond
parties and clothes. The term is still loaded, but what
distinguishes the latest Park Avenue princesses is that many have
serious careers. Both Lauder daughters are executives in the Estee
Lauder Companies. Samantha Boardman will graduate from Cornell
Medical College in May, and her older sister, Serena, 29, works for
a luxury-goods Web site.

</P>
<P>
   ``I feel comfortable enough in my achievements that I can ignore
the stereotypes of being called a socialite,'' said Ms. Barnett,
32, a former Manhattan assistant district attorney, who writes a
weekly consumer column for The New York Daily News and is co-host
of a show about Internet shopping on Oxygen, the new
cable-television service and Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barnett, the daughter of George Lindemann, whose fortune
from cable TV and cellular phones is put at $1.5 billion by Forbes
magazine, was married in June to Roger Barnett, 35, the son of
Victor Barnett, the chairman of Burberry. Christian Lacroix
designed her wedding gown.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to know why I'm working so much,'' Ms. Barnett
said. ``What do they want me to do? Get a facial all day long?'' On
Thursday night, she was a chairwoman of the Young Collectors' Night
at the Winter Antiques Show, a benefit for the East Side House
Settlement. At 8:45, she and her husband, who last year founded
Beauty.com, a cosmetics Web site he has sold for $42 million,
dashed from the show on Park Avenue to the Metropolitan Opera,
where they were hosts of the Young Patrons Trio Series, an evening
of opera for 135 of their friends.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barnett discovered opera through her mother, Frayda, who has
a Ph.D. in musicology and sits on the Met's board. ``My mother set
an example for me not to be just a party girl,'' said Ms. Barnett,
a graduate of Brown University and New York University Law School.
``She wanted me to have a real career and education. All of this
doesn't mean you can't wear a pretty dress. That's what is new
about our age group. The TV show `Ally McBeal' shows a woman who is
in court in front of judges all day, and they have her wearing
miniskirts up to her panties. I think the times have definitely
changed. Women are now comfortable enough with their intelligence
and power to retain their femininity.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Samantha Boardman is secure enough in her identity as
a future doctor to joke about her fashion obsession. ``I love
Carolina Herrera and Oscar de la Renta, but Michael Kors is
definitely my favorite,'' she said. ``He's hysterical. I was
recently complaining about how unchic my hospital scrubs were, and
he told me that he'd design me a pair in cashmere.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barnett understands exactly what is expected of her in
exchange for having her name prominently listed on fund-raising
invitations: She gives cocktail parties in her palatial Park Avenue
apartment, to which the press is invited to play voyeur, and
provides a mailing list of friends' names for tickets of $200 or
so. ``Being visible for the press helps my charities,'' she said
simply.
</P>
<P>
   How much of these women's visibility is in the cause of
altruism, and how much is self-promotion, a desire to see their
names and photographs in print, is impossible to say, though no
doubt both motives are involved. Many donors to good causes donate
in perfect anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   John Fairchild, the former publisher of Women's Wear Daily, who
tracked the figures of the '60s like Charlotte and Anne Ford, Jane
Holzer, Marisa Berenson, Jacqueline Kennedy and Lee Radziwill, said
their support of good works was often beside the point, more a
means of seeing their images in print. ``They all wanted to be
photographed, so they'd end up on the best-dressed list and get
their clothes at a reasonable price,'' he said. ``But did they ever
complain about it all!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The women know they're good-looking, and they love clothes and
jewelry,'' he added. ``There's nothing wrong with that, but it can
all lead to an unattractive kind of competitiveness. If I was
married to a young woman who was chasing the camera all the time,
I'd spank her.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodness knows that being a fashion icon is a demanding job.
There are runway shows and sample sales to attend, gowns to chose
and wear for the inspection of the press, and publicist-organized
dinners and cocktail parties upon which to alight. If this sounds
vaguely like the duties and privileges of a fashion magazine
editor, it is because the glossy magazines have long blurred the
line between official and unofficial fashion arbiters. Vogue and
its sisters have shown keen instincts for plucking women of wealth
and taste from their natural habitat and installing them on
mastheads, where their editing duties often take a back seat to
social ones.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Vreeland was discovered while dancing on the St. Regis'
roof wearing a bolero and a crown of red roses. Today, Anna Wintour
liberally stocks Vogue's masthead with young social beauties, whose
job descriptions in part are to be photographed socializing, often
in Vogue's own pages. Ms. duPont and Ms. Rust have been among
these. Last year, Ms. Rust's white-tie wedding in Maine to Ian
Connor, an investment banker, with flowers by Robert Isabell,
merited six pages in Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Betts, for her just-completed makeover of Harper's Bazaar,
enticed Ms. de Ocampo, a daughter of Greenwich, Conn., whose
Argentine-born husband, Emilio, is an investment banker, to become
a contributor to Harper's Bazaar. Ms. de Ocampo is writing a book
about society interiors for Assouline Publishing, and her access to
that world is now at Ms. Betts' disposal.
</P>
<P>
   The February issue of Bazaar is a veritable ode to discreet chic
and the privileged young women who embody it. There are no fewer
than five articles on the theme, including a beauty article on the
cosmetics inspired by Michael Kors and a 16-page fashion spread,
``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' photographed on Palm Beach golf
links, lawns and Worth Avenue. That issue has an article about the
Manhattan apartments of Jane and Aerin Lauder Zinterhofer, and for
the March issue Ms. Betts assigned Patrick Demarchelier to
photograph Serena and Samantha Boardman.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Betts, 35, a Princeton graduate who grew up on the Upper
East Side, seems to be merging her life with the young socialites
she covers. She gave up her Thanksgiving weekend to fly to Palm
Beach to be host of a Chanel store party populated with them, and
she became a last-minute chairwoman of the New York Botanical
Garden's junior-committee gala in December, a young society
favorite, chock full of belles in winter whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very savvy business move on her part,'' said Tim
Landi, a vice president for communications at the Botanical Garden,
who organized a heavy-hitting committee that caught Ms. Betts'
attention with its first party a year earlier: Whitney Fairchild, a
daughter-in-law of Fairchild of Women's Wear Daily; Nathalie
Gerschel-Kaplan, a daughter of Patrick Gerschel, a private
investor; Ms. de Ocampo, the daughter of Robert Douglass, a former
vice chairman of the Chase Manhattan Corp.; and Aerin Lauder
Zinterhofer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their parents have been involved with the garden for over 20
years, so in our minds we were just developing the next wave of
donors,'' Landi said of Ms. Gerschel-Kaplan and Ms. de Ocampo.
``Their seated dinner in the conservatory has been so successful
these past two years, though, that we're now running the risk of
superseding that goal with the kind of elitism that creeps in when
you have a finite number of coveted tickets.''

A STOCK UNDER FIRE ATTRACTS UNLIKELY BUYERS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 30) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Fla., Tenn., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By MICHELLE LEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Plummeting share price, and a board of directors facing sharp
shareholder criticism. A pair of suits alleging fraud, and a steep
fall in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   All of this applies to Curative Health Services of Hauppauge,
N.Y., which runs 160 wound-care centers at hospitals nationwide.
And if you think Curative's problems would attract short-sellers,
you're right.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, the short-sellers, Joseph Feshbach, of Los
Altos Hills, Calif., and his brother Matthew Feshbach, of Bellaire,
Fla., have been buying Curative shares, not selling them short, and
now hold a 6.7 percent stake in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Curative's woes began last February, when it said that its 1999
sales growth would slow. Shares fell more than 50 percent, to
$11.25 on Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Justice Department announced that it was joining a
suit brought by a hospital administrator in Fort Myers, Fla.,
against Curative and Columbia/HCA Healthcare, the health care giant
based in Nashville, contending that the companies defrauded
Medicare. Curative's stock closed that month at $5.625.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint contends that the companies worked together to
inflate fees for Curative services.
</P>
<P>
   Curative said it was in compliance with the law. Jeff Prescott,
a spokesman for Columbia/HCA, said that the company had not
responded to the specific allegations but that it is in settlement
talks with the government regarding this and other suits.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Curative disclosed that a second suit had
been filed in New York, under seal, making similar allegations.
Shares closed at $6.50 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Feshbachs used the sell-off as a chance to buy Curative
shares: they disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on Nov. 22 that they had acquired a stake. ``It's a
value proposition,'' Joseph Feshbach said.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s and early '90s, the Feshbachs were known for
betting against Wall Street darlings like L.A. Gear whose share
prices later fell, earning them double-digit returns.
(Short-sellers borrow stock and sell it, expecting to repay the
shares to the lenders at a lower price, locking in a profit.)
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, the Feshbachs have bet on turnarounds, too.
``We don't exclusively sell stocks anymore,'' Joseph Feshbach said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the Feshbachs are seeking representation on
Curative's board _ whose performance they are quick to criticize.
``The stock is down more than 80 percent and something needs to be
done,'' Joseph Feshbach said. ``We're optimistic that we can do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Feshbachs' chief criticisms is that Curative has not
acted on plans to buy back its shares. They also say the board
lacks adequate management representation.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors have their criticisms, too. ``This board froze
like a deer in headlights,'' said Basil P. Regan, general partner
in Regan Partners, a Manhattan hedge fund that holds a big Curative
stake.
</P>
<P>
   William Tella, a Curative spokesman, said the company was ``very
close to reaching an agreement'' with the Feshbachs under which it
would give them board seats and buy back shares. He declines to
elaborate. Tella and a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, Gina
Talamona, declined to comment on whether there were settlement
talks.
</P>
<P>
   But are investors battling over a company that, given the legal
woes, may be a dead cat?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. Kelly Crowe, an analyst at Morgan Keegan &AMP; Co., said
she worried that if there were fines, they could be as high as $100
million _ more than the company's market value _ and that some
hospitals might cancel contracts with Curative. Ms. Crowe said she
doubted that any other company would buy Curative _ an option
suggested by the Feshbachs in their filing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Curative has some strong fundamentals. In the third
quarter, it reported gross margins of 43 percent. It carries no
debt. And Joseph Feshbach calculates its book value at $7 a share,
including $4.50 in cash _ 7.7 percent more than Friday's closing
share price. Despite high legal costs, Curative managed a profit of
$2.2 million for the quarter, half what it earned a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Feshbach said he did not expect the litigation to put the
company out of business. ``The accusations against them are in a
very gray area in our view,'' he said, ``and we believe the company
will come to an acceptable resolution.''

Hundreds of Roman Catholic priests across the United States have
died of AIDS-related illnesses, and hundreds more are living with
HIV, the virus that causes the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The actual number of AIDS deaths is difficult to determine. But
it appears priests are dying of AIDS at a rate at least four times
that of the general U.S. population, according to estimates from
medical experts and priests and an analysis of health statistics by
The Kansas City Star.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri and Kansas alone, at least 16 priests and two
religious-order brothers have died of AIDS since early 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths are of such concern to the church that most dioceses
and religious orders now require applicants for the priesthood to
take an HIV-antibody test before their ordination.
</P>
<P>
   For the nation's 60 million Catholics, served by 46,000 priests,
the AIDS issue goes straight to the heart of church doctrine _ a
doctrine that teaches compassion and forgiveness but also considers
homosexual relations a sin and opposes the modern practice of
``safe sex.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nationwide confidential survey of 3,000 priests by The
Star, two-thirds of the more than 800 responding lauded the church
for being caring and compassionate to priests with AIDS. Often, the
church covers medical costs, gives them a place to live and cares
for them until they die.
</P>
<P>
   Most priests, however, said the church failed to offer an early
and effective sexual education that might have prevented infection
in the first place. Two-thirds said sexuality either was not
addressed at all or was not discussed adequately in the seminary.
Three of four said the church needed to offer more education about
sexual issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexuality still needs to be talked about and dealt with,''
said the Rev. Dennis Rausch, a priest with AIDS who runs an AIDS
ministry program for Catholic Charities in the Archdiocese of
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to get into the seminary here for the last
several years to do an awareness course for the guys, so when they
come out, they at least have some knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Other findings of the survey, which had a margin of error of 3.5
percentage points, include:
</P>
<P>
   Six of 10 Roman Catholic priests in the United States know at
least one priest who died of an AIDS-related illness, and one-third
know a priest currently living with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of those responding _ about 1 in 114 _ said they either
have HIV or AIDS or might have but haven't been tested. That would
translate into about 400 priests nationwide, an estimate supported
by members of the National Catholic AIDS Network. In the general
U.S. population, according to figures from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, between 1 in 300 and 1 in 420 people are
infected.
</P>
<P>
   Many priests and behavioral experts argue that the church's
adherence to 12th-century doctrine about the virtues of celibacy
and its teachings on homosexuality have contributed to the spread
of AIDS within the clergy. Unwittingly, the church has kept
fledgling priests _ some of whom were as young as 14 when they
entered seminary in the '60s and '70s _ uneducated about the
reality of a sexual world and its temptations.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, by treating homosexual acts as an abomination and the
breaking of celibacy vows as shameful, the church has scared
priests into silence, some say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this speaks to a failure on the part of the church,''
said Auxiliary Bishop Thomas Gumbleton of the Archdiocese of
Detroit. ``Gay priests and heterosexual priests didn't know how to
handle their sexuality, their sexual drive. And so they would
handle it in ways that were not healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``How to be celibate and to be gay at the same time, and how to
be celibate and heterosexual at the same time, that's what we were
never really taught how to do. And that was a major failing.''
</P>
<P>
   Roman Catholic cardinals in the United States and high-ranking
church officials in Rome declined requests to discuss the issue or
the newspaper's findings.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican, which has no policy on dealing with priests who
have AIDS, referred questions about the issue to local bishops.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Raymond J. Boland of the Diocese of Kansas City-St.
Joseph in Missouri said the AIDS deaths show that priests are
human.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much as we would regret it, it shows that human nature is
human nature,'' Boland said. ``And all of us are heirs to all of
the misfortunes that can be foisted upon the human race.''
</P>
<P>
   Boland thinks church leaders now are doing a better job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel today that a lot of our men get many opportunities _
the standard of spiritual direction, the standard of formation is
much higher,'' Boland said.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, the issue of AIDS deaths among priests has
been so sensitive that many of those who later died kept their
illnesses a secret. Some death certificates listed AIDS-related
conditions such as pneumocystis pneumonia but never mentioned the
disease itself. Other certificates were falsified.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church clearly is not alone. Clergy in other
denominations also struggle with sexuality and have died of AIDS.
But the Catholic Church's condemnation of homosexual acts, its
requirement that priests be male and its unique demand of celibacy
make the issue all the more vexing for its followers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some very strong social implications behind this,''
said Robert Goss, a former Jesuit priest who is now chairman of the
Department of Religious Studies at Webster University in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Gays are in the priesthood, and not all of them are celibate, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of those issues are explosive issues that superiors and
bishops don't want to deal with publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   Goss himself left the priesthood after 11 years when he fell in
love with a seminarian who was just shy of ordination. The two
became longtime partners. The former seminarian died of AIDS in
1992.

PRIEST1: DAY ONE OF PRIESTS SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY L. THOMAS  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (NOTE: EMGARGOED FOR SUNDAY AMS JAN 30 HOLD FOR RELEASE)
...former seminarian died of AIDS in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Several church leaders respond that the church is dealing with
the issue forthrightly. Any criticism, they say, must be tempered
by the realization that many priests wish to keep their medical
condition private, as do many AIDS sufferers outside the church.
</P>
<P>
   Seminary education on sexuality has been slow to evolve, but so
has the acceptance of homosexuality and the understanding of AIDS
in the general population. Many of today's priests, whose average
age is about 60, entered the seminary in the 1960s, the age of
``free love'' and sexual experimentation _ not HIV awareness.
</P>
<P>
   The church hasn't abandoned its priests who have HIV or AIDS,
some say, and often celebrates their accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are priests who are gay, there are priests with AIDS,
there are priests who are different that are doing wonderful
ministry,'' said the Rev. Jim Nickel, director of pastoral care for
Damien Ministries in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what their frailties, no matter what their history,
no matter what their differences, there are people out there who
are making a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how many priests have died of AIDS or are infected with
HIV is unknown, in part because many suffer in solitude.
</P>
<P>
   When priests do tell their superiors, the cases generally are
handled quietly, either at the priests' requests or because church
officials are reluctant to discuss them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Bishop Emerson J. Moore left the Archdiocese of New
York and went to Minnesota, where he died in a hospice of an
AIDS-related illness. His death certificate attributed his death to
``unknown natural causes'' and listed his occupation as ``laborer''
in the manufacturing industry.
</P>
<P>
   After a Minnesota AIDS activist filed a complaint, officials
changed the cause of death to ``HIV-related illness.'' The
occupation, however, has not been corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Farley Cleghorn, an epidemiologist with the Institute of Human
Virology in Baltimore, said it was common practice with early cases
not to disclose AIDS as a cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first priest that I saw with AIDS _ this was back in 1982
_ we did not put AIDS on the death certificate, because they wanted
us not to,'' Cleghorn said.
</P>
<P>
   Cleghorn said he has treated about 20 priests and
religious-order brothers with AIDS, all of whom had kept it a
secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church and religious orders need to acknowledge that there
is a problem _ that priests have sex and they are susceptible to
all sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS,'' Cleghorn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most important message is that, just like every
other part of the population, priests need sex education and sexual
disease prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, experts who counseled and treated priests
with AIDS estimated that about 200 in the United States either had
died of AIDS or had contracted the disease. Now, those who work
with infected priests say the numbers are higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking several hundred,'' said the Rev. Jon Fuller, a
Jesuit priest and physician who serves as assistant director of
Boston Medical Center's Clinical AIDS Program.
</P>
<P>
   The Star alone _ through death certificates and interviews with
fellow priests and family members _ found information on about 100
priests who have died of AIDS nationwide since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   And many priests and medical experts now agree that at least 300
priests have died. That translates into an annualized AIDS-related
death rate of about 4 per 10,000 _ four times that of the general
population's rate of roughly 1 per 10,000 and about double the
death rate of the adult male population.
</P>
<P>
   Other statistics and experts suggest that those estimates are
too conservative.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the annualized death rate of priests confirmed by
The Star to have died of AIDS in Kansas and Missouri from 1987 to
1999 is 7 per 10,000, or seven times that of the general
population.
</P>
<P>
   That death rate is consistent with the rate calculated by The
Star after reviewing death certificates of priests who died in
California, Missouri and Massachusetts in 1995. The finding: six
priests _ or 7.3 per 10,000 _ died of AIDS in those combined states
that year. The AIDS death rate of the general population in those
three states in 1995 was 1.8 per 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   A.W. Richard Sipe, a former priest who has spent more than 30
years studying sexuality issues in the church, thinks that about
750 priests nationwide have died of such illnesses. That would
translate into an AIDS-related death rate eight times that of the
general population.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Barone, a New Jersey psychiatrist and AIDS expert, puts
the number of U.S. priests who have died at 1,000 _ nearly 11 times
the rate of the general population.
</P>
<P>
   Barone directed an AIDS ministry from 1983 to 1993 for students
at North American College in Rome. While there, he set up an
underground AIDS testing program. Over seven years, he tested
dozens of seminarians. Barone gave them false names, drove them to
their tests in an unmarked car and paid for the tests himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know who they were; they didn't know who I was,''
Barone said.
</P>
<P>
   Of those he worked with, he said, 1 in 12 tested HIV-positive.
By the time Barone left Rome, he had treated about 80 priests with
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy is many of them have been so duplicitous and so
closeted,'' said Barone, a member of the National Catholic AIDS
Network. ``They didn't realize what they were doing, not only to
themselves, but to other individuals, because of the exponential
transmission rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Isola, a New York City social worker and
psychotherapist, said all the priests with AIDS that he has treated
are gay men in their 40s to early 60s who became infected through
same-sex relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them had sexual contact in the seminary which
continued after ordination, and some of the men had their first
sexual contact with other priests or with laymen after they were
ordained,'' Isola said.
</P>
<P>
   Three-fourths of the priests responding to The Star's survey
described themselves as heterosexual, 15 percent said they were
homosexual and 5 percent bisexual. Estimates of the percentage of
homosexuals in the general population have been widely debated, but
those who conduct research on gays and lesbians say the figure is
between 5 percent and 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of education and inadequate preparation on sexual issues
continues to be a problem in the seminaries, many priests and
behavioral experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my experience, the great majority of the priests who take
that vow are really not developed enough psychosexually,'' Isola
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``During seminary, the questions about sex or homosexuality or
sexual feelings were usually dealt with by the novicemaster or the
head of training saying, `If you say the Mass every day and say the
rosary every day, the rest of it will take care of itself,' which
for many of them just doesn't work.''

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 28 - Filemon ``Phil'' Esquivel, Jr., mayor of
Kingsville, accompanied by space industry executives from South
Texas, brought a straight-forward message to GOP Sen. Phil Gramm
this week: help build a space launch site in Kenedy County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to diversify our national economy into space
deliveries,''
</P>
<P>
   Esquivel said in an interview before the meeting. ``It would be
an injustice to South Texas and the entire Nation not to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   His primary goal: to convince Gramm - who has in the past been
lukewarm to the spaceport idea -- to support legislation that
Esquivel said would help make building a space port in a 258,000
square-mile area in Sarita a reality, bringing a major economic
boost to his nearby town.
</P>
<P>
   Space launch companies are also vying for building the site,
which would be used to send reusable launch vehicles into space and
ferry parts to the International Space Station. The companies and
federal authorities are choosing between the Sarita site and one in
Brazoria County.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Moser, executive director of the Texas Aerospace Commission
in Austin, who joined Esquivel in the meeting, said the talk with
Gramm ``went extremely well. He was very supportive'' of the plans.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm found the site proposal ``rational and encouraging,'' said
spokesman Larry Neal, but only under specific conditions. The
senator, chairman of the banking committee, insisted that private
investors foot 20 percent of the bill before federal dollars
support the project.
</P>
<P>
   The total price tag for the launch pad and two space vehicles
from a California-based company, Space Access, is reported to be at
least $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gramm's view is pretty straight forward,'' Neal said. ``Before
he puts the taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars, there's
going to be private investment first.''
</P>
<P>
   Esquivel and supporters of the site, who have backing from Rep.
Solomon Ortiz, D-Corpus Christi, claim some amount of federal loans
are needed to encourage investors to even consider the project.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Texas spaceport supporters have in the past lobbied
for a specific bill to offer $500 million of government loans to
the commercial space launch industry, now they might favor a new
bill based on Gramm's proposal, Moser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next step is to take what Senator Gramm has indicated he
wants to do and put it in the form of legislation,'' Moser said.
Then, capital investors could put up money for the project, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Esquivel, a part-time insurance agent now in his second term in
office, maintains the space port would transform Kingsville by
employing 6,000 people just to build it, and boost the town's
university.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to provide a quality standard of living and that's
why I am
</P>
<P>
   pushing so hard for this,'' he said. ``Regionally it's very
important. It
</P>
<P>
   will produce quality jobs.''

RUSSIANS SAY MISSING JOURNALIST IS IN THEIR CUSTODY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Russian authorities confirmed Friday that they had
detained a journalist who was reporting from Chechnya for Radio
Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   An Interior Ministry spokesman said the journalist, Andrei
Babitsky, who had been missing for 12 days, was being held in a
jail in Chechnya because he had spent time with the rebels and was
not accredited by the Russian military to cover the war.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky, a Russian citizen who has worked for the U.S.-funded
Radio Liberty since 1989, is one of a handful of journalists who
have reported from Grozny, the embattled Chechen capital.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky's family insisted for days that he was being detained
by the Russian authorities despite early denials. The U.S. State
Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, said Washington was concerned
about Babitsky's fate and would raise the case with the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Since Russia began its military campaign in Chechnya last fall,
it has sought to restrict reporting about the war by foreign
journalists. Those who want to work in Chechnya are required to
apply for military accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   Accreditation is very difficult for reporters from foreign news
organizations to obtain, and it is granted for only a limited
period. According to the military's regulations, accredited
journalists cannot travel on their own but must be escorted by
military officials.
</P>
<P>
   To cover the fighting in Grozny, Babitsky ventured beyond the
Russian lines and entered the rebel-controlled area of the capital.
His reports about conditions inside the besieged city apparently
irritated Russian authorities. On Jan. 8, his Moscow apartment was
searched by Russian investigators who confiscated photographs of
dead Russian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   A Jan. 13 report by Babitsky recounted that Grozny was being
heavily bombed by the Russians and that civilians were being killed
as a result. Meanwhile, he said, many rebels had managed to survive
the barrage by hiding in cellars and other fortified positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, as before, the main victims will probably be civilians
who cannot leave the city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Babitsky informed colleagues by satellite
telephone that he planned to leave Grozny soon and return to
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday's announcement by the Interior Ministry, his
whereabouts had not been known for 12 days. Sergei Yastrzhembsky,
the new Russian government spokesman for the war, insisted as
recently as Wednesday that Russian authorities had no information
on Babitsky. Friday, an Interior Ministry official hinted that the
reporter would be released soon.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky was a human rights activist during Soviet times and
worked for the magazine Glasnost.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said that the U.S. Embassies in Russia and Georgia had
warned reporters against travel to Chechnya, which has been plagued
by war and kidnappings. But he also said that the Kremlin should
respect freedom of the press and not try to hinder journalists'
work.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The news about Babitsky came as fighting continued to rage in
Grozny. A Chechen paramilitary group allied with Moscow said it had
concluded a deal with rebels in the Chechen capital and that some
would leave the city on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But Aslan Maskhadov, the president of the breakaway republic,
has ordered the rebel fighters in Grozny to hold out until Feb. 23.
That is the 46th anniversary of Stalin's deportation of the Chechen
people to Kazakhstan. The Chechens were later allowed to return to
Chechnya, where they lived under Russian rule until the first
Chechen war, from 1994-96.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, met with Acting
President Vladimir Putin in Moscow Friday and expressed concern
over the toll the war has taken on civilians. An aide to Putin
described the talks as ``lively and frank.''

DAY TWO OF PRIEST SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY L. THOMAS  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (NOTE: EMGARGOED for MONDAY AMS JAN. 31 HOLD FOR RELEASE)
</P>
<P>
   The young men came from Kansas, Missouri, Colorado and Texas.
Some came from wealthy and prominent families, others from families
that were practically penniless.
</P>
<P>
   Many were ``cradle Catholics''; others converts. But all had
something in common _ a calling to serve God.
</P>
<P>
   They were united as novices at St. Stanislaus Seminary in
Florissant, Mo., a 150-year-old Jesuit institution tucked away in
the rolling countryside northwest of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of the sexual revolution, in the Age of Aquarius and
during the height of the Vietnam War, the 26 novices in the classes
of 1967 and 1968 spent their days in prayer and meditation,
preparing to become priests.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Stanislaus and other seminaries, there were rules:
(ital)Non quam duo, semper tres.(end ital) Not in twos, always
threes. And the young men were told to avoid ``particular
friendships.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, when it came to sex, there was often only silence.
</P>
<P>
   Just over two decades later, only seven of the 26 in the classes
of '67 and '68 had been ordained. Three of those seven had died of
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say St. Stanislaus represents a missed opportunity to
prevent the subsequent spread of AIDS in the priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hardly anybody was prepared to deal with the problematic side
of sexuality, because in most seminaries and religious communities,
it was a topic not discussed,'' said the Rev. James Gill, a Jesuit
priest and psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders say today they're doing a better job of educating
prospective priests about sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go to a number of seminaries, and sexuality is being
treated in a much more honest and direct way,'' said the Rev.
Stephen Rossetti, president of St. Luke Institute, a residential
treatment program for priests in Silver Spring, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Rossetti's center conducts one- and two-day sessions on human
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it's supposedly picked up by the seminary faculty
adviser, and they continue to dialogue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Rossetti said, people sometimes fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``And sometimes when they fail, some of them can come down with
AIDS,'' he said. ``And that's a terrible thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The lives of the St. Stanislaus novices paralleled those of
thousands of others who entered the priesthood during a tumultuous
era that reshaped not only American culture but also the Roman
Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an incredibly exciting time to be alive, to be young,''
said the Rev. William Hart McNichols, who entered St. Stanislaus in
1968 and is now a renowned iconographer. ``The world was moving so
fast then. It was the '60s, and gosh, it was wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the ``make love, not war'' theme resounded and the Second
Vatican Council liberalized some of the church's restrictive
policies, seminaries continued to avoid a hidden part of their
culture: homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   BREAKER HED: A magical place
</P>
<P>
   Posing for class pictures outside the novitiate, the St.
Stanislaus novices appeared much younger than their 18 or 19 years.
Some looked awkward, even slightly out of place, in their black
ankle-length cassocks cinched with rope-like belts.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dobbels of Olathe sat in the front row of the Class of '67,
chubby-cheeked and grinning. Also on that row, a fellow novice from
the Kansas City area stared solemnly, a scowl on his face.
</P>
<P>
   In the Class of '68 photo, Pat Arnold, fresh from Regis High
School in Denver, stood with his hands at his side. McNichols, who
had just finished a year at Colorado State University, sat in front
and to the right of Arnold, looking more like a gleeful 12-year-old
than age 19.
</P>
<P>
   The four soon would develop lasting friendships. Before long,
they would find that they had another common bond. They all were
gay.
</P>
<P>
   McNichols had grown up in Denver in a family of prominent
politicians. His father was governor of Colorado from 1957 to 1963,
and his uncle was a popular Denver mayor. Raised Catholic, young
Bill McNichols knew by the time he was 5 that he wanted to be a
priest.
</P>
<P>
   He entered St. Stanislaus in the fall of 1968. It was even
better than he'd imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very, very magical,'' McNichols said, ``sort of the
last of the old seminaries. There was this aura of history of a
place being lived in, prayed in, died in.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Arnold _ who also entered in September 1968 _ would
describe ``St. Stans'' in his book, ``Wildmen, Warriors and
Kings'':
</P>
<P>
   ``I entered the Jesuit order and encountered there a
spirituality rich with masculine myth, symbols, and lore....We
male-bonded in life-long friendships and dreamed of heroic lives in
service to Christ, like our forebears.''
</P>
<P>
   A typical day at St. Stans began around 5 a.m., when the novices
went to ``morning visit'' at the chapel. After prayer, they
returned to their rooms for 45 minutes of private meditation.
Throughout the day, they studied Jesuit spirituality, history of
the liturgy and Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Twice a week, the novices could listen to music after dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a gigantic renaissance going on,'' McNichols said.
``I remember driving home with Pat in the novitiate van and `Bridge
Over Troubled Water' came on, and also `He Ain't Heavy, He's My
Brother.' Those were his two favorite songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we all just got quiet in the car, because there's a sense
of spirituality in both of those songs. And the Doobie Brothers had
just done `Jesus is Just Alright With Me.' So over the radio was
coming a lot of spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Paul Keenan, who grew up in Kansas City and entered St.
Stans in September 1967 with Dobbels, said the events occurring
throughout the world were shaking the seminaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just shortly before me, they were real secluded. They spoke
Latin all the time, day in and day out,'' said Keenan, who now is
director of radio ministry for the Archdiocese of New York. ``By
the time we got there, they had loosened some of that up. We had
access to TV and radio, stuff like that. We had a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joe Kramer, a St. Stans novice in 1965, said lifting some of
the restrictions may have had unforeseen consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vatican II had just taken place, and everything was changed
from `law and authority' to `love,' '' Kramer said. ``This wasn't a
hippie commune, but there certainly was a lot of that element
coming in, which allowed people to feel more and open up more.
Almost all of us were kids; we were 17, 18, 19 years old. So we
weren't very experienced in the world, or in our own emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Or in dealing with their sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never brought up,'' Kramer said.

</P>
<P>
   ...never brought up,'' Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
   BREAKER HED: Inner conflict
</P>
<P>
   As Kramer grew to know his fellow novices and superiors at St.
Stanislaus, he realized that others were gay like him. He tried to
avoid the temptations of sex and learned that it was best not to
talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have this joke, that the fourth vow is that you're
not going to come out,'' he said, referring to the vows of poverty,
obedience and chastity that religious orders require priests to
take.
</P>
<P>
   By late 1975, Kramer found the struggle between his sexual
identity and his commitment to the church too difficult. He took a
leave of absence and never returned.
</P>
<P>
   McNichols said Arnold was struggling with an inner conflict as
well. His was more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat had this darkness, a void inside,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold told McNichols that he often felt that God wasn't with
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had nothing but a desire for God, which any spiritual guide
will tell you (ital)is(end ital) God. You can't have a desire for
God without God. But every time he'd start to feel that God was
speaking to him, then he wouldn't believe it. And he'd fall back
into the darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   McNichols said that both Dobbels and Arnold contemplated leaving
the Jesuit order because they were gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this huge issue with everybody gay about how you
can't be authentic and be in the church,'' McNichols said. ``Which
is still the way a lot of people feel.''
</P>
<P>
   The two decided to remain Jesuits _ unlike many of their
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next decade, two-thirds of the St. Stans novice classes
of '67 and '68 would drop out _ some to get married, some to pursue
other interests.
</P>
<P>
   BREAKER HED: `There were just too many'
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, seven years after being ordained, the Rev. Bill Dobbels
tested positive for the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   He confided in the Rev. Bill McNichols, who was working at an
AIDS hospice in New York City. Before long, McNichols would receive
similar news from fellow St. Stans novice Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   McNichols was horrified _ and angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of cases where people would get it from a
partner who they had no idea was at risk,'' he said. ``But Bill and
Pat got it way after it was known how you could get it. I couldn't
help but think, `What were you doing? How could you possibly get
AIDS now, when everybody knows what's dangerous?''
</P>
<P>
   McNichols isn't sure they even knew when they contracted the
AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think the bigger thing was why did they take the
chance? They both had so much to offer. If they'd have only been
more responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the fellow St. Stans novice from the Kansas City area _
who had been ordained in the late 1970s _ died of complications
from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Later in 1987, Dobbels learned that his HIV had developed into
full-blown AIDS. He died in December 1990, just three days before
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   McNichols officiated at Dobbels' memorial service. Pat Arnold
attended too, his frail body showing the signs of his battle with
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold had been teaching theology in Berkeley, Calif., until he
became too sick. He finally moved back to Denver, where the Jesuits
helped care for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People took very good care of him,'' said the Rev. Edward
Kinerk, a 1966 St. Stans novice who later was Arnold's provincial
and is now president of Rockhurst University. ``The struggle was to
get Pat out of living by himself in an apartment and back into a
Jesuit community.''
</P>
<P>
   McNichols was working in Albuquerque, N.M., in October 1991 when
Pat Arnold's mother called from Denver.
</P>
<P>
   His 41-year-old friend was near death. McNichols rushed to
Denver to see him. The next morning, Oct. 23, 1991, Arnold's mother
called McNichols at his parents' Denver home to say Arnold had
died.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's when I started shaking,'' said McNichols, who had
seen many friends _ not all of them priests _ die during his AIDS
hospice work. ``People understood that this was a good friend, but
nobody could know this was the 150th death for me. They didn't
understand that there were just too many. I thought I was
unraveling.''
</P>
<P>
   BREAKER HED: An effort to change
</P>
<P>
   St. Stanislaus closed on Aug. 18, 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The Juniorate, or Collegiate Seminary, moved to Fusz Memorial
near St. Louis University, where seminarians could receive a better
program than was possible at St. Stans.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Novitiate, where the novices were trained, was moved to
Rockhurst College to avoid having all the seminary training in the
St. Louis area.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Jesuit officials decided that the expense of
maintaining the huge seminary solely as a retirement home for
Jesuits would be too costly. The seminary was put up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Those who attended St. Stans have fond recollections of their
years there. Yet even those closest to the priests who died of
AIDS-related illnesses express shock at the number of deaths.
</P>
<P>
   One priest who was a novice in 1962 is dead. So are three from
the combined classes of 1967 and 1968, and one from the class of
1968 who quit just shy of ordination.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's quite amazing, isn't it?'' McNichols said as he looked
at old class photos.
</P>
<P>
   Since the deaths, the Jesuits say they have tried harder to help
seminarians face sexual issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jesuits have made a much more concerted effort to educate
our men on sexuality and celibacy and what that means,'' Kinerk
said. ``I think we lived in a climate in the '50s and the '40s in
the church where you just didn't talk about things.''
</P>
<P>
   Because no one closely monitored the deaths _ and others kept
quiet _ it's impossible to know whether St. Stanislaus was the
exception or the norm.
</P>
<P>
   When told of the AIDS deaths at St. Stans, the Rev. Thomas
Gumbleton, auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Detroit and a
vocal proponent of better seminary training on sexual issues, said:
``That seems like a very high percentage. But who knows for sure?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have learned some valuable lessons from those deaths
if anyone had been paying attention. But unfortunately, they
weren't,'' Gumbleton added. ``They didn't want to know.''

 &HT;    Braves sign Bonilla to minor league deal
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Braves signed volatile veteran Bobby Bonilla to a
minor-league contract Friday, just in time to take some of the
spotlight off John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla will be given a chance to make the teamas a backup
outfielder and first baseman for the major-league minimum of
$200,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves and Rocker beat Bonilla's Mets in the National League
Championship Series in October. ``Bobby (Cox) and I feel that
Bonilla adds great depth and strength to our bench and provides us
with another very productive offensive player,'' general manager
John Schuerholz said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz and manager Bobby Cox were not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, released by the Mets after a tumultuous and ineffective
1999, said Friday he is ready to start over with his fifth team in
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves ``explained (my role) to me and I was comfortable
with that,'' said Bonilla, who withagent Dan Horwits met Friday
with Cox, Schuerholz and assistant GM Frank Wren. ``They like my
ability to play third, first, left and right. I could give guys
rest, occasionally spelling Andruw Jones, possibly Chipper Jones.
I'm sure I'll be able to see a significant amount of time coming
off the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season the switch-hitting Bonilla played in a career-low 60
games. He hit .160 with four homers and 18 RBIs. He was on the
disabled list July 4-Sept. 1 with patella tendonitis in his left
knee, after missing much of May with a contusion on his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't understand why I could play hurt, but I wasn't
allowed to play healthy,'' Bonilla said. ``But it's all in the past
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla was released by the Mets on Jan. 4. To work out the $5.9
million he was due this year, the Mets will pay him$1.3 million
annually for 25 years, starting in 2011. ``It's very exciting to
have a chance to work with (new Braves hitting coach) Merv
Rettenmund and have a chance to play for Bobby Cox,'' Bonilla said.
``There were a lot of positives to it. . . . I'm ecstatic to be
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, who turns 37 on Feb. 23, plans to report as early as
pitchers and catchers do, on Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
   And, he says he won't have a problem playing with Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he offended other people as much as he wound up
hurting himself,'' Bonilla said. ``No, I don't see it as a big
issue. Everyone makes mistakes.''

PENTAGON TO DRAFT CELEBRITIES FOR TAPED ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After trying just about every other strategy to
boost recruitment, Secretary of Defense William Cohen has turned to
Julia Roberts and a handful of other celebrities to go on
television, radio and the Internet to ask a new generation to
enlist in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to get to the people of influence,'' Cohen told
reporters Friday, explaining why he had traveled to Hollywood this
month to make personal entreaties to the stars.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Cohen said, he has gotten positive murmurs but no firm
promises from Tom Cruise, Harrison Ford, Robert De Niro, Will Smith
and Sidney Poitier as well as Ms. Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're drawing up the details,'' Cohen said, admitting that
shooting schedules and other commitments could dwindle his list of
celebrity volunteers who will fill the airways and cyberspace with
pitches to join the Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   While the booming economy is good news for most of official
Washington, it has helped undermine the Pentagon's ability to fill
the all-voluntary force. At the same time, more young men and women
are going straight from high school to college, further reducing
the number of potential recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Cohen decided the military had to change its whole
strategy toward recruiting and hired two private consultants to
draw up a strategy. The recommendations were fairly severe. The
military, the consultants said, had to go where the young people
are: on the Internet, at shopping malls, answering e-mail messages
and watching MTV.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do something other than putting an ad on
television once a year on Super Bowl Sunday,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The services are now setting up kiosks in shopping malls and
staffing them with new recruits, not just older veterans. Web sites
have been redesigned for humor as well as cutting-edge graphics.
And senior Pentagon officials, including Cohen, are trying to find
figures of influence who can capture the attention of young people
of enlistment age.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has Spike Lee making recruitment pitches on television.
Gen. James Jones, commandant of the Marines, had the actor James
Brolin to dinner recently to discuss the spots he will make for the
Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   And Cohen is negotiating with Terry Bradshaw and the Fox
television network to broadcast a National Football League pre-game
program aboard an aircraft carrier next fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first asked Terry, he said he'd never been approached
before and he'd be happy to help,'' said Cohen. ``If we get that
program on the carrier, that would reach a vast audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Not since World War II has the military made such a concerted
effort to enlist Hollywood celebrities for recruitment drives, said
Cohen, who originally went in search of veterans among the stars.
Failing that, he is happily settling for actors who played the role
of soldier, sailor or pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Cruise in `Top Gun' did more for recruiting than any
strategy we've ever come up with,'' he said. The movie featured
daring aerial engagements flown by F-14 pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Already some of the services have seen a small improvement in
recruiting. Last quarter, which ended Dec. 31, only the Air Force
failed to meet its target. The Navy met its goal of 9,879 new
sailors and the Army recruited 13,080, surpassing its goal by 500.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon hopes the celebrity spots will be broadcast this
summer.

 &HT;    Farm workers' suit seeks pay from Georgia-Pacific
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A group of seasonal farm workers is suing
Georgia-Pacific Corp., alleging they were underpaid for planting
trees in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific is one of three large timber
companies named in separate lawsuits seeking class-action status in
U.S. District Court in Tallahassee, Fla. The plaintiffs claim
Georgia-Pacific, International Paper and Champion International
violated federal law by not paying them the prevailing wage and
overtime pay for planting trees and clearing brush.
</P>
<P>
   James Knoepp, an attorney representing the workers through the
Migrant Farmworker Justice Project, said the workers were mostly
recruited in Mexico. They work in the United States under a federal
program that allows employers to contract foreign labor when they
can't find American labor, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Knoepp said companies are required to pay the laborers what
local workers in the area would make to do the same job to ensure
that locals don't lose jobs or wages to cheaper foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific and Purchase, N.Y.-based International Paper own
extensive timberlands in Georgia and elsewhere in the Southeast.
Stamford, Conn.-based Champion's Southern land mostly is in
Alabama, western Florida and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Company representatives declined to comment because they said
they had not seen the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We adhere to any and all laws that pertain to labor
practices,'' said Georgia-Pacific's Greg Guest, who added that the
company doesn't comment on any pending litigation.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 6,000 workers could join the suit, Knoepp said. They
could seek several million dollars in back pay, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits could be the first such cases filed against forest
companies, Knoepp said. Typically, advocacy groups sue migrant
contractors who hire the workers on behalf of the companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't solve the problem because the contractors go
out of business, change names and pop up somewhere else,'' Knoepp
said. ``If we can make a case against the timber companies, we can
change the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Knoepp's group filed a similar class-action suit
against Dole Citrus Inc., alleging it paid migrant citrus pickers
less than minimum wage.

 &HT;    Just for feet plans liquidation of stores
 &HT;    By Renee DeGross
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This time last year Just For Feet had hoped its Super
Bowl ad would boost sales at its athletic apparel and shoe stores.
Instead, it seemed to be the beginning of the end.
</P>
<P>
   Just For Feet announced this week that it plans to liquidate all
of its stores.
</P>
<P>
   The Birmingham, Ala.-based chain originally filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection on Nov. 4, and had hoped to find a buyer. But
that hasn't happened.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Just For Feet intends to sell all or part of its assets in
a court-approved auction by mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Super Bowl ad last January showed white hunters
drugging a Kenyan runner and giving him shoes.
</P>
<P>
   It was attacked as racist by advertising critics and viewers.
Just For Feet pulled the ad created by Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi after
about a week.
</P>
<P>
   To help turn around slumping sales, Just For Feet last March
hired Helen Rockey, a former Nike executive, as president and chief
operating officer. She was quickly promoted to chief executive
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Like most retailers selling athletic clothing and footwear, Just
For Feet watched its sales slump as consumer tastes changed.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the 12-year-old company closed 85 Just For
Feet stores, leaving the chain with 151 superstores, 88 specialty
stores, and 39 franchised specialty stores.
</P>
<P>
   The company is attempting to secure funding from its
debtor-in-possession lenders to continue its operations while
liquidating. CEO Rockey could not be reached for comment.

   VITINA, Yugoslavia _ U.S. soldiers fanned out among ethnic
Albanians shopping on market day Friday, shaking hands, smiling and
trying to blunt a deluge of complaints that has forced U.S. Army
officials to investigate soldiers' behavior, including charges of
rape and murder.
</P>
<P>
   It is on the crowded streets of this town of 5,000, plagued by
violence since NATO troops arrived last June, that Albanians say
U.S. soldiers routinely hit and push people for no apparent reason
as they walk by.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints are a serious embarrassment for the U.S. Army and
come just weeks after the rape and murder of an 11-year-old
Albanian girl here, for which a weapons squad leader, Staff Sgt.
Frank Ronghi, has been charged, And the ongoing complaints reflect
the troublesome job that U.S. troops face in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In this soulless town of ugly government buildings and small
shops, U.S. troops patrol in full combat gear, with helmets, flak
jackets and assault rifles. They drive through town in their
armored vehicles, a soldier manning the machine gun on the top.
Locals say this powerful image of the military carries over into
the soldiers' attitudes when they search and arrest people.
</P>
<P>
   An onion seller recounted some of the beatings three weeks ago.
``There was a group of three soldiers, two black and one white.
They were hitting people walking past with their hands if they
spoke or reacted in any way. They were hitting cars, they even hit
animals. People were scared to walk through this way,'' said
Ramadan Aziz, 42. ``Even the Serbs did not do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the surrounding area in south-eastern Kosovo, Vitina
is described as the ``hot spot'' of the region by international
police and administrators. It has suffered an almost constant run
of grenade attacks, explosions and ethnic violence since the NATO
troops arrived.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. commanders had expected one of the lightest task forces in
Kosovo when assigned the eastern sector bordering Macedonia and
southern Serbia because it had suffered the least during the war
and had escaped with relatively little destruction.
</P>
<P>
   But the area has proved the most explosive because of its ethnic
mix and the large number of Serbs still in the area. Unlike other
towns of Kosovo, the place still seems to be on a war footing.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints against U.S. soldiers three weeks ago led to a
preliminary investigation that found that several soldiers may have
been involved in misconduct. The soldiers in question have been
moved and assigned to other duties while the investigation
continues, a U.S. Army spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Daut Xhemajli, president of the Municipal Council
in Vitina, these incidents were just part of a catalog of problems
that has pushed townspeople to their limits of patience. The
tension began with the murder of the girl, which was a huge shock,
and increased. Finally, when several local men were arrested by
U.S. soldiers recently, crowds of some 500 people protested for two
days.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing violence in Vitina appears to be at the root of
the overall problem. Col. Ellis Golson, chief of staff of the U.S.
force in Kosovo, said his troops still have a strong sense of
mission and a good understanding of what is expected of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morale is still good, it always has been,'' he said in an
interview this week. ``Their main concerns are still accomplishing
the mission,'' he said of the soldiers in Vitina. ``We continually
reinforce we are here to treat everyone with dignity and respect.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But while commanders are emphasizing the importance of their
troops working on community relations, the U.N. police station
commander in Vitina says what is needed is more police.
</P>
<P>
   Ventsislav Bogdanov has only 15 police and four vehicles to
police the 60 villages and towns in the region. His men are
restricted to investigating and accompanying troops on patrols,
while the peacekeeping troops are still responsible for law and
order, and the arrests and house searches that that involves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military police are professional guys. But the infantry
soldiers are not trained to search houses,'' said Bogdanov.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the complaints lodged by the Albanians, who now make up
the majority of the population in Vitina, they do not want the
Americans to leave. Even the Serbs admit they are doing a fair job.
Asked if they would rather have peacekeeping troops of another
nationality, the answer is invariably ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With thousands of troops it would be absurd not to have
something happen,'' said an Albanian builder, Zenel Bibaj. ``And
they may shout, but they never shoot.''

 &HT;    Shaky ground for Tech's Cremins
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Once again, Bobby Cremins and the Georgia Tech
basketball program face an uncertain future, with the beleaguered
coach determined to turn things around, or else.
</P>
<P>
   This is no the first time. Seven years ago, Cremins resigned to
become coach at South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-week courtship, Cremins left Atlanta for alma mater,
even though Tech had offered a 10-year contract and promised
lifetime job at the school until his pension kicked in.
</P>
<P>
   But in the course of one day, Cremins turned down South
Carolina, then changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never looking back,'' Cremins said at a news conference in
Columbia. ``Somebody once said it's better to love and lose than
never love at all. . . . I do things instinctively, whether right
or wrong. I made a final instinctive decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, he reversed course again, saying leaving Tech
had been a mistake. Athletic director Homer Rice welcomed Cremins
back to the ``family,'' saying it was the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Cremins had taken the Yellow Jackets to six
straight NCAA Tournaments. They've made it just once since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Rice was very loyal, and a great guy,'' Tech alumnus Bob
Espy says, ``and personally, I can understand where he was coming
from. But from a basketball perspective, that was a terrible
decision to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, rivals have used Cremins' vacillation against Tech
in recruiting, He has signed just two consensus prep All-Americans
since then. Stephon Marbury, who played in `96 and left for the
NBA, and Dion Glover, who left after two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons Cremins gave for considering the South
Carolina job was that he was disappointed his `93 team was booed at
home. Now, the boo birds have returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's typical of fans,'' says forward Jon Babul, ``they
forget the past. I feel bad for (Cremins) because he busts his butt
for us. It's time for us players to be accountable, not Coach.''
</P>
<P>
   been through some ups and downs in this program the last couple
of years,'' Cremins, 52, said. ``We're close, but we have not found
ourselves totally. That's what I want. That's what I'm aiming for.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been frustrating for me, but I'm going to stay with it
and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   A noble stance, but many Tech fans find it disheartening. One
alumnus has been circulating a petition, via the Internet, urging
athletics director Dave Braine to pull the plug.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stated it very plainly before, and I will say it again:
Bobby will make that decision,'' Braine said. ``For anybody to say
Bobby is gone and we're talking to other coaches is so far removed
from reality _ you don't treat people that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have good people, who have good character and are
loyal to their school and their program, you better be fair,''
Braine said.
</P>
<P>
   Braine said thata lot of the unrest comes from fair-weather fans
who do not support the program completely, either financially or in
spirit. ``Ninety-nine percent of them don't buy season tickets and
don't contribute (money),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are concerned with one thing and only one thing _
(getting to) the NCAA Tournament,'' Braine says. ``I also have to
take into consideration 18 years of excellent service. If we had
made a couple of shots, we wouldn't be having this conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   True, the Yellow Jackets could have taken care of matters by
pulling out close losses to Stanford, Michigan. They also made a
decent showings against Kentucky in Louisville and, for a while, at
Duke.
</P>
<P>
   But they lost all of those games, and some people blame Cremins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby was absolutely the right person at the right time when
Tech basketball was pitiful,'' said Bob Espy, Tech class of `73 and
longtime season-ticket holder and athletic donor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the game has changed, and his coaching style doesn't
work,'' Espy said. ``He basically has no game-day coaching ability,
and his kids are confused on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Espy emphasized that he is not waging a personal crusade against
Cremins and said it is a reflection of growing concern for the
program. His position is widespread, he said, and was boosted by a
poor home showing by Tech on Thursday in a 60-46 loss to Wake
Forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby is a great guy and was wonderful for the school when he
got there,'' Espy says. ``I'm not a fair-weather fan. I'm a person
legitimately concerned with the program, and I'm not by myself.
People contribute too much money to have that kind of
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a strong cadre of Cremins supporters remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was here when basketball wasn't even a factor, and Bobby
brought credibility,'' says Bud Parker, a retired businessman and
class of `58. ``But sports today are totally different, just like
business. It's what have you done for me lately _ look at Coke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different world, and kids don't stay until they're
seniors. But if anybody can make it work, it's Bobby. I'm not
saying that just because I love him, which I do; he's just a class
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Class, though, does not always make the cash register ring.
</P>
<P>
   Braine acknowledged that many loyal season-ticket holders don't
turn out for every game. He is especially concerned that Tech
students _ who once helped transform Alexander Memorial Coliseum
into the ``ThrillerDome'' _ stay away in droves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most students underestimate how good the team is,'' said John
Rafferty, a junior from Ft, Myers, Fla. ``Part of it, too, is
they're not used to having a good team. But you saw in football
that, once the team started winning, students filled up the
stands.''
</P>
<P>
   Students aren't the only ones staying away. When Tech plays
North Carolina today, it expects the first hard sellout at the
10,000-seat arena in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning will take care of that,'' Braine said. ``People are
panicking. They are jumping to conclusions (about Cremins' future),
and it's unfair to the kids.''

 &HT;    McCain campaign hoping 4-state strategy will chip away at Bush
lead
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Everything could go wrong for George W. Bush over
the next few weeks and he still would have primaries in Texas and
Florida to help right his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   These states, which have the second- and fourth-largest
delegations to the Republican National Convention, are governed by
a pair of men named Bush, the candidate and brother Jeb. Their
constituents almost certainly will provide Bush a wealth of
delegates to the Republican National Convention in the March 14
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   And what does John McCain have to fall back on should he
stumble? His seat in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Before McCain can get to the point of contemplating winning the
nomination, he must win in New Hampshire on Tuesday. Then, he must
do very well, if not win, South Carolina on Feb. 19. Three days
later, he must win Arizona, his home state, and make a respectable
showing in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   None of these outcomes is assured, although McCain leads in most
polls in New Hampshire and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain's initial four-state strategy is successful, his
advisers are confident Bush's national campaign will unravel. They
frequently and mockingly cite Bush's campaign office in Guam as an
example of organizational overkill.
</P>
<P>
   Bush strategist Karl Rove has flatly stated that McCain's
four-state approach is fatally flawed. He maintains that a
presidential candidate can be successful only by building a broad
base of support nationally.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, McCain faces a tough road through the nation's
largest states.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, McCain may not be on the March 7 ballot in large
portions of the state because of Bush-backed challenges to his
qualifying petitions. McCain has sued in federal court to get on
the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   In California, by far the biggest prize, McCain's forces are
putting together a volunteer network and are considering an
advertising strategy that would put the candidate on cable
television in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and on over-the-air
stations in smaller inland markets that are rich with GOP voters,
said Frank Riggs, the former California congressman who is backing
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of work ahead of us,'' McCain told California
volunteers by telephone last week following the Republican debate
in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will raise money in the state and speak at the California
Republican convention the first weekend of February. His state
headquarters are in San Diego to stress his Navy career and to
reach out to the many veterans who live there.
</P>
<P>
   His support for campaign finance reform and Bush's record $70
million in campaign donations may work to McCain's advantage in
California, where voters have punished big money candidates before,
said Jack Pitney, a political science professor at Claremont
McKenna College outside Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's appeal to independents and Democrats is all for
naught in California. They can vote in the state's open primary
March 7, but only the votes of registered Republicans count toward
awarding delegates. And California is a winner-take-all primary for
the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Pitney said it is hard to envision McCain winning the nomination
without winning California's delegates.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain were to win the overall popular vote, but lose among
Republicans, he ``could claim a moral victory as he puts on his
Bush button,'' Pitney said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's hopes rest, in part, on his agenda of reform and
compelling personal story. But the campaign also proceeds on the
belief that Bush's support is ``a mile wide, but only an inch
deep,'' said Ken Khachigian, a veteran California political
operative and McCain adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Early victories, in their view, will strip away Bush's halo of
inevitability and help to negate his huge advantage in campaign
money and organization. No one in McCain's campaign disputes that
he trails Bush by wide margins in most states. A new California
poll gives Bush a 33-point lead over McCain, 49 percent to 16
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But they point out that McCain has cut Bush's lead in every
state in which he's campaigned. ``The trend is positive
everywhere,'' campaign manager Rick Davis said. ``Everywhere people
get a look at both of them, McCain's numbers go up and Bush's go
down.''
</P>
<P>
   And Khachigian reflected the widespread belief of McCain aides
that those poll numbers would change even more dramatically if Bush
were to lose a number of primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phenomenon most people don't understand is that Bush is a
candidate with 60 percent in the polls, monster money and high name
ID,'' he said. ``So Mr. 60 Percent got 41 percent in Iowa. He'll
get 34, 35, maybe 36 percent in New Hampshire. That's going to be a
slight wake up call to the public. The alarm is buzzing very
lightly. `Wait a minute, we thought he was at 60 percent.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio voters, who go to the polls March 7, may be among those who
would begin to take notice, said Eric Rademacher, co-director of
the University of Cincinnati's Ohio Poll.
</P>
<P>
   Bush held a whopping 45-point lead over McCain in the most
recent Ohio Poll, 64 percent to 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the survey also turned up ``a wait-and-see attitude'' among
many voters that a string of McCain victories could affect,
Rademacher said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Mike DeWine, a McCain supporter, said he would
advise the campaign not to make any decisions about television
advertising until March 7 nears. ``The average voter is not focused
yet and the reality is that by time that happens, this will be a
national campaign,'' DeWine said.
</P>
<P>
   Also on March 7, McCain could make a strong showing in New
England, his aides said. In Massachusetts, in particular, McCain
already has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on Boston
television because it reaches into southern New Hampshire.

 &HT;    EDs: Corrects spelling of Carlton Fisk in PASSED BALL ON
ENDORSEMENT brief
 &HT;    
 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Fess up, Al _ are you sure?
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several times this week, Al Gore insisted that he has always
supported both a woman's right to choose an abortion and Roe v.
Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that ensured that right. The
Bill Bradley campaign asserts that Gore is misstating the facts.
The Boston Globe did some research that backs up the Bradley camp.
The paper found that in the House in 1977, Gore voted for an
amendment stating that abortion ``takes the life of an unborn child
who is a living human being,'' and that no right to abortion ``is
secured by the Constitution.'' And in 1984, Gore supported an
amendment that would have redefined the term ``person'' to include
``unborn children from the moment of conception.'' The paper also
found memos to Gore in late 1987 and early 1988 _ from his press
secretary and his communications director _warning Gore that he had
developed a record for stretching the truth.
</P>
<P>
   TRICKY AL?
</P>
<P>
   Stepping up his assault on Al Gore's honesty, Bill Bradley said
today the vice president speaks in a ``tricky'' way that misleads.
``When you listen to Al Gore speak, you have to listen very
carefully, you have to look at every word and every clause,''
Bradley said. ``Words can be used in a tricky manner.''
</P>
<P>
   C-SPAN'S GOT IT ALL, ALL THE TIME
</P>
<P>
   C-SPAN will provide live, comprehensive coverage of the New
Hampshire primary, the nation's first, both Monday and Tuesday. The
cable channel will be on the air for two hours beginning 11 p.m.
Monday to report the traditional first voting from Dixville Notch
and Hart's Location. On Tuesday, C-SPAN will televise from 7 p.m.
until midnight. But you don't have to wait that long: C-SPAN will
provide 50 consecutive hours of live New Hampshire coverage,
beginning at 8 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   THE UNKINDEST CUT OF ALL
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush said today that President Clinton's State of the
Union address shows that the president and John McCain ``agree on
the size of the tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not significant enough,'' Bush said of the $350 billion,
10-year tax cut proposed by Clinton. McCain has proposed a $237
billion, five-year reduction. Bush has proposed greater tax cuts _
$483 billion over five years _ but McCain says more money should be
used for reducing the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S GORE IN THE STRETCH, GOING AWAY
</P>
<P>
   New poll numbers have Al Gore pulling ahead of Bill Bradley in
New Hampshire. The Dartmouth College-Associated Press poll shows
Gore leading, 54 percent to 40 percent. It also shows Republicans
John McCain and George W. Bush in a virtual tie.
</P>
<P>
   IN BASKETBALL, THAT WOULD BE CALLED A TURNOVER
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, a Rhodes scholar, scored a 485 on his verbal SAT,
lower than the 566 earned on the same test by George W. Bush, a
graduate of both Yale and Harvard who has had to defend his
intellect. ``He's acknowledged that he was an affirmative action
case for getting into Princeton,'' said Bradley spokesman Eric
Hauser. But, ``There are few people. ... who would doubt his
intellectual capacity.'' Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said he
could not confirm the 566 score originally reported by New Yorker
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   PASSED BALL ON ENDORSEMENT
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, a former Texas Rangers part-owner, has picked up
another big league endorsement. Carlton Fisk, a Hall of Fame
catcher for the Red Sox and White Sox, said he's supporting Bush's
candidacy, but slipped in referring to him. He said ``Senator
George Bush.'' Bush replied that he'll ``accept the demotion.''
</P>
<P>
   PRAISING THE HOME STATE HEROS
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the New Hampshire Legislature, Alan Keyes, the only
black presidential candidate, paid homage to Daniel Webster, the
19th-century abolitionist senator and New Hampshire native. ``If
Webster had not spoken,'' Keyes said, ``Lincoln would not have
succeeded. The heritage here in New Hampshire is awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   YA GOTTA HAVE HEART _ BUT BRAINS, TOO
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer insisted that he won't follow Orrin Hatch's lead out
of the race, but the now-last place GOP candidate did acknowledge
that he's not detached from reality. Asked by ABC News if there
would be a point at which he could concede that the plan isn't
working, Bauer said, ``Well, I mean look, I'm not an idiot. You
don't have to hit me over the head with a 2-by-4 over and over
again. But I still think my message is the best message in the
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   FAR AND AWAY _ BY FAR
</P>
<P>
   As of today, John McCain has far and away spent more time in New
Hampshire than any other presidential candidate. He's been in the
Granite State 61 days; the second-place squatter is Bill Bradley,
at 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE'S THE `LIBERAL NEWS MEDIA' WHEN BUSH NEEDS IT?
</P>
<P>
   The Manchester Union Leader, New Hampshire's biggest and most
influential newspaper, dubbed George W. Bush ``Gov. Smirk,''
derided him for ``his smug attitude,'' and endorsed Steve Forbes
four days before the primary. The front-page editorial called Bush
``an empty suit'' and said it had become clear why Bush's
``handlers'' had kept his pre-primary appearances in New Hampshire
``to a minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   DON'T BLAME `PORK'
</P>
<P>
   During one of the early debates, George W. Bush inadvertently
offended a hog farmer. John McNutt, president of the National Pork
Producers Council, didn't appreciate Bush's remark about government
waste: ``To get rid of pork, quit feeding the hog.'' In a letter to
Bush last week, McNutt said the ``verbal quip,'' while intended to
refer to pork as waste, ``besmirches a wonderful, nutritious health
food.'' McNutt would like politicians to find another way to say it
_ like waste, or excess, or unnecessary spending.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S RIGHT OVER THERE, BY THE CIA BUILDING
</P>
<P>
   The sign off the Garden State Parkway announces that West
Orange, N.J., is home to Bill Bradley's national presidential
campaign headquarters. But just try finding it. The Bradley office
is well camouflaged. There is no sign in front of the
brown-shingled, two-story commercial building at 395 Pleasant
Valley Way. But look for a free-standing basketball hoop around
back; that's the first clue.
</P>
<P>
   ON AGAIN, OFF AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   A New York state judge threw John McCain out of the GOP primary
in eight of New York's congressional districts, just one day after
two Democratic election officials helped him stay there. Most state
GOP officials are supporting George W. Bush. In the challenged
districts, McCain did not have the required number of petition
signatures, but his campaign argued that the signature requirement
shouldn't apply to him since he is a valid presidential candidate.
Judge Joseph Cannizzaro called the signature requirements
``reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORKER IN, JERSEY GUY OUT
</P>
<P>
   The squabbling continues in another example of New York's arcane
presidential primary ballot laws. Donald Trump, who's not an
announced candidate, won the right to compete for Independence
Party backing _ New York's version of the Reform Party _ and Steve
Forbes lost his spot on the Republican ballot in three Long Island
congressional districts. Forbes is trying to retaliate by going to
court and having George W. Bush removed from the GOP ballot in six
New York City districts.
</P>
<P>
   A LITTLE TIGHTER HEAD TO HEAD
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has closed the gap against George W. Bush in a potential
presidential matchup, says a new NBC-Wall Street Journal poll. The
poll showed Bush at 47 percent, Gore at 44 percent. With a 3
percentage point margin of error, that puts them in a statistical
dead heat. In December, Bush led 50 percent to 39 percent. When
Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan was included in the mix, Gore
and Bush both were at 43 percent, with Buchanan at 5 percent. In
December, Bush led 50 percent to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   TIME TO SEND OUT THE TROOPS
</P>
<P>
   With four days to go until the New Hampshire primary, it all
comes down to field work. That's the unglamorous job of calling
voters, knocking on doors, dropping off campaign literature, and
getting people to the polls, even in the bitter cold and snow. ``It
could make a 2 to 5 percent swing in the final total,'' said Steve
Duprey, surveying polls showing races too close to call in both
parties' primaries.
</P>
<P>
   A CAMPAIGN COMING-OUT
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is boasting of having more openly gay potential
convention delegates in New York than Bill Bradley. The Gore camp
said that while its slate of delegates for the state's March 7
presidential primary includes 11 openly gay candidates, Bradley's
delegation had just five openly gay people. The Gore side later
ended up wearing some egg when state party officials said Bradley's
campaign reported having seven openly gay prospective delegates _
not five as Gore had claimed. See, the Bradley camp pounced, ``The
Al Gore campaign continues to distort the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   THE MORE THE MERRIER
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire secretary of state, William Gardner, estimated
that 191,000 Republican ballots and 160,000 Democratic ballots will
be cast next week, more votes than in any previous New Hampshire
primary. He based his figures on absentee ballots, conversations
with town clerks and a bit of guesswork. ``Usually when the economy
is good, people don't vote,'' he said, but added that the closeness
of the races in both parties is likely to counter that truism.
</P>
<P>
   LOCAL DECISIONS _ THAT'S FAMILY FOR YOU
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole told students and teachers at an elementary
school in Grand Rapids, Mich., that George W. Bush has the
character and experience to help Michigan families. ``You look at
his family and how devoted he is,'' she said of Bush, citing his
promises to cut taxes and improve education by allowing more
decisions to be made at the local level. ``He's going to be
thinking of every way he can help families.''
</P>
<P>
   BATTLE OVER BATTLE FLAG
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan says no one should be offended to see the
Confederate battle flag flying over a public building. ``This flag
flew over the battlefields; it never flew over the slave fields,''
Buchanan said this week on a fund-raising swing through Alabama. He
said one of his great-grandfathers died at Vicksburg, Miss.,
fighting for the Confederacy, and another was captured outside
Atlanta. The Confederate battle flag was removed from the Alabama
Capitol dome in Montgomery in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   HOPING TO TIP(PER) THE SCALES
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore, Al's wife, will begin her final swing through New
Hampshire on Saturday. She plans to attend a series of events with
activists and undecided voters.

TV VIEWERS GIVE CLINTON THEIR FINAL ANSWER
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Television ratings taught two important lessons on Thursday
night. The first is that Regis Philbin may not have given the
president $1 million, but he certainly gave him some ratings help
on the State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
   The second is that almost twice as many Americans would prefer
to watch Philbin's trivia quiz show than they would watch the
president of the United States deliver his final scheduled address.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's popular game show ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire'' was
broadcast immediately before the president's address, and its
ratings significantly buoyed Bill Clinton's ratings. At 8:30 p.m.,
``Millionaire'' earned a rating of 18.6 _ meaning that about 19
million households were tuned in _ and a share of 27. (The share
figure indicates that 27 percent of all American viewers watching
television at that time were watching ``Millionaire.'')
</P>
<P>
   It made sense that those viewers who chose to watch the State of
the Union stayed tuned to ABC. The first half hour of the
presidential address on ABC earned a rating of 10 _ about 10
million households, or about half of those had tuned in to
``Millionaire'' _ and a share of 15, or 15 percent of American
viewers watching television.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, ratings for the first hour of the State of the
Union on CBS were far lower, with a rating of 4.3 and a share of 6.
But that made sense, because CBS' ``Diagnosis Murder,'' a rerun
that preceded the State of the Union address earned far less than
``Millionaire'' (with a 6 rating and a share of 9). NBC also ran a
repeat _ of ``Frasier'' _ that received a rating of 9 and a share
of 13; NBC's State of the Union Address, in the first hour, got a
7.3 rating and a share of 11.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox network preceded the State of the Union address with the
celebrity show ``Road to Fame,'' and its relatively low rating _
3.6 and a share of 5 _ meant that the first half-hour of the State
of the Union address received only a 2.1 rating and a share of 3.
</P>
<P>
   In the ratings race at the cable networks, CNN fared best
through the entire broadcast with close to 1.1 million households
watching. Fox News had 250,000 households and MSNBC, 194,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even those hardy viewers who chose to watch the address tended
not to stick with it throughout. At ABC, the rating of 10 dropped
to 8.2 halfway into the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   The combined Nielsen numbers for ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, the Fox
News network and CNN indicate that 48 percent of the television
sets tuned to the president 1999's State of the Union address. This
year, that dropped to 41.4 percent.

 &HT;    Tagliabue annonces Walter Payton Award
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They used to label the commissioner's comments on the Friday
before the Super Bowl as the ``State of the NFL address.''
</P>
<P>
   But every year, so little came of it, the league dropped the
unofficial terminology.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, at the downtown Hyatt, however, Paul Tagliabue was a man
of great vision. Or maybe he's just the only person in Atlanta who
hasn't been inflamed by paranoia in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
   He announced that the National Football League, unlike virtually
every school system, social club and organized group in north
Georgia, is not canceling its upcoming event in fear of foul
weather that as of early Friday evening had not come.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's Super Bowl XXXIV, between the Titans and Rams, is on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't predict the weather,'' said Tagliabue, speaking for
the NFL and not forecasters who began calling on Wednesday for up
to eight inches of snow yesterday. ``We have to be a little bit
like the postal service, whether it's rain or snow, we play
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, Tagliabue was his usual self, taking a middle
road on some questions that might have caused more problems for a
man less deft of tongue.
</P>
<P>
   _His best news was that the NFL's, ``Man of the Year,'' Award
would be re-named the, ``Walter Payton Award,'' in honor of late
Bears running back Walter Payton, the league's all-time leading
rusher, and a great man. Vikings wide receiver Cris Carter, who is
active with several organizations, is the 1999 winner of the award.
</P>
<P>
   _Tagliabue was asked if the NFL might institute a program to
counsel bad seeds like former Panthers wide receiver Rae Carruth,
charged with murder, and Dolphins running back Cecil Collins, in
trouble after breaking and entering a neighbor's apartment. The
commissioner said, ``You know, it is partly a product of society.''
The short answer: No. Problems like these are left to local law
enforcement, and individual teams.
</P>
<P>
   _Does the fact that teams that moved from Los Angeles and
Houston to St. Louis and Nashville are in the Super Bowl mean the
league will frown less on relocation of franchises? ``It is not
going to affect our policy, which is to discourage teams from
moving,'' Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   _He said the NFL is studying the possibility of flexible
scheduling of nationally-televised games late in the season so
lousy teams wouldn't end up on, say, ABC's Monday Night Football.
There have been discussions with networks, but, ``It is not better
than 50/50 that we would implement it this year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _The NFL is virtually certain, once Houston joins the league in
2001, to move to eight, four-team divisions, and wildcard teams _
like the Titans _ will still have a chance to make the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   _The commissioner disagreed with the suggestion by an
African-American journalist that the new practice of a coach
tabbing his successor _ like Jimmy Johnson-Dave Wannstedt, Bill
Parcells-Bill Belichek, Dick Vermeil-Mike Martz _ would further
preclude minorities from consideration for head coaching jobs.
</P>
<P>
   _Tagliabue also said there has been no effort made by the NFL to
influence Canadian Football, advise the Arena League on its labor
problems, and that the chances of a Super Bowl one day being in
Orlando, a non-NFL city, are next to nil.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing goes for NFL cities north of Atlanta that don't
have a domed stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue also bragged that the league's salary cap system does
a better job than other sports of giving teams in markets of every
size a fair shot at the postseason, and the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville and St. Louis aren't arguing.

&HT;     BRADLEY ACCUSES GORE OF `TRICKY' WORDS TO DECEIVE VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, N.H. _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley accused Vice President
Al Gore on Friday of the ``tricky'' use of words to create the
``illusion'' that he favors the registration of all hand guns,
creation of universal health care coverage and the protection of
abortion rights _ the cornerstones of Bradley's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley underscored his determination to wrest the Democratic
presidential nomination from the vice president, vowing additional
attacks on Gore before Tuesday's presidential primary in New
Hampshire. And he touted his campaign resources of almost $20
million and unveiled a far-flung travel schedule that includes New
York and Florida following the primary here.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley emphasized his courtship of New Hampshire's largest bloc
of voters _ the 37 percent of the electorate who are independents _
by showcasing the endorsement of Lowell Weicker, the former
three-term Republican senator and member of the Watergate committee
who bolted the Republican Party to run as an independent and win a
term as governor of Connecticut in 1990. Weicker has been mentioned
as a possible presidential candidate for the Ross Perot-backed
Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Weicker urged New Hampshire's independents to resist voting for
Republican maverick John McCain. The populist, reform-minded
Arizona senator leads Texas Gov. George Bush here in the latest
opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only independent thinker and actor here is Bill Bradley,''
Weicker told a rally in this remote community in western New
Hampshire. ``I make a special plea to my independent friends _
don't waste your vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley later told reporters that he and McCain are at odds on
gun control, health care coverage and abortion rights, even though
they share a commitment to overhauling the nation's campaign
finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question, Bradley also acknowledged for the
first time that he had suffered another episode of irregular
heartbeat. Bradley said the episode lasted for ``about two hours''
three or four days ago. That would mean the incident occurred
either on Monday, the eve of the Iowa precinct caucuses, or on
Tuesday when he flew into New Hampshire before dawn to begin his
final push. Bradley lost the vote in the Iowa caucuses to Gore by a
2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance before several hundred people in Newport,
Bradley escalated the allegations against Gore that he began during
Wednesday evening's televised debate.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said voters should listen extremely closely to Gore or
else they may be misled into believing that the vice president
favors the comprehensive hand gun registration, universal health
care coverage and abortion rights that Bradley supports.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a citizen, you have to listen very careful to a
practitioner of the old politics _ very carefully,'' Bradley
warned. ``Because a practitioner of the old politics wants you to
believe one thing and says one thing when the reality is quite
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said that Gore implies support for licensing and
registration of all handguns when his proposal merely deals with
``new hand guns.'' Bradley accused Gore of expressing support for
universal health care coverage when his budget blueprint provides
no money to achieve it. And Bradley said that Gore cites support
for the constitutional right of a woman to choose an abortion, when
Gore had an 84 percent anti-abortion voting record early in his
career in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley declined a chance to accuse Gore of ``lying'' in
response to a reporter's question. But he added: ``You don't want
to use the word truth, use bait and switch.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley made the same point more strongly in earlier remarks to
about 100 people gathered in a senior citizens community center in
Lebanon, north of Newport.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you listen to Al Gore speak, you have to listen very
carefully because the old politics uses words in a very tricky
manner,'' Bradley said. ``You have to look at every word and every
clause.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said Gore had been using words ``in a tricky manner ...
so the illusion is created that he is there fighting for universal
health coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's use of the word ``tricky'' appeared designed to draw
implicit parallels with the nefarious campaign practices of
President Richard Nixon, forced to resign in 1974 in the fallout of
the Watergate scandal. Nixon's nickname among critics was ``Tricky
Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   William Ludlow, 75, of West Lebanon, N.H., said when he heard
Bradley use the word ``tricky'' several times during his
presentation at the senior citizens' community center, he
immediately thought of Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking like that doesn't show much faith in the other
Democrat in the race,'' said Ludlow, a Gore supporter. ``They're in
the same party; I don't think he should be talking like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates once served together in the Senate, Gore from
Tennessee and Bradley from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, in subsequent remarks to reporters in Newport, denied
that he was accusing Gore of using tactics such as those used by
Nixon. Bradley said that it was ``actually a joke'' when he drew
such parallels during Wednesday night's televised debate. The
remark during the debate ``made the point, which just happened to
mention Nixon but it could have been anybody,'' Bradley insisted.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year Senate veteran said that he was merely ``clarifying
the record'' so voters would not go into polling booths on Tuesday
``believing the misstatements and mischaracteriztions of my
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, asked about Bradley's latest charges, replied in
Portsmouth: ``I'm going to emphasize the positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore underscored his pro-choice credentials by releasing an
endorsement from New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, who cited the
vice president's ``strong leadership'' abortion rights, and a
letter from members of Congress who defended his position on the
divisive issue.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hauser, a Bradley spokesman, said the campaign has almost
$20 million available for the next five weeks of the presidential
campaign _ plenty to wage a Democratic primary challenge to Gore
into March, no matter what the outcome of Tuesday's primary.

   BRADLEY-NH (Newport, N.H.) _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley garners
the endorsement of legendary independent Lowell P. Weicker, the
former governor of Connecticut, and accuses Vice President Al Gore
of ``tricky'' campaign tactics to create the ``allusion'' of
support for handgun registration, universal health coverage and
abortion rights. Bradley makes a direct appeal to New Hampshire's

former New Hampshire governor and White House chief in the Bush

it in 1973 have become to Republicans. In their debate the other
evening, the five Republican presidential hopefuls discussed issues
that one would require the attention of the leader of the world's
most powerful nation: taxes, trade, national defense, health care,
education, immigration, campaign finance reform and how to allocate
the budget surplus. But no issue generated more heat or triggered
more passionate declarations than abortion. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON.

RARE SNOWSTORM BLANKETS HOLY LAND 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Palm trees were weighted with snow Friday and the
golden Dome of the Rock, Islam's third-holiest site, shimmered
white when a rare snowstorm visited the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   The storm, the heaviest in half a century, dumped up to 3 feet
of snow across parts of the Mideast from Cyprus to Egypt to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem usually experiences an annual dusting of snow that
melts within hours. But Friday, more than a foot accumulated.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual weather caused shops to close throughout Jerusalem
and brought scores of young Palestinians and Israelis into the
streets to throw snowballs and build snowmen.
</P>
<P>
   Many, unprepared for such weather, wrapped their feet with
plastic garbage bags before slipping them into sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say we need a pair of boots like that,'' said a
black-clad, ultra-Orthodox Jew with plastic sticking out of his
shoes, as he pointed to a foreigner wearing ski boots.
</P>
<P>
   The storm began its sweep across Israel and the Palestinian
territories Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Power outages were widespread.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank, 3 feet of snow covered Hebron, which is under
Palestinian control. Beersheva, a town in the Negev Desert in the
south of Israel, got its heaviest snow cover in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 Bedouin families in the West Bank were cut off
from food supplies, and some of their sheep died, said Sheikh
Khalil Abu Ghalia of the Bedouin Charitable Society.
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon, people used chains to get vehicles up snow-capped
mountains, and some schools were closed.
</P>
<P>
   With motorists stranded and many power lines cut, Civil Defense
officials in Jordan warned people to stay home. Religious Ministry
official Hamdi Murad asked Muslims to forgo visiting the mosque for
Friday prayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``God will forgive you if you don't make it to prayers today,''
Murad told Jordan radio, ``because God told Muslims not to imperil
their lives in situations that do not ensure public safety.''
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, six people died, including a Palestinian man in
Jerusalem whose roof collapsed under the weight of snow. Two
homeless men died from exposure, two motorists were killed in
accidents on slippery roads, and one man perished in a fire caused
by a kerosene heater.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan, two gravely ill people died at home, because
ambulances were unable to drive them to hospitals. A third man died
of a broken neck after slipping on the steps to his home.
</P>
<P>
   In Syria, some of the roads around Damascus and the port of
Latakia were closed.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank, Israeli soldiers and Palestinian police
cooperated in rescuing hundreds of motorists stranded by the storm.
</P>
<P>
   The walls of Jerusalem's Old City were covered with snow, and
tourist shops were shuttered. A few street vendors braved the cold
to sell ``caike,'' oval-shaped Arabic bread covered with sesame
seeds. Many people carried cameras to snap pictures of snow-capped
religious sites.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli schoolchildren, due to return to classes at the end of a
nearly two-week teachers' strike, got an extra day off when public
transport came to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest Jerusalem snowfall on record was in 1950 when up to
28 inches fell. The next heaviest was in 1992 with 16 inches.

INFLATIONARY SIGNALS GIVE MARKET A SCARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stock market dipped dramatically Friday after the federal
government reported the economy grew at a 5.8 percent annual rate
in the fourth quarter. Galloping growth increased inflationary
pressures in the economy and virtually ensured that the Federal
Reserve would raise interest rates next week.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of its roller-coaster ride Friday, the Dow Jones
industrial average lost 289.15 points, or 2.62 percent, and dropped
below the 11,000 mark. The Dow closed at 10,738.87. The
technology-dominated Nasdaq index, which nearly doubled last year,
had a worse day, dropping 152.49 points, or 3.77 percent, and
closing at 3887.07.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was truly a nasty and ugly'' day on Wall Street, said Ned
Riley, chief investment strategist for State Street Global
Advisers, a division of State Street Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Investors panicked in response to two government reports which,
analysts said, make a strong case for boosting interest rates when
members of the Federal Open Market Committee meet Tuesday and
Wednesday to set monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   Strong growth in the final two quarters _ the economy expanded
at a 5.7 percent annual rate in the third quarter _ brought to 4
percent the growth rate for the year. In 1999, the economy
experienced its third consecutive year of 4 percent or greater
growth in an expansion that next week will officially become the
longest on record.
</P>
<P>
   ``This pace of growth is far in excess of what they (Fed
members) think is sustainable over the long run,'' said Dick Rippe,
senior economist for Prudential Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In past statements, central bankers have shown increasing
concern that strong growth, combined with a tight labor market and
unemployment at 30-year lows, would begin to push up wages, which
in turn could inflation. While the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan,
has aired those fears frequently, there has been scant evidence
that inflation is rising.
</P>
<P>
   But the US Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday that wages _
the largest component of inflation overall _ surged 1.1 percent in
the final quarter, a significant increase from the 0.8 percent rise
in wages in third quarter. Wage inflation, as measured by the
employment cost index, was caused by the biggest increase in
bonuses and health and other employee benefits since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   For the entire year, labor costs increased 3.4 percent, matching
the 1998 increase, and analysts said that it may begin to show up
in future inflation reports. The consumer price index rose 2.7
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   A separate index of inflation, used by the Commerce Department
to calculate GDP, rose at a 2 percent annual rate in the fourth
quarter, up sharply from 1.1 percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The US Department of Commerce said the economy's 5.8 percent
annualized rate of growth in the fourth quarter was due to a
powerful combination of vibrant holiday spending and stockpiling of
computers and inventories in anticipation of Y2k fears. Consumer
confidence is higher than it has ever been.
</P>
<P>
   Rippe predicted the Fed's Open Market Committee would raise
rates by a quarter percentage point next week. Other economists
said, given Friday's ominous signs, that the rate increase could
even be a half-point, and may not be the last this year.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the Fed increased the federal funds rate by a
quarter-point, to 5.5 percent. It was the third such move last year
to slow the economy and, the Fed hoped, ease inflationary
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   But, the Fed's preemptive actions apparently were too subtle to
cool an economy driven by consumers enjoying spectacular gains in a
soaring stock market. Greenspan suggested this week in testimony to
Congress that he is concerned about speculative investing in the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a no-brainer'' Fed members will raise interest rates,
said Cynthia Latta, US economist for Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, a
Lexington firm. Further, given Friday's reports, the Fed may raise
rates by a half point ``to give financial markets a jolt,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's reports ``are legitimately flashing a warning sign that
inflation may really be a danger, while for the longest time it's
been only an inference,'' said William Cheney, chief economist for
John Hancock Financial Services, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Stock analysts said Friday's market decline is not necessarily
bad. A growing number of experts believe that a speculative bubble
that has developed in Internet and computer stocks will pop.
Further, the frenzy over technology has drained other industries
and depressed stock prices in those sectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``A correction of Internet stocks may actually encourage money
to come back into the market in non-technology areas,'' State
Street Global's Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a blockbuster performance in 1999, markets this year are
down. The Dow has fallen 6.6 percent, and the Nasdaq has dropped
4.48 percent. This week, however, the Nasdaq has lost 8.2 percent
in its biggest weekly decline since late August of 1998.

FOR FRANCIS, A DEFINING MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, England _ It was his last chance, and Julius Francis
knew it.
</P>
<P>
   By 25, he had served time in nearly every prison in London and
was sitting in the dock awaiting a verdict on drug and great bodily
harm charges that might bring him another seven years in jail. As
he waited, he realized his youth would be gone by the time this
sentence was served.
</P>
<P>
   He would never be free again after this, even when the cell door
finally opened. He had already missed his daughter Lonnie's first
birthday because he was behind bars and faced missing much more
than that. He was faced with missing his life.
</P>
<P>
   Then, unexpectedly, his second chance came.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not guilty,'' the jury said, and thus was born the boxing life
of Julius Francis.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, Francis finds himself facing the second biggest
moment of his life. When he enters the ring at the MEN Arena
Saturday night in front of 21,000 witnesses, the Commonwealth
champion will earn $550,000 for being there. He will also earn,
experts predict, a quick beating from Mike Tyson. Then life will go
on.
</P>
<P>
   That is how the world sees him, an ex-con who got lucky in a
violent sport that saved him from a more violent world and gave him
a fortnight to enjoy it. But it will extract a price _ likely a
mild concussion and temporary memory loss not long after
encountering Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   To most observers, this knowledge should leave Francis
terrified, quaking in his locker room as the final minutes tick
down like the executioner's song until it is time to take the long
walk to meet his fate.
</P>
<P>
   But most observers have not been stabbed in the stomach and left
with a 60-stitch gash. Most observers have never been shot. Most
observers have never heard the cell door slam, knowing it will not
open again for a long time. Most observers have not heard, in the
dark hours, the screams Julius Francis has heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've been through what I've been through, there's not a
man alive who can scare you,'' Francis (21-7) said after Friday's
weigh-in. ``I don't care how tough anyone thinks they are, when
that cell door slams behind you, it's like being kicked below the
belt. You lie on your bunk listening to the screams and yells of
prisoners _ most of them junkies suffering withdrawal symptoms. I
can assure you, it's horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Some folks have been willing to assure Francis what he's about
to experience will be equally horrible.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for the fight, Francis locked himself away at the
British Army base at Aldershot for weeks of training. He slept
there in a tiny cot, in a room no bigger than a prison cell,
training for hours by day and locking himself away with the Bible
(which he began reading during his final days in prison) each
night. The Bible and boxing, now Francis's two holds on reality.
</P>
<P>
   Local betting shops throughout England haven't given much weight
to that period of exile, believing more, perhaps, in the redemptive
powers of prison than an army base. Barely a dozen bets have been
put down on Francis, who is a 17-1 underdog to survive. Even he
admits there is little reason for anyone to assume a 35-year-old
fighter who didn't turn professional until 28, once fought in a
cattle market, and has been beaten by the likes of John Ruiz, Axel
Schulz, and Zeljko Mavrovic has the slightest chance of leaving the
MEN Arena bathed in glory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he plans to fight as long as he can. Fight as he did in the
streets and prisons of southeast London. Fight until he is out, one
way or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know most people are betting that I won't last one round,
but I can tell them now they're going to lose their money,''
Francis said. ``Tyson is fighting for his life. That's the same way
I'm approaching this fight. I'm going there to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect it to be rough and nasty but I don't expect it to be
dirty. A lot of people in England have told me to mind my ears, but
I don't expect Tyson to bite me. I'm not expecting anything like
that. I'm just prepared for a good, tough, hard fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Notice, Francis did not mention a long fight and neither has
anyone else, including Tyson, who brings a 46-3 record and his
hopes that he will fight well enough to return to Europe in March
or April and again to England this summer to continue his pursuit
of the heavyweight title and its British shareholder, Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Francis quietly believes in redemption. He got it that
afternoon in London when he sat waiting for three hours for a jury
to return with a verdict that changed his life. Now he must wait a
few more hours for a second chance to change his life, a chance
most people believe is less likely to be coming than his first
redemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen guys crumble against Tyson,'' Francis said, ``but
there is only one person in life to be afraid of and that is God,
the Almighty Jesus Christ. Tyson has, or had, an aura of
invincibility but it's been broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evander Holyfield broke it. Buster Douglas wiped the floor
with him. The bubble has been burst. Mike Tyson is a circus. Tyson
has never intimidated me. Not by what he says, by what he does, or
by what nobody in his camp does. My game plan is to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see Tyson I think one thing. Man is man. Whatever they
say about him, he is human. He has two arms and two legs. He
bleeds. He feels pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like Julius Francis is going to feel sometime Saturday
night.

CONTROVERSY OVER GAYS IN MILITARY COMES ALIVE IN ONE-MAN PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The paranoia is right there, on tape, in the voice of
a young woman about to be interviewed by a writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to do something,'' she said apologetically. Then she
rattles off a series of clipped questions: ``Do you work for the
government? Are you a police officer? Are you in the military? Are
you, let's see, FBI? CIA?''
</P>
<P>
   She is the first of many voices in ``Another American: Asking
and Telling,'' Marc Wolf's one-man play at the Theater at St.
Clement's about gays in the military, which opened to positive
reviews in December.
</P>
<P>
   There are 18 characters, all performed and written by Wolf.
Reviewing the show in The New York Times, Sarah Boxer called Wolf
``a brilliant sketch artist'' whose play ``offers long sad stories,
wild rants and sensual narratives.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Wolf didn't so much write the play as construct it.
Working in the style of the monologist Anna Deavere Smith, author
of ``Fires in the Mirror'' and ``Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992,''
which were taken verbatim from interviews, Wolf spent three years
interviewing more than 150 current and former servicemen, military
officials, family members of slain servicemen, politicians and
academics.
</P>
<P>
   The interviews yielded some 400 hours of tape, a maxed-out
credit card and something close to a psychiatric obsession. He
slowly chipped away at his ``big piece of rock'' until he had an
hour and 45 minutes of remarkably topical theater in both dramatic
style and subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   Several documentary-style plays will be staged this spring. In
March Ms. Smith's latest piece, ``House Arrest,'' culled from four
years of interviews and observations of characters associated with
the Clinton administration, opens at the Public Theater. And in
February, Moises Kaufman will direct the world premiere of ``The
Laramie Project'' in Denver, the result of his ensemble's
interviews of citizens of Laramie, Wyo., where Matthew Shepard, a
gay college student, was beaten to death in 1998. It is expected to
get a New York production this year.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond its dramaturgical technique, ``Another American'' has
a lucky sense of political timing, opening and playing just as the
issue of gays in the military emerged from a long hibernation to
become a presidential campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf vows he didn't plan it this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started this, people were like, `Why are you working on
this now?''' he said with a laugh. ``They were saying, `Why didn't
you write this in '93?'''
</P>
<P>
   The piece's news sense is especially keen considering that Wolf,
an actor who had never written a play before, began the project in
1996, when few wanted to talk about it. The impetus came from a
role Wolf had performed the year before, that of Peter Bergson, a
Jewish advocate during World War II whose personal mission was to
draw attention to the Nazi massacre of European Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to compare this to the Holocaust, but what I learned from
that character was that when you silence people, you create an
environment where they can be destroyed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But though his spirit was willing, Wolf said, his method was
weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what questions to ask, what was the best tape
recorder to use, how should I transcribe it,'' he said. ``So I had
to make all of that up myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He also had to overcome a sense that he was on a quixotic
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first drove down to Washington, D.C., I was thinking,
`This is the dumbest thing I've ever done in my life,''' he said.
``Nobody knows what I'm working on yet. I was spending my own
money. And I was going to talk to a guy at the Brookings
Institution.''
</P>
<P>
   That feeling persisted and intensified when he began to invest
in airplane tickets. ``Then I felt really dumb,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What he found, however, was an enormous reservoir of untapped
stories, both funny and solemn. Many are told in ``Another
American,'' including the story of a mother whose enlisted son was
beaten to death in Japan, and a Vietnam recruit nicknamed Mary
Alice whose combat skills included a knack for sprucing up his
unit's bunker.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said he was immediately confronted with the intense
paranoia that the issue of gays in the military inspires. Scores of
his interviewees refused to allow Wolf to tape them despite the
promise of anonymity, and several retracted their permission to use
the stories for fear their identities would be discovered even with
no names attached.
</P>
<P>
   He also found intense fear of discovery, a fear, he said, that
rubbed off. To protect his subject's location, he said he would
often use his parents' car to travel and paid for many transactions
in cash. He sometimes left without telling anybody where he was
headed, and on his return would be vague about where he had been.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought I was becoming a little crazy,'' Wolf said.
``But people had to trust me.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the need for secrecy, Wolf said, he was also struck by
the enormous patriotism of his subjects. ``The people I interviewed
love their country,'' he said. ``And they love the military. That's
why it's a complicated thing.''
</P>
<P>
   That complexity is reflected in the play's approach to its
subject. While certainly sympathetic to the plight of gay
servicemen, ``Another American'' also fleshes out the rationale and
passions behind those who oppose a military that openly accepts
gays.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said ys his play is about ``how America stereotypes the
military community as much as it does the gay community.'' He
added, ``You don't have to be a bigot or a terrible person to have
some rational reasons'' for opposing gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said he has yet to be confronted by an audience member who
feels the play does a disservice to the military, but he said he
has been scolded by several gay activists who feel he's ``not
hitting the military hard enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf performed a slender version of the play in early 1998, just
five monologues, at Dixon Place, and then on Manhattan's Lower East
Side _ ``the most nervous I've ever been'' _ and later mounted a
workshop production at the Provincetown Repertory Theater in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In New York the piece is being presented by the New Group in
association with David Marshall Grant, another actor who has
recently tried his hand at play writing, scoring a critical hit
with ``Snakebit.''
</P>
<P>
   Having used so little of his reams of material, Wolf is
pondering what to do with it all. A book is a possibility, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of secrecy also persists. Wolf was careful with his
subject's identities in an interview, offering only as many details
as the play itself provides.
</P>
<P>
   But Wolf was even more protective with his dramatic secrets: the
only time he turned off a reporter's tape recorder was when he
revealed his play's ending.

MARTZ MASTER OF RAMS' OFFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This time last year, Mike Martz had a choice: go to
the St. Louis Rams, a team that had won nine games in two years, or
go to Chicago with Dave McGinnis, the defensive coordinator of the
Cardinals who was a strong choice for the vacant Bears head
coaching position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to Chicago,'' said Martz. ``If Dave got the job, I
was going there.''
</P>
<P>
   But McGinnis's deal with the Bears fell through and Martz was
left to become the offensive coordinator of the decrepit Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a year later, Martz is the hottest offensive mind in
football.
</P>
<P>
   He is the same Mike Martz who might have been in Chicago with a
mediocre Bears team and the same Mike Martz who was with a poor
Redskins team two seasons ago. But now his offense is the most
explosive in football: one of only three in NFL history to score
more than 500 points in a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not me,'' Martz said. ``It's the offensive line; it's the
quarterback; it's the receivers; it's the talent. It's not as if I
have a magic weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   Humble.
</P>
<P>
   Honest, too.
</P>
<P>
   Few coaches will admit mistakes, certainly not the egregious
error of not knowing which players are on the field. But time and
again late in the Oct. 31 game between Tennessee and St. Louis,
plays were slow getting from Martz to quarterback Kurt Warner.
Eventually, the Rams' comeback from a 21-0 deficit fell short,
24-21.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's what happened,'' said Martz. ``We had lost a couple of
receivers. I wasn't quite sure who was in the huddle. And we were
trying to get a guy in and out and it threw me off. So two of those
(late plays) were my fault. I sent in a play and I didn't realize
we didn't have the right players in there.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also honest in conceding that Tampa Bay took away some _
if not much _ of what he wanted to do last Sunday in the Rams' 11-6
win over the Buccaneers in the NFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to take some shots last weekend and we couldn't get
them,'' said Martz. ``But we're just going to try to do what we
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Only once did a Ram receiver get behind a Tampa Bay defender,
and that was when Ricky Proehl hauled down a 41-yard touchdown pass
from Warner late in the fourth quarter for the winning score. More
troublesome was how Tampa Bay completely took running back Marshall
Faulk out of the game and how the Buccaneers seemed to know where
Warner was throwing his quick out passes.
</P>
<P>
   But that was last Sunday. Tennessee, unlike Tampa Bay, often
plays a very aggressive man-to-man in its pass coverage, a
defensive style that might be more susceptible to the Rams' all-out
attack than Tampa Bay's zone defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to be as aggressive as we can,'' said Martz. ``At
times, a great defense won't let you do that and they will take
some things away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans may not be as quick as the Buccaneers on defense but
they may be more physical.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll get in your face in their press coverage,'' said
Martz. ``They're also very tight in their coverage and we'll have
to be sharp in getting the ball to (the receivers).''
</P>
<P>
   Martz's foe on the Titans is Gregg Williams, one of the more
underrated defensive coordinators in the NFL. And Martz knows it,
noting, ``We have our work cut out for us. Tennessee has a very
good defense and we may struggle at times. The point is, when it
comes down to it, we have to make a play to win the game. That's
what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Martz's second stint with the Rams. He was an unpaid
assistant in 1992 for the Los Angeles Rams, working with offensive
coordinator Ernie Zampese (late of the Patriots), breaking down
tape, turning on the office lights, fetching coffee, and other
low-responsibility jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Zampese helped develop Martz's offensive
philosophy. And Zampese's philosophy, which descended directly from
the ``Air Coryell'' school of former San Diego coach Don Coryell,
was one of passing, timing, and more passing.
</P>
<P>
   Martz worked under Norv Turner in Washington for two seasons
(1997-98) and it was there that he refined the Coryell-Zampese
system into the Martz system of a riverboat gambler's passing
offense.
</P>
<P>
   No worries here with the Rams about balancing runs with passes
or establishing a running game. No team uses as much motion and
shifts as the Rams and the plays end up with Warner throwing the
ball to any number of receivers at any location on the field.
Reverses, fake reverses, option pitches, shovel passes, they're all
in the arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing an offense can do,'' said Martz, ``is bunch
everybody up in an I-formation and let them zero in on you.''
Instead, Martz's offense is on the attack at all times and by doing
that, he said, ``you keep the defense on their heels. You've just
got to let it all hang out and not worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martz was a hot candidate for several head coaching vacancies
until the Rams resolved the matter by designating him as Dick
Vermeil's successor as head coach. And Martz concedes this past
year has been intriguing: leaving Washington, wanting to go to
Chicago, ending up in St. Louis, and now the Rams' coach of the
future.
</P>
<P>
   But Martz's ego is nowhere as lofty as his salary. ``It's not
that I'm a genius,'' he said of his meteoric rise. ``It's the
players.''

SOUTH AFRICA CODIFIES BAN ON BIAS IN   CONSTITUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ As called for in the constitution,
South Africa's Parliament passed a far-reaching bill this week
explicitly outlawing discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity
and sex.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also ban discrimination against homosexuals,
pregnant women and the disabled and bar the malicious use of
derogatory labels for blacks and other people of color.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the law would create a special group of judges,
specially approved by the government, to hear cases against accused
law breakers.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was passed by the National Council of Provinces
Friday and by the National Assembly on Wednesday, and is expected
to be signed into law by President Thabo Mbeki. It was mandated by
the postapartheid constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Its passage was quickly applauded as an essential step toward
ensuring that all citizens _ blacks, whites, Asians and coloreds _
would finally be treated equally. The South African Council of
Churches praised the passage of the bill, saying it offered the
country ``powerful new tools to address the legacies of the
apartheid era.''
</P>
<P>
   But earlier versions of the bill were criticized by opposition
politicians and others who described it as overly broad.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders _ particularly those in the insurance industry
_ had said they would suffer financially if they could not
discriminate against people with chronic diseases like AIDS.
Landlords _ who worried about proposed language that barred
discrimination against the poor _ had feared that they would have
to offer apartments to tenants who could not pay rent.
</P>
<P>
   In response to those complaints, lawmakers eliminated
protections _ included in earlier drafts of the legislation _ for
poor people, foreigners and those infected with the HIV virus.
</P>
<P>
   Those changes quickly stirred protests from advocates for the
poor and infirm who accused the government of failing to protect
the nation's most vulnerable people. To address those concerns, the
legislation provides for a re-evaluation of protected groups one
year from now.
</P>
<P>
   Mohseen Moosa, a Parliament member from the African National
Congress who worked on the bill, defended the changes, saying he
was pleased that the political parties, business leaders and others
could take part in the policy making process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've managed to bring many different views together in a very
real South African way,'' Moosa said.
</P>
<P>
   But some complaints about the legislation were left unresolved.
It is unclear, for instance, exactly how malicious intent will be
defined when people are charged with using offensive terms.
</P>
<P>
   And despite fierce objections of opposition parties, the
lawmakers from the ANC insisted that the government should have the
power to handpick the judges who would hear discrimination cases
and determine penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Leon, the leader of the Democratic Party, said he could not
support the bill because it threatened the judiciary's
independence. ``Undermining the principle of judicial independence
is too high a price to pay,'' Leon told local reporters earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Minister Penuell Maduna dismissed those concerns and
said the law would be a landmark in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must ensure that the people who in the past have not been
in a position to protect themselves are treated in the manner
required by the constitution,'' Maduna said.

 &HT;    Coke aims for more streamlined operations
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In his 30-year career at Coca-Cola, Doug Daft said he
had never stood at a podium to address a group of
information-starved Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel nervous, which I thought I would,'' said Daft,
the company's new president and chairman-designate. ``I believe
strongly in what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In a packed room of 200 analysts at the Essex House across from
Central Park, Daft tried to paint a clearer picture of the new
Coke.
</P>
<P>
   The company, he said, will be more decentralized, efficient and
profitable because more decisions will be made by executives around
the globe instead of at headquarters in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were making too many decisions here for Shanghai,'' Daft
said. ``The company has to think local and act local. I didn't say
global. No one drinks globally.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, he said, too many decisions had to be checked off
in Atlanta, where precious time was lost. Now, more responsibility
and accountability would be in the hands of local executives around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize the importance of this move, Daft said the company
would be changing its compensation package to encourage
risk-taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will reward bright decisions,'' he said. And, he added,
there will be consequences ``for dumb decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Also as part of this decentralization plan, the company is
establishing research and development centers on four continents,
although Daft did not identify them. The centers will come up with
product and brand innovations for their areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time around, new Coke sounds like a positive
development,'' said John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage
Digest.
</P>
<P>
   During the two-hour session with analysts, Daft was joined by
Jack Stahl, who becomes president and chief operating officer after
Daft assumes the titles of chairman and chief executive in April.
He was also joined by James Chestnut, executive vice president of
operations support.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the three fielded questions on a number of financial
topics, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Growth targets. The goal of growing earnings per share an
average 17 percent to 18 percent may be ``a tad high,'' Daft said.
He said the target may be lowered to the ``mid-teens.''
</P>
<P>
   Daft also said the company's current goal of 7 percent to 8
percent volume growth also could be lowered by a percentage point
or two. This year, the company expects case sales to grow by 5
percent to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inventories. Earlier this week, the company unexpectedly
announced its earnings will be reduced in the first half of this
year because Coke will be shipping less concentrate to bottlers,
which are reducing their inventories.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Chestnut explained that the lower inventories are the
result of technological advances and improved logistics that have
reduced the time needed to ship concentrates. As a result, bottlers
don't have to carry as much inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut denied speculation that Coca-Cola had inflated sales by
shipping more concentrate than bottlers needed.
</P>
<P>
   _ India. The company may write down the value of its bottling
assets there this year because of excess capacity. Chestnut,
however, did not elaborate on the amount of the potential charge
against earnings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dr. Pepper. Outside the United States, the company wants to
make Dr. Pepper one of its key global brands. Coca-Cola acquired
the rights to Dr. Pepper last year in its acquisition of Cadbury
Schweppes' brands in 161 nations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shareholders. The company will consider increasing its
dividends and restarting a share buyback program this year,
Chestnut said.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Bill Pecoriello, an analyst with Sanford
Bernstein &AMP; Co., said he thinks the company is on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short-term, there will be some uncertainty. But long-term, it
will payoff,'' Pecoriello said.

   CONGRESS-ATWORK (Washington) -- Pity poor Congress, having to
actually sit on Capitol Hill for 90 minutes Thursday night to hear
President Clinton's State of the Union speech. Actually, it was the
longest amount of time that U.S. Representatives have spent in
their chamber since before Thanksgiving. And, thanks to a couple of
snow days and some planned retreats in the coming week, it doesn't
look like it gets much harder for Congress. The House eased back
into business on Monday with a five-minute opening session of the
full House that featured a prayer, a flag salute and a motion to
adjourn. It was followed by snow shutdowns on Tuesday and Wednesday
and then Thursday's late-night session. Friday was an already
planned day off. True, Congress isn't a typical 5-days-a-week,
8-hours-a-day workplace. But this election year, it seems the days
politicians will spend outside the Beltway will nearly outnumber
the days they spend at their desks. By Bill Hillburg (Will move on

   NOISY -- Neighbors of a Sun Valley church implored a city zoning
administrator to crack down on noisy services and choir rehearsals
which, they say, disturb the neighborhood six nights a week. The
zoning official expects to make his ruling in the next few weeks,
and during a public hearing in Van Nuys he cautioned that the First
Amendment probably limits what the city can demand of the church.
The church's two congregations -- one Latino, another Tongan -- say
they've tried to hold down the noise and are increasingly
frustrated at the residents' continuous griping. By Michael Coit

MCCAIN CAMPAIGN CONFIDENCE ON THE RISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EXETER, N.H. _ Senator John McCain's campaign has become an
entirely different creature this week.
</P>
<P>
   With the all-important primary in view, and dozens of media
organizations demanding their shots at the candidate, the hitherto
scrappy, insurgent and slightly chaotic operation, a
characterization McCain and his aides have taken enormous pride in
until now, has suddenly become more orderly _ polished, even.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate has even allowed himself rare expressions of
confidence about Tuesday's results, the mantle of insurgency
occasionally gaping to reveal something more like regency.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took the whole day off today,'' a bemused McCain said of
his chief rival, Governor George W. Bush of Texas, on Thursday
night. ``I was surprised he took the day off today.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is renewed caution here, too. With four days to go
before the vote on which McCain has staked his bid for the
presidential nomination, there is less time to make up for
mistakes, to undo the kind of damage done by his inconsistent
statements on abortion earlier in the week. So McCain and his aides
are trying very hard not to get into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly because he is being watched by far more people
now. Hordes of extra reporters descended upon the campaign a few
days ago, and these days, the press corps and the campaign workers
travel in a three-bus convoy.
</P>
<P>
   The back of the ``Straight Talk Express,'' where reporters were
used to cramming into circulation-stopping positions just inches
from the candidate, is now inadequate for the task. McCain and the
press have moved up front, where there is more room, not just for
them, but also for several of the senator's advisers, allowing them
to monitor the candidate's rolling news conferences more closely.
</P>
<P>
   There are other hallmarks of glossier operations, too: McCain
actually held a photo-op at a Newington factory Thursday morning,
and another at the American Independence Museum in Exeter Friday.
Now, McCain's town hall meetings are bigger productions: Before and
after he gets on stage, John Fogerty's ``Center Field'' blasts from
speakers: ``Put me in coach/I'm ready to play today,'' goes the
song.
</P>
<P>
   Television audiences are seeing a slightly different McCain,
too. A new campaign advertisement exhorts New Hampshire voters to
``send a powerful message to America.'' The 30-second spot cuts
quickly between different shots of McCain before adoring audiences,
American flags behind him, the candidate looking very presidential.
The spot closes with McCain absorbing kudos from a crowd as red,
white and blue ticker tape rains down on him, the candidate every
inch a winner.
</P>
<P>
   This McCain is unrattled by the Bush campaign and whatever
endorsements he might be have picked up lately. Former New
Hampshire governor John Sununu's endorsement Friday of the Texas
governor? No problem. Endorsements don't concern him, McCain said.
Sununu's late arrival was a sign that ``the establishment is
desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Sununu simply thought he was backing a winner, a
reporter asked McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that's why he waited until four days before the
primary,'' McCain quipped.
</P>
<P>
   McCain still asserts his underdog status, but at some of his
many town hall meetings, McCain has allowed himself some
confidence. ``I'm very enthusiastic and confident about how we're
going to do on Tuesday,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Most polls still show McCain leading Bush among likely
Republican voters in this state. But previous New Hampshire
primaries have shown what looks good on the Friday before the votes
are cast can go horribly wrong before Tuesday, and there is little
time to correct mistakes in between.
</P>
<P>
   So lately, when McCain has given voice to those staples of his
stump speech that have led pundits and his opponents to
characterize him as too moderate a Republican, he has taken care to
underline his conservative credentials. He now takes care to
mention Ronald Reagan in the same breath when he invokes John F.
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends,'' he told an audience at Timberlane Regional High
School in Plaistow Thursday night. ``I am a proud conservative
Republican. I have a 17-year record as a conservative Republican.
But Jack Kennedy and Ronald Reagan had something in common: They
could inspire a crowd to causes greater than their own
self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   An important precedent is worrying McCain and his aides. In
1988, Vice President George Bush's campaign sprung its last-minute
``Senator Straddle'' attack ad against Senator Bob Dole in New
Hampshire, catching Dole off-guard and doing irreparable damage.
</P>
<P>
   They have heard that President Bush's son plans to air similarly
negative television spots, using McCain's words from the debate
Wednesday night to liken him to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and aides have been busy launching a pre-emptive strike
against that possibility over the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``My question is, will the Bush campaign go negative?'' was
McCain's first, unsolicited comment when he took his seat among
reporters Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're grasping at straws,'' said McCain strategist Mike
Murphy. ``It's an incredibly dumb argument that nobody's going to
believe. That's what they've sunk to?''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campagn also issued a news release calling on Bush to
keep to his handshake agreement to forgo negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer would neither confirm nor deny the
existence of such a spot Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to note Senator McCain's admission that President
Clinton's tax plan resembles Senator McCain's tax plan,'' he said.
But McCain continued to maintain Friday that Clinton had not been a
model of his, but an imitator.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there are bumps along this now-short road that are
beyond strategy. At a town hall meeting at Exeter Area High School
Friday, McCain wrapped up his introductory speech by mistakenly
referring to New Hampshire as Massachusetts, eliciting jeers from
his large audience. No pre-emptive strike could have helped him
there.

   Editors:
</P>
<P>
   This is the second installment in a new communique to editors
who receive  &UR; The New York Times News Service &LR; . If you saw the
introduction two weeks ago, when the inaugural chapter moved, you
know what it is all about and I recommend you save yourself time
and skip to the first subhed.
</P>
<P>
   For editors who missed the early explanation, here it is:
</P>
<P>
   As executive editor of the wire service, I think part of my job
should be to make some kind of personal contact with the people who
read and use this wire, so I am reviving the practice of issuing a
periodic newsletter. A previous incarnation, titled ``Listening
Post,'' died quietly a couple of years ago because it had become,
well, boring. I hope ``The Inside Story'' will not be.
</P>
<P>
   I intend to produce an installment at least every other week,
but more often if developments warrant. It may be a several grafs,
it may be a couple.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to give editors occasional glimpses inside The
Times, illuminating who we are, how we think why we do what we do.
I hope wire editors will pass this along to managing editors,
executive editors, department heads _ anybody who might be
interested.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ON THE WIRE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BREAKING NEWS: You may have noticed a growing component of
breaking news during the day from us. That is because a new spot
news operation has begun turning out copy intended for The Times's
Web site. But besides the Web delivery, stories from this
``continuous news'' desk, as it is known internally, are being
added to the News Service wire, so clients will be seeing an
increasing volume of early ledes for PM's, and much earlier
versions of many full stories from Asia, the Middle East and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   PRIESTS WITH AIDS:  &UR; The Kansas City Star &LR; , one of the partner
news organizations whose stories move on the Times News Service
wire, has produced a series with startling central facts.  &UR; Judy
Thomas &LR; , a Star reporter, has found in four years of research that
hundreds of Roman Catholic priests have died of AIDS and that
hundreds more are infected. The three-part series, embargoed until
Sunday, is moving on the wire tonight and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A NEW VOICE: Another News Service partner paper, the  &UR; The
Sarasota Herald-Tribune &LR; , has produced an entertaining new
columnist. He is Daryl Lease, who was recognized in the ``Stuff We
Like'' section of the most recent issue of Brill's Content.
``Gentle and sarcastic'' and ``strong without being strident'' were
the ways Brill's described Lease's work. His columns move on Monday
afternoons with the slug BC-LEASE-COLUMN-NYTR, in the ``k''
category.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IN THE HOUSE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NEW BUSINESS COVERAGE: As business editors and their bosses are
acutely aware, we parted company a few months ago with Bloomberg
News, which had been a partner on the Times News Service wire for
several years. Many papers had come to rely on Bloomberg as a key
provider of business and financial news. But many editors also
chafed at the size of the Bloomberg file, which had become so huge
with its dozens of repeats and updates that it had become unwieldy
and difficult to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, I have been designing a replacement, one that will
provide not only the fastest possible stories on the major world
and national business news of the day, but also the vital regional
business coverage that editors need.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, I could use your help. I am inviting you to tell me
what five or 10 _ or more _ businesses in your region you would
like to see covered on our wire.
</P>
<P>
   With today's technology, it is not difficult for a business news
provider to zero in on a select list of dozens or even hundreds of
companies, once the names are known.
</P>
<P>
   So below is a form that business editors, or top editors, can
print out, fill out, and send back to me. And when I am prepared to
announce the components of our new business service, one element of
it will be that is tailored to the needs of our clients.

BUSH CAMPAIGN SUFFERING ACCESS GAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOOKSETT, N.H. _ The local snowmobile dealership has seen its
share of celebrities. Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler once
stopped in to buy a standup jetski. Jim Walgreen, of drug store
fame, is a regular customer, and at least two players for the New
England Patriots have bought costly sports toys here over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing quite compares to what happened here Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Swept down the highway in a five-vehicle motorcade, flanked by
bodyguards wearing earpieces and long coats, Governor George W.
Bush of Texas made his entrance at the Hooksett Kawasaki shop
grinning and shaking hands.
</P>
<P>
   He took a private tour with the owner. He paused for a TV shot
in front of a golf cart. Then Bush dashed out for a snowmobile ride
in the icy parking lot, surrounded by nearly 100 members of his
entourage, including at least 35 photographers who captured the
moment for later broadcast around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with hardly a minute to talk to customers, Bush was
ushered back to his bus. And onlookers, some of them still reeling
from the performance, were left to wonder: Was that man really just
a candidate?
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw his father once,'' said Mark Tello, 36, an equipment
engineer from Tewksbury who happened to stop by the store, ``and it
was a lot like this. It was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a lingering image on the campaign trail, where Bush is
working to convince voters he is presidential material. Unlike some
other contenders, whose relentless one-on-one exposure to the
public resembles a run for City Hall, Bush moves in a security
bubble.
</P>
<P>
   He flies in a private Gulf Stream jet. He has a team of two
dozen guards. Everywhere he goes, men in suits are talking
furtively into their sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   And while many of those accoutrements are standard for any
governor, they can seem presidential on the campaign trail _
especially since Bush is often introduced as ``the next president
of the United States.'' He routinely describes his administration
in terms of when, not if. On the cover of one of his glossy
brochures is a picture of the White House. At every event, he is
surrounded by pillars of the political establishment _ senators,
governors, congressmen. Even while snowmobiling Friday, he was in
the company of Senator Judd Gregg, the New Hampshire Republican.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush went to church last Sunday, reporters were invited to
cover only his exit from the building, prompting an to make the
obvious comparison. ``Just like when Clinton goes to church,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is trying to create an aura of inevitability about his
campaign,'' said professor Darrell West, who teaches political
science at Brown University. ``It creates an aura of leadership.
Because if you look presidential, then it sometimes helps people
grow more comfortable with the fact you may be president.''
</P>
<P>
   All candidates try to ``look presidential,'' of course, and most
carry a bag of age-old tricks _ positioning themselves in front of
the American flag to be photographed, for example, or confidently
describing what they will do as president.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan famously created a ``presidential package'' around
his candidacy in 1980. An American flag was in every photograph. He
hired agents who resembled the Secret Service. He moved constantly
with a massive entourage.
</P>
<P>
   In the current race, Steve Forbes, the millionaire publisher who
posed a serious challenge to Bush in Iowa, put out a TV ad showing
him looking pensive in a room meant to seem like the Oval Office.
Vice President Al Gore has the obvious advantage of his current job
_ and, of course, he travels on Air Force Two.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's aura of psuedo-incumbency is striking, if only
because it was so firmly established so long before the Republican
nominee has even been picked _ and because it is in such contrast
with the freewheeling atmosphere of the campaign of his top
opponent in New Hampshire, Senator John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   On his campaign bus, McCain rides alongside dozens of reporters
each day, hammering them with his every thought. He and his wife,
Cindy, sometime appear at events with little advance warning. In
recent months, McCain, always an easy interview, has been so
accessible that journalists have occasionally asked him to go away.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, on the other hand, chartered a separate plane to transport
the press and dared ride on it only once in recent months. Even
Bush heard the running joke on the 737 chartered from the Des
Moines airline Access Air: that it really should be called ``No
Access Air.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides defend the arrangements as necessary for the governor
of the country's second-largest state, and they point out his
ability to wander freely in public has suffered because of of
national front-runner status. They chafe at accusations he is
``inaccessible,'' noting that he holds a news conference every day
and has a hectic schedule, particularly in New Hampshire, where he
is working 14-hour days to improve his standing in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush has tried to keep the environment as natural as
possible, refusing the detail offered by the Secret Service. He
says he won't sign on to Secret Service protection until he is
officially the nominee. And in an interview, he said he does not
believe his necessary security trappings are going to turn voters
off. ``This is what it is. I don't worry about things that are
beyond my control,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the people are going to say, `Who can lead? Who do I
agree with?' It was the same circumstances in Iowa. It didn't seem
to bother the folks in that good state,'' Bush said. ``I was
worried about it initially, as to whether I was going to be able to
get in front of enough people and shake hands. And I believe I've
done so, and I'm going to continue to do so.''

   This is the second installment in a new communique to editors
who receive  &UR; The New York Times News Service &LR; . If you saw the

<P>
   As executive editor of the wire service, I think part of my job
should be to make some kind of personal contact with the people who
read and use this wire, so I am reviving the practice of issuing a
periodic newsletter. A previous incarnation, titled ``Listening
Post,'' died quietly a couple of years ago because it had become,
well, boring. I hope ``The Inside Story'' will not be.
</P>
<P>
   I intend to produce an installment at least every other week,
but more often if developments warrant. It may be a several grafs,
it may be a couple.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to give editors occasional glimpses inside The
Times, illuminating who we are, how we think why we do what we do.
I hope wire editors will pass this along to managing editors,
executive editors, department heads _ anybody who might be
interested.

news operation has begun turning out copy intended for The Times's

``continuous news'' desk, as it is known internally, are being

   NEW BUSINESS COVERAGE: As business editors and their bosses are
acutely aware, we parted company a few months ago with Bloomberg
News, which had been a partner on the Times News Service wire for
several years. Many papers had come to rely on Bloomberg as a key
provider of business and financial news. But many editors also
chafed at the size of the Bloomberg file, which had become so huge
with its dozens of repeats and updates that it had become unwieldy
and difficult to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, I have been designing a replacement, one that will
provide not only the fastest possible stories on the major world
and national business news of the day, but also the vital regional
business coverage that editors need.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, I could use your help. I am inviting you to tell me
what five or 10 _ or more _ businesses in your region you would
like to see covered on our wire.

CITIZENSHIP MOVE DROPPED, CUBAN BOY A LITTLE CLOSER TO HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In this federal episode of ``Family Feud,'' the
first round goes to the grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott backed off from a GOP
bill introduced with fanfare Monday that would have both granted US
citizenship to Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban refugee, and
freed him from an Immigration and Naturalization Service ruling
that would return him to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (Congress) can make the decision about what is
best for that young boy,'' Lott said in a television interview,
adding that custody is the realm of the courts and that the
citizenship bill would be ``the last resort.''
</P>
<P>
   The turnabout was a victory for Mariela Quintana de Gonzalez and
Raquel Rodriguez, Elian's Cuban grandmothers, who have trooped
across Capitol Hill this week tearfully imploring lawmakers to drop
the citizenship idea and let the little boy come home to them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the opposing side got a boost Friday from Sister Jeanne
O'Laughlin, the Miami nun selected by Attorney General Janet Reno
to be the neutral host at Wednesday's meeting between Elian and his
grandmothers. O'Laughlin now says she thinks it would be better for
the boy to remain in Miami, and she endorsed the Senate citizenship
bill as one way to ensure it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The child has been in the torment of the seas, and now he's
been in the torment of political agendas,'' said O'Laughlin, who
made her argument to Reno Friday. ``Somehow we must find for him
calm seas, at least for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said in a statement afterwards that she he listened to
O'Laughlin's ``feelings, observations, and conclusions,'' but still
believes Elian's father speaks for the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Robert Edgar, general secretary of the National Council
of Chruches, said in an interview that O'Laughlin was ``naive'' and
had both breached the trust of the grandmothers and the attorney
general and broken her vow of silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her coming out this way gives voice to the Cuban operatives
who said who said hers wasn't a safe place or a neutral setting,''
said Edgar, who helped arrange the reunion at O'Laughlin's Miami
Beach home.
</P>
<P>
   The citizenship proposal has been pushed by the Cuban American
National Foundation, which for two decades has been devoted to
lobbying Congress against any cooperation with the regime of Cuban
dictator Fidel Castro. Friday, the group's leaders tried to put the
best face on what was clearly a setback in its effort to make Elian
a post-Cold War symbol of communist abuses in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is by no means a death blow to our efforts,'' said Jose
Cardenas, the foundation's Washington director, who escorted
several of Elian's Cuban-American relatives to congressional
offices Thursday. ``Instead, it gives us more time to present the
opinions of Elian's family members in Miami and to change American
public opinion. I think the task is certainly uphill.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters would agree. According to a new Gallup survey,
Americans by a margin of 60 percent to 33 percent say Elian should
be returned to his father. Support for that position has grown in
the two months since the youngster was plucked from the Straits of
Florida after his mother and 10 others drowned trying to flee from
Cuba in a powerboat and Elian was put in the temporary custody of a
great-uncle in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of Americans _ 54 percent to 37 percent _ oppose any
effort by Congress to confer US citizenship on the boy, the Gallup
poll found.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat who met
twice with the grandmothers this week and supports their appeal,
said the citizenship effort collapsed because GOP lawmakers pushing
it misread public opinion and were too quick to accede to the
demands of the Cuban-American lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the GOP leadership embraced this citizenship
idea is an indication that the right-wing Cuban community in Miami
still exercises clout in Congress and makes big campaign
contributions,'' McGovern said. ``What they didn't understand is
that the American people don't think this is about bashing Castro;
they view it as a tragic family issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, maybe when the Cuban-American lobby says `jump,' members
of Congress will think twice before responding, `how high?''' said
McGovern, who favors ending the 38-year-old US trade embargo
against Cuba. ``Long term, this may pave the way to talk about Cuba
in a more rational and reasonable way.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, would be the worst consequence of the Elian
Gonzalez case for the Cuban American National Foundation, which was
founded in 1981 and was run by the charismatic, anti-Castro exile
leader Jorge Mas Canosa until his death in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The voice of the organization, which is now run by his son,
Miami businessman Jorge Mas Santos, is still strong and steadfast
in Washington, but lately it has had to compete with corporate
interests and some Clinton administration policymakers who favor a
warming in US-Cuban relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, the foundation was scoring goals, passing
legislation, getting programs like Radio Marti and TV Marti set
up,'' said Max Castro, a Cuban-American sociologist at the
University of Miami. ``Today they are defending their goal and
fending off shots. With the administration trying to loosen the
screws on Cuba, their job gets more difficult every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, says he
is offended by political opponents and journalists who, he
believes, demonize Cuban-Americans as right wing reactionaries
buying their way into Congress's favor. And he fears the Gonzalez
case will cause a backlash.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read about `Miami Cubans,' with the same connotations
of the Boston Irish or New York Jews, it means more than a
geographic location,'' said Menendez, who is sponsoring a bill to
make Elian a permanent US resident. ``Powerful forces that want an
end to the sanctions and view Castro as no threat are using this
situation to isolate and demean Cuban Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami's Cuban community, the tug-of-war over Elian has
enhanced the image of the Cuban American National Foundation and
its friends. ``It's been a big victory for the Cuban hard line
here,'' said Dario Moreno, a political science professor at Florida
International Univerity, though it had widened the gulf between
Cubans and non-Cubans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Elian remains under threat of deportation, the
Cuban-American activists have a cause. In a federal court, they are
supporting the Miami family's lawsuit seeking political asylum for
the boy. A federal judge Friday moved up the hearing in that case
to Feb. 22 from March 6, prior to a separate custody hearing in a
state family court.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has sought to dismiss the federal case,
and says the state court has no jurisdiction in the matter. But it
has said it will let the case play out in federal court, so the
judge's action Friday means that Elian is likely to remain in this
country for at least another 3 1/2 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde,
an Illinois Republican, echoed Lott's view that no action should be
taken on the citizenship bills until the courts finish their work.
``It is his intention to await the outcome of pending court cases
before deciding how to proceed legislatively,'' Hyde's spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Cuban American National Foundation intends to
bring family members from Miami back to Washington next week for
more lobbying. Elian's grandmothers were scheduled to return to
Havana Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that people have rushed to judgment about returning
the boy to his father,'' said the foundation's Cardenas. ``Our task
in the weeks ahead is provide an alternative perspective, and I
don't have one iota of doubt that when this is over, our efforts
are going to be vindicated.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams ruled out the
possibility Thursday night that the Irish Republican Army will act
to meet a Monday deadline for the beginning of guerrilla
disarmament, throwing the future of the fragile Northern Ireland
peace settlement into turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Dashing widespread expectations that the guerrilla force his
party represents politically was ready to make a long awaited move
on weapons, Adams said, ``It is not easy to get the IRA, or indeed
any of the armed groups, to do this speedily. This is the
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Failure to make progress on the issue of disarmament by Monday
could bring the eight-week-old power-sharing government in Belfast
to a halt and lead to Britain's reimposing direct rule of the
conflicted province from London.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson issued a plea for
people to keep ``cool heads'' in the crisis atmosphere that was
quickly replacing the optimism that emerged in December with the
start-up of the new political institutions in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   But Adams found himself on the defensive Friday when among those
expressing alarm was Seamus Mallon, a senior official of the
largest Catholic party in Northern Ireland, the Social Democratic
and Labor Party, and a past political ally of Sinn Fein's.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time of choice for the republican movement,'' Mallon
said. ``It cannot continue to claim to act on behalf of the people
of Ireland while defying their clearly expressed will that
decommissioning happen now.'' Decommissioning is the term used for
disarmament in the April 1998 peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The comment brought a rebuke Friday night from Adams, who said
it ``just flies totally in the face of what Mallon knows our party
and our party leadership have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday is the day that Canadian Gen. John de Chastelain, head of
the independent international panel on decommissioning, is to issue
a progress report, and there had been growing anticipation that he
would be able to offer evidence of IRA cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Sinn Fein chairman Mitchel McLaughlin dismissed these
hopes as ``over-hyped expectations,'' and the Press Association,
Britain's domestic news agency, said security sources confirmed
that the IRA had told the general that no move on weapons was
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists, a Protestant party that is the province's
largest and most powerful, has indicated it will consider a report
of no progress as cause to withdraw from its leadership positions
in the Northern Ireland Assembly and the new cross border bodies
with the Republic of Ireland. That threat would put pressure on the
British government to intervene first and dismantle the fledging
government itself.
</P>
<P>
   In November, David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists and
first minister of the new Legislature, was able to persuade his
quarrelsome party to enter government with Sinn Fein only by
pledging that he and the other party members in the Assembly
leadership would step down if there was not sufficient evidence by
February of IRA willingness to put its arms beyond use.
</P>
<P>
   Even with that safety catch, he obtained only 58 percent backing
from his 860-member party council for entering the government with
Sinn Fein before any disarmament began. Many members of his party
harshly criticized his decision to abandon the long-held Unionist
``no guns, no government'' disarmament demand, and he would have
little chance of gaining support for continued Ulster Unionist
participation now in the absence of any matching IRA move on arms.
</P>
<P>
   Unionists draw support from the Protestant majority who want to
keep the province part of Britain, while republicans, most of whom
are Catholic, represent those wanting to see Ulster establish
stronger links with Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists are in no mood to be conciliatory after the
British government announced last week that it planned to
reconstitute the Northern Ireland police force and retire its Royal
Ulster Constabulary name that is cherished by Protestants.
``Unionists have been stretched to and beyond limit after limit
after limit,'' Sir Reg Empey, a senior party official noted for his
moderate views, said Friday. ``Our patience is completely exhausted
in this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   In the continual seesawing of power and favor in the politics of
Northern Ireland, it is the Unionists who are now perceived as
having made significant concessions without corresponding responses
from republicans. Since Trimble's bold gamble in November,
Unionists' frustrations have been given a more sympathetic hearing
in places like Dublin, Washington, London and Belfast, where their
resistance in the past was more often characterized as obdurate
nay-saying.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble has scheduled a vote of his party in Belfast on Feb. 12,
but the British government would likely suspend the home rule
government before then, rather than see him put his leadership at
obvious risk. Trimble has been a calming and progressive force in
the Unionist camp, keeping his party engaged in the crisis-ridden
peace settlement process in the face of strong opposition from
associates who are against the accord and covet his leadership
position.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson said he would base his own actions on Monday's report.
``If it reveals that decommissioning is still on track, I will be
guided by that,'' he said. ``If we are going backwards in the
process, I will draw the obvious conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson has said he would suspend the assembly if the terms of
the review of the peace accord conducted last fall by former Sen.
George Mitchell are not being met. The Unionists believe the
Mitchell terms call for a start to disarmament by now, and Mallon
said Friday that he agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans claim that the only deadline for disarming is the
May 2000 date in the original peace settlement, and they argue that
the IRA cease-fire, now in its third year, is proof that the
clandestine organization is committed to peace.
</P>
<P>
   Adams made his remarks Thursday night at the opening of a new
party branch in Newry on the Irish border. He told his audience
that it was ``a fundamental mistake in strategy to try and force
decommissioning,'' and he urged Unionists to show more patience.
Seeking to shift blame for a possible new failure onto them, he
said, ``The achievement of this objective has been set back by the
way it is being used as a political football by unionists at this
time.''

NFL MUST STUDY `DIGITAL REVOLUTION,' TAGLIABUE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Paul Tagliabue took a look at the National Football
League's future Friday and said where it takes his game will
largely depend on what happens with the ``Digital Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At our last owners meeting, I told them we had to do two
things,'' said Tagliabue in his annual state of the NFL address
prior to the Super Bowl. ``First, extend our present collective
bargaining agreement with the players, so that we will have (a
solid league structure) in place to see what the Internet is going
to bring. I call it the Digital Revolution, and it will be very
important to our league that we study it to see how it can best
serve our league.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no major news coming out of the 60-minute session, but
here are some of the highlights:
</P>
<P>
   --The league is studying what he called a ``flexible''
television schedule. The schedule would be set in March, as always,
but during the season better games could be switched to Monday
night, or made the national game of the day as the second part of a
doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue asked the owners to think about it and said he had a
``mixed'' reaction. He said it was 50-50 at the moment whether it
would be used in 2000. He also said he spoke with the networks
about it (CBS yet to come). He pointed out that he was concerned
about the incovenience of switching a game, say in Foxborough, from
Sunday at 1 p.m. to Monday night at 9, on short notice.
</P>
<P>
   --He announced that the NFL's Man of the Year Award will now be
called the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, in honor of the
great Chicago Bear Hall of Fame running back, who died in 1999. He
also announced that Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Cris Carter
will be the first player honored in Payton's name.
</P>
<P>
   -- He said that after a slow start, he thought instant replay,
which was voted back in this year, was very effective in the latter
part of the season.
</P>
<P>
   --He said he was concerned about the increasing player violence
on the field, terming some of it ``juvenile'' and offered that some
of the league's game officials were going to go to the NFLPA's
annual convention to talk about the players showing more respect to
game officials. He said he would have a final ruling on Orlando
Brown of the Cleveland Browns, who intentionally knocked down
referee Jeff Triplette in a game this year.
</P>
<P>
   --He also said that the suspension he imposed on former 49er
owner Eddie DeBartolo would be over Tuesday, but that as far as he
was concerned, DeBartolo would not return as the owner of the team,
which is currently under the stewardship of DeBartolo's sister,
Denise. Tagliabue said he and the judge in Ohio, trying to sort out
the DeBartolo family dispute, would determine the future of the
ownership of the team.

EX-N.H. GOVERNOR SUNUNU ENDORSES BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ Of the hundreds of endorsements Governor
George W. Bush has received, the most unexpected may have come
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   John H. Sununu, the former governor and the man who led
President George Bush to victory in New Hampshire in 1988, gave his
support to the younger Bush at a packed speech at Liberty Mutual
Insurance , saying he wanted to make it ``very, very clear'' that
he is supporting the Texas governor for president.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a decade ago, however, it was Bush who was reportedly
clarifying things for Sununu.
</P>
<P>
   When Sununu resigned as chief of staff in the Bush White House
in 1991, legend had it that George W. Bush was the one who pulled
the trigger, telling him he should leave the administration after
months of unbearable tension.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, saying Bush ``was a friend and is a friend,'' Sununu
told a news conference he had never harbored ill will toward the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never had a problem with any conversation I have had
with Governor Bush,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But because it has been widely reported otherwise, the
endorsement seemed to take on more significance than the several
dozen Bush has won in recent months. When Virginia Senator John W.
Warner gave Bush the nod Friday afternoon, Bush aides didn't bother
to issue a news release, in contrast to the news conference that
was held especially to introduce Sununu.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Bush did not stray much from his usual message
Friday, except to criticize President Clinton's announcement of a
$350 billion tax cut as ``not significant enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has spent all the money he could possibly spend
and then he had a little left over for a tax cut,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He also used the opportunity to take a dig at his oppponent's
tax plan, which is half the size of his own. ``It confirms my point
that . . . he (Clinton) and John McCain agree on the size of a tax
cut that's not significant enough,'' Bush said.

FORBES, CARDINAL LAW CONFER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes visited
the home of Cardinal Bernard Law Friday for a private meeting with
the spiritual leader of millions of New England Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Although a spokesman for Law said the meeting did not constitute
an endorsement, it was a symbolic coup for Forbes as he courts
religious conservatives on the weekend before the New Hampshire
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Law is a monolithic figure in Boston, but his influence also
extends to New Hampshire, home to an estimated 300,000 Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes's bus caravan rolled up to Law's Brighton residence
Friday afternoon for a meeting that lasted more than an hour out of
public view.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine publisher said afterward that the two men had a
``wide-ranging discussion'' that included the topic of abortion,
which both he and Law vehemently oppose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was certainly one of the highlights of the past year,''
Forbes said. ``It was very moving. He is a remarkable man.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to both men said the visit _ first proposed by Forbes in
April _ was meant to be a casual chat and signified nothing more.
``This is being seen here as a courtesy visit,'' said John Walsh, a
spokesman for the cardinal. ``Nothing should be read into this.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes added that Law expressed no preference among the GOP
candidates and was ``not going to immerse himself in the politics
of the Republican primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Law's audience with Forbes so close to Tuesday's primary
appeared to be a tacit show of support for a candidate who shares
Law's strong conservative views on issues like abortion and
assisted suicide, if not his liberalism on poverty issues.
</P>
<P>
   Law does not endorse candidates, but he has not been shy in the
past about advancing his antiabortion position in the political
arena.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has made abortion a central theme of his campaign, saying
he places an even higher priority on the issue than his 17 percent
flat tax plan.
</P>
<P>
   Before traveling to Boston, Forbes renewed his criticism of
George W. Bush's record as Texas governor. Forbes appeared Friday
with one current and one former Texas education official, arguing
that Bush has presided over five years of declining test scores and
a growing school bureacracy.
</P>
<P>
   The charges amplified a broader assault Forbes made against Bush
during Wednesday night's GOP debate, in which Forbes said Bush had
failed to cut the size of state government and implemented
``phantom'' tax cuts.

out the possibility Thursday night that the Irish Republican Army
will act to meet a Monday deadline for the beginning of guerrilla
disarmament, throwing the future of the fragile Northern Ireland
peace settlement into turmoil. Failure to make progress on the
vexed issue of disarmament by Monday could bring the eight-week-old
power-sharing government in Belfast to a halt and lead to Britain's
reimposing direct rule of the conflicted province from London. By

BRUINS' PLAY MAKING OWNER JACOBS UNHAPPY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerry Jacobs is not a happy owner these days. ``I'm very
concerned about the way we have played this year,'' said Jacobs,
who is approaching his 25th year as Bruins owner and seldom, if
ever, has discussed the performance of his team during the season.
He was recently named by The Hockey News as the fourth-most
powerful person in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the players are better than they have played,'' said
Jacobs. ``I think our team has been managed well by Harry (Sinden)
and Mike (O'Connell), but our coaching has not been what I think it
should be. I think our coaches need to do a better job. I don't
feel our fans are getting what they deserve. They should be getting
better than what we've done.
</P>
<P>
   ``As just one example, I don't see how last year we had one of
the best penalty-killing teams in the league, and this year we have
one of the worst. It doesn't make any sense to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important year for our franchise. We have two
new teams coming into the league, and we are faced with another
expansion draft. We are going to have to lose some of our players,
so we're going to have to know for sure what our players are
capable of doing and not doing, before we get to the point where we
have to put them on a protected list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly feel we have to get this thing turned around
before the season is over. There is no reason in my mind that we
shouldn't be playing better than we have. Our players are better
than our record.''

   The Patriots will pursue former Steeler player personnel
director Tom Donahoe as their general manager. Bob Kraft was very
impressed with Donahoe during their conversations prior to the
hiring of Bill Belichick as head coach. Once the Belichick hiring
became a possibility, Kraft focused on that.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few days, he will return to talking with Donahoe
about coming to New England. Several things would have to happen
before that could happen. First, Belichick and Donahoe would both
have to want it. Second, Donahoe already has a chance to have a top
front office job in Miami with his old friend Dave Wannstedt, now
the head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Wannstedt last week reportedly told Donahoe that he could come
to the Dolphins and have most of the authority of a general
manager, except for the final decision on football matters, which
owner Wayne Huizenga gave to Wannstedt. Donahoe has told friends he
doesn't know for sure whether he wants to stay in football, or look
for some other work in his hometown of Pittsburgh.

</P>
<P>
   There were two different reactions from the Super Bowl coaches
here Friday, when asked what they thought about New England giving
up draft choices to get Belichick:
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's Jeff Fisher: ``I believe that is an awful lot to
give. It is hard to put it into another perspective. We have got
some No. 1 draft choices on our football team that have contributed
to us being where we are. Steve McNair, Eddie George, or Jevon
Kearse, they're important to our success this season. More
important reason for our success than me is hard to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Vermeil. ``I think it is a small price to pay for the right
guy. I would give up two first-round picks to have Bill Parcells
coach my football team. To me there has been a ton of first-round
pick flops.''

   The Red Sox are off to an incredible start selling tickets for
the 2000 season. In the first 24 hours tickets were on sale, the
Sox sold out 10 games. Those include all seven Yankees games at
Fenway Park, games against the Mets and Braves, and the home opener
against the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine selling out a Twins game in one day? The Red Sox have
never sold out even one game on the first day of sales, and there
are two reasons: the way the team played last year, and the various
ways (electronic and otherwise) fans can buy tickets. Fans don't
have to deal directly with anyone in the Red Sox ticketing
department.

   Jerry Seeman, chief of NFL game officials, says that his replay
officials have absolutely made the right calls on the two most
controversial plays in the playoffs. The first was the lateral at
the end of the Tennessee-Buffalo game that allowed the Titans to
eliminate the Bills, and the second was the controversial pass by
Tampa Bay's Shaun King in the final drive of the NFC Championship
Game that was ruled an incompletion.
</P>
<P>
   Said Seeman, ``In the Tennessee game, we looked at the film from
every angle; slowed it down; stopped it; frame by frame; and in our
opinion, the lateral (by Titans' Frank Wycheck) to the receiver
(Kevin Dyson) was on a straight line across the field and therefore
it was a legal lateral by our rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tampa play against St. Louis, the ball touched the ground,
and when that happens, there is no catch. I kept trying to tell the
announcers (doing the game on Fox), and they wouldn't listen. Both
plays, our crews made the right call, which again shows how
valuable replay can be when it is used in the right way.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Rams linebacker Todd Collins, who played for both Bill Parcells
and Pete Carroll in New England: ``With Bill, everything was about
winning. The pressure was on the players at all times. He didn't
leave it up to the players to get themselves ready to play. He made
sure we were ready to play. Pete had a different way of doing
things. He thought the players would do a lot of little things
themselves to get ready. He thought he could treat a lot of guys
like men, guys who would act like pros, but he didn't realize that
we had too many players that couldn't be trusted to do it on their
own. Pete tried to change and be tougher about it, but it just
didn't work. The players knew Pete wasn't really like that, so that
didn't work, either. The players liked him, and thought he could
coach, but he just couldn't get everybody on the same page.''

   The previous note falls in line with this one, coming from a
Philadelphia Eagles source. After the Patriots were humiliated in
Philly, 24-9, by the lowly Eagles in the 14th game of the season,
defensive end Willie McGinest reportedly ripped into his teammates,
blasting some of them in the locker room behind closed doors.
According to the source, McGinest surprised even the Philadelphia
locker room attendants when he tore into his teammates for being
out in the city the night before the game and not getting ready to
play the way they should have. McGinest could talk, because he had
an excellent season.

   Word from someone close to Dan Marino is that the Dolphins are
``gently'' suggesting that he retire. ``They say that Dan can come
back and play next year, but they also ask at the same time why
would he want to do it,'' said the Marino friend, who thinks the
quarterback will decide to retire in the next couple of weeks.
There has been talk that Marino might ask to be released or traded
to the Tampa Bay Bucs, where he could take one final shot at
winning a Super Bowl next year. Tampa Bay looks like a team just a
quarterback away from winning the Super Bowl, and the Bucs'
offensive coordinator is Mike Shula, Don's son, who is very
friendly with Marino. Along the same track, there is talk that
Steve Young would like to get away from the 49ers and take one last
ride with the Denver Broncos. With Terrell Davis returning from
injuries, the Broncos, with Young at quarterback, could make a
strong run at another championship. Broncos head coach Mike
Shanahan was the offensive coordinator in San Francisco when Young
won the Super Bowl . . . Peter Giunta, the Rams defensive
coordinator out of Salem, Mass., and Northeastern University, says
the No. 1 job of the St. Louis defensive unit is ``to tackle Steve
McNair. The first time we played them (a 24-21 Titans victory in
Tennessee the seventh game of the season), he made some big plays
against us in the running game, just like he did against
Jascksonville last week. He is a tough guy to bring down because he
is so big (240 pounds). We are going to have something in every
defense we call prepared for his running, and we've told our
players to tackle him low. You can't bring him down high.''

COMMENTARY: THE COURT SEES REALITY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the struggle to stop the corrupting flood of big money into
our politics, the Republicans who oppose reform have relied on a
constitutional argument. The First Amendment bars any limits on
campaign financing, they say: political money is speech!
</P>
<P>
   There is a curiosity about that argument. In it conservatives
take the legally radical position that the First Amendment's
protection of speech is absolute. That is what Justice Hugo Black
used to say, arguing for example that all libel suits were barred
by the Constitution. But the Supreme Court has never agreed.
</P>
<P>
   This week the court made clear that such absolutes do not
control the issue of campaign finance. By a majority of 6-3, the
justices upheld a Missouri law putting tight limits on
contributions to candidates for state office.
</P>
<P>
   The justices did more than decide the Missouri case. In a set of
exceptionally interesting opinions, expressing diverse views, they
illuminated the problem of money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, in Buckley vs. Valeo, the court upheld a limit of
$1,000 on contributions to federal candidates _ but held
unconstitutional, as a restriction on speech, limits on campaign
spending. The contribution-spending distinction drawn then has been
overwhelmed in practice, by huge contributions of uncontrolled
``soft money'' to parties, which then use it on behalf of
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain has infuriated his fellow Republicans by
pushing legislation to close the soft-money loophole. The leading
opponent of reform, Sen. Mitch McConnell, argues heatedly that a
restriction of those contributions would violate the First
Amendment. His absolutist argument calls for overruling the Buckley
case too, allowing unlimited contributions to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion of the court in the Missouri case, by Justice David
Souter, did not re-examine the Buckley decision. It left intact the
rule that a limit on contributions to candidates does not violate
the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen Breyer, in a concurring opinion signed also by
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, said speech was not the only concern
in the campaign finance cases. There was a competing value at stake
_ the integrity of the electoral process _ that had to be weighed
in the constitutional balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislature understands the problem ... better than we
do,'' Breyer wrote. ``We should defer to its political judgment
that unlimited spending threatens the integrity of the electoral
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony Kennedy, dissenting, wrote powerfully about the
realities of what has happened since the Buckley case. The result,
he said, is ``covert speech'' that ``mocks the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Buckley has not worked,'' Kennedy said. The obscurities of
campaign finance have added to voter ``disaffection and distrust.''
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to hold the contribution limit unconstitutional,
overruling the Buckley decision. But he left open the possibility
that Congress could devise a constitutional system of ``some limits
on both expenditures and contributions, thus permitting
officeholders to concentrate their time and efforts on official
duties rather than on fund raising.''
</P>
<P>
   Only an opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice
Antonin Scalia, took the absolutist position: no limits of any kind
in campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   No one parsing the opinions in the Missouri case can be sure
what the Supreme Court would decide if legislation putting real
limits on all aspects of campaign finance were presented to it. But
in all but the Thomas opinion, one can sense a mood.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court is aware of realities now. It is not in a
First Amendment ivory tower, indifferent to the consequences of
absolutism.
</P>
<P>
   That approach undermines the arguments of McConnell. Of course
his talk about the First Amendment is really a makeweight. His true
interest is to have the rich keep pouring money in and have the
Republicans get most of it. But it matters to get the
constitutional issues straight.
</P>
<P>
   The equation of campaign spending with speech has always been
too simple. When the Buckley case was decided, the revered
constitutional law teacher Paul A. Freund said: ``They say that
money talks. I thought that was the problem, not the solution.''

FELLOW OFFICERS MISTAKENLY SHOOT, KILL OFF-DUTY PATROLMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ An off-duty Providence patrolman, the son of
the city's highest-ranking black police officer, was fatally shot
early Friday by two fellow officers who mistook him for a suspect
in a fight outside an all-night restaurant, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Cornel Young Jr., 29, had rushed outside the restaurant with his
firearm to assist the officers, who were confronting another armed
man involved in an argument between two women, Police Chief Urbano
Prignano Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   Young, dressed in plain clothes, was shot when he did not
respond to the officers' commands to drop his firearm, Prignano
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears at this point that Officer Young did not realize
that the officers did not recognize him and were ordering him to
drop his firearm,'' said Prignano, who called Young's decision to
help the officers ``an act of heroism.''
</P>
<P>
   The shooting raised questions from minority activists and
Young's friends about whether racial profiling, the practice of
assigning more criminal suspicion to a person because of race,
played a role in his death,
</P>
<P>
   The other armed man, Aldrin Diaz, 30, of Providence, is being
charged with murder, even though he dropped his weapon when ordered
by police.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz is being charged under a felony murder statute which states
that anyone committing a crime during which a person is killed is
responsible for the person's death. The underlying felony in Diaz's
case is assault with a deadly weapon: brandishing a gun during the
fight outside the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to point out that the responsibility for this
tragic incident lies with the suspect, Aldrin Diaz, who introduced
the use of a firearm into this disturbance,'' Prignano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is one of the saddest days in the history of the
Providence Police Department,'' the chief said.
</P>
<P>
   Police declined to release the identities or races of the
officers who fired on Young.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Young tried to identify himself as a
police officer to the officers who shot him.
</P>
<P>
   Young is the son of Major Cornel Young Sr., commander of the
community police division and the highest-ranking black officer in
department history. The elder Young, during a gathering in a South
Providence church Friday, urged calm among a minority population
that has clashed with police recently over allegations of racial
profiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now Cornel Senior just wants to know what happened, he
just doesn't believe it,'' said state Representative Joseph
Almeida, a former Providence police officer who visited with the
Youngs hours after their son died. ``He wants to know why.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the victim and minority activists said they believe
race might have prompted police to shoot quickly. The identities of
the two officers who shot Young were not released Friday, but Mayor
Vincent ``Buddy'' Cianci Jr. said one of them has been on the force
only for a short time.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island Attorney General Sheldon Whitehouse will
investigate the shooting. The NAACP in Providence and other civil
rights groups in the city are asking for the US Justice Department
to conduct an independent investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is terrible. It's senseless. It's something that
shouldn't have happened,'' said Thomas Horton, a friend of Young's
since childhood. ``I think it's more race-motivated than anything
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Cianci cautioned against quick characterizations of the shooting
as racially linked. ``I don't think there were any racial overtones
that I can see at this particular time,'' the mayor said. ``The
tragedy is we have two officers who certainly in my opinion didn't
intentionally mean to kill a brother officer.''
</P>
<P>
   The shooting happened about 1:40 a.m. outside Fidas restaurant,
a small, popular destination near the Federal Hill neighborhood for
young people leaving nearby nightclubs after closing.
</P>
<P>
   Police said that a fight broke out inside the restaurant between
two women, one of whom broke a glass and tried to slash the other.
An employee called police as the manager began clearing the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The fracas continued in Fidas's small parking lot. where Christa
Calder, 27, of Gray, Maine, began screaming to Diaz to ``get the
gun,'' Prignano said.
</P>
<P>
   Two uniformed officers soon arrived at the scene, where they
were confronted by Diaz, who was brandishing a gun. The police drew
their service pistols and ordered Diaz to drop his weapon.
</P>
<P>
   At this time, Prignano said, Young ran from inside the
restaurant to assist his fellow officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two officers did not recognize Officer Young as a police
officer and, as the first suspect dropped his gun, they ordered
Officer Young to drop his gun.'' the police chief said.
</P>
<P>
   When Young did not respond, Prignano added, ``the two officers
fired at Officer Young, believing he was a second suspect with a
firearm about to open fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Young was pronounced dead at Rhode Island Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz was ordered held without bail following an arraignment
Friday. Wearing a green-striped sweatshirt at District Court, Diaz
was charged with murder with a deadly weapon, violent assault with
a deadly weapon, and carrying a .22-caliber gun without a license.
Judge Madeline Quirk granted the state's request to hold Diaz
without bail.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz also was found to be in violation of probation on previous
charges of escape and larceny of a motor vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be Mr. Diaz's position he was not committing a
felony, and he was not the person who pulled the trigger, or the
person who caused the trigger to be pulled,'' said his attorney,
public defender Christopher Millea.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect's mother, Paula Diaz, lashed out at police when she
learned from reporters that her son had been charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He dropped his gun, so why is he being charged with murder,''
Diaz said. ``The police are trying to cover up themselves. Where's
the man who did it?''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz said her son has four children, up to 10 years old, and
that he supports himself by repairing cars and doing odd jobs. She
acknowledged that he had a criminal past, including car thefts, but
that he now seemed determined to better himself.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, black officers in several cities, including New
York, Washington and Ventura, Ca., have been shot and killed by
other officers who thought they were suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting of Young mirrors the case of Boston police Officer
Michael Cox, who was beaten in 1995 by fellow officers who mistook
him for a suspect. Four officers lost their badges in the incident
but no one has been criminally charged with beating Cox, who has
settled a federal lawsuit against the police department for about
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, officials said that the federal statute of
limitations has run out on any possible criminal charges connected
to the beating.

   Steve Forbes is shy. Al Gore is homey. Alan Keyes is placid,
nothing like the wired moralist he becomes in front of a camera.
John McCain is a cutup. George W. Bush is charismatic. Gary Bauer,
what you see is what you get. And Bill Bradley, well, he's always
being briefed when his nose is being powdered.
</P>
<P>
   Under the near-constant glare of TV lights, the candidates are
running to Soterion to have their faces done. The 35-year-old
mother of three from Bedford has been so busy over the last week
that she went 46 hours without any sleep.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, she worked all day _ her other clients include CNN,
NBC, and WMUR-TV _ where she hosts and produces her own beauty show
_ and then met Bush at 2:30 a.m. at the Manchester airport.
Soterion had to work on Gore at the airport two hours later after
he flew in from the Iowa caucuses. Then she went straight to CNN's
studio, set up in the Amoskeag mill, and powdered pundits until 11
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   That's where she was Thursday, dabbing foundation on political
analyst Jeff Greenfield, who was about to go on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a coronary bypass, unpleasant but necessary,''
Greenfield said about the experience while sitting in a high chair
with a plastic smock draped over his dark suit. ``The lights and
the camera so exaggerate what's there. . . . This will be vaguely
beige instead of death pallor.''
</P>
<P>
   In a couple of minutes Soterion was done. She whisked off the
smock, and de-linted his suit, sending him into the studio before
seizing the chair for herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God, I'm so tired,'' Soterion said, adding that she
sleeps with her cell phone. In her spare time, she is writing a
book, getting a master's degree, setting up a Web site, and selling
her own line of makeup.
</P>
<P>
   Her break into the business came in 1992 from Patrick J.
Buchanan, whose campaign headquarters was next door to her
husband's business. Working with him led her to other candidates,
including Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one Clinton story from that year she will tell:
``He had me booked to do his makeup. He didn't show. There's a
no-show fee that never got paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Soterion, a former Miss New Hampshire, has a degree in
international marketing from a college in London, where she became
interested in cosmetology while modeling. She expects to make about
$30,000 during the last 10 days before the primary and has been
nominated for businesswoman of the year by the Business
Professional Women's Association of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   And she enjoys her work, especially being able to see the
campaign from the inside out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not voting on the issues,'' she added. ``It has more to do
with the spirit of the man.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she is changing her registration from Republican to
independent to give her more flexibility, and said she will judge
the candidates on ``how they handle stress, how they manage people
around them, and how they treat me.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one candidate who has never looked her in the eye,
although she declined to name him.
</P>
<P>
   She has not worked with Bradley much, so she does not have much
to say about him. Forbes, she says, is underestimated by the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the most humble person I think I have ever met in my
entire life,'' she said. ``He asks you how your chicken was at
dinner last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is more relaxed than he appears in public.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday night's debate with Bradley, Gore looked at
Soterion and said, ``Oh, Kriss, I'm so nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   As for McCain, ``I think he's hysterical . . . behind the
scenes, he's exactly what you see. He's fun-loving.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer is ``very, very level,'' and Keyes, she said lowering her
voice, ``exudes peace.''

BRADLEY SAYS HEART ACTED UP AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, N.H. _ He has $20 million to spend, a new fighting
spirit _ and another irregular heartbeat in his immediate past.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley Friday disclosed that he had experienced another
erratic heart rhythm this week, his fifth episode since he sought
medical care in December for an abnormal rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   As his surprised aides looked on, the former New Jersey senator
made the disclosure in response to a reporter's question moments
after his spokesman, Eric Hauser, outlined plans for Bradley to
wage a ``very vibrant campaign'' after Tuesday's New Hampshire
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said the episode lasted about two hours. ``And it
passed,'' he said, without need for medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has been diagnosed as having atrial fibrillation, an
irregular beat of the heart's upper chambers. The condition is
common, affecting at least 2 million Americans, and is not life
threatening.
</P>
<P>
   But the timing of the disclosure is inopportune for Bradley, who
spent several days last week in Iowa dealing with distracting
questions after he acknowledged that he had experienced four
episodes of abnormal rhythms since December. None of those required
medical care.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston Globe/WBZ poll based on sampling from Wednesday and
Thursday found that 85 percent of likely Democratic voters in the
New Hampshire primary are aware of Bradley's heart condition.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen percent said that what they knew about Bradley's heart
difficulties would make it less likely they would vote for him.
Three percent said they would be more likely to vote for him, and
the great majority, 74 percent, said it would have no impact.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley can ill afford a 15 &UR;  &LR; percent drag in a close race
against Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said last week that he believed he had no obligation to
discuss his erratic heart rhythms if they did not require medical
care. His aides said they learned about the latest episode only
when they heard him respond to a reporter's question after a town
meeting in the historic Newport Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   When Bradley's aides asked him exactly when the episode
occurred, he could not be more specific than Sunday or Monday. The
incident was so minor, Hauser said, that ``he forgot about it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Bradley was ending a whirlwind, four-day bus tour of
Iowa before Monday's caucuses. He also interrupted his campaign to
fly across the state and attend a memorial service for John
Chrystal, a top campaign aide who died last week.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Bradley was on the go for nearly 20 hours,
beginning with interviews in the morning, a concession speech late
that night, then an early-morning flight on Tuesday from Des Moines
to Manchester, N.H. There, he spoke to a rally of about campaign
workers at 3:30 a.m. and arrived at his hotel in Nashua about 4
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   After about three hours of sleep, Bradley spoke Tuesday morning
at Alvirne High School in Hudson. But he was criticized for not
matching Gore, who was on the stump before dawn that day after an
hour's sleep.

 &HT;    Bonfire design contributed heavily to collapse, engineers say
 &HT;    By Mike Ward and Suzanne Gamboa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ The Aggie bonfire grew increasingly
unstable as it evolved from a teepee-style arrangement of logs into
a wedding cake-like structure, engineering professors here say.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers believed the dramatic quickening of the bonfire's
collapse in recent years after being ignited _ within five minutes
in 1990 _ signaled its instability, Texas A&AMP;M University records
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first ones that did that were kind of terrifying, and
that's what caused some concern among us,'' said T.J. Hirsch,
professor emeritus of civil engineering, who alerted the university
to design flaws.
</P>
<P>
   But university officials didn't act on suggestions, made as
early as 1994, to change the design, Hirsch said. Other professors
say the university's reaction _ deflecting responsibility to the
students _ discouraged them from speaking up about their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bonfire is operated, run and constructed by students,''
university spokesman Lane Stephenson reiterated Friday. He
acknowledged that the university has interceded in the past on
safety issues such as the bonfire's height and alcohol consumption.
But he would not say how the university responded to Hirsch's
design concerns.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 18, those concerns became a tragic reality when the
bonfire collapsed, killing 12 students and injuring another 27.
</P>
<P>
   And now an investigating committee looking into the cause of
that collapse is posing the same question Hirsch did years ago: How
safe was the bonfire's design?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I received the call at 5:45 in the morning, I was shocked
like everybody else _ and angry at myself,'' Hirsch said. ``I
didn't anticipate that bad of a collapse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking weeks of silence on the details of his concerns, Hirsch
said in an interview with the Austin American-Statesman that the
university left it up to students to decide whether to take his
advice on how to make the bonfire sturdier.
</P>
<P>
   EVOLUTION OF BONFIRE
</P>
<P>
   According to A&AMP;M legend, the first bonfire was built in 1909 _ a
pile of trash and junk hastily thrown together late one night by
the Corps of Cadets in a spontaneous pep rally during the fall
football season.
</P>
<P>
   As the bonfire's importance in Aggie tradition grew, so did the
log pile's height, reaching as much as 109 feet, 10 inches in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943, the first all-log bonfire was built from dozens of long
tree trunks stacked into a pile that looked like a teepee. Three
years later, in 1946, a wooden center pole was added to help
stabilize the stack of logs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tradition that each year the bonfire has to be bigger
and better,'' The Houston Post noted in a 1958 story. And if that
was the case, the race was on.
</P>
<P>
   As the bonfire's height climbed, subtle changes in the way the
log stack was built also took place. The teepee now looked more
like a wedding cake with logs stacked in tiers _ first two, then
four, then six.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was studying the construction (of years of bonfires), and I
was sure the stack was unstable,'' said Hirsch.
</P>
<P>
   John Weese, a regents professor and A&AMP;M's engineering
accreditation coordinator who is the liaison between the university
and an independent commission probing the collapse, said while
investigators are scrutinizing the change in design, he wouldn't
jump to any conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of many factors they are considering,'' he said.
``It's too early to speculate.''
</P>
<P>
   If the design change was a time bomb waiting to explode, as
records and experts suggest, it had been ticking for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``These six layers, the logs are almost vertical,'' Hirsch said.
``That's where they become unstable. They are a stack of logs on
top of logs.''
</P>
<P>
   Once ignited, the bonfires were collapsing more quickly. Hirsch,
who watched bonfire construction for 43 years, said that was a sign
of its instability.
</P>
<P>
   The teepee-style pyres burned for hours _ giving rise to the A&AMP;M
legend that if the center pole stood past midnight, A&AMP;M would beat
the University of Texas in their annual Thanksgiving football game.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M files bolster Hirsch's assertion. The center pole fell after
45 minutes in 1986, after 20 minutes in 1987 _ and after five to
six minutes in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   UNHEEDED WARNINGS
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch is not the only faculty member who has linked the quick
collapse of the bonfire with the instability of its design. The day
after last year's tragic collapse, Loren Lutes, associate head of
civil engineering, raised the issue again in an e-mail to A&AMP;M
President Ray Bowen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the basic problem is that the design is only
marginally stable,'' Lutes wrote. ``As evidence of instability, I
point out the fact that the stack has fallen very quickly in recent
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch's and others' concerns were partially confirmed in 1994.
With only four tiers of the bonfire built, it tilted suddenly and
began to fall over. Photos seem to show that the sides of the
bonfire that year were more vertical than in past years.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported. And the student crews who had
scrambled out of harm's way rebuilt the bonfire in four days. The
center pole collapsed 40 minutes after it was lit that year.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by the near-collapse in 1994, Hirsch said, he warned Dr.
Malon Southerland, A&AMP;M's vice president for student affairs and a
bonfire adviser during the 1960s and early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch said Southerland referred him to Zach Coapland, then
chairman of the student bonfire committee. Hirsch said that led to
a meeting in late 1994 or early 1995 with Coapland and a group of
``redpots'' _ the student construction bosses at bonfire _ when
Hirsch said he warned that the wedding-cake design combined with
the bonfire's excess height were dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Go back to the teepee-style of construction, Hirsch said he told
the group. And use a concrete or more fire-resistant center pole to
keep the flaming bonfire from collapsing so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   ``Zach Coapland said this was a student project and they are
going to get together and decide what to do _ and that was it,''
Hirsch said. ``No decision was made, and because it was a student
project, I accepted it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coapland, now the associate dean of students at the University
of Houston, and David Zuehlke, a chief redpot in 1994, said they do
not recall any such warning from Hirsch or a meeting with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little surprised there were reports of all these
engineering professors coming forward,'' said Zuehkle, reached at
his home in Georgia. ``I never saw a draft or anything to change
the design.''
</P>
<P>
   Southerland declined comment Friday. But in a press briefing two
weeks ago, he said he did not recall the conversation with Hirsch.
</P>
<P>
   THE WORLD LEARNS
</P>
<P>
   While other engineering professors apparently had similar
concerns, documents show, they did not pursue them. Lutes explained
why in his e-mail: Hirsch ``was unquestionably the most respected
structural engineer when I came here in 1988. Many structural
engineering faculty are well aware of (Hirsch's) unsuccessful
attempt to have the design of the stack altered. I think there has
been a widespread feeling that if he couldn't do it, then none of
the rest of us had a chance of having an effect.''
</P>
<P>
   If any of Hirsch's advice was heeded and changes were made to
the design, photos of bonfires after that year don't show them. The
wedding-cake style has continued.
</P>
<P>
   Records indicate that from 1995 to 1998, the bonfire was most
likely built within the 55-foot height limit. But last year, at the
time of its collapse, the bonfire was above that limit _ and headed
for 75 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of the collapse, top A&AMP;M officials accompanied
Hirsch to the accident site to examine the splintered center pole
and other debris. He also surrendered copies of his notes, sketches
and written observations to A&AMP;M lawyers and volunteered to assist
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he said he was still awaiting a call from the
commission investigating the bonfire collapse.
</P>
<P>
   In e-mails made public in recent days, several engineering
faculty members have seemed to agree with Hirsch's earlier
concerns. The messages were made public in response to a request
filed by the American-Statesman under Texas' open records law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noted that some logs were stacked butt end up; I presume
this may have been done to offset the taper of the logs and make
the stack more vertical,'' said Ray James, an A&AMP;M research
engineer. ``But it is a factor in the stability of the stack.''
</P>
<P>
   In a message two days after the collapse, Richard Bartoskewitz,
A&AMP;M's senior academic adviser in civil engineering, credited Hirsch
with sounding the alarm _ although unsuccessfully _ after the 1994
near-collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The center pole that supposedly supports the bonfire is no
match for several tons of logs. The problem is that the logs are
placed vertically, one on top of another. All are the same length.
There is really nothing to prevent them from tipping over except
friction along the sides of the logs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh sure, they wire the logs together,'' Bartoskewitz
concluded. ``But at 2:28 a.m. on Thursday, 18 November, the world
learned how effective that bailing wire is.''

 &HT;    Coke aims for more streamlined operations
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In his 30-year career at Coca-Cola, Doug Daft said he
had never stood at a podium to address a group of
information-starved Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel nervous, which I thought I would,'' said Daft,
the company's new president and chairman-designate. ``I believe
strongly in what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In a packed room of 200 analysts at the Essex House across from
Central Park, Daft tried to paint a clearer picture of the new
Coke.
</P>
<P>
   The company, he said, will be more decentralized, efficient and
profitable because more decisions will be made by executives around
the globe instead of at headquarters in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were making too many decisions here for Shanghai,'' Daft
said. ``The company has to think local and act local. I didn't say
global. No one drinks globally.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, he said, too many decisions had to be checked off
in Atlanta, where precious time was lost. Now, more responsibility
and accountability would be in the hands of local executives around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize the importance of this move, Daft said the company
would be changing its compensation package to encourage
risk-taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will reward bright decisions,'' he said. And, he added,
there will be consequences ``for dumb decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Also as part of this decentralization plan, the company is
establishing research and development centers on four continents,
although Daft did not identify them. The centers will come up with
product and brand innovations for their areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time around, new Coke sounds like a positive
development,'' said John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage
Digest.
</P>
<P>
   During the two-hour session with analysts, Daft was joined by
Jack Stahl, who becomes president and chief operating officer after
Daft assumes the titles of chairman and chief executive in April.
He was also joined by James Chestnut, executive vice president of
operations support.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the three fielded questions on a number of financial
topics, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Growth targets. The goal of growing earnings per share an
average 17 percent to 18 percent may be ``a tad high,'' Daft said.
He said the target may be lowered to the ``mid-teens.''
</P>
<P>
   Daft also said the company's current goal of 7 percent to 8
percent volume growth also could be lowered by a percentage point
or two. This year, the company expects case sales to grow by 5
percent to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inventories. Earlier this week, the company unexpectedly
announced its earnings will be reduced in the first half of this
year because Coke will be shipping less concentrate to bottlers,
which are reducing their inventories.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Chestnut explained that the lower inventories are the
result of technological advances and improved logistics that have
reduced the time needed to ship concentrates. As a result, bottlers
don't have to carry as much inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut denied speculation that Coca-Cola had inflated sales by
shipping more concentrate than bottlers needed.
</P>
<P>
   _ India. The company may write down the value of its bottling
assets there this year because of excess capacity. Chestnut,
however, did not elaborate on the amount of the potential charge
against earnings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dr. Pepper. Outside the United States, the company wants to
make Dr. Pepper one of its key global brands. Coca-Cola acquired
the rights to Dr. Pepper last year in its acquisition of Cadbury
Schweppes' brands in 161 nations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shareholders. The company will consider increasing its
dividends and restarting a share buyback program this year,
Chestnut said.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Bill Pecoriello, an analyst with Sanford
Bernstein &AMP; Co., said he thinks the company is on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short-term, there will be some uncertainty. But long-term, it
will payoff,'' Pecoriello said.

TIME SHARES BUTTON UP AND DITCH THE CHAINS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Fla., Vt. Pa., Colo., Ind., Ga., La., Calif., Mass. N.Y.)  (jw) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMUGGLERS' NOTCH, Vt. _ Peter and Anita Gerner had stayed twice
before at this ski resort nestled in northern Vermont, both times
flirting with the idea of buying a time share.
</P>
<P>
   But when they came again this winter, with their four young
children, they decided it was time to make their move. Two days
before returning home to West Roxbury, Mass., the Gerners signed a
contract to pay $36,000 for part ownership of a large one-bedroom
condominium.
</P>
<P>
   The deal guarantees them two weeks' occupancy every year,
forever _ as long as they pay the $360 annual fee for each week.
Since one week is always in February (the other rotates throughout
the year), the Austrian-born Gerners can normally count on enough
natural snow at least one week to indulge their passion for skiing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids love it,'' Mrs. Gerner said. ``And they're at the age
where we can all come up together for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 2 million Americans have bought time shares since the
concept was imported from Europe in the early 1970s, according to
the American Resort Development Association, a trade group. Time
shares boomed in the '90s, vaulting the industry from a modest $300
million business in 1978 _ when it was plagued by what Malcolm
Noden of the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University
called the high-pressure ``silk shirt, gold chain crowd'' _ to an
estimated $3.5 billion industry in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   That is up from $3.1 billion in 1998, and the number of weeks
sold last year is estimated to have reached a record 318,000, up 8
percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That growth is coming not just from time shares bought by
families, but also those bought by couples and singles (who last
year accounted for almost 14 percent of purchases). Now that the
old two-week vacation has metamorphosed into a series of three-,
four- or seven-day getaways, the time share is increasingly
regarded as a good alternative to a vacation home or rental.
</P>
<P>
   While there is still occasional fraud or mismanagement, it has
clearly helped that the industry is plagued by far less of this.
``The minute Marriott, Hilton, Disney and the other big names came
in,'' Noden said, ``they brought a whole new image and way of doing
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that image-building involved substituting ``vacation
club,'' ``second home experience'' and the like for ``time share,''
which conjures images of predatory salesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Well into the mid-1980s, many time shares were little more than
apartments cobbled out of the remains of condominiums and hotels
that had gone belly up.
</P>
<P>
   Today most time share properties are built from the ground up,
often in clusters of no more than 25 units. They are available in
many sizes, configurations and price ranges, and decked out with
workout rooms, whirlpools, saunas and fireplaces, as well as the
usual pools, tennis courts and nearby golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   Some really go all out. The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co.'s time shares
under construction in Aspen, Colo., and St. Thomas in the British
West Indies, which will sell for $85,000 to $355,000, plus annual
dues, for a minimum three-week slot, will include maid service,
child care, concierges, catered meals and valet.
</P>
<P>
   Marriott International, which owns Ritz-Carlton, is also
building units elsewhere that will sell for $9,000 to $13,000 _ in
line with the national average.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has undergone considerable consolidation in the
last several year: Starwood Hotels and Resorts last year paid
$403.9 million for Vistana, a leading time share company, and this
week Carnival, the cruise ship company, agreed to buy Fairfield
Communities. Some relatively obscure companies continue to garner
sizable sales, including Sunterra Resorts, CFI Westgate and
Silverleaf Resorts. But ``the hotel companies seem to be gaining
market share at the expense of the independents,'' said Mark
Mutkoski, a managing director at Deutsche Banc Alex Brown.
</P>
<P>
   It was the hotel companies _ also including Hyatt, Four Seasons
Hotels and Resorts, Ramada, Promus Hotel and Radisson, a unit of
Carlson _ that helped jump-start the industry by instilling new
confidence in it. That induced lenders to open their purse strings,
and the hotel companies' adherence to strict standards helped
hasten long-overdue innovations.
</P>
<P>
   Although time-share buyers can take out a mortgage, few bother.
Instead, most take out a home equity loan, pay by credit card or
put an average of 11 percent down and pay the rest in installments.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, one drawback was that buyers were locked into
spending vacations in the same place year after year. But now many
buyers split their week into two-, three- or four-day pieces. They
can carry over unused days into another year. They can trade
land-based time shares for a vacation on cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   And in most states they have a grace period in which to cancel
the original contract. After Pennsylvania adopted a law in 1990
providing a five-day right of cancellation, ``we saw a dramatic
drop in the number of problems,'' said E. Barry Creany, a senior
deputy attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   But a big saving grace for the industry sprang from the
foresight of Jon and Christel DeHaan, who established Resort
Condominiums International in 1974 on their kitchen table in
Indianapolis. Their inspiration was to set up an exchange program
in which, for a modest fee, time share owners could swap their week
in, say, Orlando, for a week in Hawaii or Colorado, France or
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   It took a long while for owners to realize there was not a
catch. In its first year, Resort Condominiums recorded a mere 236
exchanges at 35 resorts. But last year its members made almost 2
million swaps at more than 3,500 resorts in about 100 countries.
The cost of swapping is $84 a year ($355 for five years), plus $118
for a domestic exchange, $155 for an international swap. (While the
company, owned by Cendant, is by far the biggest exchange company,
Interval International in Miami also arranges swaps. Interval is
owned by Willis Stein Partners.)

<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you own a time share at the seashore in January,
few people will line up to swap with you. But to appreciate the
impact of swapping, consider Barbara Rainey, a sixth-grade teacher
who lives in Fern Park, Fla. About 16 years ago she bought a
one-bedroom time share in Sky Valley, Ga., a ski resort. But ``I've
only been to Sky Valley once,'' she said, ``because I bought it to
exchange in order to travel.''
</P>
<P>
   Listing herself with Resort Condominiums, she was able to trade
her week for weeks in the Virgin Islands; Cancun, Mexico (twice);
Fort Lauderdale, Bermuda, Key Largo and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people don't like to keep going back to the same place,''
she added, ``but with the exchange arrangement you don't have to.
Besides, owning a time share forces me to take a vacation, and for
that I'm very grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Or consider S.M. Chiu of Bala Cynwyd, Pa. Shortly before
retiring from Temple University in 1991, where he was a professor
of Chinese history, he and his wife, Helen, bought a $6,000 time
share at Tanglwood Resort in Hawley, Pa., in the Poconos. Over the
next few years they swapped for weeks in Switzerland, Florida,
California and New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   But after Mrs. Chiu suffered a stroke in 1993, and Chiu had
open-heart surgery the next year, they tried to sell the time share
but were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought time shares were a good deal when they told us we'd
own the unit in perpetuity because we had a deed,'' Chiu said,
``but if you can't sell the unit, you're bound for life to keep
paying the annual fee.''
</P>
<P>
   The amount of that fee, for upkeep, insurance and management,
which ranges widely depending on size and location, averaged $360
nationally in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   These days the industry largely soft-pedals the actual or
supposed financial advantages conferred by ownership of time
shares, preferring instead to stress the ``vacation experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't buy the idea that you really save a lot of money
owning a time share,'' said Dr. Gerner, an anesthesiologist at
Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, during a break in the
30-minute sales presentation here. ``But there's a nice family
atmosphere here, and it isn't as crowded as some other ski resorts
we've been to.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no easy way to compare the cost of vacationing in one's
time share apartment with renting year after year. ``It depends on
the location and amenities, among other things,'' Mutkoski of
Deutsche Banc Alex Brown said. ``But if your calculation is based
strictly on economics, I'd have to say it's probably going to be a
good 10 years or more before you break even with a time share.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat similarly, in deciding whether to rent a unit or sell
it as a time share, analysts say, property owners have to decide
whether they prefer a recurring income stream each year or getting
it up front.
</P>
<P>
   Most time shares are in the Sun Belt, including 24 percent in
Florida, most of them in the Orlando area. A handful of time shares
have even crept into New York, Boston, San Francisco and a few
other big cities, but industry officials say construction and land
costs in urban areas will sharply limit their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Because time shares began in the French Alps in the 1960s, it
should be no surprise that the concept arrived first in America at
ski resorts, in the 1970s. But Smugglers' Notch did not get into
the game until 1983, three years after William Stritzler, a former
AT&AMP;T executive, joined the privately owned resort as managing
director. In 1996 he bought the resort for an undisclosed sum, and
he still takes visible pride in the accolades it regularly receives
in the trade and popular press. Of the 485 condos and town houses
here, 155 are time shares, and new ones continue to go up as demand
dictates.
</P>
<P>
   Additional units are springing up at many other ski resorts from
New England to Colorado, but not just for skiers. Instead of
shutting down after ski season, resorts are adding summer camps for
children and activities for adults. Smugglers' Notch, for example,
has almost 50 summer programs for children 3 to 17, and 40 more for
families or adults. And many of those adults have bought time
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the improvements, it is far too early to confer
sainthood on the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Several ``vacation clubs'' have gone out of business in recent
years, leaving members with nothing to show for their investment.
And last year attorneys general in 14 states and the District of
Columbia filed lawsuits against two Fort Lauderdale companies,
National Travel Services and Plaza Resorts, asserting that they
misled consumers and subjected them to high-pressure sales tactics.
Also named as a defendant was Robin Leach, the host of television
show ``Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan attorney general said Leach endorsed an
``official-looking'' packet of documents mailed to consumers saying
they had won a Florida vacation as well as a cruise to the Bahamas
_ a ``cruise'' that turned out to be a ride on a car ferry.
</P>
<P>
   While a spokesman for Leach said that his client had severed his
ties with the two Florida companies in 1998, Creany of the
Pennsylvania attorney general's office said recently that Leach
remained a defendant, adding that a settlement in the lawsuit was
expected soon.

BRADLEY SPENDING HEAVILY ON TV ADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bill Bradley has made large purchases of advertising
for the final week of campaigning in the New Hampshire presidential
primary, according to figures from the major Boston television
stations.
</P>
<P>
   The former New Jersey senator far outspent Vice President Al
Gore in earlier phases of the race for the Democratic nomination,
shelling out $2.9 million to Gore's $1.7 million for ads on Boston
and New Hampshire stations between Nov. 23 and last week. He had
been spending around $330,000 a week recently to Gore's
approximately $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   But for the last week of the campaign, Bradley has doubled his
spending on advertising, booking $734,520 for 212 minutes of
advertising on Boston stations and 55 minutes on New Hampshire
stations to $499,265 for Gore for 133.5 minutes on Boston and 65.5
minutes on New Hampshire outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesmen last week said they did not plan large increases
in advertising for the final days of the campaign, while Bradley's
declined comment on their plans.
</P>
<P>
   Publisher Steve Forbes, as many anticipated, also has bought in
heavily, after being outspent more than 10 to 1 by his Republican
rivals in earlier phases of the campaign. For the last week, the
three leading Republican candidates are spending almost identical
amounts.
</P>
<P>
   On Boston stations, Forbes is spending $354,225 for 107 minutes,
to $358,750 for 114.5 minutes bought by Texas Gov. George W. Bush
and $346,140 for 97 minutes for Arizona Sen. John McCain. On New
Hampshire stations, Forbes has bought 86 minutes worth $62,988,
Bush 86 minutes for $59,539, and McCain 78.5 minutes for $48,050.
</P>
<P>
   Comparatively small purchases also have been made by Republicans
Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer for the campaign finale. Keyes is paying
$24,794 for 73 minutes in New Hampshire, Bauer $900 for three
minutes. Keyes has not made a recorded purchase on Boston stations,
while Bauer is spending $725 for 0.5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Stations' rates for the ads vary with the size and type of the
audience which will be watching at the specific time of a showing.

JAPAN'S GOVERNMENT TO BORROW FROM BANKS RATHER THAN ISSUE BONDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In a striking demonstration of how precarious Japan's
financial situation has become, the government plans to borrow
money directly from banks to fulfill its obligations to local
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Governments normally borrow money by issuing bonds, which is
cheaper than taking out bank loans. Japan's unorthodox approach to
borrowing now and the size of the shortfall _ 8 trillion yen, or
roughly $76 billion _ have stunned economists and other market
watchers. With one small exception, this is the first time since
after World War II that Japan has taken such a step.
</P>
<P>
   The amount is equivalent to roughly 2 percent of Japan's gross
domestic product, and exceeds the 7.7 trillion yen the government
has injected into troubled banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funding mechanism is breaking down,'' said David Asher, a
research fellow in the Japan Program at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. ``The dam is showing more and more stress fractures,
and they're trying to put plaster on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Concern is rising that Japan is overextending itself. The
government's debts now match the country's GDP and Merrill Lynch is
predicting a rise to 150 percent of GDP in two years.
</P>
<P>
   The skyrocketing debt, justified by politicians as a way to keep
a faltering economic recovery on track, is increasingly a point of
contention within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. But by
sidestepping the traditional reliance on the bond market, where
borrowing is cheaper, the new borrowing has placed a stark new
emphasis on this crushing problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``By not issuing bonds, by taking on an intermediary like a
bank,'' said Jesper Koll, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Japan
and typically upbeat about Japan's prospects, ``you are basically
saying one of two things: Either you don't believe in the
efficiency of the financial markets or you're admitting you have a
credit problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Koll said, the government runs the risk of replicating, on
a smaller scale, the trap that brought many Asian economies to
their knees recently. ``There's a mismatch because they're planning
to borrow one-year loans, but the municipal deficits are not going
away in a year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs, too, that the government may expand its
borrowing from banks, which are healthier than they were two years
ago. A Finance Ministry spokesman said there were plans to cover
shortfalls in another, unnamed ``special account'' this way, though
the amount in question is far smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Smithers, a prominent fund manager, was one of the few
experts who put a positive spin on the plan, saying it would get
more money into circulation, which many economists have advocated
as a way of curing the economy's ills. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because loan demand is low, banks have too much money sitting
idle. ``It's a good measure,'' he said, ``because it further eases
monetary policy and relieves pressure on the bond market, which
will help lower real long-term interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan has been suffering from a classic ``liquidity trap'':
While an exorbitant amount of money is available for lending,
companies and individuals are not borrowing as they are trying to
restructure their activities. Thus, the money is bottled up in the
banks, idle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While most people see the move as a sign of government
desperation, it may also help some banks facing shrinking loan
demand.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Masaaki Kanno, senior economist at J.P. Morgan in Tokyo, is also
unconcerned. ``Japanese commercial banks are the largest buyers of
government bonds,'' he said, ``so there's really no change.''
</P>
<P>
   The government is battling to keep its ballooning deficit in
check in the face of continuing signs that the economy is addicted
to stimulus measures that require more and more debt.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to Parliament on Friday, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
said that reviving the economy would take precedence over paring
the national debt. ``Fiscal reform is important,'' he said, ``but
we cannot commit the mistake of undertaking it while the economy is
not firm and before it is on the path of full-fledged recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet highlighting the discord within the government, Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa bemoaned that the proposed budget would
push government debts to 645 trillion yen, or $6.15 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Economic prospects are not bright. The Japan Center for Research
estimates that GDP fell by 1.6 percent in the latest quarter,
suggesting that the government will have trouble meeting its target
for 0.6 percent growth this year.
</P>
<P>
   Hiroyuki Inoue, the center's senior economist, said the figures
demonstrate that when government public-works outlays end, the
economy falls right back into the doldrums. ``After the effects of
government spending programs faded last summer,'' he said, ``the
economy slipped back to the level it hit in 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   He expects that to change as the latest stimulus package starts
kicking in. But the center's figures still suggest that the economy
is far from able to sustain itself, even though Obuchi promised
Friday that there would be no new spending beyond the record $810.8
billion budget he has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   The Finance Ministry spokesman said the decision to borrow from
banks rather than float bonds was merely an effort to segregate the
funds, which will go into a special account for local governments.
He said it had nothing to do with the government's ability to raise
money, an assertion confirmed by two recent bond auctions.
</P>
<P>
   But that makes the plan even more puzzling. Economists speculate
that the government is wary of issuing more bonds than it has to,
fearful of jeopardizing any recovery by pushing long-term rates
higher. ``They're afraid of upsetting the bond market,'' said
Ronald Bevacqua, senior economist at Commerz Securities in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The government also wants to avoid drawing additional scrutiny
from credit ratings agencies. Many economists say Moody's Investors
Service, which withdrew its triple-A rating of Japan's sovereign
debt last year, is poised to downgrade its assessment even more
later this year. Standard &AMP; Poor's, though, recently reaffirmed its
triple-A rating.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The ministry spokesman said the new plan was nothing more than a
response to the fact that traditional sources of financing have
fallen short. The government has traditionally been able to tap the
253 trillion yen postal savings system, but many 10-year deposits
will mature soon, leading many economists to predict that money
will flow out of the system in search of higher returns. The post
office in Japan is the country's de facto largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman stressed, however, that the outflow should dwindle
after two years, at which point the government might be able to dip
into it again.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Koll noted that the post office took in 1.1 trillion
yen in new deposits in December, suggesting that Japan's
ever-so-cautious investors may prefer earning 0.28 percent over 10
years to risking their life savings in the market.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in tax revenues coupled with a decreasing ability to
tap the postal savings system left the government with a gaping $76
billion hole when it came time to give local governments their
share. ``Can they keep spending money to cover the deficits of the
local governments and in the pension system?'' Asher asked. ``If
the answer is no, there's going to be a crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has resorted to direct borrowing at least once
before, to cover shortfalls in a special account for national
forestry projects. But the account for local government is quite
different, said Kunji Okue, an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort
Benson in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Borrowings for national forestry projects are used to manage
and cultivate national forests and parks and can thus be viewed as
an investment expense,'' Okue wrote in a recent report.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he noted, the amount borrowed for the forestry account was
far smaller. ``This is the first time since the end of World War II
that Japan has undertaken large-scale direct borrowing to cover
recurring expenses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the United States resorted to a similar move was
in 1893, when J.P. Morgan provided gold to help the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   The banks, for their part, are likely to welcome the plan.
Although the Finance Ministry spokesman stressed that terms had not
been set, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading financial
daily, said the government planned to pay 2.1 percent interest _ a
handsome premium to the 1.6 percent the banks could earn buying
government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   James Fiorillo, an analyst at ING Barings in Tokyo, notes that
with deposits rising and loan demand falling, banks are facing
earnings pressure. ``They're in a really bad situation,'' he said.
``Whether by design or by accident, the government's plans will
help banks, particularly regional banks.''

MEMORIES OF SEATTLE PERSIST AT ECONOMIC FORUM IN SWITZERLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mexico, Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland _ World leaders and business executives,
gathered for an annual conference beneath the powdery ski slopes of
this Alpine resort, have their minds fixed on a rainy American port
city 8,000 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The city is Seattle, where protesters battled police and trade
ministers battled one another under storm clouds in December. The
city's name is invoked with such regularity here that its mere
mention conjures up fears of a sustained backlash against
globalization.
</P>
<P>
   The by-invitation-only attendees at the World Economic Forum, an
event that caters to a political and business elite and has long
championed the march of capitalism and Western values around the
world, are treating the surprise collapse of the Seattle talks as
the first real crisis to confront globalization since the fall of
communism. Ernesto Zedillo, president of Mexico, lamented Friday
the sudden emergence of ``globaphobia,'' an international force
that has targeted global integration as the primary cause of
environmental and social problems.
</P>
<P>
   The prime ministers of Britain and Turkey, the head of the World
Trade Organization and the leaders of hedge funds, think tanks and
labor unions echoed that theme in public talks and private
conversations here. Sharing goods and ideas across national
boundaries still makes economic sense, many said, but it has run
into moral and political roadblocks that may prove difficult to
overcome. Politicians said repeatedly that global institutions,
including the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and
the trade organization, are not up to the task and need fundamental
reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no point in pretending that Seattle was not a setback
for free trade,'' said Tony Blair, the British prime minister, in a
speech Friday. ``We have an enormous job to do to convince
opponents, many of whom I think are wrong, that they can live with
globalization.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair proposed that as a first step, leading countries set up a
panel to propose how to overhaul the bureaucracy of the WTO, the
Geneva-based body that regulates international trade. He also urged
that the United States, Japan and Europe drop all remaining
barriers to imports from the poorest countries as a gesture of good
will to the developing world, which was instrumental in derailing
last month's trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also plans to address how to restore
confidence in trade and globalization when he speaks Saturday at
the six-day conference. Clinton, who will fly into Davos for a
half-day visit, is seeking to recover a reputation as an ardent
free-trader. Some fellow world leaders blamed Clinton's
administration for failing to contain demonstrators in Seattle and
frightening developing nations with his call to impose tougher
labor standards.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders are grappling with the reality that in recent
months, popular impressions of globalization seem to have shifted.
It is now seen less as spreading prosperity around the world and
more as the conduit for a long list of ills. Among the many
problems cited: Growing inequality between rich and poor people and
rich and poor nations; the failure of law and ethics to keep pace
with advances in science; environmental pollution, and the rapid
spread of financial instability from one country to another.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this reflects the views of diverse protesters who
converged on Seattle. While government officials have stressed that
the failure of trade talks owed more to negotiating positions taken
by WTO members than to the influence of demonstrators on the
streets, it was clear that the protest message has quickly become a
political priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Globalism is the new ism that everyone loves to hate,'' said
Michael Moore, director-general of the WTO, in an interview.
``There is nothing that our critics will not blame on globalization
and, yes, it is hurting us.''
</P>
<P>
   The paradox of this hand-wringing is that the World Economic
Forum, a convention of rich and powerful people carefully
cultivated by its Swiss founder, Klaus Schwab, over 30 years, has
long viewed itself as the intellectual godfather of globalization.
In fact, critics view the forum, in which elected world leaders
convene with top business executives in this heavily patrolled
resort, as a cabal that shapes the world order without consulting
ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   The forum is actually more of a gabfest. But Schwab, saying that
the goal of this year's meeting was to create a ``social
consciousness of the global economy,'' sought to broaden the
invitees this year to include representatives of nongovernment
organizations and unions, some of which led the Seattle
demonstrations. Many accepted.
</P>
<P>
   That did not stop a Swiss group called the Anti-WTO Coalition
from announcing plans to block the winding, two-lane road into town
Saturday, during Clinton's visit. The Swiss army was on call,
promising to keep the road open and the who's who list of attendees
safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the NGOs'' _ nongovernment organizations _ ``that came
here did so knowing that they would be criticized,'' said Peter
Armstrong, director of OneWorld International, a private group
opposed to globalization, who is attending the meeting. ``But there
is a certain sense of victory that we are here at all, that we can
voice our concerns on the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   John J. Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, who worked to stop
the launch of a new round of trade talks in December, is also
attending the forum, along with a group of international union
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle is just the beginning,'' Sweeney said. ``Unless
workers are involved, globalization will not work.''
</P>
<P>
   Business executives expressed anxiety about whether
globalization is working, and some said they were part of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   George Soros, the hedge fund manager, called for world
democracies to establish a new global federation that would set
labor and environmental standards more effectively than the United
Nations. Louis Schweitzer, chairman and chief executive of the
French auto company Renault, said that business must take a back
seat to politics, accepting limits on political contributions and
influence, to help restore public faith in elected leaders.

   If one were to freeze random television frames from Bill
Clinton's State of the Union address, the result might be a
dignified presidential portrait. One might just as easily get an
image with the eerie wit of a Salvador Dali painting or a Monty
Python montage of floating heads: there is Vice President Al Gore's
left eye, floating spectrally over the president's shoulder; when
the vice president stands, his disembodied left hand with
wristwatch applauds.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert, popped up now and then
over Clinton's other shoulder, but not nearly as often as Gore. The
peekaboo appearances created the goofy impression of an eager vice
president poking his head in and out of the picture as if to say,
``Is it my turn yet?''
</P>
<P>
   As many post-speech commentators observed, the possible Gore
succession was a major Clinton subtext. But that is not the main
reason the vice president was so distracting. His now-you-see-him,
now-you-don't appearances added a touch of surprise to a
perfunctory and aging television ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Theatrically, the president's delivery lacked the passion he so
often displays. Yet the pundits came prepared to praise Clinton's
speech-making powers and did just that. Ordinary viewers were more
likely to note the restrained demeanor of a lame duck not yet ready
to retire.
</P>
<P>
   The network coverage was in a similar lame-duck position: rooted
in the present and tentatively glancing toward a future dominated
by cable and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The State of the Union is one of the rare events all the
broadcast networks still cover, and it is not surprising that ABC
led the ratings. It offered the comfiest lead-in, the megahit ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' That game show's message of feel-good
prosperity (``You can be rich, too!'') fed directly into Clinton's
first major point, about the country's economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's coverage was the most daring, though. Right after the
president's speech, Tom Brokaw interviewed Bill Bradley, Gore's
competitor in the Democratic primary. The other networks did not
interview any candidates. By tacitly acknowledging that the evening
was political, NBC seemed fresher and more forthright.
</P>
<P>
   The networks scrambled off the air as fast as they could to let
the local news in (at 11:15 after the Republican response). When
they did, Brokaw switched from NBC to the network's cable channel,
MSNBC, to be host of a special called ``Are You Better Off?'' That
wrapup was by far the night's most informative and future-oriented.
There were follow-up interviews about the speech; Tim Russert
bullied Hastert into agreeing that the president's proposal for
federal gun registration would go nowhere in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   More distinctively, the special discussed the state of the
country in broader terms. Clinton's former Treasury secretary and
economic mastermind, Robert Rubin, and the Netscape innovator James
Barksdale, talked about the link between social opportunity and
computer literacy.
</P>
<P>
   Even the networks know the future is encroaching fast, and the
dot-com hints were on every screen. NBC asked viewers to vote at
MSNBC.com on the question, ``Are you better off?'' ABC directed
viewers to ABCNEWS.com for more information. CBS commissioned what
it called the first scientifically representative poll using the
Internet. That meant it chose a scientific sample and provided
WebTV to those who were not on the Internet already, for a
stunningly quick evaluation of the speech. Networks cannot deliver
the captive audience they did in those cave-dwelling, precable
days. Their nods toward the technological future were gestures of
self-preservation, and hopeful moments in a staid night.

FROM THE STREETS OF SEATTLE TO THE TABLE AT DAVOS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland _ Memories of Seattle pervade this latest
gathering of world leaders and corporate elite. This being their
first big get-together since Seattle, there was much bracing for
violent street protests drawing attention to the shortcomings of
globalization and free trade. But the message from the streets has
hit Davos in a different format.
</P>
<P>
   Not that big, riveting demonstrations are really a possibility
here. This tiny ski resort, hard to reach even in summer, is not
wide-open Seattle. The well-armed Swiss troops at checkpoints along
the main roads are not the easier-going Seattle police. And the
World Economic Forum is not the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than excluding opponents, as the WT.. did in Seattle, the
forum invites its enemies and critics to participate and mingle
with the chief executives of the 1,000 companies whose dues and
fees pay almost all of the forum's $37 million annual budget. This
year, some of the Seattle protesters got invitations and found that
their street demonstrations in Seattle added weight to their words
in Davos.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a Shell or a Monsanto or a BP Amoco, you don't want
to be blindsided simply because you have not had contact with the
leaders of groups that can mobilize opposition to your practices,''
said Lance Knobel, who planned the 318 discussion sessions. ``You
listen to their concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Minds are not changed, of course; no one is likely to come away
converted when this gathering ends Tuesday night. The world leaders
(Bill Clinton and Tony Blair accepted invitations this year) and
famous executives (Bill Gates is a regular) will go on insisting
that globalization and free trade are good things that raise living
standards.
</P>
<P>
   No one said so more clearly than Lewis B. Campbell, chairman of
Textron, a multinational company engaged in manufacturing and
finance. But Seattle shook him. ``I was very unpleasantly surprised
by the outcome,'' he said. ``After Seattle, we have to rethink our
assumptions'' _ not about the benefits of free trade and
investment, but its inevitability. ``We could lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell shared a platform with John J. Sweeney, president of
the AFL-CIO, and Martin Khor, director of the Third World Network,
an umbrella group for 80 or so organizations in developing
countries that say unrestricted trade hits their nations especially
hard.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, Sweeney, Khor and Brent Blackwelder, president of
Friends of the Earth USA, helped organize and lead demonstrations.
Here they were participants. Their message: Removing barriers to
trade and investment may be inevitable and even a good thing in the
right circumstances. But without proper regulation, the cost is
considerable: more pollution, destruction of rain forests, frequent
financial crises that destroy jobs and savings, cheap imported food
that undercuts small farmers in developing countries, and workers
without the power to bargain and protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The list goes on, and the arguments fall mostly on deaf ears.
Why, then, bother to come here?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, on the issue of pollution and climate, there is
some movement. Companies like BP Amoco that have voluntarily
limited the emission of damaging gases into the atmosphere were
extolled here. So public opinion and debate do sometimes have an
effect, however incipient.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a crucial difference for Sweeney, Khor and
Blackwelder between Davos and Seattle. The WTO, they say, is a
governmental body with the power to set binding rules that enforce
free trade, and was doing just that in Seattle. Stopping the
rule-setting became a consuming goal, justifying the demonstrations
that disrupted the meeting. ``No deal is better than a bad deal,''
Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   The World Economic Forum is a different matter. The corporate
luminaries who give it life certainly influence the officials who
make the WTO rules, but they don't make any rules themselves. Here
in Davos they mostly talk, and it pays to talk with them, Sweeney
said. He has been coming here for three years now.
</P>
<P>
   Khor and Blackwelder, newly invited this year, agree. ``If we
can't change their minds,'' Blackwelder said, ``we are still left
with all the demonstration mechanisms that we used so effectively
in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in Davos, Blackwelder's organization makes that point. One
of his colleagues, Andrea Durbin, maintains a presence at a caucus
of organizations opposed to unrestricted trade and globalization
that have gathered outside the forum. Some of them were invited but
declined to take part.
</P>
<P>
   Those who stayed outside said they would feel compromised if
they participated in a conference sponsored by a group they
consider undemocratic and deeply opposed to their views. But
Friends of the Earth took a more flexible stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our perspective is that it is important to be inside
(italics)and(end italics) outside,'' Ms. Durbin said at a news
conference a few blocks from where the forum is holding its
meetings. ``There are people we are trying to persuade from the
inside, but it is also important to maintain pressure from the
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, mass demonstrations remain an option, if not for
this isolated ski resort, then for the next act in the escalating
struggle over trade and globalization.

INVESTING WITH STEVEN L. KIRSON AND MICHAEL J. MUFSON: PUTNAM OTC
EMERGING GROWTH FUND  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 30)

<TEXT>
<P>
   They are both just over 6 feet tall and have short curly brown
hair. They are both fans of football, Mexican food and sushi.
``We're almost interchangeable,'' said Steven L. Kirson of himself
and Michael J. Mufson, co-managers of the Putnam OTC Emerging
Growth fund. Together, they are known around their downtown Boston
office as ``the OTC twins.''
</P>
<P>
   And judging by the record, they work well together: Their fund,
with $11.23 billion in assets, returned 43.8 percent, annualized,
for the three years through Jan. 21, compared with 27.5 percent for
its peers in the small-capitalization growth category, according to
Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Kirson, 39, and Mufson, 36, use a bottom-up investing style in
choosing growth stocks with market capitalizations of $150 million
to $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The 150 to 175 companies in the portfolio generally share
several characteristics. They typically have a sustainable market
advantage, like a technologically superior product. And they
operate in large, underserved markets, in which there are
relatively few providers of similar products or services.
</P>
<P>
   The managers are helped by seven Putnam small-cap growth
analysts and five other Putnam small-cap and mid-cap growth fund
managers.
</P>
<P>
   Much of these analysts' and managers' time is spent visiting
companies, collecting information at trade shows and talking to
consultants and company competitors. Data culled from the visits
and the companies' financial statements allows Kirson and Mufson to
project quarterly earnings for 18 to 24 months. That does not mean
they don't closely monitor earnings results, as well as Wall Street
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When companies significantly exceed market expectations, that
drives the stock price,'' Kirson noted.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Kirson and Mufson want sales and earnings to grow at
least 20 percent a year, on average, for the next three to five
years.
</P>
<P>
   They pay special attention to gross profit margins, before
operating expenses. ``High margins tell you a company's product is
different, and the company can charge more than its competitors,''
Kirson said.
</P>
<P>
   Balance sheets are scrutinized for signs of future problems. A
decline in inventory turns, for example, the number of times that
inventory is sold and replaced each year, often signals a future
decline in sales. ``Deterioration in the balance sheet is often a
precursor that determines what the income statement will look like
in the next quarter or two,'' Mufson said.
</P>
<P>
   And they look at a company's market opportunity _ the total
potential sales of its specific market.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are early-stage companies, so it's hard to look at them
on an earnings basis, because they're still investing their money
internally for growth,'' Mufson said. One way to gauge a company's
relative priceyness is to compare its price-to-sales multiple to
those of other companies in the same industry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kirson and Mufson are willing to pay for good companies
with good potential, although there are no firm rules.
``Fundamentals are the clear drivers of our investment decisions,''
Mufson said. ``Valuation is a distant second.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the strong market, they still see opportunity in their
favorite sectors: technology, telecommunications, business services
and media.
</P>
<P>
   They like Breakaway Solutions, a Boston company that builds and
manages Web sites and office computer systems. Breakaway is
``capitalizing on the tidal wave of spending by corporations in the
U.S. to do business over the Internet,'' Kirson said.
</P>
<P>
   Based on its market opportunity of $5 billion in the next few
years and its strong services offerings, ``it has a lot of
potential to be a much bigger company,'' he said. The fund first
bought shares at $14 each at the company's initial offering last
October. Breakaway's gross profit margins are 55 percent, and
Kirson expects the company to become profitable this year. Shares
closed at $78.625 on Friday, or 157 times his 2001 earnings
estimate of 50 cents a share and 13.1 times his sales estimate of
$6 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite is Silknet Software, of Manchester, N.H.. It
sells software that helps companies improve online customer service
and thus increase sales. Kirson puts its market opportunity at $10
billion. Its gross margins are 75 percent, he said, but the company
is unprofitable because it is building infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street expects it to turn profitable in 2001, ``but we
believe they'll be profitable way sooner than that,'' Kirson said.
Shares trade for 360 times his 2001 earnings estimate of 45 cents a
share, and 30 times his sales estimate of $5.40 a share.
</P>
<P>
   They bought shares for $15 each in the initial offering last
May. The stock closed on Friday at $162.
</P>
<P>
   The also own Independent Energy, which provides electric and gas
service to small and midsize British companies and has joint
headquarters in New Orleans and London. The company is gaining
share in what is already a $50 billion-plus market, Mufson said.
``They just built a totally outsourced business model, so they're
the lowest-cost provider in the country,'' he said. He expects
revenues, at $650 million in 1999, to exceed $1.5 billion in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   They originally bought American depository receipts at the
initial offering in July 1998 at $8. Mufson expects a three-year
earnings growth rate of more than 40 percent a year. The ADRs
closed on Friday at $45, or 32 times his earnings estimate of $1.40
per ADR for 2001.

SURVEY REFLECTS FRUSTRATION, MORALE PROBLEMS AMONG NAVY JUNIOR
OFFICERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVERETT NAVAL STATION, Wash. _ Poor leadership. Commanders
micro-managing their subordinates, fearing that a single mistake
will kill a military career. Endless inspections and paperwork. A
work environment where hard work and honesty go unrewarded.
</P>
<P>
   When the Navy last fall surveyed several thousand junior
officers in what's known as the ``surface'' Navy _ the component
that operates all surface warships and supply vessels except for
aircraft carriers _ they knew that morale problems existed.
</P>
<P>
   But they were stunned by the outpouring of frustration and anger
in the ranks, particularly against the quality of leadership in
today's Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrific angst was created in the fleet'' by a decade of
turmoil and downsizing, Capt. Roy Chapple, the chief of staff at
Navy Region Northwest, said in an interview. ``We went away from
warriors and came out with a group of careerists who were
risk-adverse ... afraid to make hard decisions,'' said Chapple, who
has commanded three surface warships during his 29-year career.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy anticipated about 15 percent of the 4,524 junior
officers surveyed _ all the ensigns, lieutenants (junior grade) and
lieutenants assigned to the surface warfare community _ would fill
out the questionnaires. Instead, Navy officials said a
``remarkable'' 55 percent responded.
</P>
<P>
   Many were from the Puget Sound area, where the surface Navy is a
major presence with six warships assigned to Everett and four
combat support ships in Bremerton. Overall, there are about 30,000
Navy personnel assigned to bases in the region, making it the
third-largest naval complex in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The sour mood reflected in the survey could have grave
consequences, Chapple said. With a booming economy and good
civilian jobs for the taking, the Navy already is facing a crisis
in attracting college students into various officer training
programs, and in trying to keep enough junior officers in the
service.
</P>
<P>
   To maintain the correct mix of mid-rank officers, the Navy needs
to persuade 38 percent of lieutenants nearing the end of their
obligated tour of service (usually four years) to sign up for
another term. But fewer than one-third of those surveyed say they
plan to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Those entering the Navy in the past six years are even less
inclined to stay than older officers commissioned earlier. About 69
percent of those commissioned in 1990 favor a naval career,
compared to just 21 percent of those commissioned in 1998, the
survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Matt Armas is one of those surveyed. He said he plans to
leave the Navy when his hitch is up, this summer.
</P>
<P>
   A 27-year-old Naval Academy graduate who commutes from Seattle
to his staff job at Naval Surface Group Northwest headquarters each
day, Armas for the past five years has had an experience that
typifies the turmoil generated in part by defense cutbacks that
have reduced Navy personnel by 50 percent since the mid-1980s: four
separate assignments on three separate ships and the Everett
headquarters, and three separate deployments.
</P>
<P>
   ``What hit me the hardest was the time away from home,'' said
Armas, who is married.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone joining the Navy can expect to spend lots of time at sea,
but the unrelenting demand for Navy ships in non-combat missions
such as peacekeeping and counter-drug operations has made a
stressful situation even worse, Armas said.
</P>
<P>
   He served on the Everett-based guided missile frigate USS Ford
for 17 months in 1996-97, including a six-month deployment to the
Persian Gulf. When he returned Armas transferred to the
Bremerton-based cruiser USS California and immediately left for two
months in the eastern Pacific patrolling for drug smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   The California was decommissioned in September 1998 and Armas
joined a third command, the ammunition ship USS Mount Hood _ and
soon was on his way to the western Pacific for another three
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got bounced a bit,'' said Armas. ``I've enjoyed my
experiences a lot, but I want to have a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Ens. Curtis Young, 30, said he remains committed to a 30-year
military career (he served two tours as an enlisted man before
gaining a commission). He said the Navy is beginning to make
progress in attacking the roots of the current malaise.
</P>
<P>
   But he quickly can cite his own frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   As the electrical division officer on the Everett-based USS Paul
Foster, Young was responsible for running what the Navy calls the
``personal electrical safety program.'' It was a time-consuming
effort in which Young's sailors had to inspect every personal
electronic device owned by the destroyer's 325-member crew _ from
CD players to electrical razors to Walkman receivers _ then assign
each device an identification number and tag it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to prepare planning lists of people with upcoming
inspections,'' he said. ``We had to coordinate with other
departments for the timing. We had to publish the names in the
ship's Plan of the Day.'' He shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   The program consumed ``hundreds'' of man-hours of work each year
for no apparent reason, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt.(j.g.) Rick Potter cited the steam valve in the galley of the
USS Chandler as emblematic of the Navy's woes. The valve, designed
to funnel steam heat for the cooking ovens on the ship, was worn
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't work, it leaked, it broke,'' Potter said. ``I
couldn't fix it. We'd have to take it apart, weld it, put it back
together. It would break again.''
</P>
<P>
   For lack of $4,000 to buy a replacement, Potter said he and his
sailors were forced to spend hours engaged in hot, sweaty work that
was doomed to failure, Potter said. ``I was telling them to fix it
and I knew they couldn't fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the survey, junior officers complained that they are
overworked by superiors so fearful of error that junior officers
are given no chance to demonstrate initiative or leadership.
</P>
<P>
   A large majority said they were not receiving the support they
need from their commanders. This leadership failure spanned a gamut
of issues from inadequate spare parts and training ammunition to an
overall ``zero defects'' mentality in the unit where the slightest
mistake is viewed as a career-ending incident.
</P>
<P>
   Chapple said he is optimistic that the Navy's senior leadership
is making progress to improve the quality of life and the
traditions of initiative and leadership in which the Navy takes
pride. The service has already stopped some inspections found to be
unnecessary, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A 4.8 percent pay raise approved by Congress went into effect on
Jan. 1, marking the first time in years that service people have
begun to recapture earning power lost in the 1990s when salaries
failed to keep up with inflation. Initiatives aimed at giving
qualified young officers opportunity for early promotion and
command have been implemented, as well as a special bonus of up to
$50,000 for surface warfare officers signing up for another five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Adm. Ed Moore, commander of Pacific Fleet surface forces,
said such initiatives have had ``a positive effect on both morale
and retention'' among junior officers. ``Although we must continue
to look for ways to make a Navy career more satisfying to our
Surface Warriors, the outlook is good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said the low percentage of poll recipients indicating
interest in a career is ``not a cause for alarm'' because many
officers do not decide to stay in or get out until late in their
four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Chapple said the turnaround effort still has a long way to go,
including showing junior officers that they can advance in a
shrinking Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always told our youngsters that the brass ring is within
their reach,'' Chapple said. ``Only today, it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Some findings of Navy survey of junior officers
</P>
<P>
   Negative
</P>
<P>
   82 percent: Workload too heavy while ship in port or routine
training
</P>
<P>
   80 percent: Civilian employment options are better
</P>
<P>
   77 percent: Micromanagement of their work by superiors
</P>
<P>
   73 percent: Poor leadership
</P>
<P>
   66 percent: Inadequate pay and compensation

PANEL ENDORSES DRUG TO TREAT ADVANCED MS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Wash., Mass.)   (jw)

<P>
   GAITHERSBURG, Md. _ A cancer chemotherapy drug is the first
effective treatment for certain forms of advanced multiple
sclerosis and should be approved for that use, according to a
unanimous recommendation Friday by a panel of scientific experts to
the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   If the agency follows the panel's recommendation, as is
expected, the drug, mitoxantrone, would become the first approved
treatment designed to slow the rate of neurological disability and
reduce flareups in patients with rapidly worsening multiple
sclerosis. More than 100,000 people may benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This opens up a new era in the treatment of multiple
sclerosis,'' said Dr. Howard Weiner, a neurologist at Brigham &AMP;
Women's Hospital in Boston, who was a consultant to the committee.
Although doctors are already using chemotherapy drugs for multiple
sclerosis, he said, having government approval will legitimize the
practice and lead to more widespread use.
</P>
<P>
   But mitoxantrone, which goes by the brand name Novantrone and
was first approved in this country for treatment of leukemia in
1987, has drawbacks. It is not a cure, and it will not reverse
damage already done.
</P>
<P>
   And Novantrone has a serious side effect, heart damage, which
means that patients will be able to take it for no longer than two
or three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have to be monitored carefully,'' said Dr. Stephen
Reingold, vice president for research at the National Multiple
Sclerosis Society. ``It is not going to be able to used lightly or
for very long, but the consensus is it does have a role in slowing
neurologic disability. So that's good news for people who are not
otherwise being treated.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the manufacturer, Immunex Corp. of Seattle, the
drug, administered as an intravenous infusion, will cost a patient
about $3,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 350,000 Americans have multiple sclerosis, a
crippling, and often unpredictable, immune system disease that
causes a breakdown of the myelin sheath, the protective insulation
that surrounds the nerve fibers of the central nervous system. Its
symptoms vary in severity from patient to patient, but they include
excessive weakness, impaired vision, loss of balance and muscle
coordination, loss of cognitive ability and, in the most severe
cases, paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   In its early stage, the disease typically takes a course of
remissions and relapses, in which patients experience periodic
flareups, or relapses, and then recover. This is known as
``relapsing remitting'' multiple sclerosis, and about 70 percent of
all MS patients are placed in this category at the time of
diagnosis. There are already three drugs on the market to treat
this form of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   After about 10 years, however, half of these patients go on to
develop ``secondary progressive'' multiple sclerosis, in which
patients gradually worsen between flareups. Novantrone, if
approved, would be used for these patients, as well as patients
with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis that is worsening more
rapidly than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Patients are eager to have the new drug. Among three who
testified Friday was Mary Elizabeth McNary, 39, of Washington, who
gave birth to twins five months ago. Her gait is slow, and double
vision prevents her from driving. She said she received a diagnosis
of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in 1990. Now, she wonders
if her condition will worsen.
</P>
<P>
   ``My MS has been relatively merciful to me; nonetheless, I feel
as that I am under the sword of Damocles,'' Ms. McNary said. ``It's
really frightening now that I'm a mother, to think that I might not
be able to hold my babies.''
</P>
<P>
   With the advisory committee's recommendation, Dr. Robert Temple,
an FDA official, said the agency would move quickly to make the
drug available to patients. Formal approval could come within a
matter of weeks, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The panel's 7-0 vote came after a day of intense discussion over
the validity of the scientific data presented by Immunex. In a
study of 194 patients in four European countries, the company found
that the annual rate of relapse was 21 percent for patients on the
maximum Novantrone dose, while the relapse rate in a group
receiving a fake treatment, or placebo, was 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although the findings were compelling, the study troubled
committee members because it was partially ``unblinded,'' meaning
that the patients' doctors knew which treatments they were taking,
although the scientists analyzing the data did not.
</P>
<P>
   Novantrone, like many chemotherapy agents, is an
immunosuppressant. It works by interfering with the replication of
T-cells, the immune system cells that become overactive in multiple
sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   Novantrone, said Dr. Craig Smith, a neurologist from Seattle and
consultant to Immunex, is ``not the final answer but it's a very,
very strong supporting character in a treatment armamentarium that
is weak but getting better.''

HOUSTON GIRLS ACCUSED IN RASH OF ROBBERIES GET 7 YEARS IN PRISON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE BREWER 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Two of the four Houston girls accused in a series of
armed robberies last summer lost their bid for probation Friday and
were sentenced to seven years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Malissa ``Lisa'' Warzeka wept quietly and Katie Marie Dunn
sobbed loudly and almost collapsed as state District Judge Mark
Kent Ellis read the jury's verdict and imposed the punishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spare me your tears. You should have known better ... You have
sown the wind and you have now reaped the whirlwind,'' Ellis told
the 17-year-old girls.
</P>
<P>
   The jury of seven women and five men returned after deliberating
for about 90 minutes Friday. The panel had been sequestered
overnight after failing to reach a decision following six hours of
deliberations Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn and Warzeka had each pleaded guilty to two charges of
aggravated robbery, so jurors had to decide if they were to be
placed on probation or sent to prison for anywhere from five years
to life.
</P>
<P>
   The girls, who had no previous felony records, got seven years
for each of the two robbery charges. The terms will run
concurrently, so with credit for time already served in jail, they
will be eligible for parole in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and other supporters, who filled the courtroom
throughout the trial, were visibly shaken by the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn's mother and Warzeka's parents were more subdued as they
filed out. All declined comment, as did the jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Warzeka and Dunn were arrested in August, along with Michelle
Morneau, 18, and Krystal Dawn Maddox, 16, who has been certified to
stand trial as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   The four have been linked to five robberies _ two in Montgomery
County and three in Harris County _ between May 30 and July 10, in
which they disguised themselves so effectively that some thought
they were boys.
</P>
<P>
   All four are from the affluent community of Kingwood, which is
in north Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn has admitted to taking part in four of the robberies, which
the girls pulled to get money for drugs, clothes, body-piercings
and other things
</P>
<P>
   Warzeka, a member of several sports teams at Kingwood High
School, admitted to being the one who held a gun on clerks as she
shouted obscene commands in three of the robberies.
</P>
<P>
   Morneau is alleged to have taken part in three robberies and
Maddox in all five. They are awaiting trial.

THE LATEST POLITICAL TRICK: ACCUSE YOUR OPPONENT OF BEING
NEGATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ These days, the candidates see nabobs of
negativism everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   At a debate this week, former Sen. Bill Bradley said Vice
President Al Gore had gone negative on him. Gore called that
accusation a ``negative attack'' on his integrity. At a town hall
meeting in Nashua on Thursday, Sen. John McCain rallied the crowd
with the wish that in the final week of campaigning here, ``We
won't be having any negative ads.'' And in a new commercial on New
Hampshire television stations, a Republican group quotes Bob Dole
as saying that the attack ads in the 1996 primaries left him
``battered, bruised and broke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Forbes, stop the negative ads,'' the commercial's
voiceover concludes, referring to the Republican contender, Steve
Forbes. ``Don't help the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   All this talk about negativity has more than a few New Hampshire
voters bewildered. Given the history of truly vituperative primary
campaigns here, this year's strikes a lot of people as being closer
in tone to high tea than ``High Noon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a shadow issue,'' Dave Naughton, a political
independent from Nashua who had come to McCain's meeting, said with
a shrug. ``I take it for what it's worth: something they talk
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, though, the candidates seem to want to talk about
negativity all the time. It is a fixation that is rooted in the
time-honored campaign tradition of spreading bad news about the
other guy. The difference is that this year, the bad news they seek
to spread is that it is the other guy who is spreading the bad
news.
</P>
<P>
   Keenly aware that voters here and across the country say they
are tired of the kind of media mudslinging that has come to be
known as the politics of personal destruction, strategists are
expending large amounts of money and energy to convince the public
that their opponents' campaigns are much more negative than they
truly are. In commercials and debates, in gripe-and-grin events and
interviews on local television, the candidates and their surrogates
are branding as negative comments by their foes that in other
campaigns might have been dismissed with a yawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually a pretty sophisticated strategy,'' observed
Darrell West, a professor at Brown University who studies political
advertising. ``It used to be that candidates would go negative to
pin negative information on their opponents. Now, what they are
trying to do is play the blame game, blaming their opponent for the
tenor of the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   What gives this a weird sense of disconnect for voters is that
by most measures, Campaign 2000 has been about as raucous as a game
of croquet.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, the candidates have been remarkably
issue-based,'' said Brad Rourke, director of the Project on
Campaign Conduct, a nonprofit group in Camden, Maine, that seeks to
establish guidelines for civility in campaigns. ``You read the
papers, and it sounds as if what they are having are really tough
issue debates.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, things could get truly nasty in a hurry. The New
Hampshire primary has a not-so-proud tradition of mean-spirited
advertising on the last weekend of the campaign. Most infamously,
there was the advertisement put on the air in 1988 by Vice
President George Bush that labeled Dole ``Senator Straddle'' for
refusing to sign a pledge not to raise taxes, a spot that helped
doom Dole's candidacy here. And in the last couple of days, various
campaigns have been playing cat and mouse with one another,
threatening to more broadly criticize their opponents and even
broadcast the dreaded attack ads _ but only, of course, if their
rivals do so first.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they say something inappropriate to us,'' declared William
Dal Col, Forbes' campaign manager, ``we've got material prepared to
be delivered to level the playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But even Forbes, whose attacks on Dole on the airwaves in New
Hampshire four years ago were some of the most vicious the state
had ever seen, is pulling his punches, running commercials that
illustrate his own positions on economic issues. The campaign, in
fact, has run only one spot that might be viewed as negative, in
which an anti-tax advocate from Texas criticizes Bush for his tax
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col complained that in the current climate, the impact of
such spots _ well within the boundaries of fairness, in his view _
is muted by the loud, righteous protests from the other side. ``Any
time you talk about his record, they spin it as negative,'' he
said. ``Here is a constituent who says Bush broke his tax pledge.
But they want no debate, so they do the negative thing by accusing
us of being negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, scoffed at the
idea that Bush was the aggressor. ``I think the voters make a
rather informed judgment on who is negative and who is positive,''
he said. ``That's one of the reasons Steve Forbes is having so much
difficulty gaining any traction.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Political campaigns are built to take the pulse of public
sentiment and play to some popular rhythm, and that may partly
account for how voguish it is at the moment to portray the
opposition as negative. For negative is highly out of fashion. In a
poll of 800 adults across the nation in November by Rourke's
organization, nearly 80 percent said they believed attack-oriented
campaigns produced leaders who were ``less ethical and less
trustworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll found, Rourke said, that while ``it's bad to be
attacked, it's worse to be perceived as an unfair attacker.''
</P>
<P>
   That may help to explain why so many of the harsher commercials
that have made it to the airwaves this year have been sponsored by
third-party groups. Organizations as diverse as the Sierra Club,
the National Abortion Rights Action League and Americans for Tax
Reform have run spots here targeting one candidate or another. The
most tactically sophisticated, however, has been a series of spots
run by the Republican Leadership Council, including the new
advertisement with the words of Dole, that has been designed to
head off any attempt by Forbes to go negative.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Miller, the council's executive director, said the group
began running the spots in November. ``I think everyone in the
party felt he went way too hard last time and did lasting damage,''
Miller explained. ``We wanted to tell him in an ad, warning him not
to go down that road again.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, such a spot has another function, reminding viewers
that this was a candidate prone to go on attack. Voters may simply
tune a lot of this out; McCain, for instance, always gets applause
when he mentions his disdain for attack ads, but virtually never a
follow-up question. Yet to some monitoring the candidates' behavior
closely, even the accusations of negativity have a corrosive
effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, developments in the past week have disturbed me,''
said the Rev. C. Welton Gaddy, executive director of the Interfaith
Alliance, a nonsectarian organization based in Washington that
promotes ethical conduct. In December, the group persuaded five
candidates _ Bush, McCain, Bradley, Gore and Sen. Orrin Hatch _ to
sign what it called the ``Framework of Civility for Presidential
Candidates,'' in which they agreed, among other things, to not run
commercials that vilified their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Gaddy worries that with all the claims that opponents are
attacking, the atmosphere of civility is endangered. ``We have
moved to the edge of a precipice,'' he said, ``and I hope we take a
step back.''

TRAITS ONLY A BOSS COULD LOVE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 30) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)   (af)  
 By RACHEL-LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To Michael Maccoby, anthropologist, psychoanalyst and scholar of
management, executives like Bill Gates, Larry Ellison and Jeffrey
P. Bezos exemplify a new personality type that now dominates our
business culture: ``the productive narcissist.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Narcissistic Leaders: The Incredible Pros, the Inevitable
Cons,'' an article in the January-February issue of the Harvard
Business Review, Maccoby asserted that such business leaders
displayed creative vision, a willingness to break the rules and an
ability to persuade people to follow them. But, he said, they are
terrible listeners, hypersensitive to criticism and lacking in
empathy. All of that, he added, can make them tough to work for.
</P>
<P>
   Maccoby, former director of the technology, public policy and
human development program at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government, advises underlings to display great empathy for such
bosses' feelings, to understand their vulnerabilities and to always
give them credit for the employees' own ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Maccoby, who has studied workplace personalities and strategies
for 30 years, was once an associate of Erich Fromm, the famed
psychoanalyst. Together, they wrote ``Social Character in a Mexican
Village''(Prentice-Hall, 1970).
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, Maccoby, then at Stanford, visited companies
like Hewlett-Packard and IBM to study people who create technology.
Rejecting the stereotype of William H. Whyte's ``Organization
Man,'' he found instead the Gamesman, who took calculated risks and
tried new methods while making sure to please the boss.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Gamesman: The New Corporate Leader'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster,
1977), Maccoby defined him this way: ``He sees a developing
project, human relations and his own career in terms of options and
as if they were a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that entrenched companies face much faster-moving
competitors, he says, leaders must take bolder steps and remain
obsessive about their visions. ``The Gamesman figured out how to
win,'' he wrote in his recent article. ``The Jeff Bezoses, the Bill
Gateses and the Steve Cases are creating a new game.''  &QL; 
(None of these executives, at Amazon.com, Microsoft and America
Online, had any comment. Ellison, at Oracle, was not available.
</P>
<P>
   The new business leaders have a great deal of aggression,
Maccoby said in an interview. They can become too isolated, because
they are so independent, often not asking for advice. ``It's a
difficult personality type,'' he says. ``But the best ones have a
sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Maccoby, whose Washington consulting firm bears his name,
advises employees that such a boss often has sharp intuition, and
that anyone challenging it must be well prepared. ``They're willing
to listen if someone has a real argument, but when you say, `Boss,
that doesn't feel right,' they get very angry.''
</P>
<P>
   He also tells employees to hone time-management skills and to
learn what demands are truly worth heeding. ``Narcissistic leaders
often give subordinates many more orders than they can possibly
execute,'' he said. ``Ignore the requests he makes that don't make
sense. Forget about them. He will.''
</P>
<P>
   A boss lucky enough to recognize these traits in himself or
herself should find a trusted sidekick. ``But underlings have to be
able to reinforce their best side without looking like a
sycophant,'' Maccoby said. He offered the example of Gates and
Steven Ballmer, recently named chief executive at Microsoft:
``Ballmer brings in the ability to help make Gates' vision a
reality in a much more organized way.''
</P>
<P>
   As more women gain power in business, he said, it will become
clear that they are as prone as men to becoming productive
narcissists.
</P>
<P>
   Since Maccoby's article appeared, a forum on the Harvard
Business Review Web site has been buzzing. ``I've worked for a very
unproductive narcissist,'' wrote Hugh Williams, a data warehousing
consultant, explaining that some condescending remarks a boss made
during a meeting ``cost our company millions in a sale lost.''
</P>
<P>
   But Noel M. Tichy, a professor of organizational behavior at the
University of Michigan's business school, called Maccoby's work
unscholarly. ``I think it's an irresponsible article that labels
people without proper empirical data,'' Tichy said in an interview.
``He hasn't met half of these people. He just picked a sexy label
and put a negative spin on what all leaders should be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Maccoby responded that the people he writes about are so well
known that meeting them isn't necessary. ``He's talking about a
very narrow model of research,'' Maccoby said. ``These are people
in the public domain.''
</P>
<P>
   Maccoby says he has received notes from chief executives
recognizing these traits in themselves and asking to get into
psychoanalysis. One chief that he classified as a productive
narcissist wrote to say he was hurt that Maccoby only alluded to
him, and didn't name him, in the article.

   AIRPLANE-BEDS (Undated) _ The battle among airlines for the
premium-fare passenger by offering luxury more typical of a cruise
ship has risen to this: One major airline will soon introduce a
private cabin equipped with a double bed. The cabin will go for
about $18,500 a couple. The airlines have good reason to be

WHEN WORK CONQUERS ALL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LINDA CARROLL MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six months ago, on the day I was moving to the East from the
Midwest, I saw that I had become unemployable.
</P>
<P>
   There I was, driving to our new home, trying by cell phone to
complete the final negotiations with the movers. I flipped
frantically through the contract pages scattered across the
passenger seat and punched numbers into a hand-held calculator _
all while holding the phone and the steering wheel. I was so
disoriented by the sensory overload that I couldn't even sip my
latte.
</P>
<P>
   For someone who has been out of the corporate workplace for four
years, the message was clear: If I couldn't handle such juggling _
or do they call it multitasking these days? _ I couldn't handle
today's business world.
</P>
<P>
   While I have privately pined for the formal order of an office
in the days since I sidestepped a financial career to be at home
with my children, it seems that the office has come to mimic the
chaos of my house: casual, continually occupied, overrun by
technology and a place for fun and games.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, our local newspaper printed a group photograph of
employees of a small Internet company that had gone public. In
another era, a picture of such a jubilant, T-shirt-clad bunch would
have had a caption like ``Chess club wins tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, my Generation X brother works with a media
agency whose virtual office offers bumper pool, foosball tables and
an incomparable view of New York Harbor _ but no assigned work
spaces. I know it is no longer in vogue to work in an environment
that looks like a work environment, but our new, hobby-shop milieu
has some puzzling consequences.
</P>
<P>
   For years the workplace has been striving to feel homey _
allowing for casual dress and corporate-sponsored counseling on
weight loss and stress. But now the workplace is also trying to be
recreational. My former employer tried to renew itself by investing
in employee education and development. That found many of us out in
the woods, dangling from ropes and scaling walls.
</P>
<P>
   The exercises were intended to strengthen teamwork, expand our
leadership skills and, I now believe, make work our prime amusement
as well as our livelihood. I recall thinking that this cozy
corporate style, with its spa-like activities and catered meals,
was fast becoming tough competition for any other claim on our
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow my generation has bungled the notion of balancing time
and money. We work so much that we don't know what else to do. I am
so struck by the one-dimensionality of my peers that I wonder how
``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' finds contestants. Don't they
know that winning might end their need to work?
</P>
<P>
   Our talk hasn't yet caught up with our walk. People still say
they'd like to work less, and few say they love their jobs. But you
can't help but feel that our professional and personal lives have
merged. Work has become hobby; hobbies have become work. One takes
up golf or studies wine only to advance one's career.
</P>
<P>
   (In contrast, I recall attending a meeting that was cut short by
a banker so he could go clogging. That's right, to clog, in the
``Riverdance'' sense. To this day, I don't know if eyebrows were
raised in jest or in envy.)
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, even people who may delight in down time can't
escape the reach of their employers. We all know that, thanks to
prolific technology, the workplace is everywhere you want it to be
(your kitchen, your car), and more than a few places that you don't
(your beach blanket, your bedroom).
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, my husband's demanding new job has earned him
a novel skill: He can be awakened by a phone call at 4 a.m. yet
answer as if it is 10 a.m. and he's seated comfortably in his
office. The most alarming thing is that it doesn't alarm him.
</P>
<P>
   My brother thinks that we work as much as we do because we think
it will be possible, in a way that it never was before, to retire
young and rich. Thus we treat work as passion, passion as work. But
if we're really lucky enough to retire young and rich, what will we
do with all our free time? &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's as if Rip Van Winkle awoke to hit the talk-show circuit,
run for president and rap on MTV. Cadillac, somnolent for so long,
suddenly seems to be everywhere, doing the wildest, craziest
things.
</P>
<P>
   It revs up a racecar for Le Mans and gives its Catera to
Steinmetz Tuning for a high-performance makeover. It shows off a
luxury hot-rod called the EldoRODo. Its new ``design &AMP; technology''
advertisements are everywhere, even looming over Times Square. At
every opportunity, it rolls out its Evoq roadster, a knife-edged
design study that foreshadows the look of Cadillacs to come.
</P>
<P>
   It trumpets its return to the limousine business it had
virtually abandoned. It redesigns its wreath and crest for a
high-tech look, shooing away the ducks that had roosted there since
1908, when they displaced the swans of the original '06 emblem.
</P>
<P>
   Given that over the last two decades, General Motors' prestige
division has sometimes barely seemed to be breathing, all this
might be likened to menu planning on the Titanic. Cadillac's 1999
sales were about half those of its peak in 1978. In three years it
has dropped from first to second to third in luxury sales, and now
trails Mercedes-Benz and Lexus. Its customer base, steadfastly
loyal but alarmingly old, has shrunk.
</P>
<P>
   Still, something is undeniably happening at Cadillac. It has
technologies like Night Vision, which lets drivers see beyond
headlamp range, and a computer-controlled suspension that
continuously matches ride and handling to road conditions, keeping
the car always in balance.
</P>
<P>
   Some future Cadillacs, like the Catera's successor that arrives
in 2002, are truly striking, at least as models in the design
studio. The division seems to have regained a sense of where it's
going, though there is considerable debate about whether the path
it has chosen is the right one.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 DeVille takes a tentative step in this new direction.
Compared with the oversized, overwrought zeppelin that the previous
DeVille had become, the new sedan is an executive jet. It has a new
platform and a wheelbase 1.5 inches longer, though the length is 3
inches shorter. It is narrower, too, but its track _ the distance
between the opposing wheels _ is wider, improving stability. While
this remains a big car, it feels trimmer and tighter.
</P>
<P>
   It also feels distinctly American _ and that is not a putdown.
Another fine new luxury car, the Lincoln LS, seems sternly German,
but the DeVille is soft, accommodating and laden with comforts. The
surprise is that it now handles with precision.
</P>
<P>
   There are now three distinct models prepared two ways. The
DeVille and DHS (for ``DeVille High Luxury Sedan'') are aimed at
the traditional Cadillac customers who want to sink back, point the
wheel and cruise. The two models share a 275-horsepower version of
Cadillac's excellent Northstar V-8, now tuned to run on regular
gasoline, and a suspension calibrated for a soft ride. The front
bench is gone, but a ``flex seat,'' with a center cushion over a
storage compartment, preserves six-passenger capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The DTS (for ``DeVille Touring Sedan'') is Cadillac's bait for
baby boomers with higher performance expectations. It has 25 extra
horsepower, bigger 17-inch wheels and tires and a chassis with the
accent on responsive handling (though the DTS's firmer ride won
raves from my passengers).
</P>
<P>
   Also standard is StabiliTrak, an active-handling system that
prevents skids and works seamlessly with the DTS's road-sensing
suspension. The DTS has five-passenger seating with a console and
floor shift.
</P>
<P>
   The DeVille starts at $40,565, including shipping, and the DHS
and DTS share a base price of $45,765; with every option, they top
out around $55,000. I spent time in three test cars, two DTS's and
a DHS. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All three performed with grace, particularly in comparison with
the '99 DeVille Concours that I drove, and came to despise, on
vacation last summer. The suspensions remain on the soft side, and
the steering has too much power assistance for my taste, but these
are heavy front-drive cars that manage to feel eager and light on
their feet.
</P>
<P>
   While it is hard to fault the DeVille's road manners, the
styling seems to have come from the paper-doll school of auto
design: Attach grille (a) from an old Mercedes S-Class, add
roofline and rear quarter panels (b) from the Infiniti Q45, and
outline the profile (c) of the Lexus LS400.
</P>
<P>
   Derivative though it may be, the simple, slab-sided body serves
as a bridge between the full-of-helium look of the recent past and
a sharp-edged techno style yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   The rear end, at least, seems original, the high tail flanked by
vertical taillights that pay homage to fins. The rear lights are
actually light-emitting diodes, which illuminate faster when the
brakes are applied.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the car there are many more signs of derivative thinking,
but this is not a bad thing. The controls are attractive,
well-placed and thoughtfully arrayed. The soft-touch switches seem
to be lifted from a Lexus, right down to their size, shape and
lettering.
</P>
<P>
   The excellent gauges also have holographic red needles in the
Lexus style, and when the car is started they race around the
dials, a la Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances on the test cars included loud, grating noises from
the telescoping steering wheels in two cars, and a similar groan
from one power seat. Wind noise seemed excessive, though the
DeVilles were quiet in other respects.
</P>
<P>
   My other chief complaint was the exceptionally long stretch
required to close the wide-opening doors. Even men with long arms
have to struggle to reach the door pull. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are separate climate controls for driver, front passenger
and back seat, a choice of massaging or adaptive seats (filled with
air cells to relieve fatigue), heaters that warm the whole seat or
just the backrest. The DeVille now offers a backup sensor that
warns you if you are about to hit someone or something. Starting
next month, all DeVilles will come from the factory with controls
for Onstar, GM's information and communications service.
</P>
<P>
   New this year is an optional touch-screen navigation system. It
incorporates the audio controls much like the system in the
Mercedes-Benz S-Class; I found it, like Mercedes's, to be
distracting.
</P>
<P>
   Such gadgets are now frosting, not a coverup for an inferior
recipe. The base and DHS models are clearly superior to their chief
competitor, the low-tech Lincoln Town Car, and the DTS deserves a
look from people shopping for a Lexus or Mercedes. Indeed, if
Cadillac had built this car a few years ago, it probably wouldn't
be looking up at those brands on the sales charts. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

dinosaur bites the dust.

BRUINS PLAYING IN HOSTILE TERRITORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ Surviving the Oregon road trip often means
surviving the rowdiest, raunchiest, rudest crowds in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the UCLA Bruins maintained their composure while
exchanging barbs with Oregon State students, who singled out coach
Steve Lavin and reserve guard Ryan Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were creative,'' Lavin said. ``They were going through
the !ital!Bruin Attitude items (from the media guide) and reciting
quotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They also asked what kind of pizza and beer we wanted. At the
end, when I knew we had the game in hand, I told them I wanted two
large pepperonis and an O'Douls. They said, `No, what kind of
beer?'''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey's experience wasn't as humorous. The students made
references to his brother, Toby, and they questioned his race and
sexuality. The taunts affected Bailey, who committed an intentional
foul early in the second half and did not play the rest of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every crowd has fun with me about Toby because he was such a
great player,'' Bailey said. ``But these people had a lot more to
say. They went at me pretty hard. It was personal stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere prepared UCLA for the bedlam of Oregon's McArthur
Court, where students used to hurl racial epithets at former
Arizona guard Damon Stoudamire (a Portland native) and former UCLA
forward Kris Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the crowd caused the baskets to shake while USC
shot free throws late in the game. Officials gave Trojans guard
Brandon Granville a second chance from the line with 1:02
remaining, prompting Ducks coach Ernie Kent to ask for calm.
</P>
<P>
   It could be worse for UCLA this evening. Oregon is playing for a
share of first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to assign one assistant to be in charge of rim
shaking,'' Lavin said. ``It's as difficult an environment as there
is in the conference.''
</P>
<P>
   __ No decision: Despite NBA sentiment to the contrary, sophomore
forward Jerome Moiso said he hasn't decided if he'll turn pro after
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why they'd say that, because I have not made a
decision yet,'' said Moiso, who is averaging 14.3 points and 7.7
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   According to NBA scouts, UCLA sophomore center Dan Gadzuric is
also mulling a jump to the pros.
</P>
<P>
   __ Staying put: Guard Ray Young scored a career-high 22 points
Thursday and seems comfortable as the sixth man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gives us a dimension we really need as a spark off the
bench,'' Lavin said. ``But his minutes will obviously be those of a
starter.''

BOEHEIM SEEMS A CHANGED MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ The perception?
</P>
<P>
   Average coach. Whiner. Hard to deal with from a media
standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The reality?
</P>
<P>
   Much better than average coach who can win 20 games a season as
consistently as any coach in the business.
</P>
<P>
   A whiner? Perhaps, but not so much that you would notice if you
got to know the man.
</P>
<P>
   A delight to deal with from a media standpoint because he gives
honest answers and opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Not that any of that bothers Jim Boeheim anymore. He's beyond
that. Way beyond it.
</P>
<P>
   He has his friends who defend him with a passion. He has a new
family circle with his wife, Juli, 2-month-old twins Jack and
Jamie, 19-month-old son James III, and a daughter, Elizabeth, from
his first marriage. And he has a team that this season might be as
good as any in the country.
</P>
<P>
   All of this at age 55 as he continues to reinvent himself, if
not his image, with a Syracuse team that comes to Conte Forum to
face Boston College Saturday with a 15-0 record, making the
Orangemen the only remaining unbeaten school in Division 1.
</P>
<P>
   When you talk about college basketball coaches, you run the
gamut of personalities. You have wise guys, self-promoting guys.
Jersey guys, hard-nosed guys.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Boeheim is a Syracuse guy. How else to explain someone who
has lived in upstate New York almost all his life, who arrived at
Syracuse in 1962 as a wide-eyed freshman and basically never left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I ever think I would still be there 38 years later?''
Boeheim said with a smile earlier this week. ``I didn't think I'd
be here three months when I saw Dave Bing.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeheim was recruited as a guard, but soon became the other
guard when Bing, who is the all-time scoring average leader (24.8
ppg) in Syracuse history, arrived on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Boeheim stayed and survived, becoming co-captain by his senior
season. After a brief stint with pro ball and an apprenticeship as
an assistant coach to Roy Danforth, he took over as the head coach
in 1976 with a team that compiled a 26-4 record.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't slowed down since then.
</P>
<P>
   Consider some numbers:
</P>
<P>
   He has a career record of 565-193 (a.745 winning percentage).
</P>
<P>
   Boeheim is fifth in winning percentage among all active coaches.
</P>
<P>
   His teams have won 20 or more games in 21 of his 24 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse has played in either the NIT or NCAA tournament in 22
of 23 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen have been to Two Final Fours, making the
championship game both times.
</P>
<P>
   He's never had a losing season.
</P>
<P>
   He's the winningest coach in Big East history.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite all this, the picture of Boeheim was of someone
whose teams never quite did well enough, with the quintessential
picture of Boeheim gesturing at officials with his hands spread in
the pose of the ultimate whiner.
</P>
<P>
   While Boeheim's friends knew the person behind the glasses and
the caustic remarks, others didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '80s, when Jimmy was younger, he had some wonderful
teams,'' said longtime friend Mike Tranghese, who is also the
commissioner of the Big East. ``When those teams didn't win the
national championships, the national assessment of Jim was that he
couldn't coach.''
</P>
<P>
   That assessment changed in 1996, when Boeheim took the Orangemen
to the Final Four, where they lost the national title to Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Boeheim showed the nation the other side, the coach with a dry
sense of humor who could be funny and incisive at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception changed in 1996,'' said Tranghese. ``And he's
mellowed since then. I've known him since the early '70s. He's a
good guy, but his public persona is different. If you know Jimmy
and study what he's done, he's one of the most innovative offensive
coaches of the last 25 years. And he's one of the fiercest
competitors you will find.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeheim doesn't deny it. Basketball. Golf. Pick a sport, pick a
subject, and Boeheim gives you everything he has. And then some.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he is different. His marriage in 1997 to Juli changed that.
Having three children under 5 has changed it more. ``I have two
lives,'' Boeheim said. ``When I'm here, it's still basketball,
still getting involved with that. But when I leave here, I go home
and that's what I do. The difference has been that after the game,
instead of having a nice long dinner with my wife, I go home and
deal with what's there.''
</P>
<P>
   He says it with a smile and a shrug. While he argues that he is
not different, his players say they have seen a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has more patience now,'' said senior guard Jason
Hart. ``If we don't do the things he asks us to do, he's more
patient about it because he understands.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there is the side of Boeheim that remains unchanged. ``Such
a perfectionist,'' said Hart with a laugh. ``I would come into the
locker room at halftime, thinking I was playing pretty well, and he
would get all over me. That's when you still hear the whining in
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeheim has had little to whine about this season. The Orangemen
have tied a school record by winning their first 15 games. Boeheim
says it is a matter of maturity as much as it is talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really the same team as last year,'' Boeheim said.
``Just a year older. They're taking better shots, making better
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   With Hart, center Eton Thomas, and forward Ryan Blackwell
providing the senior leadership, the Orangemen have not yet
stumbled, although the hardest part of the schedule lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with five starters back from a team that went 21-12 and
an influx of new talent, led by freshman guard DeShaun Williams,
the Orangemen have answers for most of the problems posed to them.
</P>
<P>
   And they have Boeheim, who coaches and makes adjustments
constantly during games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception of Syracuse is as a loosey-goosey team,'' said
Tranghese. ``But there is a structure. You get Jimmy in a dogfight,
he's not going to sit there and let you determine whether you win
or lose the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite winning 75 percent of his games, despite a record that
most coaches could only dream about, Boeheim still has his critics.
</P>
<P>
   The latest salvo came early in the season when Boeheim was
criticized for what was called a decline of recruiting over the
past several years. Boeheim seethed at the criticism, pointing out
that some of his best players have not been super blue chips and
that he has gotten his share of Top 25 and Top 50 players and will
continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The question is how. The days when the Carrier Dome and Syracuse
being on national television served as major recruiting advantages
no longer exist. And you only have to see Syracuse in mid-January,
with sub-zero temperatures, gray skies, and snow to marvel at how
he gets kids from Southern California to even make a visit, much
less a commitment.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeheim sells himself as well as his program. He is the
program. His teams play hard. They win. The best players move on to
the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   His assistant coaches also do well. Rick Pitino, Providence
coach Tim Welsh, and Holy Cross coach Ralph Willard are all Boeheim
proteges.
</P>
<P>
   Boeheim also does not hide his loyalties. When he felt former
Boston College coach Jim O'Brien had been treated unfairly by the
Eagle administration, Boeheim publicly took them to task.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the '90s, when the Big East was getting beat up
pretty good,'' said Tranghese, ``it was Jimmy and Jim Calhoun who
seemed to take it personally and who were the loudest in their
defense of the Big East.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeheim knows the time will come when the critics will return.
``I'm popular now,'' he said with a laugh that suggests some of the
old Boeheim cynicism. ``Everybody likes me.''
</P>
<P>
   As well they should.

BELICHICK FIRES PATRIOTS STRENGTH COACH PARKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ In a shocking move in Bill Belichick's first
act as head coach and the man in charge, he fired longtime strength
and conditioning coach Johnny Parker Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Parker was told he was free to seek employment elsewhere after
Belichick met individually with some of the coaches on the
lame-duck staff. He informed some they were under consideration to
remain, and he told others he didn't have jobs for them.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches he will get back to (Ray Hamilton, Dante
Scarnecchia, Jeff Davidson) will learn their fate Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick did confirm that former Jets offensive coordinator
Charlie Weis and defensive assistant Eric Mangini had verbally
agreed to join Belichick's staff.
</P>
<P>
   The Parker move was an indication that Belichick has complete
control of the operation, although he doesn't yet have the GM
title. There are reports that former Pittsburgh personnel man Tom
Donahoe is deciding between the Dolphins and Patriots after
interviewing in Miami Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Parker had worked with Belichick for years with the New York
Giants and in his one season with the Patriots (1996). When Bill
Parcells left the Patriots to go to the Jets, Parker stayed behind
and signed a seven-year deal even before Pete Carroll was hired.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, considered one of the best strength coaches in the game,
was informed of his release Friday morning and he left the facility
early in the day. Parker declined comment, but the timing of the
move isn't good. Basically, the only job available might be in New
Orleans, which has yet to name a coach, which means Parker may be
out of work.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick's first hire will be Berj Najarian, a former public
relations assistant with the Jets, who will be his new personal
administrator.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, Belichick told Parker, ``We're moving in a
different direction.'' A few days ago, Parker told some of his
collegues with the Patriots how pleased he was that Belichick and
Weis were coming to the Patriots. If the ``border war'' is over,
why was Parker let go?
</P>
<P>
   Is it the Patriots trying to release the last vestiges of the
Bill Parcells era? Is it Belichick trying to get rid of those with
Parcells ties?
</P>
<P>
   Those answers were not forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Parker has always been a straight-shooter with the players, the
coaches, and the management. When he didn't like the way things
were run last year, he had a meeting with Bobby Grier and Bob Kraft
to straighten them out. After the team lost a wild-card playoff
game to Jacksonville in 1998, he again blamed himself for the rash
of injuries that left the Patriots so battered.
</P>
<P>
   Under Parcells, who first hired Parker with the New York Giants
in 1984, Parker was effective and players were much more faithful
to the program. But under Carroll things changed, though there was
an upswing in attendance and commitment after Parker's chat with
management and after Carroll began getting tougher with guys who
didn't show up.
</P>
<P>
   The firing of Parker will not go over well with the players, and
some of the support Belichick had may now wane. Most of the players
who bought into Belichick coming aboard thought it would reunite
with some of the old regime, namely Parker.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, 53, a native of Shaw, Miss., had decided not to go to
the Jets with Parcells because he was trying to set up roots in the
Boston area. He still has four years remaining on his Patriots
contract, but Parker doesn't want to earn his money by sitting
around.
</P>
<P>
   Parker had studied strength and conditioning in other countries,
visiting the Soviet Union in 1983 and '86 to learn the training
techniques of Soviet Olympic trainers. He incorporated many of
those methods in his own routine.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, the Giants had 23 injuries and went 3-12-1. When Parker
took over the next season, the team only had seven injuries. Parker
has always said that he and other coaches are defined by the bottom
line: wins and losses, and so when the team doesn't measure up, he
doesn't measure up.
</P>
<P>
   But as a strength coach who sometimes clashed with Carroll, no
one ever expected he would be fired by someone with whom he had
worked in the past.

<P>
   MIAMI _ The federal judge who is hearing the appeal by relatives
of Elian Gonzalez to raise the 6-year-old boy in Miami, away from
his father in Cuba, admonished the relatives' legal team Friday to
stop all its ``hoopla'' and ``excesses'' in rallying public
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, William M. Hoeveler, saying the lawyers did not need
a month to prepare, moved up the date for them to respond to the
Justice Department's contention that no court has authority to
override its decision to repatriate the child. He moved the date to
Feb. 14 after setting it at Feb. 24 only Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, who is fast becoming an international celebrity with the
lawyers and public relations representatives trotting him out
daily, lost his mother at sea more than two months ago when she was
fleeing Cuba with him to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   At a special hearing he called after listening to the lawyers'
televised comments saluting the near-month the judge had given them
in which to respond, Hoeveler told the lead lawyer, Spencer Eig:
``I'm concerned about all of the hoopla, all of the demonstrations,
all of the excesses that have taken place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This case,'' he told the court, ``will be tried on the law and
the facts without all the additional fanfare, and I hope we all
understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things Thursday, Eig had ridiculed the Justice
Department's ``chutzpah'' for the nearly 2-inch-thick file it
submitted to the court, the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of Florida, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   When Eig asked the judge to advise him on responding to the news
media, Hoeveler said, ``I don't want you to comment about what
they're doing, about what you're doing, about how bad the
government is.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, as prospects for making Elian an American citizen
bogged down, the Roman Catholic nun who brought the boy together
with his grandmothers on Wednesday and now believes the boy should
stay in Miami privately appealed Friday to Attorney General Janet
Reno, a longtime friend, to change her mind too.
</P>
<P>
   Although the meeting proved fruitless, Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin
said she impressed upon the attorney general that the boy had
already deeply bonded with his Miami relatives. Wrenching him away
from them would create further trauma, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had he gone back to Cuba the first week or second week, the
position I feel would be different,'' Sister O'Laughlin, president
of Barry University in Miami Beach, said after her meeting with Ms.
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Sister O'Laughlin also said that during the boy's visit with his
grandmothers she sensed a kind of fear and foreboding that spoke to
a ``way of life'' in Cuba that she did not like.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I was feeling was not the fear of plane rides or
helicopters,'' she said. ``It had to do with way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reno, in a statement issued after the meeting, said she
still saw no legal reason to alter a ruling by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service that Elian should be returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Sister O'Laughlin's change of heart, and her
visit to their offices, re-energized lawmakers who are pushing to
make Elian a citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Sister O'Laughlin, the president of Barry University, has
visited Cuba and supports lifting the economic embargo against the
island, an unpopular position in Miami, so her words are seen to
carry extra weight in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sister Jeanne has a tremendous reputation in Miami, Dade
County and South Florida as being a lady of principle,'' said Sen.
Connie Mack, R-Fla., who introduced the citizenship bill in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Mack said Friday that the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of
Mississippi, has left it up to him to steer the bill's course.
``It's my call,'' Mack said, adding that he hopes to move forward
with the bill late next week.
</P>
<P>
   But Mack acknowledged that the bill, which would turn the case
into a custody matter, not an immigration issue, faces a rocky
road. Several Democrats have threatened to block it, and even
Senate Republicans, who initially seemed to embrace the idea, are
divided.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbying to the point of exhaustion, Elian's grandmothers have
made several trips to Capitol Hill to try to thwart the
legislation. They met with several more lawmakers Friday but were
expected to return to Cuba this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, the legislation's prospects appear no better. Rep.
Dennis Hastert, the speaker of the House, sent the bill to the
Judiciary Committee, and the chairman of the panel, Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., decided Friday to set it aside until the courts make
a decision.

COMMENTARY: WAKE ME WHEN IT'S ALMOST OVER
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``An exciting time ... an exciting result!'' declared MSNBC's
anchor, Brian Williams, on Monday night as he broke the news that
``Alan Keyes has rocketed'' to third place in the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about excitement! A man who has never been elected to
anything, a man whose third-place finish amounted to only 14
percent (some 12,000 votes) of a lower-than-hyped Iowa GOP turnout,
a man who is less likely to be elected president than Bill
Belichick, is rocketing! What does it matter that his rocket's
destination _ unless it's as a permanent talking head at a place
like MSNBC _ may be oblivion? This is history in the making.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is, despite the hard sell, the country isn't
buying. Even as the caucuses were meeting in Iowa, Harvard's
Kennedy School was tabulating its latest polls for its new
worrywart project on the Vanishing Voter. The numbers showed that
despite weeks of Iowa and New Hampshire headlines, and despite the
likelihood the whole nominating process will be over by March 7,
only 26 percent of the public is paying attention to the campaign.
A mere 6 percent of those polled described themselves as paying ``a
great deal of attention'' _ which is astounding, given that more
than 6 percent of the country is either employed by government or a
major media organization and therefore might be thought to have a
vested interest in Election 2000. What's more, 66 percent don't
support any candidate in any party, and 56 percent pronounce the
campaign ``boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Boring? That's the unkindest cut of all, especially given the
competition offered this week by professional show business: Barbra
Streisand's numbing State of Her Union filibuster at the Golden
Globes. If anything, our political culture has been in overdrive,
trying to cook up creative story lines. There were the sagas of
George W. Bush's smirks (and alleged snorts), Al Gore's sighs (and
alleged tokes), John McCain's tantrums, Bill Bradley's heart flips,
Warren Beatty's mind games and, of course, Donald Trump's sex life.
There was the Naomi Wolf ``alpha male'' flap and the spirited
debate over the true meaning of the Confederate flag. There have
been the fascinating colloquies over the differences between the
Democrats' health care plans and the Republicans' tax-cut plans.
Not to mention the touching spiritual pageant of candidates
publicly embracing Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Even the fringe acts have been worthy of Barnum &AMP; Bailey in
their heyday. Gary Bauer, the forward-to-the-past family-values
candidate, actually did arouse nostalgia for the sideshow era of
the Dionne quintuplets by arranging for his donors to gawk at
Iowa's McCaughey septuplets in exchange for a $250 campaign
contribution. Nearly as bizarre was Keyes' accusation that McCain,
a man who risked his own young life in war, was in peacetime guilty
of ``aiding and abetting the cultural murder ... of our young
people'' because he made a joke about liking the the music of Nine
Inch Nails.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, though, the most spectacular geek show is that of Steve
Forbes, who has spent $60 million of his own money to act out his
delusions on the public stage. No one will say the poignant truth
about this guy _ that even if he were a better speaker, or less of
a hypocrite (how can the billionaire owner of Forbes magazine
inveigh repeatedly against the ``media elites''?), there would
still be the insurmountable problem of his giggly Peeping Tom grin
and pop-eyed spectacles. The most virulent, if least acknowledged,
bigotry in this country _ far more widespread than sexism or racism
and practiced by all genders and ethnic groups _ is looksism. Even
in the pre-HDTV era, no one is going to be elected president who
doesn't meet the minimal physical standard required of a game-show
host.
</P>
<P>
   That the majority of the public chooses to ignore all the year's
political players is, professors might tell us, a sorry commentary
on the state of both the electorate and American politics. We're
lousy citizens. Young voters are selfish, ill-informed slackers.
Bill Clinton has made all politicians look like dirt. Everyone
hates the media.
</P>
<P>
   But a case could also be made that the people in this country,
far from being stupid or unpatriotic, are disengaged for good
reason. At a time of boom _ polls show that 73 percent say they are
better off than eight years ago, and 81 percent want ``steady
progress'' rather than ``big, bold'' ideas from the next
administration _ Americans recognize that the two Democrats and the
two Republicans who actually have a shot at being president will
not rock the boat. They may also realize that the four men's
quarrels on the issues voters care most about (health care,
education, Social Security, Medicare) are mostly modest differences
about highly incremental means, not ends.
</P>
<P>
   The old, bold ideological polarities _ big government programs
from Democrats, big government cutbacks from Republicans _ have
been sanded down in the Clinton era. Foreign-policy issues aren't
even on the table. No wonder the low-rated debates generate sparks
only when they resemble ``Saturday Night Live'' skits, as witness
Keyes' recounting of his excellent adventure in a mosh pit.
</P>
<P>
   Where there still are violent ideological disputes, mainly on
cultural issues involving the boundaries of church and state, they
are predictable, since the candidates all conform to party
stereotype: every Republican hopeful wants to thwart Roe V. Wade,
both Democrats want to protect it. Anyone casting a November vote
on the basis of which side gets to appoint Supreme Court justices
could skip the rest of the campaign and cast absentee ballots now,
without waiting to find out the identity of the nominees.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Given four contenders so eager to hug the center, conventional
wisdom has it that this election is a battle over character _ hence
the endless dissection of smirks and sighs and the constant lookout
for this year's magic balm, authenticity. But none of the big four
show any sign whatsoever of being sociopaths or, despite the
Bickersons routine of Messrs. Gore and Bradley, compulsive liars.
Nor, being politicians, will any of the four prove to be completely
authentic or free of smarminess _ including Bradley, who
resuscitated Willie Horton for no logical reason, and McCain, who
suddenly found benign dignity in a rebel flag just 24 hours after
he had condemned it as a symbol of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   What all four of these men lack is not decency but the vision
thing. Neither Bradley nor McCain has so far succeeded in his
quixotic efforts to arouse public passion about campaign finance
reform or the plight of the 27 percent of the country that is not
better off than it was eight years ago. Perhaps they fail to
command the moral high ground because they, like their opponents,
are so blatantly in thrall to big bucks. (To see which corporations
have their hooks into which candidates and parties, check out the
new paperback ``The Buying of the President 2000'' from Charles
Lewis and the Center for Public Integrity.) Nor have any of the
four candidates kept pace with the fast-advancing issues raised by
the new digital economy; if they had, maybe the young people who
are being either engaged or turned away by that new world might
listen to them.
</P>
<P>
   This is instead a fat and happy election, built on the
supposition that rosy surplus estimates are accurate and the boom
is forever. It feels less like the first election of a new century
than the final election of the old one. It's surely the last to be
adjudicated by network TV anchors, perhaps the last without
widespread Internet balloting, possibly the last in which the
parties' summer infomercials will still be referred to as
``conventions.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, there's no reason to join the 6 percent of Beltway
junkies hanging on every Keyes bounce. Which doesn't mean that it
won't get more interesting in the stretch. The increasingly
inevitable story line that the political press has feared from the
start _ that this might actually be a Bush-Gore horse race _ may be
far less boring than the alternative narratives that have been
trotted out to try to upend it.
</P>
<P>
   If 2000 really is the year of Bush-Gore, at some point the Texas
governor will have to stop clinging to his twin mantras of
``compassionate conservatism'' and states' rights every time he
wants to duck a controversial issue, and the vice president is
going to have to start talking about Buddhist monks. The earth may
not move, but the system may have produced just the tepid managers
Americans want in a transitional time.  &UR;  &LR;

HMO DECISIONS DUE WITHIN TWO WEEKS, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN AND LIZ KOWALCZYK  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Regulators expect to have a firm list of options for a
Harvard Pilgrim Health Care solution in less than two weeks,
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After filing his first progress report with the Supreme Judicial
Court, Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly said the process of
fielding offers for a sale or recapitalization of the crippled
health plan is going better than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving along very nicely right now,'' he said. ``Our
investment banker is working very hard, and we're very pleased with
that work. Right now, Feb. 11 is the day we're shooting for. And
then we will be able to make some decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 13 suitors who have signed confidentiality agreements in
exchange for the opportunity of examining Harvard Pilgrim's records
are poring over documents in guarded rooms in preparation for a
possible deal.
</P>
<P>
   In the court report, Reilly outlined the options on the table.
They include a tax-exempt recapitalization with Harvard Pilgrim
remaining non-profit, either through a merger, affiliation, a
revived sale and leaseback of the Harvard Pilgrim health centers,
or a capital infusion from a third-party. ``The options also may
include sale options to either a non-profit or for-profit buyer,''
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a level of comfort for potential investors and buyers,
Harvard Pilgrim has finished accounting for 1999 losses without
discovering additional problems that might have complicated a deal,
Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no real surprises or issues that would alter the
course in anyway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, auditors hired by the state as well as Harvard Pilgrim's
outside accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, will spend the
next month double-checking the health plan's work, Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim's 1999 losses have been the subject of much
worry for officials trying to keep the health plan from
self-destructing before it can be sold or revitalized with a cash
infusion.
</P>
<P>
   The health plan discovered some $58.5 million in surprise losses
in the tangle of its confused computer accounting systems early
this year, triggering state receivership. Since then officials have
said they have no way of knowing whether more losses may be lurking
somewhere in Harvard Pilgrim's books.
</P>
<P>
   Officials ducked questions about how long Harvard Pilgrim can
continue to pay all its current bills to hospitals as well as pay
past-due bills before its cash runs out. The court filing said over
$100 million has been paid to providers since the receivership.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredibly speculative kind of thing,'' Insurance
Commissioner Linda Ruthardt said. ``Any answer could be right and
any answer could be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly has said in the past that Harvard Pilgrim ``has a finite
period of time'' before it reaches the end of its available cash
and must be liquidated.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, he sought to mute any urgency. ``Right now things
are very stable,'' he said. ``The membership is stable. The cash
situation is stable. It's important that this matter be handled in
a calm, businesslike manner.''
</P>
<P>
   He repeated that Harvard Pilgrim's turnaround plan has been
reviewed by state accountants and found to be ``reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on a good course in every way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, regulators continue to haggle with hospitals in the
ongoing argument over what Harvard Pilgrim owes. The amount is in
dispute in part because Harvard Pilgrim's books don't agree with
records kept by hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are difficult, legitimate differences as to what's
owed,'' Reilly said. ``We're working very hard to resolve those
differences, and it has been very productive. The hospitals are
being very cooperative.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals have said they are owed some $300 million, though
recently a group of major hospitals has said it would be willing to
forstall some of the debt in order to help save Harvard Pilgrim.

   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ A heavy blast of snow cut across parts of the
Southeast Friday, forcing schools and businesses to close and
slowing traffic in Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee. The storm
weakened as it moved east into Alabama, but forecasters predicted
that another storm could move into Georgia on Saturday, threatening
to disrupt Super Bowl events in Atlanta this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The storm, which hit the Mississippi Delta on Thursday night and
continued throughout Friday, left from 2 inches to a foot of snow
from Memphis south to parts of northern and central Mississippi.
Arkansas recorded its biggest snowfall in more than a decade, with
15 inches in some areas. More than 6 inches of snow fell in Little
Rock.
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas Highway Patrol estimated that 1,000 motorists were
stranded on Interstate 30 in Clark County, about 60 miles southwest
of Little Rock. Some motorists were rescued by the National Guard
and taken to motels and shelters; others stayed in their cars and
waited for crews to clear the highway. About 300 tractor-trailer
rigs were stuck on I-30, the highway patrol said.
</P>
<P>
   In Mississippi, Clif Lusk, a spokesman for the state's Emergency
Management Agency, said that while the amount of snow was unusual,
the effect of the storm could have been much worse. Because
temperatures generally stayed above freezing, he said, ice and
freezing rain did not accompany the snow, so there were no
significant power losses or highway accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dodged a major bullet,'' he said. ``We're cold and have a
beautiful, big snowfall right now, but no major problems.''
</P>
<P>
   For many children, the weather was an enchanting experience. Not
only was school closed Friday, but many children also got their
first chance to go sledding and to build snowmen.
</P>
<P>
   In Horn Lake, Miss., in the northern part of the state, Zachary
Kretschman, 8, and his sister, Courtney, 5, built their first
snowman in their front yard. Zachary made a nose out of a hot dog
and a mouth and eyes out of dry dog food.
</P>
<P>
   In Memphis, parents and children sledded down the only big hill
in Overton Park, the city's largest park. Mark Day, 38, brought his
13-year-old daughter, Chelsea, to teach her to how sled just as he
had learned as a boy on the same hill. Using the hood of a 1971
turquoise Volkswagen Beetle, just like the one he had used 30 years
earlier, Day and his daughter careened down the hill while
onlookers shouted, ``Clear the path!'' and, ``Watch out, here comes
the big car hood!''
</P>
<P>
   But such joy was not in the air in Atlanta. Instead, city and
football officials spent the day trying to reassure the public that
the weather could not hurt their plans for this season's grandest
spectacle, Super Bowl XXXIV, on Sunday, because the game will be
played under a dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game should go on, and people should be able to see it,''
said Carol Boatright, a spokeswoman for Georgia Power Co. ``We have
back-up systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Atlantans were still reeling from last weekend's ice storm,
which left 340,000 homes and businesses without electricity. So
they spent the day preparing for the worst. Most schools throughout
the northern and central Georgia were closed Friday as residents
stocked up on food and emergency supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Airlines scaled back on some flights into Atlanta because
of weather problems in other parts of the South, said Lanni Thomas,
a spokeswoman for Hartsfield International Airport. ``We still have
quite a bit of traffic and a very steady stream of visitors in town
for the Super Bowl,'' Ms. Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   The same weather system that may bring ice to Atlanta on
Saturday could then move into the already battered interior parts
of North Carolina later this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In Raleigh, N.C., which was buried under 20 inches of snow
earlier this week, service resumed late Thursday at Raleigh
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Harned, a National Weather Service official in Raleigh,
said he was ``guardedly optimistic'' that the latest storm would
not endanger power lines.

<P>
   The battle for the premium-fare passenger, in which airlines
offer luxury more typical of a cruise ship, has risen to this: One
major airline will soon introduce a private cabin equipped with a
double bed.
</P>
<P>
   The cabin, on Virgin Atlantic, will go for about $9,000 for one
person _ or about $18,000 for a couple _ on a trans-Atlantic trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to put the romance back into flying,'' said
Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the real target is business travelers. The airlines
have good reason to be concerned about their comfort. Surveys of
business travelers _ who buy only 20 percent of all tickets but
account for about half of industry profits _ reveal that executives
would rather snooze during long flights than dine on caviar and
Cabernet.
</P>
<P>
   Competition is becoming intense to add more in-flight bunks,
although most are spartan affairs. British Airways will begin
replacing business-class seats in March on flights between New York
and London with single beds that the airline boasts have been
tested by a NASA scientist to deliver better sleep. Virgin Atlantic
is also introducing a new lounger for business class. By spring of
next year, American Airlines will have swapped its first-class
lounge chairs with seats that convert into beds on all
trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific flights.
</P>
<P>
   Seats that fold into single beds have long been reserved for
first-class passengers, who pay about $9,000 for roundtrip
trans-Atlantic slumber. Within the next several months, business
travelers will have comparable cots at about half the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Within three years, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic will
spend about $800 million between them to improve premium service,
beyond a $10 billion plan to buy new jets. British Airways predicts
that its new bed will increase its share of business travelers
between the United States and London, one of the industry's most
profitable routes, by almost 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Flat-lying beds are cherished perks, since few business
travelers have sampled them. A typical British Airways flight from
New York to London has only 14 single beds that are sold as
first-class seats. By reconfiguring business class with new beds,
which are less private than the first-class models, an additional
70 passengers can have them.
</P>
<P>
   In-flight beds on routes across the Pacific are almost
exclusively reserved for first-class passengers. British Airways
said that its business-class bed will be installed on all long-haul
flights, including those to Asia, within the next 18 months. ``One
reason that you are seeing all these improvements among the
airlines now is that the environment has become so competitive,''
said Carl Michel, head of the commercial group for British Airways.
``On some routes, passengers can choose between 10 airlines. ''
</P>
<P>
   The airlines have a long history with beds, even though some
industry executives want to pass them off as new amenities. In the
1930s, the Douglas Sleeper Transport, which was used on long night
flights, carried as many as 16 people in sleeping berths that were
about 3 feet wide and almost 6 1/2 feet long. MGM Grand Air, which
was controlled by Kirk Kerkorian and operated primarily between Los
Angeles and New York, had private compartments in the late 1980s,
with seats that folded into double beds.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, beds disappeared to make room for more seats,
lofting airline revenue. The trend to drop amenities has reversed
recently, with airlines conjuring up new luxuries to lure
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Several major airlines _ including British Airways, Qantas and
Singapore _ have private pods with seats that convert into single
beds as part of first- class service. Such posh features have begun
to drift down into business-class cabins. Passengers who book an
upper-class seat, the equivalent to British Airways' business
class, on any Virgin Atlantic flight can be buffed up by a masseuse
and manicurist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The carriers keep raising the bar in terms of their premium
cabin product,'' said Sam Buttrick, an airline analyst at
PaineWebber. ``The leading- edge business class at its inception
was an enhanced coach. But many business classes are now better
than what was offered in some first-class cabins five or six years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   First class these days tends to be the domain of top corporate
executives, royalty, entertainers and the super rich, with other
affluent people choosing business class.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines are not neglecting economy-class passengers
entirely. Some are adding videos to the backs of seats and making
chairs more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways and Virgin Atlantic conducted extensive research
in developing their beds. Branson said that passengers appreciate
his airlines' luxuries so much that they go out of their way to try
them. About half of Virgin's passengers are willing to be wakened
just to have a complimentary manicure, Branson said.
</P>
<P>
   To introduce the double bed, which will be about 4 1/2 feet wide
and slightly more than 6 feet long, Branson will create a
first-class cabin, which will require that he buy larger jets to
get the extra space.
</P>
<P>
   Branson jokes that the private double berths will herald a new
era for in-flight sex. ``We are legitimizing the mile-high club,''
he said. But he believes that 90 percent of his double-bed
customers will be business travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these people who buy the bed tickets will be
executives trying to get from point A to point B,'' Branson said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, Virgin will also introduce a seat that
converts into a bed for upper-class passengers. Branson admits that
the seat does not lie fully flat, which has already earned snickers
from British Airways executives.
</P>
<P>
   While the Virgin Atlantic recliner will remain in straight rows
of two within the cabin, British Airways will couple its new
business-class beds like lounge chairs. Some will face forward and
others backward.
</P>
<P>
   In part of the bed, British Airways will include an electrical
outlet, so that passengers can use their computers longer, and a
phone. After passengers griped about standing in line to get their
baggage, British Airlines will allow its business travelers to
carry on 41 pounds of luggage, double what they were allowed
before.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of in-flight bunks has ignited the rivalry
between Virgin Atlantic and British Airways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of Virgin's double bed is a marketing gimmick,'' said
Michel. ``Richard Branson has been promising that for years. The
real argument against a double bed is that couples rarely travel
together on business. What happens when one wants to stay up and
the other wants to lie down?''
</P>
<P>
   Affable on most matters, Branson turns almost icy when talking
about his London rival. Noting that British Airways may lose
millions of dollars this year _ the airline's earnings have
declined in recent quarters _ Branson said ``that just shows that
you get your just deserts when you don't keep your quality up.''
</P>
<P>
   More elaborate luxuries are on the way. Airbus said that its
proposed new jumbo jet, which can hold more than 500 passengers,
could be equipped to include several lounges and sleeping
compartments.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways may one day hold parties in its cargo holds. The
airline said it was considering converting some cargo space into a
cinema.

<P>
   FUNDS WATCH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Portfolio That Puts Its Eggs in One Basket &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to closed-end funds, it pays to look at what's
under the hood. Exhibit A is Engex, an American Stock
Exchange-traded fund whose stock price has risen 190 percent in the
last three months, to $40.
</P>
<P>
   Behind those extraordinary results is a portfolio consisting
almost entirely of a single, volatile biotechnology stock, Enzo
Biochem of Farmingdale, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Engex, like many closed-end funds, leverages its portfolio, in
this case borrowing money to get higher returns. Enzo's stock,
which now trades at $89.25, is up more than ten fold percent from
its 52-week low of $8 last April, as biotechnology stocks have
soared.
</P>
<P>
   As of Engex's latest shareholder report, on Sept. 30, the fund
owned the equivalent of $14.5 million of Enzo; because of the
fund's leverage, that stake is worth more than the fund's total
assets of $13.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's concentration is very unusual, said Thomas J.
Herzfeld, an investment adviser in Miami. ``It's the only time that
I've ever seen a closed-end fund make such a heavy bet on one
company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Engex's investment objective is unusual, too, judging from its
annual report, issued Nov. 29. While it aims to buy shares in
emerging-growth companies and undervalued or turnaround stocks, it
seeks over the long term to own majority stakes in new and small
companies; its ultimate goal is to deregister as a closed-end fund.
So Engex operates more as a holding company, according to Herzfeld,
who owns a large position in Engex but has been taking profits
recently.
</P>
<P>
   J. Morton Davis, chairman of the fund and president of D.H.
Blair Investment Banking, a Manhattan brokerage firm, together with
his wife, holds nearly 35 percent of the fund, according to a Nov.
30 proxy statement.
</P>
<P>
   Enzo Biochem, for its part, is involved in medical diagnostics.
It has two products in clinical trials, for treatment of HIV and
hepatitis B.
</P>
<P>
   An analyst, Evan Sturza of Sturza Medical Research in Manhattan,
is skeptical about its prospects. ``It's a bubble,'' he said. ``It
is a diagnostics company and in the grand scheme of things that is
one of the least-exciting sectors of health care. Investors are
making a mistake in bidding up the share price more than 10
times.''

   What Elections Mean to Markets &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire primary is two days away, and the presidential
campaign season is in full swing. But even without knowing the
ultimate winner, investors can hazard a guess as to what this
election year means for stock investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Election years, while not as good as pre-election years, are
generally up years for the market,'' said Sheldon Jacobs,
editor-in-chief of The No-Load Fund Investor, a newsletter based in
Irvington-on-Hudson, N.Y. He points out that this has been the case
since 1940, with the Dow Jones industrials gaining 6.9 percent, on
average, during the last 15 presidential election years. In only 4
of those 15 did the Dow lose ground.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-election years did far better, gaining 15.9 percent, on
average, over that time _ and there were no instances in which the
Dow lost ground. In the years immediately after elections, the
benchmark gained just 4.7 percent, on average, and lost money 7 out
of 15 times. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Do investors really need another online broker? Sure, says Brent
H. Bessire, chief operating officer of Intltrader.com of Winter
Park, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The firm, billing itself as the only ``truly global'' online
brokerage firm, opened on Wednesday, and Bessire said it would
build its business by catering to clients who trade foreign stocks.
</P>
<P>
   For example, some online brokers allow investors in foreign
companies to trade only in American depository receipts. Many do
not provide price quotations on foreign stocks, and when they do,
the quotations are often delayed and denominated in foreign
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Bessire, 30, said Intltrader.com would provide investors with
quicker executions and more timely, dollar-denominated quotations.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign stock trades cost $29.99 for up to 5,000 foreign shares;
domestic trades cost $14.99 for market orders of up to 5,000
shares, and $19.99 for limit orders. &QL;

 &HT;    Snow reports hit or miss for the South
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There was enough snow Friday for sleds _ if you could
buy one _ in Mississippi, Arkansas and northwestern Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   But in other spots of the Deep South, like Birmingham and
Montgomery, they were using umbrellas for nothing but rain by
lunchtime after an early sprinkling of snow. As in most of Georgia,
a day full of promised snow for many parts of the South turned into
a little white lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been lame,'' groused Patrick Farren, the manager of
John's restaurant in downtown Birmingham. ``The weathermen here are
nothing but this side of carney men who just showboat and
grandstand and tell us how bad the weather's going to be _ and we
didn't have the first freeway close.''
</P>
<P>
   Farren had only 30 percent of his normal lunch crowd, lawyers
and government workers who took Friday off.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines on Friday canceled flights from Nashville and Memphis
as fans of the Tennessee Titans tried to make it to Sunday's Super
Bowl at the Georgia Dome. In Oxford, Miss., snow Friday added to 5
inches already on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   And there was still the threat of snow _ or at least a mess of
ice _ in Georgia, Alabama and the Carolinas as temperatures dropped
Friday night. The possibility of severe winter weather was expected
to remain through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina Friday, Gov. Jim Hunt asked President Clinton
to declare 26 counties in the state a disaster area. A winter storm
earlier this week deposited a record 20 inches of snow on parts of
the state. Officials estimate they've spent more than $16.5 million
responding to that storm.
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heel State still is recovering from Hurricane Floyd,
which caused an estimated $6 billion in damage _ much of it
uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   In Arkansas, the National Guard rescued more than a thousand
motorists stranded on Interstate 30 when more than a foot of snow
finished falling by Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just came on so fast. There was no way to know we were
going to be trapped,'' said Betty Hagan, traveling from Illinois to
her home in Dallas. ''I spent the first 35 years in Illinois and
I've never been trapped like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing like that happened in Birmingham, where parts of the
city had 4 inches of snow by Friday morning. The northwest corner
of Alabama had up to 6 inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The snow's all melting,'' said Lela Warren, revenue manager of
the Tutwiler hotel in Birmingham. ``It's just a rainy day. People
are driving and everything is clear.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tutwiler booked all 147 of its rooms Thursday night as
people heeded warnings that the South's second winter storm in a
week could make driving treacherous. By Friday morning, many people
were checking out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good news when you consider what the projections were,''
said Scott Adcock, spokesman for the Alabama Emergency Management
Agency. ``But this is still a winter storm. With the possibility of
icing, driving conditions are very hazardous.''
</P>
<P>
   Drier air from a high-pressure system near Chicago wrung out and
weakened the winter storm as it slogged through Alabama Friday. At
its height, the winter mix led to the death of a motorist in
Mississippi and at least four in Texas on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters, however, warned that the system may re-energize
overnight, making more frozen precipitation possible in northern
Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and the Carolinas this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of precipitation is still a big, big question, said
forecaster Jonathan Blaes at the National Weather Service's
Raleigh, N.C., office. ``We could have a big frozen-precipitation
event. Everything out there is frozen. Put a little water on there,
and it will freeze. It could become a dicey situation.''
</P>
<P>
   That's hardly the forecast people east of Charlotte, N.C.,
wanted to hear, where most of the 40,000 homes and businesses still
without electricity on Friday morning are located. In the small
community of Troy, Ann Long went grocery shopping for the first
time since the Monday deluge. It was beautiful at first, like a
plate from Courier &AMP; Ives, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then it started to look a little like a monster,'' Long
said. ``And I thought it's amazing how fast something that is so
pretty can turn into something so ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   As Dixie dug out from the uncommon winter storm, a Wisconsin
company recalled 27,000 of its snowblowers because of leaks in a
fuel-line connection. The Ariens Co. recalled five models of the
SS332 and SS522 orange Ariens units and the LSS522 green Lesco
model, according to the U.S. Product Safety Commission. The
snowblowers have been sold in retail outlets, including
Atlanta-based Home Depot, since July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Snowblowers would come in handy in the middle of Arkansas, where
more than 12 inches of snow fell in Arkadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Bettis Hardware sold all 40 of its plastic, $9 True Value sleds.
The store also ran out of de-icing chemicals. It sold fertilizer
Friday to do the job instead.
</P>
<P>
   Clerk Denise Bettis said Friday that customers weren't bothering
to buy winter supplies like propane or candles. She also couldn't
move many of the store's insulated overalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stocked up for Y2K so they have all the fuels and
batteries,'' Bettis said. ``Everybody stocked up for Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   Bettis estimated there were 14 inches on the ground.
``Everything's white,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Piggly Wiggly on Main Street, four people staffed the
store.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're buying any kind of bread,'' manager Terry Dixon said.
``We're out of regular bread so we're trying to steer them toward
brown-and-serve rolls.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon measured 13 1/2 inches of snow in his front yard. As he
drove around in his four-wheel drive Jeep, he saw few snowmen in
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``There haven't even been a whole lot of snowball fights,'' he
said, ``because they can't pack it good enough, the snow's so
dry.''

CHINA FREES SCHOLAR WHO WORKED IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Pa.)  (jw) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A U.S.-based scholar detained in China for more than
five months on vague charges of ``providing confidential materials
to foreigners'' was released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The scholar, Song Yongyi, a research librarian at Dickinson
College in Carlisle, Pa., was detained in August while collecting
documents concerning the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution that are
widely available in markets and curio shops.
</P>
<P>
   He was formally charged last month with ``the purchase and
illegal provision of intelligence to foreigners,'' a move that
alarmed academics overseas, who saw a threat to research activities
in China, as well as American politicians. Together, the two groups
waged a vigorous campaign to gain the release of Song, a Chinese
citizen who had been scheduled to become an American citizen weeks
after he had been detained.
</P>
<P>
   At 9 p.m. Friday, Song, still in a Beijing State Security Bureau
office, used his brother's cellular telephone to call his wife in
Pennsylvania to say that he was being freed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so excited, but it was so strange I couldn't believe
it,'' said his wife, Helen Yao, who added that she and Dickinson
officials had spent a few hours trying to confirm that the call was
accurate. Ms. Yao said she had been given no reason for the
release.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued later by the Chinese Embassy in Washington
said Song had been shown ``leniency'' and not prosecuted because he
had admitted his ``criminal activities'' and had volunteered
information about the ``illegal activities of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yao said that in their phone conversation Song had insisted
that he had ``never confessed to a crime _ no, never.''
</P>
<P>
   Song's lawyers have said all along that he was in China
collecting materials about the Cultural Revolution as part of his
job. They denied that involved anything criminal.
</P>
<P>
   The ``leniency'' release is a bittersweet victory for many of
Song's dogged supporters, who saw his predicament as a test case
not only for academic freedom, but also for legal reform in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the state of the process of Chinese judicial reform,''
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said, ``I think it would be too much to
expect that they'd admit to having made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter had sponsored a congressional resolution to demand that
Song be freed, and he received the first official news of the
release at a scheduled meeting with the Chinese ambassador to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government has frequently released political
dissidents on medical grounds to rid itself of prisoners whose
cases had become public relations problems. Although Song, 50, has
bladder cancer, the authorities did not choose that.
</P>
<P>
   Specter and others said the mounting pressure had been extremely
effective. China is working to join the World Trade Organization,
action that indirectly requires congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the government of China thought that his
detention caused more problems than it was worth,'' Specter said.
``If China wants to come into the community of trade, it has to pay
attention to things like the norms of criminal practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal advisers on the case said China's leaders probably also
wanted to avoid a trial that would have been embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   ``His detention was basically unfair, and the Chinese
appreciated that once it was brought to the attention of people at
a sufficiently high level,'' said Jerome Cohen, an adviser who is
an expert on Chinese law. ``They were responding to immediate
pressure. But they were also responding to the weakness of their
case against Song and the light this case would shed on the
problems and weaknesses of China's criminal procedure code.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Song have complained that he was denied rights
guaranteed under Chinese criminal laws while he was detained. He
was not allowed to see a lawyer, for example, despite repeated
requests.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, when his 37 days of legally sanctioned detention ended
without formal charges, he should have been released, Cohen said.
Instead, he was held for months in the basement of a State Security
Bureau in what the police called ``supervised residence.''
</P>
<P>
   Song's lawyers said that they had collected evidence that some
of the documents used to charge him had been planted and that there
were plans to present them at his trial.
</P>
<P>
   Song became the object of a huge petition drive by scholars on
four continents. They said their ability to conduct research in
China would be severely compromised if Song's case stood as a
precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional delegations traveling in China relentlessly
pressed for the release. This week, after a Foreign Ministry
spokesman had announced that Song had confessed and would face
trial on the more serious charge of ``undermining national
security,'' some politicians suggested that the case could affect
the WTO application.
</P>
<P>
   Specter introduced a bill this week to give Song American
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yao said her husband had not been aware of the campaign on
his behalf.

SURVEY REFLECTS FRUSTRATION, MORALE PROBLEMS AMONG NAVY JUNIOR
OFFICERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVERETT NAVAL STATION, Wash. _ Poor leadership. Commanders
micro-managing their subordinates, fearing that a single mistake
will kill a military career. Endless inspections and paperwork. A
work environment where hard work and honesty go unrewarded.
</P>
<P>
   When the Navy last fall surveyed several thousand junior
officers in what's known as the ``surface'' Navy _ the component
that operates all surface warships and supply vessels except for
aircraft carriers _ they knew that morale problems existed.
</P>
<P>
   But they were stunned by the outpouring of frustration and anger
in the ranks, particularly against the quality of leadership in
today's Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrific angst was created in the fleet'' by a decade of
turmoil and downsizing, Capt. Roy Chapple, the chief of staff at
Navy Region Northwest, said in an interview. ``We went away from
warriors and came out with a group of careerists who were
risk-adverse ... afraid to make hard decisions,'' said Chapple, who
has commanded three surface warships during his 29-year career.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy anticipated about 15 percent of the 4,524 junior
officers surveyed _ all the ensigns, lieutenants (junior grade) and
lieutenants assigned to the surface warfare community _ would fill
out the questionnaires. Instead, Navy officials said a
``remarkable'' 55 percent responded.
</P>
<P>
   Many were from the Puget Sound area, where the surface Navy is a
major presence with six warships assigned to Everett and four
combat support ships in Bremerton. Overall, there are about 30,000
Navy personnel assigned to bases in the region, making it the
third-largest naval complex in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The sour mood reflected in the survey could have grave
consequences, Chapple said. With a booming economy and good
civilian jobs for the taking, the Navy already is facing a crisis
in attracting college students into various officer training
programs, and in trying to keep enough junior officers in the
service.
</P>
<P>
   To maintain the correct mix of mid-rank officers, the Navy needs
to persuade 38 percent of lieutenants nearing the end of their
obligated tour of service (usually four years) to sign up for
another term. But fewer than one-third of those surveyed say they
plan to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Those entering the Navy in the past six years are even less
inclined to stay than older officers commissioned earlier. About 69
percent of those commissioned in 1990 favor a naval career,
compared to just 21 percent of those commissioned in 1998, the
survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Matt Armas is one of those surveyed. He said he plans to
leave the Navy when his hitch is up, this summer.
</P>
<P>
   A 27-year-old Naval Academy graduate who commutes from Seattle
to his staff job at Naval Surface Group Northwest headquarters each
day, Armas for the past five years has had an experience that
typifies the turmoil generated in part by defense cutbacks that
have reduced Navy personnel by 50 percent since the mid-1980s: four
separate assignments on three separate ships and the Everett
headquarters, and three separate deployments.
</P>
<P>
   ``What hit me the hardest was the time away from home,'' said
Armas, who is married.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone joining the Navy can expect to spend lots of time at sea,
but the unrelenting demand for Navy ships in non-combat missions
such as peacekeeping and counter-drug operations has made a
stressful situation even worse, Armas said.
</P>
<P>
   He served on the Everett-based guided missile frigate USS Ford
for 17 months in 1996-97, including a six-month deployment to the
Persian Gulf. When he returned Armas transferred to the
Bremerton-based cruiser USS California and immediately left for two
months in the eastern Pacific patrolling for drug smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   The California was decommissioned in September 1998 and Armas
joined a third command, the ammunition ship USS Mount Hood _ and
soon was on his way to the western Pacific for another three
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got bounced a bit,'' said Armas. ``I've enjoyed my
experiences a lot, but I want to have a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Ens. Curtis Young, 30, said he remains committed to a 30-year
military career (he served two tours as an enlisted man before
gaining a commission). He said the Navy is beginning to make
progress in attacking the roots of the current malaise.
</P>
<P>
   But he quickly can cite his own frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   As the electrical division officer on the Everett-based USS Paul
Foster, Young was responsible for running what the Navy calls the
``personal electrical safety program.'' It was a time-consuming
effort in which Young's sailors had to inspect every personal
electronic device owned by the destroyer's 325-member crew _ from
CD players to electrical razors to Walkman receivers _ then assign
each device an identification number and tag it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to prepare planning lists of people with upcoming
inspections,'' he said. ``We had to coordinate with other
departments for the timing. We had to publish the names in the
ship's Plan of the Day.'' He shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   The program consumed ``hundreds'' of man-hours of work each year
for no apparent reason, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt.(j.g.) Rick Potter cited the steam valve in the galley of the
USS Chandler as emblematic of the Navy's woes. The valve, designed
to funnel steam heat for the cooking ovens on the ship, was worn
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't work, it leaked, it broke,'' Potter said. ``I
couldn't fix it. We'd have to take it apart, weld it, put it back
together. It would break again.''
</P>
<P>
   For lack of $4,000 to buy a replacement, Potter said he and his
sailors were forced to spend hours engaged in hot, sweaty work that
was doomed to failure, Potter said. ``I was telling them to fix it
and I knew they couldn't fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the survey, junior officers complained that they are
overworked by superiors so fearful of error that junior officers
are given no chance to demonstrate initiative or leadership.
</P>
<P>
   A large majority said they were not receiving the support they
need from their commanders. This leadership failure spanned a gamut
of issues from inadequate spare parts and training ammunition to an
overall ``zero defects'' mentality in the unit where the slightest
mistake is viewed as a career-ending incident.
</P>
<P>
   Chapple said he is optimistic that the Navy's senior leadership
is making progress to improve the quality of life and the
traditions of initiative and leadership in which the Navy takes
pride. The service has already stopped some inspections found to be
unnecessary, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A 4.8 percent pay raise approved by Congress went into effect on
Jan. 1, marking the first time in years that service people have
begun to recapture earning power lost in the 1990s when salaries
failed to keep up with inflation. Initiatives aimed at giving
qualified young officers opportunity for early promotion and
command have been implemented, as well as a special bonus of up to
$50,000 for surface warfare officers signing up for another five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Adm. Ed Moore, commander of Pacific Fleet surface forces,
said such initiatives have had ``a positive effect on both morale
and retention'' among junior officers. ``Although we must continue
to look for ways to make a Navy career more satisfying to our
Surface Warriors, the outlook is good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said the low percentage of poll recipients indicating
interest in a career is ``not a cause for alarm'' because many
officers do not decide to stay in or get out until late in their
four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Chapple said the turnaround effort still has a long way to go,
including showing junior officers that they can advance in a
shrinking Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always told our youngsters that the brass ring is within
their reach,'' Chapple said. ``Only today, it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Some findings of Navy survey of junior officers
</P>
<P>
   Negative
</P>
<P>
   82 percent: Workload too heavy while ship in port or routine
training
</P>

   80 percent: Civilian employment options are better

ANALYSIS: CLINTON REFRAMES GUN ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton's proposal to license all new handgun buyers
is unlikely to get through Congress and would be even harder to
implement around the country. But the president has stepped onto
what many regard as the next battleground for gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Licensing gun buyers, the way automobile drivers are licensed,
is anathema to the National Rifle Association, just as gun
registration is. But it is the kind of easily understandable,
potentially appealing strategy that gun control researchers and
advocates have lacked since they finally won passage of the Brady
Law in 1994. That law, named for James Brady, the press secretary
who was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt on President
Ronald Reagan, established a nationwide system of background checks
for handgun purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think this is a one-year battle,'' said Bob Walker,
the president of Handgun Control, the Washington group founded by
Brady and his wife, Sarah. ``We certainly don't think Congress will
adopt gun licensing this year. But it took us seven years to pass
the Brady bill, and gun licensing, while it could take another five
to seven years, is a winnable battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many Americans believe that gun licensing and gun
registration are much the same thing, gun experts see them as very
different. Gun licenses apply to the person buying the gun, while
registration provides information about the gun itself. Under
federal law, backed by the NRA, it is illegal to maintain any gun
registry.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of licensing say it could help reduce gun crimes and
accidental shootings in several ways. Under Clinton's proposal,
every handgun buyer would have to undergo a background check and
pass a gun safety course in order to obtain a license with a
photograph, much like a driver's license. If the gun safety course
was substantive, it could help weed out some violent or mentally
ill people who now are not detected in background checks, some
experts said in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The requirement to obtain a license might also deter gun
traffickers and straw buyers, or those who buy guns to resell them
to criminals or juveniles. And the power to revoke a license might
also provide law enforcement with a tool for confiscating handguns
from people who are convicted of crimes, something that the police
cannot do now. That is, once a person passes a background check and
buys a gun, there is little law enforcement officials can do about
getting the gun away from the person if he or she later commits a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond opposition from the NRA, which opposes any requirement
for Americans to be licensed to own guns, establishing an effective
system to enforce the licensing process state by state would be an
immense bureaucratic challenge. Even now, the background checks
required by the Brady Law are often incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   But the main benefit from Clinton's proposal may well be
providing a convenient issue for gun-control groups to take up as a
coalition, said Dr. Garren Wintemute, the director of the Violence
Prevention Research Program at the University of California at
Davis and an emergency-room physician.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this means to me is that President Clinton may have found
a way to take a closer look at people who are buying guns, and his
proposal could be a way to broaden the criteria for people who are
prohibited from buying guns.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, only criminals convicted of felonies are currently
excluded from buying handguns. But Wintemute has found that people
with misdemeanor convictions who buy guns legally are much more
likely to commit a violent crime than are other gun buyers.
</P>
<P>
   There seems little chance that Clinton's proposal, which would
require an act of Congress to set up a federally backed but
state-operated licensing system, will pass the House or Senate this
year. Last year Congress was unable to pass a bill supported by
Clinton, but opposed by the NRA, to require background checks on
all handgun purchases at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   And some gun control advocates question whether Clinton's
proposal would even add anything to current background check law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at a loss to understand what it adds to the current
system,'' said Kristen Rand, director of federal policy at the
Violence Policy Center in Washington, a gun control research and
advocacy group that generally takes a more radical approach than
Handgun Control.
</P>
<P>
   The analogy between a driver's license and a gun license
``certainly appeals to people,'' Ms. Rand said. But it wasn't
driver's licenses that reduced deaths in car accidents, she added.
It was changes in car design, like seat belts and air bags.
</P>
<P>
   A critical question is whether under Clinton's proposal the
states would maintain information they collected about handgun
owners, said David Kennedy, a senior researcher at the John F.
Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Reed, who advises Clinton on domestic policy, said that
under the proposal, the information on people who get gun licenses
would not be recorded for law enforcement. Such a system,
maintaining a file on every gun that is sold, would be gun
registration, and is even more offensive to the National Rifle
Association than licensing.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice president of the association,
said that Clinton had made a huge political mistake with his
proposal, and, ``I think Al Gore will pay for it at election
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's rival for the Democratic presidential
nomination, supports both gun licensing and gun registration. Gore
has called only for gun licensing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 80 million Americans who own guns, and to them, the
right to own a firearm is a fundamental freedom,'' LaPierre said.
``It's in the Bill of Rights. It's the same as the right to speak,
or freedom of religion. Imagine how people would react if they
needed a license to go to church.''
</P>
<P>
   To LaPierre, Clinton's proposal is like ``a knock on the door in
the middle of the night,'' a sign of further government measures to
come to take away gun owners' constitutional rights, not a crime
control policy.

THE LEASING OF SOFTWARE: LESSONS FROM THE CAR LOFT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 30) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Calif. Wash., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By WILLIAM SANTIAGO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vincent A. McCord had a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Conner Technology, where McCord is vice president and chief
financial officer, was starting up in the hard-drive manufacturing
business and needed a lot of expensive software to get rolling:
$500,000 of applications in finance, sales, distribution and
manufacturing, and $600,000 in consulting and integration services
to make it all work together.
</P>
<P>
   But laying out that much up front was not a viable option, and
neither was borrowing the money through traditional channels, since
almost no bank accepts software as collateral or makes an unsecured
loan to a start-up company.
</P>
<P>
   The solution McCord found was what is known, a bit loosely, as a
software lease, arranged through a new financing division set up by
the Oracle Corp., the vendor whose software Conner had chosen.
</P>
<P>
   The terms are somewhat like those of an automobile lease: Conner
makes regular payments over three years, at 11.5 percent interest,
uses the software and can keep it forever afterward if it chooses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without financing, we would have had to dedicate over a
million dollars of cash to the transaction,'' said McCord, whose
company began operating in March 1998. ``And it would have been a
much weightier decision. We would have had to go at it much more
slowly. This enabled us to start with a much faster ramp.''
</P>
<P>
   Software leasing, which has become increasingly common in the
last few years, was unheard of a decade ago. Vendors and lenders
alike were long leery of financing software because of its
intangible nature: if a customer stops paying, there is no
practical way to repossess the leased product, and the deal can be
a total loss to the lender.
</P>
<P>
   But with the transformation of the business landscape by
technology in the 1990s came important changes. Companies began to
depend ever more heavily on software, which has grown steadily more
expensive and now claims a greater share of most companies'
information technology spending than hardware does.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, software vendors came to realize that they
were missing out on potentially lucrative sales to small and
midsize companies that could not handle the usual cash-up-front
sales terms _ including the burgeoning number of start-ups diving
into Internet commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the demand for financing is greater,'' said John B. Brooke,
senior director of global business development for Oracle's
financing division.
</P>
<P>
   That demand is being met primarily by special financing arms of
computer hardware and software companies like Oracle and IBM that
arrange leases for customers with third-party lenders, much the way
that car dealers do. It is also common for customers to line up
financing ahead of time with third-party lenders like LPI Software
Funding Group of Wayne, Pa., before shopping for software, much
like prequalifying for a home mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, ``software leasing'' is a misnomer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not a lease at all,'' said Hal Hayden, director of
strategic sales with CapitalStream, a Seattle-based company that
sells a program allowing lenders and software companies to keep
track of such agreements. ``It's nothing more than a finance
agreement that allows a customer to pay for software over time.''
</P>
<P>
   What is being financed is a nonexclusive, nontransferable
perpetual user license, in amounts from $5,000 to $10 million, for
three- to five-year terms, said Mark Bazrod, president of LPI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on the credit of the company and the size of the
transaction,'' he said, ``interest rates can vary from 8 to 16
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The benefits for the customer go beyond freeing cash reserves
and spreading out costs over time. Software leases generally leave
the company's existing lines of credit untapped and available for
other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   And the lease arrangement lets the customer treat software as a
monthly operational cost rather than as a capital purchase. That
can have budgeting and administrative advantages. Installation,
maintenance, training, periodic upgrades and other services can
also be swept into the same lease and paid for with a predictable
monthly payment.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge demand for project financing,'' said Sam
Khanna, vice president for software and service business
development at IBM Global Financing, which focuses on offering
comprehensive, software-heavy financing packages to companies
switching to e-business models. ``But they don't want to pay for it
piecemeal'' in separate transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The main disadvantage, as with any credit purchase, is the added
cost of interest. Yet in as many as a quarter of all leases,
software vendors, for competitive reasons, discount the purchase
price to offset all or part of the financing costs.
</P>
<P>
   If a customer defaults on payments, software vendors can cut off
support and service. The only other recourse a lender has against a
deadbeat customer is a breach-of-contract lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   National accounting guidelines established in 1997 discourage
vendors from financing leases themselves, because of concerns that
some vendors may have been ``inflating their reported revenue, by
forgiving debt at the end of the lease terms, to maintain customer
relationships,'' said John Dirks, of PricewaterhouseCoopers in San
Francisco, who helped draft the guidelines. Instead, vendors
connect customers with third-party lenders or sell the leases to
third parties after arranging them.
</P>
<P>
   As widespread as software leasing has become, most federally
regulated commercial banks still steer clear, judging the concept
too risky. Citicorp, for instance, prefers to lend on hardware it
can repossess and sell in a pinch, ``because, really, at the end of
the day, software is worth nothing,'' said Sally Wunsch, a
saleswoman with Citicorp's commercial financing division in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few banks to try the idea is Silicon Valley Bank in
California, but it limits its leases to software it sees as
``mission-critical'' for the customer. ``In software, we don't take
title,'' said Philip Johnson, senior vice president of the bank.
``We get comfortable with the fact that the software is running the
business, that it's necessary to them, and that they're going to
make their payments as they would their electric bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the extra uncertainty in offering software leasing to
start-ups, very few lenders cater to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Software leasing itself is risky, and providing it for
venture-backed start-up companies, typically unprofitable and big
credit risks in themselves, is even riskier,'' said Jim Labe,
president of Comdisco Ventures, a division of Comdisco, a Menlo
Park, Calif., technology management company. ``You can lose your
shirt.'' So qualifying for any sort of software lease, he added,
requires a much more rigorous assessment of the customer than the
usual credit check.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk to investors, research their markets and technologies,
talk to industry analysts, do reference checks on senior
management,'' Labe said. To mitigate risk further, he added, ``the
terms are shorter and the interest rates are much higher on
software than on a lease or loan for equipment'' alone.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that finance software leases to new businesses usually
protect themselves in one more way: with a piece of the start-up.
Terms often call for a the lender to get warrants good for stock
worth 2 percentto 5 percent of the amount being financed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a little equity,'' Labe said, ``as an added kicker for
the extra risk involved.''

   LONDONDERRY, N.H. _ Locked in a tight race with Sen. John McCain
four days before the nation's first primary, Gov. George W. Bush
has taken steps to cushion himself against a possible loss here by
intensifying advertising and organizational efforts in states where
he had not planned such heavy early investments.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few days, Bush campaign officials said they
purchased advertising time on radio stations in Delaware in advance
of the Republican primary there on Feb. 8, and pumped additional
money into an advertising drive in South Carolina, which holds its
primary Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign had not planned a large-scale effort in
Delaware. But campaign officials said they changed course to assure
as potent a victory there as possible so if Bush loses in New
Hampshire it would not appear that his support is eroding in states
with subsequent contests.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those efforts, which Bush advisers described as an
insurance policy, officials said they believe a victory in New
Hampshire is within reach, despite most polls showing that McCain
is ahead. To that end, the Bush campaign stepped up its purchase of
advertising on Boston television in a final push that also includes
telephone calls and mailings aimed at Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   On one station in Boston, for example, the Bush campaign has
purchased an addition $50,000 of broadcast time for this weekend,
on top of more than $100,000 previously purchased.
</P>
<P>
   To convey a daily sense of momentum _ and try to dominate the
news _ the Bush campaign has been pulling out big names to appear
with the governor on the stump. On Saturday, the campaign was
planning a surprise appearance by former President George Bush, who
was to appear at his son's side at a concert of country singer
Travis Tritt in Milford, N.H. Friday, former Gov. John Sununu
endorsed Bush; on Thursday, it was Jack F. Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   In another attempt to come on vigorously in the final weekend,
Bush's advisers said they were considering broadcasting a
commercial that would contrast his tax-cutting plan with McCain's.
The advertisement would feature a clip of a moment from a debate
where McCain said of Clinton's tax-cutting plan: ``Maybe President
Clinton's looks too much like mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers said they had to move this week to shore up
their organizations in Delaware and South Carolina as a precaution
because by Tuesday if would be too late _ in the event that Bush
loses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, when we wake up Wednesday morning we've got to be
ready to shift ground quickly if necessary,'' said one senior
adviser to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Trying, perhaps, to play down expectations, several advisers
said they feared that Bush had not completely recovered from his
failure to campaign more aggressively in this state last year _ and
his failure to mix more with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is truly running a national campaign,'' said Gov. John
Engler of Michigan, an adviser to Bush, who noted that McCain has
concentrated his resources here. ``He's now trying to play catch-up
in New Hampshire.'' He added: ``We are competing everywhere. But I
don't think the people of Michigan are sitting at the edge of their
chairs to find out what the people of New Hampshire think.''
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Bush said they were confident that his campaign has
the resources and endorsements around the country to outlast McCain
even if the senator triumphs on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, John McCain has to win New Hampshire,'' said Ralph
Reed, a Bush adviser. ``We want to win. But he has to win. Whatever
the outcome, we fight on and, at some point, he runs out of supply
lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Other advisers to the governor said they were increasingly
concerned that if Bush loses here and does not perform
overwhelmingly in subsequent states, that could undermine his
biggest selling point among many Republicans: that he has the
popularity to win in the general election. In fact, a Wall Street
Journal/NBC News poll published Friday found that Vice President Al
Gore _ coming on strong after his easy win over Bill Bradley in the
Iowa caucuses on Monday _ is now in a dead heat with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   While Steve Forbes, the wealthy magazine publisher, placed
second to Bush in the Iowa caucuses, Bush advisers said they were
far more concerned about McCain. Ultimately, they said, they do not
believe Forbes is electable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time we gave a nomination to a person who was not
elected to anything was Eisenhower _ and he won World War II,''
Engler said. ``It's not going to happen. It's a Bush-McCain race.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dave Carney, a Republican strategist here who worked for
President Bush, said of the governor's efforts here, ``It should
have been put away a long time ago.'' But, he added, ``This week,
he's had the best week he's had.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Bush's advisers said they are concerned that Forbes,
with his deep pockets, could spend enough on television commercials
to wound them _ as he did with Bob Dole here four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Dal Col, Forbes' campaign manager, dismissed McCain as
not having the resources to be competitive down the road.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's success in this state _ as measured by the polls and by
the huge crowds he is attracting _ has begun to frustrate some Bush
aides. They particularly expressed concern about McCain's
suggestion that Bush is not as prepared to be president. At the
headquarters in Austin, some Bush workers refer to McCain's bus,
the ``Straight Talk Express,'' as the ``Double Talk Express.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the drive to beat McCain on Tuesday, the Bush
campaign is counting on the strength of the campaign apparatus of
Sen. Judd Gregg. But Mike Murphy, an adviser to McCain, said the
ability of the Gregg organization to deliver voters to the polls on
election day is vastly overstated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't even deliver a pizza,'' he said.

BRADLEY BACKS AWAY FROM A CAMPAIGN FINANCE ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JAMES DAO with KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, N.H. _ A day after some of his top aides said he was
likely to attack Vice President Al Gore for campaign finance
abuses, former Sen. Bill Bradley held back his toughest punches
Friday and instead accused Gore of being dishonest on the issues of
abortion and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   At an event intended to appeal to New Hampshire's large number
of independent voters, Bradley picked up the endorsement of former
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut, a Republican turned
independent. He then proceeded to attack Gore's integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do great things if we don't have a politics that drags
us down,'' Bradley told a crowd of more than 250 people that
gathered in an old opera house here, just four days from New
Hampshire's Democratic primary, the first in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley stopped short of mentioning Gore's aggressive fund
raising for the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996, as some of his aides
had predicted he would. Many people consider the issue to be Gore's
greatest political liability, largely because Attorney General
Janet Reno has investigated fund-raising phone calls made by
President Clinton and Gore from the White House. She decided there
was no evidence of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to avoid criticizing Gore about those events
reflected disagreements among Bradley's top advisers over how to
approach a potentially potent, and contentious, line of attack
against the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   It also suggested that Bradley's advisers, and Bradley himself,
remain uncertain about how far they want to take their newly
aggressive attacks on the vice president, which began just this
week.
</P>
<P>
   In discussions that went late into Thursday night, some advisers
argued that Weicker's announcement would be an ideal time to raise
the fund-raising issue. But others said it would muddy the message
of the event: an appeal by Weicker to independent voters. Bradley
himself was involved in those discussions, the aides said.
</P>
<P>
   While the advisers decided against an attack involving the
campaign finance issue, they said Friday that Bradley might yet
assail the vice president on the issue this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gore said Friday that his campaign would refrain
from attacks. Arriving in New Hampshire after a trip to Washington
for the State of the Union address, Gore said, ``I'm going to
emphasize the positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, who is trying in these final days to win
over New Hampshire's independent voters, made almost no reference
to the president's address. But he did seek credit for being part
of an administration that has overseen a near-record economic
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was asked in local television interviews about Bradley's
stepped-up aggressiveness in attacking him. But after months of
insinuations that Bradley's proposed economic program would blow
the surplus and risk taking the country into recession, he was
determined Friday to stay above the fray.
</P>
<P>
   ``See,'' Gore said, ``I'm not going to get down to that level.
I'm going to continue to emphasize a positive agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said repeatedly that the voters did not want to hear
negative attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Bradley used his New Hampshire campaign
appearances to accuse Gore of being untruthful about three issues
of great importance to many Democratic voters; abortion, health
care and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   At a morning event in Lebanon, Bradley asserted that Gore had
used ``tricky'' words to mislead voters into thinking that he
supported the licensing of all owners of hand guns, when he had
actually called for licensing only new buyers.
</P>
<P>
   And he asserted that Gore has said he supports universal health
care without offering such a plan. Gore contends that his proposal
for expanding health care would cover nearly as many people as
Bradley's plan, and at a much lower cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you listen to Al Gore speak, you have to listen
very carefully,'' Bradley said. ``Because old politics uses words
in a very tricky manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in response to a reporter's question, Bradley asserted
that Gore had been dishonest about changes in his views on
abortion. Gore says he has always supported a woman's right to an
abortion, but Bradley asserts that the vice president was once an
opponent of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad his position evolved,'' Bradley said. But, he added,
``Why does his camp say he's always held this position?''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign also began running a television commercial
Friday describing him as the only presidential candidate who has
consistently supported a woman's right to an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign countered by releasing a letter signed by more
than 40 Democratic members of Congress vouching for the vice
president's support of abortion rights and urging Bradley not to
create ``differences that do not exist'' between the two Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's appearance with Weicker was unabashedly aimed at
independent voters, who can vote in either the Democratic or
Republican primaries in New Hampshire. Political analysts say many
independent voters are wavering between Bradley and Sen. John
McCain, the Republican presidential contender.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Weicker urged those voters not to ``waste'' their
votes on the Republican. ``Do not confuse independence with the
Republican Party,'' he said. ``The only independent thinker and
actor is Bill Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference, Bradley said he thought President
Clinton's State of the Union speech on Thursday had been full of
good proposals. But he added that he was disappointed that it did
not include a call for universal health care.

 &HT;    Eyewitness remembers Challenger tragedy
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The Space Shuttle Challenger lifted off
from Cape Canaveral on a planned seven-day mission just after 11:30
a.m., Jan. 28, 1986. The crew was scheduled to conduct experiments
in comet observation, release a satellite and then return to earth.
</P>
<P>
   Their unofficial goal was more pressing: Reigniting America's
passion for space.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a quarter century of space flight, including
moon landings and 24 previous shuttle launches, NASA's
technological wizardry no longer held the same hypnotic sway over
the public or congressional budget makers. Launch-day crowds,
including news crews, had been getting thinner by the mission.
</P>
<P>
   But the story that made this otherwise-routine flight different
was strictly human interest: A 37-year-old social studies teacher
from New Hampshire, Sharon Christa McAuliffe, had been chosen to
join the crew.
</P>
<P>
   After a year of training, McAuliffe was set to become the
world's first space teacher, leading lessons that would be beamed
to classrooms 150 miles below. She joined six professional
astronauts characterized by NASA as ``a cross-section of the
American population in terms of race, gender, geography,
background, and religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Kanetzky, an electronics engineer who worked on several
shuttle systems, headed for his office at the Cape early that
morning to beat the traffic. The sky was clear, but the temperature
was below freezing.
</P>
<P>
   Kanetzky worked in a building next to the astronauts' quarters.
He saw the Challenger crew walk out the door as he approached. They
were already suited up. He smiled and nodded as they passed by. It
was hard to tell whether the astronauts noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were businesslike, of course,'' he says. ``They got into
their silver van and drove off.''
</P>
<P>
   A MUCH-DELAYED FLIGHT
</P>
<P>
   The launch was scheduled for 9:38 a.m., but it was delayed by a
malfunction in a fire-detection module. Meanwhile, NASA pondered
the effect of foot-long icicles hanging from the launch pad. The
launch had already been put off three times.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe had told her mother that NASA was determined to avoid
any further delay. President Reagan was scheduled to make his State
of the Union address that evening, and the shuttle mission was sure
to be mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe's parents and sister occupied a prominent spot in the
Cape's viewing stand, while hundreds of her students back in New
Hampshire gathered in the Concord High School auditorium to watch
on TV. Class work around the country also stopped, and thousands of
Florida schoolchildren were ushered outside to watch the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Kanetzky made his way to one of the space center's
instrument-test buildings 3 miles from the launch pad. ``It was
closer to the pad than the launch control center was,'' he says.
The rooftop was off-limits on launch days. Kanetzky and his friends
waited for the security helicopters to finish sweeping the area,
minutes before the launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we quickly scrambled up to the roof,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Their line of sight was perfect. Kanetzky focused his camera on
Launch Pad B, in use for the first time, and began shooting as the
countdown began. He'd photographed all but one of the previous
shuttle liftoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This launch looked like all the rest,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   What no one could have seen until much later, when films were
blown up and analyzed, is the tiny puff of gray smoke that escaped
from a joint in the right-side rocket boosters less than a second
after liftoff. For more than a minute, Challenger traced a familiar
arc through the sky.
</P>
<P>
   On-board steering systems were countering strong crosswinds, but
the flight was on course when the booster joint began to spew
flames 58 seconds after liftoff. Investigators later determined
that a seal called an O-ring had collapsed, partly due to the cold
weather.
</P>
<P>
   A series of calamitous events soon doomed the flight. Flames
reached an external hydrogen tank; then, one of the rocket boosters
broke away from the tank. When the booster sheared off, hydrogen
spewed.
</P>
<P>
   The fire expanded with explosive force and speed. Challenger was
consumed and broke apart 46,000 feet above the earth, 73 seconds
after liftoff. Kanetzky, like most, could not make sense of what he
was seeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Wow, those rocket boosters are separating way
early,''' he says. ``Then I figured, maybe because it's a different
launch pad, they're using a different trajectory. Maybe it just
looks different.''
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, the sky obscured by crazy swirls of white smoke,
it was clear Challenger had met disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, it looked like it was almost straight
overhead,'' Kanetzky says. ``We saw the debris falling down. We
didn't know if we were in danger. We didn't know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knew what to do.
</P>
<P>
   From the Cape to Concord and all across the world, millions
watched in stunned silence. The Challenger explosion instantly
became a where-were-you moment, like the Kennedy assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Except that with the Challenger, there was no wait for some
grainy Zapruder film to be dug out. This was live, on television,
and replayed endlessly: The plume of smoke; the rain of shattered
bits; the heart-breaking close-up of Grace and Edward Corrigan,
McAuliffe's parents.
</P>
<P>
   NASA EMPLOYEES POWERLESS
</P>
<P>
   Kanetzky, stunned, stopped shooting pictures and stared. Then he
shot a few more frames as the sky cleared. ``I was just sick,'' he
says. ``I stood around in shock for a while. Then I went back to my
office.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do was no clearer when he got there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd walk through the halls and people were screaming,'' he
says. ``It was bad. People finally just closed up their offices and
went home. I did too. I sat in front of the TV the rest of the
day.''
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan canceled his State of the Union address, but
made a short televised speech honoring the Challenger's crew and
vowing that America would not turn back from space. NASA,
meanwhile, suspended all flights until it could find out what went
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Kanetzky, like many other space program workers, was laid off
during the post-Challenger lull and then called back two months
later to work on a thorough redesign of the shuttle. He worked at
the space center until 1994. He is now a software engineer for ICN,
a West Palm Beach company that builds and maintains Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of rejuvenating the space agency's image, the Challenger
mission led to widespread criticism of cost cutting and safety
compromises. The agency was slow to answer questions about the
disaster, particularly about the fate of the crew.
</P>
<P>
   Partial remains of all seven were eventually recovered, along
with the crew's cabin, which had remained largely intact and
continued its ascent for about 25 seconds after the explosion
before plunging to the ocean. A NASA medical inquiry concluded that
the force of the initial breakup was probably not fatal but that
loss of cabin pressure may have been. The report failed to
determine a cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   A presidential commission was appointed to investigate the
disaster. It took nearly three years to reach conclusions, redesign
systems and launch another shuttle. The Discovery featured more
than 100 major modifications and new features.
</P>
<P>
   Among them: an escape hatch, parachutes and survival gear. It
lifted off on Sept. 29, 1988 with a crew of five, all professional
astronauts. The flight was delayed one hour and 38 minutes to
replace two fuses in the flight-suit cooling systems. Discovery
traveled 1,680,000 miles in four days, one hour and 11 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   It landed safely.

EX-N.H. GOVERNOR SUNUNU ENDORSES BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ Of the hundreds of endorsements Governor
George W. Bush has received, the most unexpected may have come
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   John H. Sununu, the former governor and the man who led
President George Bush to victory in New Hampshire in 1988, gave his
support to the younger Bush at a packed speech at Liberty Mutual
Insurance , saying he wanted to make it ``very, very clear'' that
he is supporting the Texas governor for president.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a decade ago, however, it was Bush who was reportedly
clarifying things for Sununu.
</P>
<P>
   When Sununu resigned as chief of staff in the Bush White House
in 1991, legend had it that George W. Bush was the one who pulled
the trigger, telling him he should leave the administration after
months of unbearable tension.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, saying Bush ``was a friend and is a friend,'' Sununu
told a news conference he had never harbored ill will toward the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never had a problem with any conversation I have had
with Governor Bush,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But because it has been widely reported otherwise, the
endorsement seemed to take on more significance than the several
dozen Bush has won in recent months. When Virginia Senator John W.
Warner gave Bush the nod Friday afternoon, Bush aides didn't bother
to issue a news release, in contrast to the news conference that
was held especially to introduce Sununu.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Bush did not stray much from his usual message
Friday, except to criticize President Clinton's announcement of a
$350 billion tax cut as ``not significant enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has spent all the money he could possibly spend
and then he had a little left over for a tax cut,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He also used the opportunity to take a dig at his oppponent's
tax plan, which is half the size of his own. ``It confirms my point
that . . . he (Clinton) and John McCain agree on the size of a tax
cut that's not significant enough,'' Bush said.

TERROR SUSPECT IS REARRESTED IN AFRICA AT U.S. REQUEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A leading suspect in an aborted terrorist plot, who
the authorities believe is linked to the Osama bin Laden
international terror network, has been arrested in his native
Mauritania after he was briefly detained and released in Senegal,
law enforcement officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Mohambedou Ould Slahi, was held by the Mauritanian
security service in Nouakchott, the capital of the West African
nation, after he was released in neighboring Senegal. He was
detained in Mauritania, as he was in Senegal, at the request of
U.S. authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, federal law enforcement officials said they were eager
to interview Ould Slahi, but so far prosecutors have yet to charge
him with a crime. And it was not clear whether prosecutors were
ready to accuse him in the plot, a step that would provide a legal
basis for bringing him to the United States to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, Ould Slahi had been living in Montreal, where
he met with several people involved in a New Year's bombing plot,
and before that he resided in Germany. Interviews in those places
suggested that Ould Slahi did not seem like a militant firebrand.
Associates said he was a devout Muslim who attended Mosque daily
and kept his political beliefs to himself.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing plot was uncovered last month when an Algerian,
Ahmed Ressam, was arrested at Port Angeles, Wash., as he tried to
enter the United States on a ferry from Canada driving a car
carrying explosives and four timing devices.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials suspect that Ould Slahi may have been an
organizer of the plot and theorize that he may have been a conduit
for the bin Laden organization. Last fall, Ould Slahi traveled to
Montreal, where he met frequently with Mokhtar Haouri, another
Algerian charged with directing Ressam in the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Bahaa Elbatal, the secretary at the mosque in Montreal, where
Ould Slahi lived for about a month before he left for Africa, said
Ould Slahi was a prayer leader. He said Ould Slahi had taken refuge
in the mosque in part because of the intense investigation of his
associates by the Canadian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Elbatal said Ould Slahi knew the Koran ``by heart,'' learning
the holy text from his grandmother in Mauritania as a child along
with the complex rules for the many different forms in which the
Islamic canon is recited.
</P>
<P>
   El Batal said Ould Slahi seemed unfazed even as members of the
mosque were interviewed by the authorities and came to realize that
they were under surveillance by two cars continuously parked
outside the mosque. But Canadian security officials never tried to
interview Ould Slahi while he was at the mosque.
</P>
<P>
   In the German industrial city of Duisburg, where Ould Slahi
previously resided, police officials said the authorities became
interested in him shortly after the bombings of U.S. Embassies in
East Africa in 1998. The German authorities learned that Ould Slahi
might have ties to Islamic extremists in Europe, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   But a cousin of Ould Slahi, who declined to be identified, said
Ould Slahi, who had a degree in electrical engineering, lived
quietly and kept his political views private. Nevertheless, he said
Ould Slahi, like other Mauritanians in Germany, were sympathetic to
bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   So far, only four Algerians have been charged with complicity in
a still murky plan that appeared to be directed at targets inside
the United States. But the authorities remain uncertain of the
timing of any attacks and do not know where the bombings were to
have taken place.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, another man, Youssef Karroum, whose nationality was not
known, was taken into custody as a material witness in the case in
Seattle after he was stopped at a Canadian border crossing in a car
in which traces of explosive chemicals were found, law enforcement
officials said. It was not clear how Karroum was connected to the
plot.
</P>
<P>
   Ould Slahi's brother-in-law is a close associate of bin Laden,
who has been charged in an indictment as the leader of Al Qaeda,
the Islamic terror group responsible for the deadly embassy bombing
attacks in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Ould Slahi was in continuous contact with
representatives of a construction company in Sudan that was owned
by bin Laden and operated clandestinely to support Al Qaeda's
terror objectives.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials have cautioned that so far they have
obtained little evidence that bin Laden was behind the unsuccessful
New Year's bombing plot. Though the exact plan remains unclear,
some officials suspect that the Algerians were targeting up to four
sites with small bombs intended to show the terrorists' ability to
penetrate the vast counterterrorism operation mounted in advance of
the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, it was uncertain what efforts were under way to bring
Ould Slahi to the United States. Federal agents had been sent to
Africa to question him, but it was not clear whether the U.S.
authorities would try to negotiate his surrender to be charged in a
U.S. court.

   An Airline Executive Who Missed the Boat &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Richard Branson is feeling blue about JetBlue Airways. When this
new airline takes to the skies next week, he will be left behind.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Branson, chairman of Britain's Virgin Group, considered
becoming an investor in a $200 million low-fare airline that would
fly out of New York's Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier would have borne the Virgin name and been similar to
the European carrier Virgin Express. Because of an American law
restricting foreign ownership of airlines, however, Virgin Group
would have controlled only a quarter of the voting stock.
</P>
<P>
   Branson decided that the Virgin brand was too valuable to trust
to anybody else, and opted to stop negotiating. David Neeleman, a
former Southwest Airlines executive who would have run Virgin
America, decided to go ahead with the plan, minus Branson. On Feb.
11, Neeleman's venture _ JetBlue _ will make its inaugural flight
from Kennedy to Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   And the brash British entrepreneur is having second thoughts.
``In retrospect, we should have gotten into bed with him,'' Branson
said in an interview last week. ``We foolishly decided to hold
out.''
</P>
<P>
   JetBlue will succeed, Branson said, because the East Coast is
starved for airline competition and because Neeleman understands
how a low-fare airline should be run.
</P>
<P>
   _David Leonhardt &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Welch, in the Air, on the Greens &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Jack Welch wants to buy a Boeing business jet, he won't
take no for an answer. Not even when it comes from Phil Condit,
Boeing's chief executive, with an explanation that Boeing does not
make a business jet. At Welch's behest, General Electric, which
supplies Boeing with jet engines, did some quick research and
calculated that a Boeing 737 business jet would cost only about as
much as a smaller top-of-the-line business jet. ``Why the heck
aren't we selling them?'' Welch asked Condit, who told the story
last week.
</P>
<P>
   So, about three and a half years ago, Boeing and GE formed a
business jet venture, with GE placing two of the first orders.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 38 jets have now been delivered, with 56 on order.
Owners of the jets, costing more than $42 million, include H. Wayne
Huizenga, who had his plane painted in the green and gold colors of
his Miami Dolphins, and the ruling family of Dubai. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Welch also pops up in any discussion of chief executives who
could practically join the professional golf tour. According to
Golf Digest, which ranks Fortune 500 executives by their handicaps,
the very best is Scott G. McNealy. Besides guiding Sun Microsystems
to a more than tripling of its stock price last year, he managed to
maintain a 3.3 handicap, virtually unchanged from the year before.
</P>
<P>
   But McNealy merely muttered about his run-ins with Welch. ``No
way should I be No. 1 after being trounced by Jack Welch not once
but twice,'' McNealy told the magazine. ``I just hope he waits long
enough to retire so I can beat him'' while he is still boss.
McNealy at least came away with a seat on GE's board last fall.
</P>
<P>
   A rising handicap, from 3.8 to 7.1, that Welch, 64, ascribed to
a bad shoulder, lowered his own ranking from second to a tie for
16th last year.
</P>
<P>
   McNealy's chief nemesis, Bill Gates of Microsoft, was ranked
205th, with a 23.9 handicap, among the 230 corporate chiefs who
play enough to have handicaps. &QL;

<P>
   His Eyes Are on the Prize &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now that Robert J. Eaton, DaimlerChrysler's spunky co-chairman,
has announced his retirement, the new sign on his door could just
as well be: Gone Fishin'.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton has a house on Walloon Lake in northern Michigan, where
Ernest Hemingway also had a house, which he prized for the nearby
fishing. ``Most of the time I'm going to spend hunting and
fishing,'' along with golfing and skiing, Eaton said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton will not exactly be a threadbare pensioner. ``I'm going to
go on a fixed income,'' he said, but quickly added: ``It's not bad.
We've done pretty well in the past eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   When Daimler-Benz closed the deal to buy Chrysler in November
1998, the company cashed out Eaton's options, for $70 million.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of his next birthday, on Feb. 13, leaves Eaton a
little wistful: ``I'm not sure I want to be 60,'' he said, ``but I
will be 60.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he does have one other date to look forward to. ``I'll
start looking for my retirement check sometime around April 30,''
he said.

 &HT;    Search for spies delays start of Dome practice
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Rams didn't seem to mind that Friday's practice at
the Georgia Dome was delayed by about 15 minutes, as the Titans
took a longer than planned.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the Titans' fault.
</P>
<P>
   It took an extra 15 minutes before they practiced for NFL
officials to scour the Dome and feel confident there were no spies.
</P>
<P>
   Rams coach Dick Vermeil, who did not give his players a curfew
this week until a midnight deadline last night, didn't sound too
upbeat when asked about his players' frame of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't sense any feeling one way or the other,'' he said. ``I
don't sense that they're hyped, or that they're tight. I think they
are just sort of allowing themselves to build it up to a crescendo
Sunday evening. I have played our preparation very low-key.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams will have a walkthrough at the Dome today.
</P>
<P>
   After players, coaches and their families fend for themselves
for dinner, there will be a team meeting at 9 p.m., and an 11 p.m.
curfew tonight.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAL UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   Center Mike Gruttadauria, who missed Thursday's practice with
flu-like symptoms, returned for Friday's practice, and will start
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The only player to miss practice was ailing kicker Jeff Wilkins,
although that was by design.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins, who is bothered by painful patella tendinitis in his
left, or non-kicking knee, will kick Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime NFL kicker Nick Lowery, whom the Rams worked out last
week, is in Atlanta this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spoke to him a couple of times this week, and he was very
close to getting a call (to be signed),'' Vermeil said. ``But Jeff
kicked well (Thursday), and his leg felt a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he practiced for a second consecutive day, starting
wide receiver Torry Holt (shoulder/ribs) will be a game-day
decision as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   WISHFUL THINKING
</P>
<P>
   Trent Green can't help but wonder what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   It's been 4 1/2 months since Green, who'd left the Redskins as a
free agent and signed a $16 million contract last February with the
Rams, suffered a knee injury in the third exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   Then he watched his backup, Kurt Warner, throw for 4,353 yards
and 41 touchdowns, and become the NFL's MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, you go through the whole `what if?' game,'' Green
said. ``But you can't dwell on it. To say I'd have the same numbers
as Kurt, that's a hypothetical. Mine might've been worse, or
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Green's not certain of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be kidding myself if I thought coming into training camp
the job will be open,'' he said. ``Kurt's the MVP, he's had one of
the best seasons ever. If the Rams do choose to keep me, that'll be
the role I'll have to take.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams are expected to trade Green, whose recovery and
rehabilitation are on track for him to be available for training
camp. The Steelers have been mentioned as a possible destination.
</P>
<P>
   ROSTER RUMBLINGS
</P>
<P>
   The Rams de-activated four players for the Super Bowl, as per
NFL rules. Offensive tackle Matt Willig, running back Justin
Watson, rookie linebacker Troy Pelshak, and rookie defensive end
Lionel Barnes will not be in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   YOU WANT WHO TO COACH?
</P>
<P>
   Rams co-offensive line coach Jim Hanifan, long considered one of
the best in NFL history at his trade, has been to Atlanta before.
He was a Falcons assistant from 1987-89.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when Marion Campbell resigned under pressure as coach
with four games left in the '89 season, Hanifan, head coach of the
St. Louis Cardinals from '80-85, took over the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Late team founder) Rankin (Smith) Sr. had come out and made a
statement in the papers that none of the present coaches would be
even considered for the head coaching position,'' he said. ``Some
of us were upset about it, some of us weren't. I for one wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Hanifan's first game in charge, Smith called him into a
room in the bowels of old Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Rankin Sr.) goes, `I do want to tell you that you will
definitely be considered for the head coaching vacancy,''' Hanifan
said. ``I said, `You've got to be kidding.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said it with a touch more color. `Are you out of your
gourd?' I said. He stepped back and looked at me, and he goes
`Huh?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `You're crazy. Why would you want to do that?' And he
said `huh?' and then he said, `But what if you win the next four
games?' I looked at him and went `Well, let me tell you this. If we
win the next four games, then I ought to be the coach.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons lost all four, and finished 3-13. The last game, a
31-24 loss to the Lions at the old stadium, was played in front of
the smallest crowd in franchise history of 7,792 on a cold
Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Hanifan was coaching with the Redskins. He still wears the
Super Bowl ring the team received for winning Super Bowl XXVI.
</P>
<P>
   11 MISSED GAMES
</P>
<P>
   All season, on offense, Rams fullback Robert Holcombe missed one
game, and left guard Tom Nutten two. On defense, free safety Keith
Lyle missed seven, and cornerback Dexter McCleon one. That doesn't
count Green.

SUCCESS STORY IN GERMANY IS NOT ALL IT APPEARS TO BE

<TEXT>
<P>
   As January winds down, the German stock market's benchmark index
is leaving its main European rivals in the dust. The DAX index of
30 stocks is up 1.6 percent in euros, while the other major indexes
are down sharply.
</P>
<P>
   But the performance of the DAX is deceiving. It comes on the
backs of just six stocks: SAP, Siemens, Munich Re, Mannesmann _ the
Vodafone takeover target _ Allianz and Deutsche Telekom. The other
24 in the index are down so far this year. The big loser, Metro, is
off 18.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That is not a new story for American investors, who saw the Dow
Jones industrial average rise 25.2 percent last year, while 61.6
percent of the stocks trading on the New York Stock Exchange were
down 20 percent or more from their 52-week highs, according to
Salomon Smith Barney. But it is just one of the many hurdles that
American investors in German stocks face this year.
</P>
<P>
   The worst news of 2000 has been the plunge in the value of the
euro, which fell below the $1 level on Thursday and continued its
decline on Friday, finishing the week at 97.78 cents. The euro is
now down 16.2 percent since its debut on Jan. 1, 1999. So in dollar
terms, the DAX is off 1.6 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   And while a weak euro could spur exports and, in turn, European
stocks, its continued decline will eat away quickly at American
investors' gains.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign finance scandal that has engulfed the Christian
Democratic Union of former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is
mushrooming. It has sent the DAX plunging on some days and is
undermining the euro.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bigger correction in the German DAX cannot be ruled out,
especially if Kohl were to name the companies involved'' in the
scandal, according to Marco Kramer, German strategist at Paribas in
Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   George Hodgson, European strategist at ABN-Amro in London, says
an even bigger danger lies in the chance the German scandal will
taint other European politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``If global investors start to sense that European politicians
are not healthy, the euro zone could attract the type of risk
premium that Italy used to attract,'' Hodgson said, referring to
the Italian corruption scandals that ruined the Christian Democrats
in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation, while still below 2 percent, could head higher,
meaning interest rates would rise. The spike in oil prices, the
weaker euro (which makes oil and other imports more expensive) and
union wage demands are all increasing price pressures.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side for Germany, the scandal has propped up the
current chancellor, Gerhard Schroder of the Social Democratic
Party, whose government was on its knees. That should make it
easier to get key tax proposals approved this year.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal, announced last month, calls for eliminating
capital gains taxes on the sale of the large stakes that many
German companies, especially banks and insurers, own in other
concerns. The tax change would make it easier for German companies
to begin the restructuring, acquiring and merging needed to make
them leaner, meaner and more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it would provide an impetus to go through the
process of creating shareholder value that many American industries
have already completed.
</P>
<P>
   Banks, said Alex Ions, Lehman Brothers European strategist in
London, would get cash from the sale of holdings, easing
acquisitions abroad. Companies freed of these outside holders would
find it easier to merge or would become more attractive acquisition
targets.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover fight for Mannesmann, the biggest operator of
wireless telephone networks in Europe, illustrates the growing
support for restructuring. ``There has been no collusion by
Mannesmann with the German establishment to fend off the
takeover,'' Ions said.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a long-term bet. And, unfortunately, the rally from
the December tax announcement was immediate. Deutsche Bank shares
jumped 14 percent in a day.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgson said there should be a ``second leg'' to the capital
gains story when the tax is approved and companies act on it. But,
he said, over the ``next few months, this could recede into the
background.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance this year of the German stocks in Lehman
Brothers' recommended pan-European portfolio also proves that
patience is needed. The restructuring theme is at play in all of
them _ Bayer, BMW, Continental, Mannesmann and Volkswagen. But
except for Mannesmann, the takeover target, all are down 11 percent
or more.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring theme, Ions said, ``has not produced at the
bottom line as quickly or as painlessly as some have hoped.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The American economy grew at a blistering rate of
5.8 percent in the final quarter of last year as it closed in on
the record for the longest expansion in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   But inflation also jumped during the quarter and this, along
with more evidence of accelerating health costs, make it more
certain that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest
rates by at least a quarter of a percentage point when it meets
next week, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The two government reports published Friday ``amount to the
`smoking gun' that the Fed has been warning would eventually
appear,'' said David Orr, chief economist at First Union Bank.
``The key story is the uptick in inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks, which have been retreating for most of the new year,
were pummeled heavily throughout the day while the bond market
gyrated wildly and finished mostly higher, pushing rates lower.
</P>
<P>
   Gross domestic product, the Commerce Department reported, grew
at a blistering 5.8 percent annual pace during the quarter, just
slightly higher than the summer's 5.7 percent but well ahead of the
5.2 percent that economists expected.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, many of them holding large stock gains, spent freely;
military and other federal outlays rose sharply; and there was a
huge buildup in inventories that apparently reflected precautions
against computer failure at the turn of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Spending on food, in fact, climbed 9.3 percent _ about
one-quarter of the rise in consumer outlays _ as many households
stocked up, fearing Year 2000 computer problems that proved largely
unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Business spending on equipment and software, on the other hand,
grew more slowly as some companies took a breather after preparing
for potential Year 2000 problems, while others deferred such
spending until the new year, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Since many of the factors affecting the fourth quarter,
including exceptionally favorable weather, are unlikely to be
repeated, analysts say the economy is certain to cool off in the
January-March period.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not at all clear that it will cool enough for the Fed
to be able to avoid a series of rate increases as the economy in
February sets a record for uninterrupted expansion _ 107 months.
That would surpass the 106 months of Vietnam-era prosperity from
1961 to 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Shipley, senior economist at Merrill Lynch, said that Alan
Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, ``wants it south of 4 percent,''
referring to growth of the gross domestic product, on the
assumption that inflation will break out if the economy keeps
exceeding its speed limit. This is set by the sum of population
growth, about 1 percent a year, and productivity, traditionally
thought to be about 1 1/2 percent but now perhaps 2 1/2 percent to
as much as 3 1/2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This report also showed that the savings rate _ personal savings
as a percentage of disposable income _ shriveled to 1.9 percent
from 2.1 percent in the preceding quarter. The rate was 4.5 percent
for 1997, 3.7 percent for 1998 and 2.4 percent for all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The inflation number that seemed to upset analysts the most
Friday was the so-called GDP deflator, which jumped to a 2 percent
pace in the autumn from 1.1 percent in the summer. But others also
advanced, including the price index for gross domestic purchases,
up to 2.3 percent from 1.7 percent; without counting food and
energy, this index accelerated to 2 percent from 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But economists also cited the Labor Department's Employment Cost
Index, which showed Friday that while wages and salaries for
civilian workers rose the same in the autumn as in the summer, 0.9
percent, the cost of fringe benefits accelerated to 1.3 percent
from 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pickup in benefits apparently reflected increased
retention bonuses as well as a continued uptrend in health
insurance costs,'' said James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at J.P.
Morgan. Wall Street's year-end bonuses, especially hefty for 1999,
are expected to have their main impact in the next report.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's civilian workers saw their pay and benefits advance
3.4 percent last year, the same as in 1998, as consumer prices
advanced 2.7 percent. Benefits include vacations, holidays, sick
leave, overtime pay, shift differentials and bonuses, as well as
health and life insurance, savings and pension payments, and
severance pay.

FAST NFL START FOR A SHOE KING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 30) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Fla.)   (af)  
 By JANE TANNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ The office of J. Wayne Weaver, owner of the
Jacksonville Jaguars, is on a corridor that rings the stadium where
last Sunday his team saw its chance to play in the Super Bowl slip
away in a 33-14 loss to the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   Although the shelves in Weaver's office are loaded with
footballs signed by his players, one memento looks out of place: a
wooden mold for a petite woman's shoe, circa the 1920s. The shoe
represents Weaver's other life, the one that made football
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver is now chairman and largest stockholder of Shoe Carnival,
a retail discount footwear chain, and he is the majority owner of
LC Footwear, which distributes a line of Liz Claiborne shoes. When
he became chief executive of the Jaguars as the team entered the
National Football League, he stepped down as head of the Nine West
Group, the women's shoe company he built from $9 million in sales
in 1978 to $550 million in 1993, and moved to Jacksonville from
Darien, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't forget who brought you to the dance,'' Weaver said
in his office. But though he said he never considered involvement
in a sports franchise before his brother Ron, a Jacksonville
businessman, urged him to invest in the city's drive for a team,
Weaver now plans to retreat further from the shoe business.
</P>
<P>
   At 65, he can do without 80-hour workweeks, he said, and
besides, the industry has been in a tailspin lately. He said he
expected to sell Shoe Carnival in the next few years, and someday
take LC Footwear public.
</P>
<P>
   After joining the 32-team league, Weaver quickly became a leader
among team owners, and the NFL commissioner, Paul Tagliabue, chose
him to lead the league's product licensing committee. ``He's a very
quick study about a wide range of business issues,'' Tagliabue
said.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver is known as intensely driven and impatient with
underlings who do not work hard enough to suit him, but also as a
good listener with strong people skills who finds himself mediating
among the egos of fellow team owners.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, he bridged the gap of his large desk with warm
conversation and an easy smile. After the Jaguars lost last Sunday,
he congratulated Titans fans outside his skybox in the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Among the owners, he was instrumental in lining up support for a
plan to lend money for the construction of new stadiums _ to make
up for the reluctance of cities and states to provide tax money the
way Jacksonville did for his team's refurbished home field.
</P>
<P>
   Teams in smaller cities objected to helping to pay for big-city
stadiums, but were won over when Weaver came out in favor of the
plan, arguing that the league's television revenue-sharing system
gave all teams a strong interest in one another's success.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver now knows quite a bit about making a professional sports
franchise work in a relatively small market. (With about one
million residents, Jacksonville is the second-smallest metropolitan
area with an NFL team, bigger than only Green Bay, Wis.) But when
his brother approached him in 1991, Weaver said, he knew little
about the city.
</P>
<P>
   `My first reaction was, you've got to be kidding me,'' Weaver
said. Unwilling to divert his attention from Nine West and Shoe
Carnival, which he had bought from Nine West in 1988, he initially
committed just $200,000 to the franchise bid. But his passion grew,
and he ultimately paid just under half of the Jaguars' $140 million
franchise fee and $66 million in start-up costs.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver was unwilling to disclose the team's financial data, but
said he did not expect to recoup his investment very quickly. ``You
build value by winning and having a high-profile franchise,'' he
said. In its short history, the Jaguars have made the playoffs four
times.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming the principal owner of the Jaguars, Weaver has
left day-to-day management of Shoe Carnival to executives at the
company's headquarters in Evansville, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   The company went public in 1993 and peaked at $19.25 a share,
but sank to $2 a share at the beginning of 1996 when the company
posted losses. After a management shake-up and a switch to a
strategy of less deeply discounted pricing, the company posted 13
consecutive quarters of rising profits.
</P>
<P>
   When earnings slowed again late last year, analysts cited lack
of inventory and tougher competition from department stores and
outlets. The stock closed Friday at $7.9375.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Ikenson, an analyst at Chase H&AMP;Q, agreed with Weaver that
the stock has been tarred unfairly with competitors' woes.
``They've been consistent during a difficult time in the shoe
industry,'' Ikenson said.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said that as an American Conference team owner he would
be rooting for the Titans Sunday, even though the Rams hail from
St. Louis, where he and his wife and two children lived for nearly
20 years while he rose to be a top executive at Brown Group, parent
of shoe chains like Naturalizer and Famous Footwear.
</P>
<P>
   His first job after high school in Columbus, Ga., was at a Brown
shoe store. He left in 1977 after he realized that he would not get
the top job.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver spent a lifetime selling shoes, but only a few seasons in
high school playing football, so he lets his coaches run the
Jaguars on the field and does not pace the sidelines. ``I don't
have any expertise to offer there.''

 &HT;    N.H. DEMOCRATS WORRY ABOUT BITTER TONE OF CAMPAIGN
 &HT;    580&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD and KEN FOSKETT
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ State Democratic leaders expressed concern Friday
night about the increasingly combative tone of the contest between
Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley in New
Hampshire's presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Chair Kathleen Sullivan, kicking off a state
party fund-raising dinner attended by both Gore and Bradley, said
that after the fighting and arguing of the presidential contest,
``we need to stick together and be family again.''
</P>
<P>
   She reminded the Democrats of the Rev. Jesse Jackson's
admonition after his defeats in the 1984 and 1988 campaigns: ``The
process makes us better, not bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gore and Bradley said their candidates did not plan to
stage a campaign skirmish in front of the party donors Friday
night. Both were scheduled to speak at the fund-raising dinner
following a full day of campaigning in which Bradley continued his
assault on Gore's truthfulness.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, arriving at the dinner, told reporters that
she was concerned with the shift in Bradley's tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to play very well here,'' said the
popular governor, who has endorsed Gore. ``People appreciate the
need to draw distinctions on the issues, but when it starts getting
personal, the people of New Hampshire don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Decker, a Manchester businessman who supports Bradley,
complained that Gore was ``the source'' of the negative campaigning
by ``deliberately distorting'' Bradley's Senate record and his plan
for universal health care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say Bradley's attacks on Gore haven't been
provoked,'' Decker said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is seeking to walk a very fine line in the final days of
the campaign by attacking Gore without appearing to engage in the
same type of negative attacks that Bradley says he is against.
</P>
<P>
   The balancing act was not lost on Sonia Sheridan in Lebanon,
N.H., who posed Bradley a probing question at the conclusion of a
town hall meeting in Newport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm asking you, how can you deal with the sleaze factor
without yourself going through the same kind of tactics?'' Sheridan
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone misrepresents your position as Al Gore has done
consistently in this campaign, you call them on it,'' Bradley
responded.
</P>
<P>
   In a briefing with reporters, Bradley also disclosed that he had
experienced another episode of irregular heartbeat this week, the
latest of several in recent weeks. Bradley said the episode lasted
``about two hours'' and did not require medical treatment. The
condition, known as atrial fibrillation, is not life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, arriving in Portsmouth from his overnight trip to
Washington for the State of the Union speech by President Clinton,
refused to respond to Bradley's attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to emphasize the positive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Gore
stuck to his day's message _ that he is the only presidential
candidate with the know-how to keep the economy on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have just begun to prosper,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to strike a positive tone, the Gore campaign will begin
airing a 30-minute ad on New Hampshire television Saturday. It
includes scenes of Gore playing Frisbee with his wife and dancing
with his daughter at her wedding.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Bradley on Friday accused Gore of misleading voters about Gore's
own proposals for gun control and health care reform. He also
questioned Gore's commitment to abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   The assault on Gore's truthfulness came a day after Bradley
accused the vice president of distorting Bradley's record. Both
lines of attack reflected a sense of urgency in the Bradley
campaign over the potential outcome in next Tuesday's primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have invested a year of my life building a relationship with
the voters of New Hampshire,'' Bradley told reporters. ``I am
clarifying the record so they don't go into the last week believing
misstatements and mischaracterizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who trails Gore in most recent state polls, refused to
say if he needed to win next Tuesday in order to claim success in
the Granite state, saying only that he needed to ``do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign, however, sent more signals Friday that
Bradley was focused on a five-week battle with Gore leading up to
the big-state primaries March 7. The campaign reported that it
would enter February with nearly $20 million in the bank, including
$11.4 in federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign released its latest financial figures, too. They
showed the vice president with a nearly identical amount of money
available. Gore has an organizational advantage in most of the
upcoming primaries, however.
</P>
<P>
   In another development Friday, the Bradley campaign tacitly
acknowledged for the first time that Bradley is facing competition
from Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., among independents, New Hampshire's
largest bloc of voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley flew in former Sen. Lowell Weicker of Connecticut, a
former Republican who became an independent, to endorse him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully understand the independence of Senator McCain on the
campaign finance issue, but once you get past that one issue, the
only independent thinker and actor is Bill Bradley,'' Weicker told
voters at a town hall meeting here. ``Don't waste that vote.''
</P>
<P>
   After months of contrasting himself with Gore on the basis of
experience and leadership style, Bradley bluntly characterized Gore
as a manipulative politician who was insincere on some of the
Democratic Party's core issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley wrapped his criticisms around his latest campaign theme
of contrasting a new politics of ideas with an old politics of ``a
thousand promises and a thousand attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you listen to Al Gore speak you have to listen very
carefully, because old politics uses words in a very tricky
manner,'' Bradley told voters at a town hall meeting in Lebanon,
N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley asserted that Gore favors licensing handguns. ``But of
course unless you look at the clause he says 'new' handguns,''
Bradley said. ``If you don't listen very carefully it sounds like
he is right there for gun control, but the reality is that you have
to license and register all handguns.''
</P>
<P>
   On health care, Bradley said of Gore, ``He says he is for
universal health coverage, but his plan can't even begin to get to
universal coverage. So the illusion is created, well, he's there
fighting for me for universal health care coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question later, Bradley said Gore had a strong
``right to life'' voting record in Congress. ``Now he says he is
pro-choice, which is fine,'' Bradley said. ``Everyone should
evolve, but at least acknowledge where you've come from.''

   Preferred stock. The term evokes a Wall Street era of ticker
tape, spittoons and coupon-clipping.
</P>
<P>
   These securities, commanding almost no public attention these
days, are still around, however, and some professionals think they
now offer almost irresistible value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yields on preferreds right now on a historical basis make them
very advantageous,'' said Joseph Grunfeld, an adviser to well-to-do
investors at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Yields are now 8 percent to 10 percent. According to a Merrill
Lynch study, they average about nine-tenths of a percentage point
higher than bonds of similar credit quality, a difference that is
about three times as much as usual. The spread has been wider: late
last year, because of intense tax-loss selling, it hit 1.20 points.
But it is still attractive.
</P>
<P>
   And the yield to maturity on the Merrill Lynch fixed-rate
preferred stock index, meanwhile, at 9.03 percent, is nearly a full
percentage point higher than it was a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Preferred shares occupy a clear niche. They are equity shares
that rank ahead of common stock in their right to receive dividends
and, if the issuer fails, to share in proceeds from its
liquidation. With a preferred share of the ``cumulative'' type,
dividend arrears must be paid before holders of common stock get a
dime.
</P>
<P>
   The dividends are usually specified when issued _ but sometimes
float _ and are usually paid quarterly, unlike bonds, most of which
pay interest twice a year. That is a nice advantage. A common issue
price is $25, with most issues remaining within a handful of
dollars of this or another starting point, like $50, throughout
their life. They do not come due on a fixed date, but a time is
specified when the company can choose to pay them off.
</P>
<P>
   Preferreds are subordinate to even the least senior bonds,
however, generating dividends only after all bondholders get
theirs. And holders usually do not get to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Preferred issues trade like bonds, meaning that their prices
move more in response to fluctuations in interest rates than in
response to what happens to the companies that issue them.
(Convertible bonds, on the other hand, trade more like stocks.)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, preferred shares are best considered as substitutes for
bonds, a conservative way to raise portfolio income without going
into bonds, which are subject to sharp price swings, the volatility
becoming progressively greater as maturity lengthens. Preferred
shares are somewhat less sensitive to rates than bonds of the same
duration because of their subordination to bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They allow us to pump up the yield in a way that we have a
measure of safety,'' said William C. Newell, president of Atlantic
Capital Management in Sherborn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Investing in preferred shares is generally safe and easy, with
468 of them listed on the New York Stock Exchange. But they are not
for everyone because, except for those convertible into common
stock, they are almost guaranteed not to rise much in value.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no growth in them,'' Newell said. ``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   If interest rates decline, the issuer will redeem the preferred
shares at the specified call price plus some premium. Most new
preferred issues carry five years of protection against call. In
similar circumstances, bondholders would usually get the benefit of
rising prices.
</P>
<P>
   What preferreds do offer, in return for investors' sacrificing
the chance for capital gains, are fat yields _ 9.20 percent, for
example, for preferreds of Grand Metropolitan, which merged with
Guinness, the Irish brewer, in 1997 to form Diageo.
</P>
<P>
   To get as much yield in bonds, Grunfeld said, ``I've got to buy
junk'' _ that is, drop below investment grade minimums.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, most preferred shares were bought by
corporations, which until 1994 did not pay taxes on 70 percent of
dividends from these shares. The reduced corporate presence since
the law was changed has tended to raise yields and produced
anomalies that smart investors can exploit.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few mutual funds focus on preferreds. But more than a
half-dozen closed-end funds do, and all trade at big discounts to
their net asset values.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, individual preferred-picking can be
rewarding. ``It's a reasonably inefficient market where an investor
with a relatively modest amount of homework can do really well,''
said Dan Fuss, portfolio manager for the Loomis Sayles Bond fund.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory K. Phelps of John Hancock Advisors manages five
closed-end funds. He particularly likes preferreds issued by oil
and gas companies, utilities and telecommunications concerns, and
suggests that investors may want to buy shares in the secondary
market trading below par.
</P>
<P>
   One pick: preferred A shares of Shaw Communications, a Canadian
cable company. They are rated just below investment grade and are
not callable until October 2002. The shares closed at $20 Friday,
yielding 10.24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since the markets for preferred shares tend to be thin, experts
say considerable care is needed in checking prices and transaction
charges before jumping in.

 &HT;    Turning off the killer instinctBy Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mike Jones, Titans defensive lineman, describes the
Sunday-morning transformation from family man to football maniac as
``an incredible transition.'' ``It's an incredible switch, from
watching Barney and Elmo on TV and watching my babies dance and
sing, to getting ready to go to war,'' Jones said. ``It's almost
like being on a SWAT team. You're leaving home, and putting on a
whole 'nother uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael D. Jones, not to be confused with former teammate
Michael A. Jones, a Rams linebacker, paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I never really thought about it,'' he said. ``That's an
incredible transition. Then you make the transition coming back
home to Elmo, hoping the kids will finally go to sleep so you can
watch `SportsCenter.'''
</P>
<P>
   He can leave behind three hours of mayhem and violence for 60
minutes of Barney and Elmo, before watching an hour of mayhem and
violence highlights on TV.
</P>
<P>
   RETURNING TO NORMAL
</P>
<P>
   Jones, known in St. Louis as ``The Doc'' because of his
initials, M.D. Jones, can make the transformation from Dr. Tackle
to Mr. Mild.
</P>
<P>
   He can do what every NFL player must: Leave the game behind and
return to normal life, which for many players is family life.
</P>
<P>
   And then next Sunday arrives, and it's time once again to knock
off someone else's block, or tackle, or quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's a challenge,'' said Jones, 31, a ninth-year
veteran from N.C. State. Jones started three games this season for
the Rams but will begin Sunday's Super Bowl on the Titans' bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really, really caught up in my job,'' he said. ``Being a
husband and a father is a job in itself. (You have) to cut that off
and play this game, which has a lot of pressure to be at the
absolute highest level. Then it's kind of hard to cut it off after
the game, when you're still thinking about the game and your
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be an exerted effort to keep yourself grounded,''
Rams center Mike Gruttadauria said Tuesday during theSuper Bowl
photo and interview day when thousands of reporters, tape recorders
and television whirled around him. ``Being here, you think, how
could these guys (players) not get big heads?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is hard labor that people like to watch,'' Gruttadauria
said.``It's a job, a great job. I love doing it. On Sundays, you
get three hours where you're a star. Then you go back home and
remember what got you there: Being grounded, being courteous, being
a regular guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is regular, though, about how some players prepare _
mentally or physically _ for games. Ernie Holmes used the raw-meat
approach. A crazed defensive tackle of the four-time Super Bowl
champion Steelers of the '70s, he used to eat uncooked hot dogs
right out of a package while driving to Three Rivers Stadium. He
came out of the Fort Pitt Tunnel, looking down on Three Rivers
below, while stuffing a hot dog down his gullet. He wasn't
concerned about excess sodium or nitrates, just scarfing down dogs
to prepare him for an afternoon's fun.
</P>
<P>
   Caffeine, set to a soundtrack, was the thing for Bob Golic, the
former defensive lineman who played for the Patriots, Browns and
Raiders in a 14-year career.''I would sit in the locker room and
listen to heavy-metal music _ Metallica, Skid Row _ on my
headphones,'' said Golic, now 42. ``Anything that had a very hard,
very fast beat. Anything that got my heart going. And I'd drink a
pot, pot and a half of coffee. Black? No, cream and sugar. I'm not
that tough. I told my wife, `Once I start sweating, I'm ready to
go.'''
</P>
<P>
   Just to be sure, though, Golic would approach a teammate or two
and slap 'em in the head, psych 'em up.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has been hit this season with several instances of
violence by players; the most publicized was the Panthers' Rae
Carruth being charged with murder in the death of his pregnant
girlfriend. The Dolphins' Cecil Collins, in his latest brush with
the law, was charged for breaking and entering. Titans starting
cornerback Denard Walker is on probation after being charged last
summer for assaulting a former girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Other incidents have occurred, sometimes on Sunday nights after
games. That never was a problem for Golic. ``My adrenaline was
still going, but it wasn't like I still had to go out there and
continue venting my aggression,'' he said. ``I don't think I've
ever been in a bar fight. The only fight (off the field) I ever had
was in the sixth grade. I got beat up by a seventh-grader, 'cause I
didn't know how to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the transformation is when you're done playing and
those three hours (of watching a game) are done, you're still with
your family. That's tough. The only adjustment I had to make was
when I stopped playing, what to do with the free time. When I was
playing, I didn't mind losing if I'd played my butt off, tried my
hardest. With other people, their problem comes when they can't
leave it on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   A SPECIAL EXAMPLE
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys have to be guys,'' Adam Timmerman said. Timmerman is the
intense and funny fifth-year veteran left guard who left the
Packers last winter to sign as an unrestricted free agent with the
Rams and is in his third Super Bowl in four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kind of turn it on when you get on the field,'' Timmerman
said. ``You almost transform into this evil, violent, nasty person
when you get on the field. You have to turn it up. Then when it's
done, you turn it off. Go home, go hold your son, give your wife a
kiss and turn it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of funny. People say, `Would you want your son to
play football?''' said Timmerman, whose wife, Jana, gave birth to
their first child, Mason, 10 months ago. ``I'd say, yeah, if he
wants to. I know the risks.'' Diane Chandler knows the pattern well
for her husband, Chris, a Falcons quarterback. ``His (pre-game
routine) is different,'' Diane Chandler said. ``Chris really winds
down. He's gearing up but becomes more quiet while doing it. On
Saturdays, he ends up sleeping almost the entire day, because, you
know, your adrenaline can kind of slow you down.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a quarterback, it's more mental,'' Diane Chandler said.
``The other guys have to gear up more physically, but he has to
gear up mentally. I know one time last year, he carpooled to the
airport with some of the offensive linemen. He said they were
getting all fired up and (AC/DC's) `Highway to Hell' was blaring on
the radio. He was all squished in the back of the (vehicle). He
said, `I'm never riding with those guys any more.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets fired up, because you have to to play a game that's so
physical, but not the way other guys do. He thinks a lot, and he
studies almost every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jones always had a fine example of handling football's
highs and lows. Growing up in Columbia, S.C., his high school coach
was his father, Dave. ``We all got the opportunity to watch him, to
see how he handled his business as a coach, then came home to be a
father and a husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great dad _ until I got to the point where I played
for him,'' Jones said, smiling. ``He did a great job of being a
coach and a father.''
</P>
<P>
   FAMILY CHANGES STYLE
</P>
<P>
   His father's example helped Jones with his change in lifestyle.
``Having babies helped,'' said Jones, whose wife, Javonda, gave
birth to their daughter Courtney, 2, and son Mike Jr., 1. ``When my
little man comes up and steps on my toes, you know, I'm back home.
When my little girl jumps in my arms, that helps me switch gears.
Now, when I come home, my wife can be in a bad mood, from having
had a tough day with the kids. You have to be more forgiving and
understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   The Joneses also have custody of a 15-year-old named Steven;
Jones hopes the adoption process will be completed in a few months.
``When I come home from games, he's downstairs, and I can reflect
on the game with him,'' Jones said. ``He'll have some questions,
and it's almost a way to relieve some stress for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also a way to teach him some things: persevering,
overcoming adversity, giving it your best. It'll give me the
opportunity to raise a man while a man's still being developed.
That's really cool.''
</P>
<P>
   So is this, Jones says: ``It's cool to be the big-time athlete
in the NFL, then come home and cuddle with your wife and kids.''
And leave the game behind.

CLINTON BASKS IN AFTERGLOW OF HIS LAST STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (See also CLINTON-SPEECH-MEDIA, CLINTON-RATINGS) 
(lh) 
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUINCY, Ill. _ The last time Bill Clinton came close to this
tiny town along the Mississippi was during his first run for the
presidency in 1992, when his campaign bus roared past here on its
way to a rally across the river. He returned Friday as president,
seven years later, to relish the aftermath of his final,
proposal-packed State of the Union message.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton always hits the road the morning after his annual
addresses to Congress, repeating themes meant as much for the
country's heartland as for the chamber full of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   In Quincy, a once struggling city now in the midst of a boom, he
chose the ideal spot to bask in the post-speech glow. The quaint
streets here were lined for miles with well-wishers.
</P>
<P>
   At the downtown square where Clinton spoke _ the same spot where
one of the famous Lincoln-Douglas debates took place _ excited
residents huddled in the cold for hours before his arrival, many of
them schoolchildren given a snow day despite not a single flurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you saw the speech last night, you know that I quoted
President Theodore Roosevelt, one of my favorite predecessors,''
said Clinton, who will soon become the youngest ex-president after
Roosevelt. ``He's the last sitting president to come to Quincy. I
don't know what the others were thinking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the crowd indicated they had taken in his televised
speech, all 89 minutes of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched every part of that speech, every minute of it, and I
liked everything he said,'' said Maurice A. Crider, a retired
autoworker who wore a knit hat pulled low over his head. He stood
in the center square packed tight with more than 10,000 others.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody there had voted for Clinton, but it was difficult
to find someone who did not find something meant for them in the
speech. ``I loved the photo IDs for guns,'' said Pam Foster, a
counselor at Catholic Charities, backing the president's proposal
for the requirement of state identification cards for handgun
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're grain farmers, so what I liked was the farm part of his
speech,'' said Kay Wood, a Clinton backer whose family runs a
520-acre farm in Alexandria, Mo. ``He said things are in bad shape,
and we know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Debby Birch, an English teacher at a junior high school, voted
for President Bush in 1992 and Bob Dole four years later, but she
still jockeyed for position along a rope line for a chance to shake
Clinton's hand. She came away excited that he had said some words
to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't anything he said in the speech that I was
against,'' Ms. Birch said, calling it his ``last-chance speech'' to
try to vindicate his presidency before the next president takes
over.
</P>
<P>
   She said she supported Clinton's education agenda, his tax-cut
plan and other parts of the speech, indicating its broad appeal.
But she still considered herself very much a Republican. ``I still
ideologically don't agree with everything he says,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Quincy's unemployment was in the double digits when Clinton took
office. It suffered heavy damages from the major floods that soaked
the Midwest in 1993. Aides carefully chose this spot to represent
America as much better off than it had been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was unemployed back in the late '80s, and now I'm working,''
said Ken Gibleon, who took the afternoon off from his job at a
downtown nursing home to snap a photograph of Clinton. ``This
president has turned the economy around. I give him credit for
that. My favorite part of the speech was the help with college
tuition. I have a daughter in college, and that hit home with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1992, just up the river in Burlington, Iowa, Clinton had
hammered his opponent for claiming an economic recovery that many
Americans could not feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent is quoted as saying the recession is over,'' the
then-governor of Arkansas had said. ``You just don't know it yet.
That's what they've been telling you all along. Things are great.
You're just too dumb to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now things really were great, Clinton said _ although he took
pains to repeat his message from Thursday night that too many
Americans are still left out of the country's good times.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that really bothers me about this
astonishing economic recovery of ours is that not everybody has
participated in it,'' the president said. ``And I think all
Americans will support us in saying that this is the best time
we'll ever have _ with unemployment low and growth high _ to go
into these inner cities, into these small rural towns, into these
Native American reservations, and help turn their economies
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gathered with several hundred supporters at the White
House immediately after the speech Thursday night, a pep rally that
lasted until the wee hours of the morning and prompted the
president to nap aboard Air Force One Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning at the White House, Clinton assessed his
performance before about 300 mayors and aides. He reiterated his
long list of proposals, from targeted tax cuts to major funding
increases for education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   And he took another crack at the line about making communities
more livable that he twice bungled as ``liberal'' during his moment
in the spotlight. ``That was weird,'' the president said. ``In my
whole life, I've never mispronounced that word before last night.''

MIAMI TRIAL TARGETS `AMERICA'S PIMP' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Tracey Barnes figured out early in life how he wanted
to make a living and stuck with it.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old man who goes by street name ``Vitamin T'' has
been a pimp since he was 16, according to court documents and
prosecutors. And, as he proudly told a teenage prostitute last
summer, he intends on ``stayin' pimpin.'''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, however, isn't your garden variety procurer,
investigators say. He's accused of being America's pimp _ taking
prostitutes from Seattle and shipping them across country to earn
him money.
</P>
<P>
   Some should have been in school. Barnes allegedly recruited
girls as young as 15 and 16 off Seattle streets _ approaching one
as she waited for a school bus _ and sent them thousands of miles
away to ply the illegal sex trade.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes is on trial in a federal courtroom in Miami, charged with
forcing or enticing women to cross state lines to engage in
prostitution. At least two young women from Seattle who worked the
streets and a Seattle police vice detective have testified against
Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   His case is expected to go to the jury Tuesday. He faces up to
20 years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers say the teen prostitutes weren't corrupted by
Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not young girls, but street-smart prostitutes'' who
were turning tricks before they met Barnes, contends public
defenfer Mary Barzee.
</P>
<P>
   It's unusual for a prostitution case to wind up in federal
court. That's a reflection of how fed up Miami police and
prosecutors are with child prostitution, which puts young women at
risk for beatings, rape and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The men who put the girls on the street are rarely caught. When
they are, they get little more than a few months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were seeing more and more child prostitution on the streets
of Miami. People who were the pimps were just picking up and moving
to another state,'' said Jennifer Prior, the prosecutor trying to
put Barnes in prison. Prior is leading a nationwide investigation
into child prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Miami turned to federal law, which provides far
tougher punishment than state statutes. Federal prosecutors are
also able to tie together prostitution cases in several states.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in other jurisdictions, including Detroit,
Los Angeles and Minneapolis, also are turning to the Mann Act to
fight child prostitution, Prior said.
</P>
<P>
   The rarely used law was passed in 1910 to combat so-called
``white slavery'' _ forcing young women into prostitution or simply
selling them.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. attorneys in Miami used it for the first time last summer,
winning a conviction against a Portland man. George Lamon Hardin
Jr. enticed a 15-year-old Oregon runaway to Miami _ in time to work
the streets before the 1999 Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested the girl several times in Miami, ultimately
connecting her to Hardin. They arrested him as he stepped off a
plane at Miami International Airport. Hardin, known as
``Godfather,'' got 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   After federal prosecutors are through with Barnes, authorities
in Seattle want him. He was charged here in September with assault,
promoting prostitution and kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an individual that preyed on a variety of victims, and
those victims included juveniles,'' said Sgt. Jeff Chen of the
Seattle Police Department's vice squad. ``Any time juveniles are
involved, it's a priority for this department.''
</P>
<P>
   Serious time behind bars would be something new for Barnes. His
brushes with the law have been frequent. But he has typically
served only short stints in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy has had his wrist slapped over and over again by the
state,'' Prior said.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' involvement with prostitution dates back to at least
October 1985, when he was 16, according to Seattle court records.
</P>
<P>
   He offered to drive a 17-year-old girl from high school to a
welfare office. Instead, he took her to Tacoma, then Seattle's
Chinatown, ordering her to work the streets. He threatened that she
might not see her child if she didn't comply.
</P>
<P>
   She ended up that night at a Capitol Hill nursing home, where
she had sex with an old man for $50.
</P>
<P>
   For that crime and a related robbery, a judge sent Barnes to a
state juvenile institution for about a year.
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, a 21-year-old Barnes had refined his efforts to attract
employees. In October that year, Barnes approached a woman who
appeared to be working as a prostitute on the SeaTac strip on
Pacific Highway South, a notorious area south of Seattle known for
prostitution. He told her she looked like she needed ``feeling and
touching all over,'' according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   He asked whether she wanted to join his ``family,'' make money
and ride in Cadillacs.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was an undercover cop working a ``john patrol'' to
crack down on the customers of prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised and chagrined to discover she was an
undercover police officer when she arrested me,'' Barnes wrote
later in his statement of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Police who arrested him also found a .22-caliber pistol on
Barnes. He didn't have a permit.
</P>
<P>
   A month earlier, Seattle police picked up Barnes for possession
of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors offered Barnes a plea bargain. They combined the
drug and promoting-prostitution cases. Barnes pleaded guilty and
was sentenced to 11 months in the King County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   By the the mid-1990s, Barnes had gone from local to national and
his employees had gotten younger, prosecutors contend.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents filed in the case pending against him in King
County accuse him of recruiting teenagers, brazenly handing them
his business card and talking dreamily of earning lots of cash and
diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   He also made threats, making good on some of them, according to
prosecutors. Barnes beat one young woman 17 times with a wire coat
hanger, according to court documents used to charge him with
kidnapping and other offenses.
</P>
<P>
   His work force included three young women from Seattle. Court
documents filed by prosecutors in September tell their stories:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Christina was 15 when she went with Barnes to his home.
She told him she was 16. He showed her photographs of money and
told her she would be his ``ho.''
</P>
<P>
   They had sex the next night. Then Christina, supplied with
condoms and a pager number, went to work.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Jessica first saw Barnes when she was 16. She was waiting
for a bus after getting out of school.
</P>
<P>
   She initially refused his offer, then changed her mind when life
at home became intolerable. She prostituted herself for two years,
traveling across the country. In California, she was making $700 to
$800 a night. All the money went to Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Valerie was 18 when Barnes recruited her to be a
prostitute in Cleveland. She joined her friend Jessica there and
had sex with men in Jessica's company.
</P>
<P>
   She turned the money over to Barnes. When Barnes pressured her
to work by herself, she got scared and called Ohio police.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes apparently is proud of his business acumen and given to
bragging about his abilities, court documents show. He did so last
June over the telephone to Jessica _ with Seattle vice detectives
listening in.
</P>
<P>
   It was in that call that he said he was ``stayin' pimpin.''' He
claimed to have prostitutes ``on automatic'' in different states,
and boasted of beating one of his girls the night before, according
to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami case focuses on five prostitutes, four of whom are
from Seattle. They worked six days a week, making about $700 a
night, Prior said. Their earnings of $20,000 or so a week went to
Barnes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Prior said Barnes picked the right young women. Most were
troubled in one way or another. Some were emotional wrecks. Others
had drug habits to support, or were ready to flee problems at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to find someone who is manipulatable,'' Prior said.
``He fills a void they are looking to fill.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Hill works with prostitutes in Hawaii, trying to get them
off the streets and away from the sex trade. She said pimps offer
``whatever the young girl thinks she needs at that time. Maybe she
breaks up with her boyfriend and wants a young man to love. Maybe
she never had a father, and she needs a father figure.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pimp is really exerting total control over the women,
said Hill, who runs an organization called Sisters Offering
Support.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the relationship is like that of an abusive husband
and battered woman, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the abuse, the wife continues to stay at home. Despite
the degradation and potential danger, the prostitute comes back to
the pimp, offering the money she has made him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no money; they have no ID,'' Hill said. ``They have
no one to call.''

<P>
   KATZRIN, Golan Heights _ When Gabi Katz took over as manager of
Israel's biggest water-bottling plant last month, the workers were
in an uproar, and no wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks with Syria suddenly threatened the plant's very
existence: Eden Springs, the mineral water company, had become one
of the biggest investors and employers in the Golan Heights, which
Israel captured in 1967. But any peace accord would almost
certainly return all or most of the Golan Heights to Syrian control
_ and the factory site and the pristine spring that supplies the
water would go along with it.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, executives of Eden Springs, whose stock is listed in
Tel Aviv under its Hebrew name, Mayanot Eden, were saying they
could do business with Syria. But what about the workers?
</P>
<P>
   Most of the plant's staff of 60 are recent Jewish immigrants
from the former Soviet Union, and were unnerved by the prospect of
what they see as an equally repressive dictatorship seizing their
new homes and workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Then word got around that the local Coca-Cola bottler, which had
distributed Eden Springs to retailers for a decade, had
unexpectedly canceled the contract. Was Coke trying to sidestep
trouble with the Arab world, or did it think Eden Springs had an
unreliable future as a supplier?
</P>
<P>
   To top it off, the day the peace talks started, Eden Springs
announced the planned sale of a big equity stake to a private
American investment fund. Workers worried that the news was a
prelude to one of those Wall Street takeovers they had read about,
in which companies are dismantled and assets peddled to the highest
bidder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was quite confused,'' Katz said. ``These are highly
intelligent, highly educated people, and they are aware of
everything that is happening here, in Israel, in the world. They
needed some explanations.''
</P>
<P>
   He called in the chief executive from Tel Aviv, Yariv Shapira,
to talk to the staff in the company cafeteria. Shapira told them
that Eden Springs was already reserving rights to another mineral
water well in the Galilee hills, within Israel's pre-1967 borders,
and promised the Katzrin workers that they ``are all welcome to
work in the new plant, whenever and wherever it can be built.''
</P>
<P>
   The American investors were brought in because the company,
which had been almost entirely Israeli-owned, needed fresh capital
to diversify into new products and markets in Europe, he told them.
And Eden Springs would no longer be delivered to stores along with
Coca-Cola because of a simple marketing conflict: the Coke bottler
had invested in another water company.
</P>
<P>
   Eden Springs is healthy and expanding, and it will stay in
business no matter what happens to the Golan Heights, Shapira
assured them.
</P>
<P>
   Katz said, ``The atmosphere is much more relaxed now.''
</P>
<P>
   The need to grapple with the uncertainties of the peace talks
struck Eden Springs faster than its neighbors. Unlike Eden Springs,
the other important business ventures in the Golan Heights _ a ski
resort, a premium winery, a highly automated dairy farm _ are owned
by local kibbutzim and collective farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no mandate to seek alternatives, because our
shareholders are communities in the Golan,'' said Victor
Schoenfeld, who works next door to Eden Springs as chief winemaker
at the Golan Heights Winery.
</P>
<P>
   But Eden Springs has been publicly traded since 1992, and
shareholders are understandably nervous about the business
implications of a possible Syrian peace pact. Although it has
investments in mineral-water bottlers in Poland, Switzerland and
Spain, the company still draws 85 percent of its revenue from the
sale of Golan Heights spring water to more than 100,000 customers
across Israel.
</P>
<P>
   It was a ``mere coincidence,'' the company said in a Dec. 15
news release, that the agreement to sell up to 25 percent of the
company to Aqua International Partners, a $300 million investment
fund in San Francisco, happened to be made public on the day peace
talks began in Washington. The sale would be accomplished through a
new stock offering that could net Eden Springs up to $47 million in
investable cash.
</P>
<P>
   Local market reaction was skeptical. The announcement _ which
valued Eden Springs at $190 million, substantially above its Tel
Aviv stock market capitalization of $140 million at that day's
prices _ seemed remarkably serendipitous, coming on the very day
that the company's chief asset came under geopolitical threat.
</P>
<P>
   Eden Springs's stock, which peaked at $12.17 just before the
talks started, fell 12 percent in the next few days; it closed on
Thursday at $10.04.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli analysts suggested cynically that the Naftali
family, the company's majority owners, had arranged the
announcement to fix a steep price on the company in anticipation of
a government compensation package after a peace pact.
</P>
<P>
   But Aqua International confirmed that it had signed an agreement
detailing the terms for the proposed purchase, noting that Eden
Springs was a local market leader with double-digit yearly sales
growth and the beginnings of potentially profitable franchises in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Managed by the privately held Texas Pacific Group, Aqua
International takes positions in water-related businesses from
irrigation to desalination to the office water-cooler trade that
Eden Springs dominates in Israel. The deal could be completed by
April, Eden Springs says.
</P>
<P>
   Whether a peace settlement and its consequences will be
discernible by then is another matter. Company officials talk
bravely about continuing operations under Syrian sovereignty. The
Damascus market is underserved, they say, and sales to Israel might
still be possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``In theory there is no problem about leaving the factory
there,'' said Nir Dor, the company's chief financial officer. ``It
could be sold to an American or a European company, or perhaps kept
as a joint venture. It really depends on what kind of a peace
agreement we are going to have.''
</P>
<P>
   But Syria has made it clear that it wants all Israeli residents
out of the Golan and the Israeli presence there erased. Eden
Springs is already calculating that the plant's $25 million of
bottling equipment could be moved in just six months to a new site
near the Galilee spring. And it says it is confident that the
Israeli government will help underwrite the move with subsidies or
tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the peace talks stall, the company has decided that it
needs a new foundation in undisputed territory. ``We already have
the solution,'' said Katz, referring to the cold, clear waters of
the undeveloped Galilee spring. ``We are not waiting until the last
moment to act.''

SMOKE CLEARS IN CURRY CASE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Unspecified ``communication issues'' between Cal
State Northridge women's basketball player Edniesha Curry and head
coach Frozena Jerro caused Curry to leave the team, a player said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddy feels like coach Fro is not the same as last year,'' said
Jamiliah Jones, Curry's roommate and teammate. `` . . . When you
talk, you don't really get through. Or (Jerro) doesn't see it the
way we see it.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Curry and Jerro's problems have been ongoing but came
to a heated point early in Sunday's practice. A frustrated Curry
exchanged words with assistant coach Karen Howell, and Howell
kicked her out of practice. Jerro sided with her coach.

   Jones believes the two need to talk, but Jerro should call Curry
first.
</P>
<P>
   Curry declined to come to the phone as Jones was being
interviewed. Jerro didn't come to school Friday and couldn't be
reached.
</P>
<P>
   Jones also admitted she left the team for similar reasons, not
because of of her step-grandfather's illness. Jones might return
and plans to speak with Jerro at some point, perhaps Sunday,
``maybe prior.''

ON WALL STREET, THE WORST JANUARY IN YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
 (See also ECON-REPORT)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices fell sharply Friday as the three major
market indexes prepared to post their worst performances for a
January in a decade or more.
</P>
<P>
   If the current levels hold through Monday, the technology-heavy
Nasdaq index, off 4.5 percent for the year, will chalk up its worst
start to a year since 1990, the year that the nation's last
recession began. The Dow Jones industrial average, down 6.6
percent, will have its worst January since 1978. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's index of 500 stocks, down 7.4 percent, will have its worst
January since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, this disappointing performance occurs just as the
nation's economy is setting a record for the longest economic
expansion in its history.
</P>
<P>
   The sell-off was sparked by rising short-term interest rates and
growing fear that the Federal Reserve might have to slam on the
brakes, instead of just tapping on them, to slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
   That concern was heightened Friday as the government reported
that inflation, employer costs and economic growth all rose more
than expected in the last three months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department said that the gross domestic product
grew at an annual rate of 5.8 percent in the last quarter. The
inflation gauge rose 2 percent in the quarter, almost twice the 1.1
rise in the third quarter. Meanwhile, the Labor Department said
that its employment cost index rose 1.1 percent, powered by the
largest increase in health care payments, bonuses and other
benefits in six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Fed is going to be raising rates, the stock market is
going to be going down,'' said Jeffrey Applegate, the chief U.S.
strategist at Lehman Brothers, who is still optimistic about the
stock market outlook for the year. ``And I think that is all that
is going on here.''
</P>
<P>
   But given the strong economy and increasing inflationary
pressures, the Fed might now have to raise its short-term interest
rate target more than the two quarter-point moves that Lehman
Brothers had forecast, Applegate said. ``The equity correction
could be longer in duration and deeper in decline than it would
have been,'' he said. ``But unless the Fed has to tighten a lot,
this still shouldn't be more than a correction.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Berner, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, said he did not think there was any sign of a major upswing
in inflation. But, he said, ``I think we are starting to see
cyclical forces pushing inflation higher and the markets are having
to deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 289.15 points, or 2.62
percent, to 10,738.87 Friday. The S&AMP;P 500 dropped 38.40, or 2.75
percent to 1,360.16. Technology stocks, including Qualcomm and
Amazon, showed their volatility as the Nasdaq composite finished at
3,887.07, down 152.49 points, or 3.77 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of the stock market in January has been a
reasonably good _ but not surefire _ predictor of performance for
the entire year. Over time, the stock market has tended to do
better the rest of the year after strong Januarys than weak ones.
But remember that in 1987, the Dow rose 13.8 percent, its best
January ever, before crashing in the fall of that year. The Dow
plunged 508.33 points, or 22.6 percent on Oct. 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow is now on the way to recording its biggest loss since
the 7.4 percent decline posted in January 1978, while the S&AMP;P is
approaching the 7.65 percent decline of January 1970. The Nasdaq
index's previous worst January was the 8.6 percent decline in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   While stock prices fell Friday, the bond market convulsed. The
fear of Fed rate increases sent shorter-term interest rates higher,
while a sudden influx of cash as investors sought the safety of
government debt, pushed long-term rates lower. The decline in
long-term interest rates was surprising given the whiff of
inflationary pressure in the government economic reports.
</P>
<P>
   But this may have been explained by special factors, including
the Treasury's plan to buy back a lot of longer-term debt as it
pays down the nation's debt with growing federal budget surpluses.
The expected relative scarcity of 30-year bonds in the future has
made them especially attractive.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year bond dropped to 6.45 percent, from 6.52
percent Thursday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction,
rose 28/32, to 95 25/32. But in a sign of the fears of rising
short-term interest rates, the yield on the Treasury's two-year
note jumped to 6.54 percent, from 5.51 percent, and is higher than
the yield on the 30-year bond for the first time since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, such an inverted yield curve, if it persisted, has
signaled that the economy was going to slow or that even a
recession was possible. But the special factors that have lowered
the yield on the 30-year bond make it a unreliable predictor,
according to some economists. In fact, the yield on Treasury's
10-year note, at 6.69 percent, is still higher than the two-year
note.

</P>
<P>
   Karen Parker, director of currency research at Chase Securities,
said that the cash flooded into the Treasury markets after
investors sold off Europe's single currency, the euro, in the last
two days. It fell through the psychologically important $1 level
Thursday and even lower Friday, ending at 97.78 cents, down from
98.86 cents.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that losses from the euro trade appeared to
trigger changes of strategies of investors in other currencies,
leading to selloffs of these currencies against the dollar. The
most significant was the Australian dollar, which plunged 3.7
percent against the American dollar Friday. The Japanese yen also
fell.
</P>
<P>
   There were also rumors that a hedge fund had suffered major
losses, triggering some of the turmoil in the currency markets. Ms.
Parker said that whether or not this was true, the selling of the
Australian dollar was not just from one source. She said it was
widespread and done by many mainline institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   Many hot performers of last year have been dropped during the
decline in the stock market so far this year. For example, three of
the top 10 performers in the Dow last year _ Wal-Mart, Microsoft
and Home Depot _ are in the top 10 losers so far this year, all
with 14 percent or more declines.
</P>
<P>
   In addition countercyclical stocks _ like pharmaceuticals and
consumer staples that do well even if the economy is slowing _ have
performed well. Merck &AMP; Co., which rose 2\, to 76 3/8 Friday, is up
almost 14 percent for the year.

WIZARD VS. DRAGON: A CLOSE CONTEST, BUT THE FIRE-BREATHER WINS
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ One is a majestic 1,000-year-old epic, translated from
the Old English by a Nobel Prize-winning poet and suffused with
history, heroism and the sheepish atavistic guilt attached to books
you should have read but didn't. The other is a contemporary
children's tale about a young wizard who fights the forces of evil
while trying to finish his homework, and who seems single-handedly
to have introduced the concept of recreational reading to a
generation of computer-distracted boys.
</P>
<P>
   When the judges of the Whitbread Prize, one of Britain's premier
literary competitions, decided this week to award the book of the
year title, worth (PS)21,000, or $34,000, to Seamus Heaney's new
translation of ``Beowulf'' instead of to J.K. Rowling's ``Harry
Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,'' they touched off a debate
that spilled from their smoke-filled room to the wider reaches of a
Britain that enjoys nothing more than a good argument about the
relative merits of high and low culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the only reason this has caught people's imagination
is that it does encapsulate this great debate about popularity
versus excellence,'' said best-selling writer Robert Harris, one of
the Whitbread judges. He was not pleased with the 5-4 vote, having
been a staunch supporter of ``Harry Potter.'' ``This exemplifies
the gap between the arbiters of literary taste and the appetite of
the public for books,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The biographer Anthony Holden, another judge and the vociferous
leader of the victorious Heaney faction, would disagree. ``
`Potter' is charming, but I think it's derivative, traditional and
not particularly well-written, and to compare it to Heaney is
absurd,'' he said. ``If `Harry Potter' had won the Whitbread book
of the year it would have been sending out a signal to the world
that Britain is a country that just can't grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not a new debate, and it is not unique to Britain. But in
a country with a proud tradition of high thinking and high art, it
is a question that comes up every time people discuss culture here.
Does popular art _ a crowd-pleasing sculpture of a shark in a tank
by Damien Hirst, say, or an internationally successful movie like
``Four Weddings and a Funeral'' _ have as much inherent worth as a
traditional painting or a dark, beautifully created film that few
people will see and fewer still might bother to understand?
</P>
<P>
   To Harris, the dissonance between high and low art is at its
worst when it comes to literature. ``There's an English
snobbishness that began in this country around the time of Virginia
Woolf and that has infected the bloodstream like a poison,'' he
said, noting that it was his understanding that the prize, set up
29 years ago by Whitbread &AMP; Co., the British beverage maker and pub
chain, was supposed to go to the most enjoyable book of the year.
``It says that if everyone can understand something it's no good
and if only a select few can understand it, then it has literary
merit.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, there has been no escaping the phenomenon of
Harry Potter, the boy with magical powers who goes off to Hogwarts,
a wizards' boarding school where owls deliver the mail, people in
paintings wander out of the frame to visit their friends in other
paintings and everyone's favorite sport is played on broomsticks.
Ms. Rowling's first three Harry Potter books have so enraptured
children, and their parents, that they are now published in 33
countries, with worldwide sales of some 27.5 million copies. They
hold the top three spots on the best-seller list of The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beowulf'' is hardly as popular, but it has more than held its
own. The story of a warrior-prince who heroically slays a horrible
monster, the monster's horrible mother and then a hideous dragon,
it was written by an unknown poet between the middle of the seventh
century and the end of the 10th. Seamus Heaney's lush, thrilling
translation, commissioned by W.W. Norton for inclusion in the
latest edition of the Norton Anthology of English Literature,
became a surprise best seller in Britain. There are now 75,000
copies in print here, a staggering number for a poetry book.
</P>
<P>
   When the book was published, reviewers showered it and its
author, widely considered to be the greatest living
English-speaking poet, with praise of the highest order. ``Seamus
Heaney, like the Nordic hero himself, was clearly `in fighting
mood, awake and on edge, spoiling for action' as he wrote for his
new translation,'' said Rachel Campbell-Johnson in The Times of
London, quoting from the poem. ``He tears back the thickets of
scholarship which have bound this cornerstone of English literary
tradition and frees a living voice from the snares of pedantry.''
</P>
<P>
   When it came time for the Whitbread Prize, then, it was almost
inevitable that both Heaney and Ms. Rowling would make it to the
short list. The Whitbread is a strange sort of prize, in which
first-round winners of five different categories are pitted against
one another in the final competition for book of the year, as
terriers might compete against hounds for best of show in a dog
show.
</P>
<P>
   The judges' meeting was rancorous almost from the start, with
Holden leading a Heaney contingent that also included the model
Jerry Hall, and Harris and the humor writer Nigel Williams firmly
in the Harry Potter camp.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Insults were freely traded _ at one point, Harris called
Holden's attitude pompous and someone denounced ``Beowulf'' as ``a
boring book about dragons'' _ as the discussion became more heated.
Surprised by the sharp tone of what was meant to be a collegial
meeting, the judges nervously lighted cigarettes and when the
Champagne materialized began swigging from the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   News of the dispute filtered out quickly, even though the judges
had promised not to tell anyone what they said. Commenting on
television (in Britain, top literary awards are televised and
discussed by panels of celebrities, much the way sports might be
televised and discussed by panels of athletes), David Baddiel, a
comic writer, called Holden a ``pompous prat.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, London's literary editors were sharpening their
pencils. ``Heaney's feat in turning `Beowulf' into a compelling and
poignant poem in our living language is certainly the equal of any
supposedly original work,'' wrote David Sexton, the literary editor
of The Evening Standard. ``The best book won, fair and square.''
Erica Wagner, the literary editor of The Times of London, said in
an interview that the point of the prize was to celebrate great
literature, not record-breaking sales. ``In my opinion, `Beowulf'
is a towering work of literature,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the aggressively populist Daily Mail conducted a
survey of well-known literary figures, asking whether they had ever
read ``Beowulf'' and whether they knew how it ended. Many said they
hadn't, and didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always seemed very boring and not the sort of book I've
ever had the desire to pull off the shelf,'' said Alain de Botton,
the author of ``How Proust Can Change Your Life,'' among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   Holden remains unbowed. ``If I'm a pompous prat for saying that
Seamus Heaney's `Beowulf' is greater literature than Harry
Potter,'' he said, ``then I'm proud to be a pompous prat.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock investors may hope that the one-quarter-point
increase in interest rates that is expected this week from the
Federal Reserve Board will not do more damage to their already
clipped holdings.
</P>
<P>
   But another matter that could affect them a bit more directly
has floated onto the radar screen of regulators. That is the
year-end surge in borrowing by stock investors, known as margin
debt.
</P>
<P>
   As prices have soared, so has the debt accumulated by investors.
Margin debt at New York Stock Exchange member firms grew from
$140.1 billion in 1998 to $228.5 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed sets margin requirements. Since 1974, investors have had
to put up half the initial cost of buying a stock. As long as
increases in margin debt kept pace with gains in share prices, few
fretted. Then, last November and December, margin debt spurted 25
percent while stocks rose 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has worried that the jump may
be an indicator of froth in the market. But he has also said that
he would not raise margin requirements to tone things down. Limits
on borrowing hurt small investors more than institutions, and are
not effective, he believes.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Kaufman, the noted Wall Street economist, disagrees.
``When you raise margin requirements, you express a concern that is
telegraphed to the market at large,'' he said. ``You express a
concern about speculation, the inappropriate use of credit and
risks that it may expose to the financial system.''
</P>
<P>
   With stocks at lofty levels _ the NASDAQ 100 stock index has a
price-to-earnings ratio of 121 _ a warning may be in order. But
raising margin requirements would be hugely unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   Still, an increase could help solve one problem Greenspan does
acknowledge _ the wealth effect, where rising stock prices make a
hot economy hotter. Higher share prices have a direct correlation
to consumer spending and economic growth, so higher margin
requirements could blunt the wealth effect's impact. Yet Greenspan
has asked securities regulators only to study the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that mean that to do something about it, we have to have
long experience with it and a major problem?'' Kaufman asked.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors may not realize that borrowing to buy stocks
works only when shares rise. When they drift or fall, margin is
costly. And heavy investor debt can exacerbate a market decline; as
stocks fall, margined investors are likely to sell holdings, rather
than put up more cash as required. Selling begets selling.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan may be hoping that the nation's brokerage firms will
do his work for him by raising their margin requirements. This is
how he conducts interest-rate policy, letting the bond market raise
rates ahead of the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   But lending money to investors is very lucrative for these
firms; they reap both margin interest and extra commissions from
investors buying twice the stock they would have otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when the Big Board and NASD recently proposed to
increase the amount of cash or securities that a day trader must
have in his account, they relaxed other rules, letting day traders
borrow twice what they had been able to before.
</P>
<P>
   And so the borrowing binge goes on.

 &HT;    Similarities in campaigns likely will change after primaries
 &HT;    (EDs: EMBARGOED for Sunday, Jan. 30)
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Come Wednesday, the paths the two parties
take toward nominating their presidential candidates will begin to
diverge sharply.
</P>
<P>
   In the lead-up to the nation's first presidential primaries
Tuesday, the Democratic and Republican campaigns have roughly
mirrored each other.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties have clear front-runners in Vice President Al Gore
and Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Both have challengers, in former
Sen. Bill Bradley and Sen. John McCain, who have caught the public
eye by defying their party's establishments and forging
unconventional campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly here in New Hampshire, Bradley and McCain often
have vied for the same voters: independents or those willing to
cross party lines to vote for an individual they think has
integrity.
</P>
<P>
   After New Hampshire, both the calendar and the contours of the
two campaigns will change.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have only one non-binding caucus between Tuesday's
primary and the big March 7 primary day when 15 states vote. The
Republicans, on the other hand, have eight primaries and caucuses
in February.
</P>
<P>
   If polls turn out to be accurate, Tuesday's primary will also
change the position of each challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign has been hurt by his Iowa caucus loss, his
heart problems and Gore's aggressive attacks. He has the money to
soldier on into March 7 and try to regroup in New York and other
northeastern states, but a loss here would deal a severe blow to
his chances.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley has foundered, McCain has been gaining ground.
Some of the most striking evidence of this comes from tracking
polls conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center.
It showed McCain pulling into a narrow lead over Bush among
registered Republican voters, as well as maintaining his wide lead
among independents.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes has vowed to go on no matter what happens Tuesday.
So while Bush remains an overwhelming favorite, the Republican
nomination battle stands to go on longer than the Democrats'.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire is symbolically important to both parties, because
only one candidate who didn't finish first in New Hampshire, Bill
Clinton in 1992, has ever been elected president. Even in that case
there were special circumstances: Sen. Paul Tsongas of
Massachusetts, who won that Democratic primary, was running as a
virtual favorite son candidate, and Clinton was famously able to
fashion himself as the ``comeback kid'' with a respectable
second-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to remind people that although he came in second, he
was on the ropes coming into New Hampshire,'' said Kathleen
Sullivan, state Democratic chair.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire has had such influence that even a less than
sweeping first place finish was enough to convince Harry Truman not
to seek another term after Estes Kefauver nipped at his heels in
1952, and Lyndon Johnson to do the same after his match with Sen.
Eugene McCarthy in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expectations are the third rail of New Hampshire politics,''
former Gov. Hugh Merrill said this week at a symposium at Saint
Anselm's College.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Fran Wendelboe, a Republican from New Hampton, said
concern about keeping up that predictive streak could have at least
a small role in what happens Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are saying, if we get McCain and he dies in South
Carolina, we won't have any credibility,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wendelboe had already cast an absentee ballot, but after
supporting first Elizabeth Dole and then Dan Quayle, she wasn't
saying how she finally voted.
</P>
<P>
   The weather could play a role, in a couple of ways.
</P>
<P>
   If the winter storm afflicting Atlanta this weekend is still in
New England Tuesday, it could keep older voters away from the
polls, Wendelboe noted. That could help Bradley and McCain, whose
independent supporters tend to be younger.
</P>
<P>
   The price of home heating oil has more than doubled in the past
18 months, which could be on the minds of voters in the cold days
leading to the primary.
</P>
<P>
   At a town meeting in Bedford last week, Bush drew a pointed
question about whether he would be willing to ``stand up to Big
Oil.''
</P>
<P>
   One group not expected to be a big factor Tuesday are religious
conservatives. But an intriguing number of bumper stickers for Alan
Keyes have beeing showing up here after the Republican's
third-place finish in Iowa. Dean Eggert, a religious conservative
who is also a law partner of Sullivan, the Democratic chair, said
he's been getting calls from friends taking a second look at Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   According to Survey Center director Andrew Smith, the only
substantial group of religious conservatives are French-Canadian
Catholics. But Eggert, who attends a Baptist church in Concord,
said those like him are harder to find in New Hampshire because
they don't tend to organize in groups like the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll notice up here that our churches try assiduously to be
apolitical,'' Eggert said. ``A lot of that may be the Yankee
mentality that you don't try to force the members toward a
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   While they won't play as large a role in Iowa, religious
conservatives could affect the percentages, and correspondingly,
the perceptions. As a benchmark, Pat Robertson got close to 10
percent of the vote here in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The state law allowing same-day registration could also affect
the vote. In 1996, 26,000 people registered and voted on primary
day _ about 9 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   Since these tend to be voters who aren't on party mailing lists,
and who get most of their information from newspapers and
television, they could produce some surprises.

NEW YORK DROPS PSYCHIC TRAINING FROM WELFARE-TO-WORK PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nine months after New York City began recruiting
welfare recipients to work from home as telephone psychics, city
officials decided on Friday that there was no future in it.
</P>
<P>
   Jason A. Turner, commissioner of the city's Human Resources
Administration, announced the end of the city's arrangement with a
company calling itself Psychic Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though HRA believes people should have the freedom to choose
their own employment, HRA's Business Link has decided not to
include the Psychic Network as one of its participating
employers,'' Turner said in a one-paragraph statement issued
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to part company with the Psychic Network came on
the same day that an article on the arrangement was published in
The New York Times. Since April, 15 welfare recipients had been
trained to read tarot cards and hired by the Psychic Network
through Business Link, a division of the city welfare department
set up in 1995 as part of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's welfare-to-work
effort.
</P>
<P>
   A barrage of brickbats and belly laughs met the revelation of
the city's venture into the telepsychic realm.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen DiBrienza, chairman of the City Council's Committee on
General Welfare and a vigorous opponent of the mayor's welfare
policies, seemed almost gleeful in his outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bizarre,'' he said. ``Remember, this is taxpayer funds. I
don't think I could find anything more bizarre and at the same time
more disturbing if I tried.''
</P>
<P>
   DiBrienza, who has accused Turner of failing to answer the
committee's questions about the types of jobs the city's
welfare-to-work programs provide, added, ``It's no wonder they
stonewall us if these are the kinds of jobs they're pushing.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelley Ackerman, the president of the New York chapter of
Astrological Federation of America, was upset for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm horrified that this is going on,'' she said, eager to draw
a line between a quickie course in tarot and ``astrological studies
that have been around for thousands and thousands of years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That a city agency would do this _ it's unbelievable, it's
just unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Under city, state and federal welfare-to-work programs, any
business that hires a welfare recipient for at least three months
can qualify for thousands of dollars in wage subsidies and tax
credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no criteria at all,'' Carmen Ortiz, national
coordinator of the tax credit program, said in a recent interview.
Michael Kaufman, a financial economist with the U.S. Treasury
Department, estimated the tax credits granted nationwide in the
program at $370 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to city figures, Psychic Network was one of 161
businesses that successfully recruited with Business Link, which
was set up to connect companies in need of workers with welfare
recipients in need of jobs. In his statement, Turner cited as
examples Bell Atlantic, Macy's, Rite Aid, Madison Square Garden and
United Airlines.

 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ Juan Miguel Gonzalez prefaces his answers to almost
every question about his 6-year-old son, Elian, with a sigh and the
word ``imaginate'' _ imagine, which has been all he has been able
to do since the boy emerged at the fiery heart of an ideologically
charged custody battle.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two months, since Elian was rescued from a
capsized boat in which his mother and 10 other Cubans died trying
to reach the United States, Gonzalez has been limited to seeing
fleeting images of his child on television in Miami, and brief
telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suffering that I have is not just because I see his room
empty,'' Gonzalez said in a one-hour interview Friday afternoon at
the offices of the Cuban National Assembly, which has taken the
lead in Cuba's fight to bring the boy home and arranged the
interview. ``It is knowing he is not next to me, and seeing what
has happened to him. To see on television the Cuban people crying
for his return, that makes me want to cry too.''
</P>
<P>
   The tug of war for Elian between Cuba and the boy's relatives in
Florida, vociferously supported by Cuban exiles there, has fired
protests and passions on both sides of the ideological divide,
including countless government-organized rallies and marches across
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   At annual festivities in Havana Friday to mark the anniversary
of the birth of Jose Marti, the revered Cuban poet-warrior, many of
the 28,000 children who streamed through the Plaza de la Revolucion
had tiny pictures of Elian, peering through a chain link fence in
Miami, pinned to their chests, with the inscription, ``Who has said
a songbird needs a golden cage?''
</P>
<P>
   A trip to the United States this week by Elian's grandmothers
failed to bring a resolution any closer, despite a much-anticipated
meeting in Miami at the residence of a Roman Catholic nun, Sister
Jeanne O'Laughlin. Gonzalez said he was disappointed that the nun
went on to oppose Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
   But the short, solidly built man, whose intense demeanor was
eased by fleeting smiles, said he was sure the boy would eventually
come home. Gonzalez, who has given a number of interviews since
Elian reached Miami, was accompanied at this one only by his
brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lose hope?'' he said. ``Never. I will do whatever I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Except travel to the United States. He has been asked about that
in every interview. His answer has been, and was Friday, that the
political pressure enveloping the case, as well as court
proceedings and the animosity of the exile community toward the
Cuban government, have left him reluctant to go there and become a
hostage of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I go?'' he asked. ``Should I entangle myself in
court, be offended and have problems with somebody and go to jail?
Are they looking for that? If they tell me, here is your son and
you have to come get him, I will go get him. But they do not want
to tell me that.''
</P>
<P>
   By his own account, and those of his neighbors, Gonzalez was a
doting father, lavishing attention on the boy who was born after
his mother, Elizabet Brotons Rodriguez, miscarried seven times.
Though his parents divorced _ after 13 years of marriage _ when
Elian was 3, the child spent most nights at his father's home
because of his mother's work schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes Elian would cry because he had to go to his mother's
house,'' he said. ``He would want to stay with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez was surprised when his former wife fled. He never
foresaw any reason for her to go, since both had worked for about
10 years in well-paying tourist jobs in the nearby resort town of
Varadero.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had favorable conditions and were better off than the rest
of the people,'' he said. ``There was a little more for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Since being taken into the home of Gonzalez's uncle, Lazaro
Gonzalez, Elian has been showered with toys, clothing and even
tuition at a private school. What his Miami relatives have not been
as generous with, Gonzalez said, has been allowing the father and
son to speak in recent weeks. At first, he said, the relatives
refused to accept collect phone calls, forcing the boy's father to
sell his 1956 Rambler. More recently, the Cuban government has been
helping him make the calls.
</P>
<P>
   When he talks with the boy, usually at 5 p.m., he seldom asks
too many questions. This week, he did not press him on the visit
with the grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you ask him too many questions, he limits his
responses,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gonzalez said that his calls to Elian have been
interrupted by Lazaro Gonzalez, who picks up the line and insults
him.
</P>
<P>
   The brusque treatment, he said, came as a shock, since just last
year he welcomed Lazaro Gonzalez into his home in Cardenas, going
as far as letting his uncle stay in his bedroom while he slept in
his car. He says his uncle's behavior must be motivated by the
support _ financial and otherwise _ of the Cuban American National
Foundation, the exile lobbying group that featured Elian on an
anti-Castro poster.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a conversation with Lazaro, I called to ask him to get out
of that and return the child,'' Gonzalez said. ``He said he would
like to do that, but he could not because where would that leave
him. It is clear there is pressure on them.''
</P>
<P>
   But other relatives in Florida disagree with Lazaro Gonzalez and
would like to see the child go back to Cuba, including one uncle,
Manolo, according to Gonzalez. Manolo Gonzalez and his wife have
been frequent guests, visiting Cuba for the Christmas holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of reasons, he has been the one closest to us,''
Gonzalez said. ``He is the one the boy knows. He and his wife both
think clearly that the boy should return.''

N.Y.   TIMES CO. TO OFFER `TRACKING STOCK' FOR NET PROPERTIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moving to take advantage of the hot market for Internet stocks,
The New York Times Co. announced plans Friday to offer a ``tracking
stock'' for its Net properties, including on-line versions of The
New York Times and The Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Times Co.'s registration statement with the Securities and
Exchange Commission estimated a maximum offering of $100 million in
stock, although details _ including the number of shares and
offering price _ won't be released until after an April 27
shareholders meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Company Digital unit of the firm includes nytimes.com,
boston.com, NYToday.com, WineToday.com, GolfDigest.com and Abuzz, a
free on-line service where users can post and answer questions
about hobbies and interests.
</P>
<P>
   The division would remain owned by Times Co., with a new New
York Times Class C stock following the financial performance of the
division.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet properties had a total of 138 million ``page
views'' during December, including 43 million for Boston.com. The
Times has more than 10 million registered users for its on-line
version, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The division had net revenues of $15.3 million during the nine
months ended Sept. 30, with operating losses of $19.9 million and a
net loss of $11.7 million, according to a registration filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The firm said in the filing that the TCD unit can offer
advertisers a ``quality audience'' of affluent, highly educated
people. The stock would trade on the New York Stock Exchange under
the symbol TCD.
</P>
<P>
   The filing did not specify how much ownership of TCD would be
retained by Times Co. and how much would be sold in the offering.
Owners of TCD stock will vote as a group with owners of Times Class
A stock, which has limited voting rights.
</P>
<P>
   The filing comes as traditional media firms are looking to
highlight the value of their Internet assets to attract the
interest of Wall Street, which has been generous to other
Internet-related firms.
</P>
<P>
   Companies also sometimes issue tracking stock for units as a
precursor to a spinoff, although Times officials have made no
comment about their future plans for the division.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. will be lead manager of the offering.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Times and the Globe, Times Co. properties include 22
regional newspapers, Golf Digest and two other magazines, and
interests in two paper mills and the International Herald Tribune
newspaper.

SACRIFICES OFFSET ENERGY GLUTTONY

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Forget road rage. Though it may seem like the
trendy highway vice, but environmentalists say millions of American
vehicle buyers have committed a different sin, namely gluttony.
They went shopping for a family car and came home instead with a
sport utility vehicle, a van or a pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   If you are in this group, and unless you haul bales of hay or
entire soccer teams, or commute up and down the Grand Tetons, you
may be wantonly contributing more than your share of pollution said
to cause global warming. To quote Eldridge Cleaver out of his
radical 1960s context, you are part of the problem, not part of the
solution.
</P>
<P>
   But suppose you recognize the error of your ways. But what can
you do to atone?
</P>
<P>
   Quite a bit, say environmentalists and energy experts, who hope
that buyers who picked something bigger than a car will suffer some
pangs of conscience. Lately, SUVs, vans and pickups account for
about half the sales of ``light duty vehicles,'' the government's
term for the kinds of cars and trucks purchased for household and
small-business use.
</P>
<P>
   It's not too late to repent. You can do so from the comfort of
your own home, but you may have to face certain hardships, like
getting by with only one refrigerator and junking the halogen
torchier. Like a dieter compensating for a binge, you have dug
yourself in deep, but with a lot of small steps you can still climb
out.
</P>
<P>
   First, the scale of the problem. Burning a gallon of gasoline,
no matter how cleanly the vehicle does it, creates a little more
than 18 pounds of carbon dioxide, the most prevalent of the
so-called greenhouse gases. In the process, carbon from the
gasoline is combined with oxygen from the air, in amounts that
scientists can weigh, or calculate.
</P>
<P>
   Add in the energy use required to refine that gallon from crude
oil and haul it to your neighborhood gasoline station and each
gallon is worth about 20 pounds. The number is the same whether
that gallon takes you 70 miles in a Honda Insight (the new hybrid
that saves gasoline by shutting off the engine at stop signs, and
turning energy lost in braking into electricity for acceleration)
or the four-wheel-drive Range Rover, at about 13 miles a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Put differently, for each pound of carbon dioxide, the Insight
will go 3.8 miles; the Range Rover will go about 1,100 yards, or
about six-tenths of a mile.
</P>
<P>
   Most purchase decisions, however, are not between such extremes
but between more similar vehicles, like a typical car and a typical
SUV. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that the average
light truck gets about 15.3 miles a gallon, compared with 22.5 for
the car.
</P>
<P>
   The truck generates a pound and a half of carbon dioxide for
every pound from the car. Or, assuming that they are each driven
14,000 miles a year, the truck generates 5,600 pounds, or nearly
three tons, more carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   Many steps to make up the difference are easy, according to Dr.
Joseph J. Romm, the former assistant secretary of energy for
efficiency and renewables and the author of ``Cool Companies''
(Island Press, 1999), a book on businesses that have reduced
greenhouse gas emissions. ``Anybody can cut one to two tons,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The main form of energy used in most homes, providing the
biggest opportunity for saving, is electricity. Power generated at
hydroelectric and nuclear plants produces hardly any carbon
dioxide, but the biggest single fuel is coal, which is rich in
carbon.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the average kilowatt-hour, the energy needed to
light ten 100-watt bulbs for an hour, produces about 1.5 pounds of
carbon dioxide. In the Northeast, with proportionally more nuclear
generation, the number is about 1.06 pounds a kilowatt hour,
according to the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.
</P>
<P>
   At the national average, earning back the 5,600 pounds means
saving about 3,700 kilowatt-hours a year _ what a typical home
might use in three months. A household could save almost that much
by turning off eight 100-watt bulbs that burn 12 hours a day _ if
it has that many big bulbs burning that long, and if residents
don't mind going to sleep at sunset.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are more practical options. ``The No. 1 thing I'd
recommend is getting rid of halogen torchiers,'' Romm said.
Replacing a 300-watt model that burns six hours a night with a
fixture that has a 75-watt compact fluorescent bulb would provide
about the same light _ but 750 pounds less carbon dioxide
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is getting rid of the old refrigerator. Not the
one in the kitchen, but the one that used to be in the kitchen and
is now in the basement playroom or the garage. To the chagrin of
efficiency advocates, it seems that nearly everybody who pulled out
the avocado-colored 1970s refrigerator and replaced it with a sleek
new white-on-white model kept the old one, too.
</P>
<P>
   If those who want a couple of cases of cold beer can make do by
simply running to the store in their SUVs, they can save about
1,500 pounds of carbon dioxide a year by junking the old fridge.
(If you're keeping track, you're up to 2,250 pounds in carbon
dioxide savings, or 1,500 kilowatt-hours.)
</P>
<P>
   Further ideas come from ``CO(underscore)2
</P>
<P>
   Diet for a Greenhouse Planet,'' a paper by John M. DeCicco of
the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy and James H.
Cook, Dorene Bolze and Jan Beyea of the National Audubon Society.
</P>
<P>
   A low-flow shower head would save 300 pounds of carbon dioxide
in a house with an electric water heater, or only 80 pounds with a
more energy-efficient gas water heater.
</P>
<P>
   Washing four out of five loads of clothes in cold water instead
of hot would save about 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide with an
electric water heater. (If the water was heated with gas, the
saving would be 350 pounds; with oil, 500 pounds.)
</P>
<P>
   Do all that in a home with an electric water heater, and your
savings total 3,550 pounds of carbon dioxide, not quite enough to
compensate for the SUV, but enough to make a good dent.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to go further, of course _ most notably with the
home heating system. But such improvements are usually undertaken
only when an old system dies. The American Council for an Energy
Efficient Economy says that replacing a 25-year-old oil-fired home
heating system with a modern one saves 218 gallons of oil in a
house that had used 750 gallons a season. Because heating oil
produces slightly more carbon dioxide a gallon than does gasoline,
the savings from this step alone would be 5,886 pounds, enough to
assuage most cases of SUV guilt.
</P>
<P>
   And there is always the back-to-nature approach. Planting a new
tree on the property would absorb 26 pounds of carbon dioxide a
year. Planted to shade the house in summer and provide a windbreak
in winter, the tree could save 300 pounds a year.

BRADLEY GOES ON ATTACK; GORE FEELING `POSITIVE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN AND BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ The yin and yang of the Democrats in Campaign
2000 have suddenly switched roles. With three days until the
primary vote here, Bill Bradley continued slashing and attacking
Friday while Al Gore said he's ``going to emphasize the positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning on the western side of the state Friday, Bradley all
but called Gore a liar, and invited comparisons between the vice
president and former President Richard M. Nixon. Bradley also took
to the airwaves with a scathing new ad attacking Gore's claim, in
Wednesday's debate, to have always supported abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gore, the aggressor for much of the primary campaign,
took pains not to return fire, as he barnstormed along the New
Hampshire seacoast. His lead in most polls growing by the day, he
clearly hopes that Bradley's attacks will only tarnish the image
the New Jersey senator cultivated all year _ of a politician who
wouldn't stoop to ``politics as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Republicans it was a day largely without rancor. Arizona
Senator John McCain bustled from town hall to town hall, continuing
the string of local meetings with voters that are the foundation of
his campaign here. Texas Gov. George W. Bush bombed about happily
on snowmobile at one appearance, and won the endorsement of former
New Hampshire Gov. John H. Sununu, a man whom he helped get fired
from the White House where Sununu was chief of staff to Bush's
father, the former president.
</P>
<P>
   Of the leading GOP candidates, only publisher Steve Forbes, who
spent part of his day in a session with Boston Cardinal Bernard
Law, took direct aim at a fellow Republican, criticizing Bush's
record on education as Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy of campaigning came as trend lines in a new
Globe/WBZ-TV tracking polls appeared to show growing strength for
both Gore and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore continues to steadily build his lead over Bradley, which
now stands at 51-41 percent, with the remainder undecided,
according to the poll. Bush, meanwhile, has seen his support creep
up, and now trails McCain by a single point, 37-36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll offered little cheer for the other GOP contenders.
Forbes drew 12 percent; Keyes dropped to 5; Gary Bauer to 4.
</P>
<P>
   Based on sampling of 400 likely voters in each party primary,
the poll has a margin of error of 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republicans and Democratic candidates have been wary this
year of throwing any sort of political punch that could be
construed as a negative attack. With voters paying closer attention
as the primary draws near, experts say any trace of harshness could
backfire - or at least return to haunt nominees in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the risk Bradley takes in his move to take on Gore _ a
shift of strategy that followed his resounding defeat in Monday's
Iowa caucuses. Gore, Bradley believes, has been unfair and
intellectually dishonest in his criticisms of the senator's health
care plan and disingenuous about his history of support for
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, at the Wednesday debate, said he has ``always'' supported
Roe v. Wade, the decision that created the federal right to
abortion. But Gore, early in his career, voted several times on
bills designed to bar federal funding of abortions and, in 1984,
voted for a bill that would define the word ``person'' under four
civil rights laws to include ``unborn children from the moment of
conception.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, however, years ago amended his stance, and now supports
abortion rights across the board, included federal funding for
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The new Bradley ad, which will air Saturday, dives head-long
into the apparent gap between Gore's statement Wednesday and his
early voting record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the seven men running for president, only one candidate has
been pro-choice for everyone all the time,'' a narrator says in the
ad.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley then takes over the narration himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of issue you can't straddle,'' Bradley says,
looking straight into the camera. ``You can't be on both sides. You
have to decide which side you are on. . .And I decided a long time
ago that I'm pro-choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign, during the day, mounting a defense on the
abortion issue, circulated a letter from 42 members of Congress
affirming that Gore is ``pro-choice'' and a list of New Hampshire
women who support him, in part, for his views on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president otherwise declined to mix it up with his
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get down to that level,'' said Gore, when
asked about Bradley's stinging assaults. Though Gore has spent
months methodically dissecting and disparaging Bradley's health
care proposal, he said, ``I don't think the voters want to hear
negative attacks. They want to hear what we're going to do for the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's newly aggressive tactics brought a reprimand from New
Hampshire's Democratic party chair, as well as words of caution
from Lowell Weicker, the former Republican senator and Independent
governor of Connecticut who endorsed Bradley in Newport Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse Jackson said this is supposed to make us better, not
bitter,'' said Kathy Sullivan, the Democratic chairwoman. ``But to
impugn somebody else's integrity in your own party in a primary
just comes back to hurt them later on, whoever the nominee is.''
</P>
<P>
   Weicker called it fair for Bradley to point out that Gore is
misrepresenting Bradley's record and proposals. ``But I'm more
interested in his substance on the issues, so I don't want him to
abandon that to go after Gore,'' he said. ``Do I think
concentrating on negative responses is fruitful for Bill Bradley?
No, I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   One candidate who has resisted spending much time talking about
his opponents is McCain, the Arizona Republican. And at town hall
meetings throughout the state, he receives loud and long applause
when he speaks out against nasty, negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know it when you see it,'' McCain said aboard the his
campaign bus. McCain said he's been pleased with the minimal amount
of fractiousness among the Republican candidates, and dismayed by
the Democrats, especially Gore, who he believes went over the line
in suggesting that Bradley's health plan would be harmful to
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, as he travelled from Lebanon to Newport to Dublin, said
``enough is enough,'' by way of explaining the new tenor of his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you listen to Al Gore speak, you have to listen very
carefully because he uses words in a very tricky manner,'' he said,
making a veiled allusion to Nixon, who was nicknamed ``Tricky
Dick'' by his opponents, for the second time this week. ``You have
to look at every word and every clause.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile on the Republican side of the campaign, Forbes pressed
his attack Friday on Bush's record.
</P>
<P>
   The millionaire publisher focused on schools in an appearance
with one current and one former member of the Texas Board of
Education. Forbes repeated charges made in Iowa and in Wednesday's
debate that Texas SAT scores have fallen since 1994. He also said
Bush has failed to back school choice and local control over
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has education improved under George Bush?'' Forbes said. ``He
says yes. The facts are, it didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials strongly object to Forbes' charges,
saying he is is using selective statistics and noting that the
College Board warns against evaluating state records based on SAT
scores.

JUDGE HINTS AT BREAK FOR MCCAIN ON NEW YORK BALLOT 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge disparaged the system adopted by New York's
Republican leadership for the presidential primary, indicating
Friday that he was strongly considering easing the rules to allow
Sen. John McCain to appear on the ballot across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a lawsuit brought by McCain, Judge Edward Korman
of U.S. District Court in Brooklyn declared that the current rules
were intended to help the party's favorite, Gov. George W. Bush,
and smother the prospects of insurgents like McCain. A decision is
likely early next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything tells us that the reason for all the rules is to
advantage the chosen candidate of the Republican Party,'' Korman
said at a hearing. He noted that primaries were devised to give a
greater voice to the rank and file, rather than having party bosses
anoint candidates in back-room parleys. ``What is going on here is
an effort to turn this on its head and hold a meaningless
primary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has sought a ballot spot in New York across the state,
but after an exhausting petition process and legal challenges from
the state's Republican establishment, he is slated to appear in
only 18 of the state's 31 Congressional districts, making it
difficult for him to wage a full-throated campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he opened the hearing, Korman left little doubt that
he thought the primary system was unfair. He is the same judge who
ruled in favor of Steve Forbes in 1996, when Forbes sued while
battling with state Republicans to get on the ballot, and his
ruling pressured the Legislature to eliminate some of the more
arcane requirements in the election law.
</P>
<P>
   At Friday's hearing, Korman clearly disputed the need for
several of the rules still in effect. He sharply questioned the
lawyer for the state Republican Party about the rationale for the
rules, most of which do not exist elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   And the judge criticized a requirement that people who collect
signatures for the nominating petitions of a presidential candidate
in a congressional district be party members who live in the
district. The rule is often a major obstacle for candidates other
than the front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   Korman suggested that he was leaning toward sharply reducing the
number of signatures required to get on the ballot in each
congressional district. Under the rules, candidates must mount
separate petition efforts in each district, and can appear in some
and not others.
</P>
<P>
   The number of signatures that must be gathered in each district
is one-half of 1 percent of the registered Republicans in the
district. That figure ranges from 82 to 890, depending on the
district. Korman said he was considering reducing that threshold to
one-tenth of 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At that level, a candidate would have to collect a total of
roughly 3,000 signatures in the districts. They would still have to
abide by a rule requiring them to gather another 5,000 signatures
anywhere in the state. Under that new criteria, McCain would comply
in 29 of the 31 districts, and the judge could order him on the
ballot in the others.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Forbes campaign sought to take part in the lawsuit,
asking the judge to restore Forbes to the ballot in three
districts; he has a slot in the other 28 districts. The campaign of
another candidate, Alan Keyes, also sought help. The Keyes campaign
did not circulate petitions, saying the process was too arduous.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign, represented by the Brennan Center for
Justice at the New York University School of Law and the firm of
Emery Cuti Brinckerhoff &AMP; Abady, said it was heartened by the
judge's comments.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Mandelker, a lawyer for the state party, said he
believed that after the judge reviewed the party's defense of the
primary system, he would leave it intact. ``I'm hopeful that he
will conclude that the amount of signatures should be what's in the
statute,'' Mandelker said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, the campaigns continued to charge that
their rivals had engaged in improprieties in the petition process.
On Thursday, the Forbes campaign said the Bush petitions in six New
York City districts were assembled fraudulently.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the state party produced a Forbes petition from western
New York signed by a man named Ralph Apa on Dec. 14. The party
noted two problems: he is a registered Democrat, and, according to
official records, he died on Oct. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Muir, a lawyer for the Forbes campaign, said he was not
aware of the petition, but said that if campaign workers had
manufactured signatures, they should face penalties.

STECKEL'S TITANS HAVE A WORD FOR OFFENSE: PHYSICAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They take no prisoners. That is the way the Tennessee
Titans have routed Jacksonville (three times), St. Louis, Buffalo,
and Indianapolis (in Indianapolis) this season, and it's not going
to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (the Titans coaching staff) believe that the common
denominator in football is the physical part of the game,'' said
Les Steckel, Tennessee's offensive coordinator and a former
assistant coach with the Patriots. ``Our philosophy as a team is to
be very physical at all times, and to be more physical than the
team we play each week. We believe that you run to win, throw to
score, and be more physical than the other team for four quarters
to be sure it all happens.''
</P>
<P>
   If a vote was taken around the league to name the most physical
team, Tennessee would win in a landslide. No one gets a free pass
on this squad, offense, defense, or special teams.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that makes Tennessee's offense so unusual is
that it tries to beat up the opposing defense, when it is the other
way around with all the other teams in the NFL. The rest of the
offenses try finesse. The Titans use muscle behind one of the NFL's
best offensive lines, and their two unique stars, running back
Eddie George and quarterback Steve McNair, a sensational
ballcarrier himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to tell people that George is great but McNair is even
better and they look at you,'' said Cleveland Browns coach Chris
Palmer after playing Tennessee this season. ``McNair is tougher to
get on the ground than George. He is a weapon with the ball under
his arm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to think of ourselves as being hard-nosed,'' said
Steckel. ``We preach zero turnovers. We've been doing that for the
last four years. We have a rule, that anyone on our team who has a
ball in his hands must keep it locked at all times. We want that
ball tucked away, even at practice, walking to practice,
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   If they don't, ``I'll go over there and knock it out of their
hands,'' said Steckel. ``I do that about six or seven times a
practice. The guys laugh. And the rookies at first don't understand
it, but after a while, it becomes a habit. In the last two years,
we have finished second in the NFL both times in fewest giveaways.
We're proud of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's offense has been criticized because McNair rarely
throws deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of not turning the ball over is not throwing
interceptions,'' said Steckel. ``McNair really takes care of the
ball. Each year since he became the starter his number of
interceptions goes down. This year he had just seven, which is one
of the best among starting quarterbacks. He can throw the ball, but
what we want to do first is win. Each week we sit down as a staff
and figure out what we have to do the next week to win. What's our
best chance? If it's run, we run. If it's throw, we throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Steve. I have been coaching football for 29 years, most
of it in the NFL, and this is the toughest football player I have
ever been around. There is no one at any position I've ever seen
who is tougher. Last year (1998), he played with a ruptured bursa
sac in his elbow, a hip pointer, which is a terribly painful
injury, and a broken sternum, and never missed a game. This year,
he had to have a serious back operation early in the year and he
was back before anyone thought he would be. Right now he is playing
with two big toes that are double their normal size (because of
turf toe). Yet he never complains. He never makes an excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   George is the same kind of player. He slams into opponents with
as much brute force as any runner in the league, and he takes
pleasure in trying to beat them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie is the best-conditioned player I have ever been
around,'' Steckel said. ``You can get tired just watching him work
out. We have this sprint circuit in training camp, and when the
players are finished, they are out of gas. They can't do anymore.
Eddie George does it twice. Eddie is all football. Before we played
in Indianapolis, he studied all 16 of the games the Colts played
this year. He is always totally prepared. He'll do the same thing
with St. Louis this week, even though we have played them and have
an idea of what they are like.''
</P>
<P>
   What are they like?
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that St. Louis is the most balanced team we have
played all season,'' said Steckel. ``So much is made of their
offense, but their defense is ranked No. 1 against the rush in the
entire league. This is going to be a challenge for our running game
and we love to run the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it's been 15 seasons, Steckel never will forget his last
trip to the Super Bowl, Chicago's 46-10 rout of the Patriots in
January 1986 in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was with the Patriots (quarterbacks coach), and we ran into
the greatest defensive team in the history of the game,'' he said.
``The year before I was coaching in Minnesota and we played
Chicago. Their defense was so impressive that I told the writers
after that game how great I thought that defense was going to be.
They sort of laughed at me because they thought I was making
excuses because they beat us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the next year with the Patriots, the Bears were the best
defense ever. No one I have ever seen had the combination of talent
and scheme going at the same time. We could have played with 12 men
on our side that day and it still wouldn't have made any
difference.''

 Yahoo to Webcast TV Ads From Super Bowl  &HT;     By Kelly Zito

<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tired of all those pesky first downs and slow-mo replays
interrupting the stream of cool Super Bowl commercials?
<P>
   The folks at Yahoo are, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site will offer the multimillion dollar ads from the
likes of Pepsi, BMW and Monster.com via streaming audio and video
immediately after the big game ends tomorrow night _ with no replay
or commentator interruptions. Users can watch and also vote for
their favorite ads at www.yahoo.com/ promotions/superspots.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who just watch the Super Bowl to see
the spots,'' said Karen Edwards, Yahoo's vice president of brand
marketing. ``So we thought it would be a fun thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said Web surfers will be able to view the ads in
different formats, depending on their connection speeds. Visitors
will need at least a 56k modem and video-streaming software such as
RealPlayer or Windows Media Player. Both programs can be downloaded
from links posted on the Yahoo site.
</P>
<P>
   About 85 percent of the Super Bowl advertisers had given Yahoo
permission to stream their ads as of yesterday Friday &LR;   &LR; afternoon.;
but &LR;  Edwards said the company was still receiving approvals and
that figure could climb.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo said it's not beefing up its system to deal with a spike
in traffic because it already handles roughly 120 million users a
month worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't foresee that we'll have any problems,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Others aren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, streaming media suffered a major setback when the
much-hyped Victoria's Secret's much-hyped &LR;  fashion show was only
accessibly to one in 50 potential visitors because its servers
couldn't handle the crush of lingerie-loving women and men drawn to
the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably a reason (Yahoo) didn't make a big (promotional) push
is that they're not sure they want 2 million people trying to view
these commercials from their site,'' said Matthew Parks, product
manager for Keynote Systems, a San Mateo firm that measures
Internet performance.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, streaming technology has improved and companies have
learned to engineer duplicate sites that can shoulder some of the
burden. Yahoo officials said the company doesn't employ such sites,
and couldn't say how many visitors its site could handle at one
time.
</P>
<P>
   Parks expects tomorrow's event to test the Yahoo's capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really hasn't been an event on the Internet that has
reached the number of people that broadcast has,'' he said. ``If
millions of people try to view these commercials, it will be a good
test for Yahoo.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo expects to have the ads up around 7 p.m. Pacific time _
the anticipated conclusion of the game _ and will leave them up for
about a week, depending on the interest.

 Ziff-Davis Transforms Into ZDNet  &HT;     By Carrie Kirby 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL;
<P>
   Ziff-Davis, best known as a computer-magazine publisher
headquartered in New York, is reinventing itself as a Web-only
technology resource headquartered in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Having sold off nearly all of its non-Internet divisions,
Ziff-Davis now plans to make ZDNet, its San Francisco Internet arm,
into a stand-alone company.
</P>
<P>
   Ziff-Davis then plans to sell off its remaining business,
trade-show producer ZD Events, and be absorbed by the new company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company can be recognized for what it is, a top-20
Internet property,'' said Mandana Hormozi, an analyst at Lazard
Freres, an investment bank headquartered in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers are not surprised by the development. ``We've
expected this to happen for at least six months,'' said Bob Hiler,
an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The transition cannot take place until ZD Events, whose
centerpiece is the Comdex technology conference, is sold off, which
Ziff-Davis expects to do in the second quarter. Ziff-Davis has
already agreed to sell its magazine publishing and education units.
It will use the money from these transactions _ along with the
already-complete sales of its interest in cable TV channel ZDTV and
its market research unit, ZD Market Intelligence _ to cover its
debts of nearly $1.2 billion. Most of the remaining cash will be
distributed to Ziff-Davis shareholders in a $5-per-share cash
dividend. Anything left over will belong to ZDNet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ziff-Davis, its cash and its retained interest simply becomes
ZDNet,'' said Dan Rosensweig, who is and will remain chief
executive and president of ZDNet.
</P>
<P>
   Since last March, ZDNet has been publicly traded separately from
Ziff-Davis as a tracking stock _ shares tied to the financial
performance of a particular portion of a company's business. Under
the symbol ZDZ, the tracking stock significantly outperformed the
regular Ziff-Davis shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect ZDNet as a stand-alone company to perform even
better once the sales of other divisions are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a cloud over the stock because it's been a
tracking stock,'' Hormozi said. Another hindrance to the stock's
performance has been uncertainty about how much ZDNet depended on
its parent company, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Softbank Corp., the Japanese company that owns 70 percent of
Ziff-Davis, has been systematically divesting itself of ZD
properties as part of Chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son's strategy of
focusing on the Internet, analysts said. In the past year, Softbank
has also spun off its own publishing, commerce, technology
consulting and finance businesses. Softbank also owns stake in
Internet players such as E-Trade and Yahoo and is a major investor
in Japan's Internet industry.
</P>
<P>
   Softbank will be the majority shareholder of the new company,
with a 45 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Ziff-Davis' well-known magazine division, which publishes such
titles as PC Week and Yahoo Internet Life, is being sold to Willis
Stein &AMP; Partners, a Chicago-based investment firm. The $780 million
cash transaction is expected to close in the first quarter; ZDNet
will retain the right to use the magazines' content for a five-year
period in exchange for royalty payments, Rosensweig said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel as an independent company, we will be able to
accelerate our growth on a global basis even faster than we've been
growing,'' Rosensweig said, adding that the change puts ZDNet on a
more equal footing with pure Internet competitors such as Cnet.
ZDNet currently  &LR; employees 450 people.
</P>
<P>
   ZDNet's collective Web sites were ranked the 16th most popular
Internet property in December by Media Metrix, a Web ratings
company. Cnet ranked just one slot higher at 15.
</P>
<P>
   ZDNet's tracking stock closed at $27.88 yesterday, down $2.19,
and Ziff-Davis' stock closed down 94 cents at $17.88.

   In the summer of 1992, a pervasive gloom cast a shadow over the
American economy. The unemployment rate rose to 7.8 percent, the
worst in years. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates, trying to
breathe life into an economy that seemed caught in protracted
stagnation. And the federal budget deficit rose to its highest
level ever.
</P>
<P>
   A best-selling book by a prominent economist, Lester Thurow,
reflected a widely held view that the United States would continue
to stumble behind a vigorous Japanese economy and a unified Europe.
Even President George Bush, who would soon lose his job over the
dismal economy, acknowledged that something was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   What almost no one divined was that the American economy had
already embarked on a historic expansion, one that took three more
years to really bloom. And how rich that bloom now is. The
expansion _ an uninterrupted rise in the value of the goods and
services that the nation produces _ becomes the longest in history
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Gone is the vision of America as an economically weak giant.
With the economy growing since 1995 at an average annual rate of
4.2 percent, unemployment has fallen to a 30-year low of 4.1
percent, and consumer prices have risen less than 3 percent a year.
Even as its global rivals have faltered, the United States has
turned out to be capable of more growth and less inflation than
almost anyone had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the great gift of the 1990s. However this expansion
ends _ whether in a stock market collapse or more gently _ its
legacy is a reborn respect for the nation's potential. Limits to
economic growth and prosperity still exist at the turn of the
century, but they are not the stunted ones of the '70s, '80s and
early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last four years really have lifted our hopes about what is
possible,'' said Paul Romer, an economics historian at Stanford
University. ``We emerged from the 1970s and 1980s with
substantially diminished expectations for the performance of the
American economy. And now confidence is returning that the economy
can grow as fast as it once did in the past without much
inflation.'' The 1990s expansion turns 107 months old in February,
edging it past that of the 1960s as the longest ever. In other
words, it has been nearly nine years since the last recession ended
in March 1991.
</P>
<P>
   By most measures, of course, the '60s expansion remains the gold
standard for the American economy. Then, the economy grew more
quickly. Wages and family incomes rose by larger amounts each year.
The poverty level and the unemployment rate fell more quickly and
to lower levels. The gap between the wealthy and the poor was much
smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Still, over the last four years, the current expansion has
gained traction, leaving its mark across America. The strong growth
has lifted wages and salaries throughout the work force _ although,
adjusted for inflation, for the most part they are not back to
levels reached in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Where the expansion clearly shows is in family income. Labor
shortages have drawn more family members into the work force, and
those with jobs are working more. However stressful that may be for
family life, median family income rose to a record $46,737 in 1998,
adjusted for inflation, decisively past the old high of $44,974 in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Tracey and Carrie Jones, who live in a Cincinnati suburb, are
beneficiaries of this revival. Jones, 43, assembles and helps to
design labeling machines for commercial packages. He has held the
same job for four years, a considerable improvement over the early
1990s, when layoffs forced him into hourly work at several
companies, without health insurance or a 401(k) pension plan. He
now has both.
</P>
<P>
   The long stay at one employer has raised Jones' confidence in
his own skills. He earns $45,000, up from less than $38,000 when he
started in 1996. He got a 3.5 percent raise last year and another
one this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it had been 5 percent,'' he said. ``I have worked
harder for this company than I have ever worked in my life.'' In
March, he expects a $750 bonus, the amount he got last year. That
lifts his spirits.
</P>
<P>
   His wife is not complaining. ``As the months pass and he still
has his job, that makes me feel better,'' she said. ``And when he
comes home and complains about being busy, I say, `Be glad you are
busy.'''
</P>
<P>
   She herself has worked two evenings a week _ a total of four
hours _ as a bookkeeper for her dentist. At 38, she devotes the
rest of her time to raising the couple's two sons. ``Every time my
husband goes to have his teeth cleaned,'' she said, ``the dentist
has asked, `When is your wife going to work more for me?''' She has
finally agreed to add one afternoon, from noon to 3 p.m., while the
boys are in school. That will nearly double her $4,500 in annual
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the income gains have been greatest in the upper tier
of the work force. Those earning more than $80,000 _ often much
more _ have enjoyed steadily rising incomes, as they did in the
1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, these winners, concentrated on Wall Street and in
Silicon Valley, are often paid in shares of stock that have
skyrocketed, perhaps far beyond their real worth. Given that those
euphorically priced shares have been collateral for a huge amount
of borrowing by both individuals and corporations, the expansion
could come to an abrupt halt in a market sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, even the poorest regions are enjoying the fruits of
economic growth. No region is poorer than a four-county area in the
Rio Grande Valley where the unemployment rate two years ago was
more than 20 percent; now it is 13 percent. It's not that there are
more jobs in the valley; the situation has improved because so many
people who lived there have migrated to Houston, Austin or Dallas,
where jobs are plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are a construction electrician and you are earning $6
an hour or less in the valley, and you hear what they are paying in
these other cities, you go,'' said Sister Judy Donovan, a Roman
Catholic nun and a community organizer in the valley for the
Industrial Areas Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the economy has grown since 1995 at nearly double
the rate that most economists and policy makers thought possible
without provoking inflation. The all-important productivity growth
rate, tracking how much more each worker contributes to output each
year for the same hours of work, has risen to an annual average of
2 percent for the 1990s, better than the 1970s and '80s but well
short of the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude in the 1960s was concentrate on growth and don't
worry about inflation, and that attitude may be returning now,''
Romer said. ``The strong expansion may be demonstrating to us that
fast growth and low inflation reinforce each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The expansion has changed the political debate, too. Patrick
Buchanan and Ross Perot rose to prominence in the late '80s and
early '90s on the job anxieties of many voters. This year, those
men have been only faint voices, and neither jobs nor the health of
the economy is much of an issue.
</P>
<P>
   But will the expansion last? Even the gloomiest forecasters _
economists like A. Gary Shilling, a Wall Street consultant _ have
ceased to see a recession just a few months away. ``The stock
market speculation has carried the economy longer than I
anticipated,'' Shilling said.
</P>
<P>
   Other economists say new technologies, spilling out one after
another, will keep the economy growing robustly not just for
months, but for years, ultimately justifying the stock market's
lofty level.
</P>
<P>
   Only time will settle the debate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Causes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aid From Computers, Markets and the Fed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What accounts for the durability of the expansion? The Internet
and the spread of personal computers are high on the list, because
they raise productivity. The Intel Corp., to pick one example out
of thousands, has set up special Web sites for customers, mainly
computer manufacturers that buy Intel's chips. They place orders on
the Web, and computers do the rest, letting Intel employees do
other tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a real improvement in our productivity,'' said Andrew
S. Grove, Intel's chairman. Output and revenue have risen faster
than labor costs, largely because of the new technologies. Each
Intel employee accounted for $436,000 of the company's revenue in
1999, up from $197,000 in 1991. There is more money for profits and
wages without raising prices, and the economy grows larger without
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But is every company an Intel? Or is the impact of computers and
the Internet likely to be used up in a decade or two?
</P>
<P>
   Many industries are benefiting: Airlines and theaters through
ticket sales on the Web, retailers through e-commerce, Wall Street
through online trading. The growing list raises the national
efficiency for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have entered a period of rapid and constant innovation,
just as we did when electricity and the light bulb spread through
the country,'' said James H. Stock, an economist at Harvard's
Kennedy School of Government. ``But there are limits. I tend to see
the computer and the Internet and the technologies related to them
like electricity and the light bulb. Once they are widely used,
their effect on growth tends to taper off.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, new technology is by no means the only reason for the
booming economy. Another is that strong profits and low-cost
financing, mainly through the stock market, have resulted in record
levels of corporate investment in all kinds of machinery, not just
computers, and so in increased production. Moreover, Asia and Latin
America have become growing sources of manufactured goods, a new
supply line that was particularly noticeable during the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed also gets a share of the credit for sustaining the
expansion. Rather than sharply raising interest rates in
anticipation of higher inflation, a reaction that until the 1990s
often dumped the economy into recession, the Fed is now more
willing to let a boom run its course, as long as inflation stays
reasonably close to 2 percent, roughly its present level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to describe the change at the Fed is to say the people
there are not so trigger-happy,'' said Robert M. Solow, a Nobel
economist. ``They keep talking as if they were still trigger-happy
about inflation, but they no longer really are.''
</P>
<P>
   There are still other changes. The United States has become less
dependent on oil, so the latest increase in oil prices has not
produced the sort of price shock that was so devastating in the
1970s and '80s. The rise of a service economy has also helped to
hold down wages and inflation. Faced with labor shortages, service
companies have been quick to relocate or expand in states with
pools of inexpensive, unemployed workers.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers cannot move their heavy equipment and their more
complicated operations so quickly. But that is not a problem for
Burrelle's Information Services, which culls newspaper, magazine,
video and Internet citations for corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   Burrelle's, with headquarters in Livingston, N.J., has big
operations there and in New York City and Utah. But its growth
these days is in Houlton, Maine., where unemployment is a couple of
percentage points higher than the national average. As a result,
educated people can be persuaded to sign on for $6.50 an hour, with
a promise of $10 an hour after three or four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can still get people in Houlton, but the labor market is
getting tighter,'' said Robert Waggoner, Burrelle's chief
executive. ``We are looking for places where unemployment is higher
and they also have good school systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other busy companies, Burrelle's pushes its workers to keep
up with the workload _ a bit of extra pressure that has often added
to productivity at the height of an expansion. And employees
everywhere, perhaps cowed by past downsizing, are more willing to
accept signing bonuses, performance bonuses and profit sharing as
their reward rather than insisting on raises, which are harder for
employers to absorb without raising prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a general understanding in the United States today
that companies are not going to compete for workers by raising
wages,'' said David Collander, an economic historian at Middlebury
College in Vermont. ``And that understanding has become embedded in
our social structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Rising stock and home prices are high on everyone's list of
factors contributing to the expansion's durability. So is growing
public confidence, at its highest since the 1960s. ``It would be
odd if people were not pleased with their job situations and their
rising incomes,'' said Richard Curtin, director of the University
of Michigan's Consumer Surveys. ``What is odd is that they don't
expect the good times to end in the next five years.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rules &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Raising the Ceiling On the Economy  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A result of this optimism has been an explosion in consumer
spending, paid for partly through higher incomes, but also through
credit. As stocks and homes have climbed in value, they have
become, in effect, the collateral for the rising debt that helps
keep the expansion robust.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 25 percent of the economic growth since 1996 is a result
of the stock market and real estate booms, says Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And if those booms had never existed? If the stock market had
never become so exuberant? The economy would still have grown
substantially faster, without inflation, than Greenspan thought was
possible _ until he saw it happen.
</P>
<P>
   However the expansion is finally explained, an old set of rules,
deeply ingrained in economic forecasting and college textbooks, is
losing its punch. In the late 1960s, the inflation that had
descended on America was attributed to shortages of goods and
services. After all, hadn't Lyndon Johnson demonstrated that even
the mighty American economy could not produce enough to satisfy a
prospering citizenry and also an army in Vietnam?
</P>
<P>
   That idea of the economy's limits gained an iron grip on
academic theory and government policy. Unemployment could not fall
below 6 percent, the rules had it, or labor shortages would drive
up wages, then prices. In the '70s and '80s, that happened just
often enough to demonstrate the theory's accuracy. Industry could
no longer operate flat out, risking inflationary shortages, which
also occurred often enough to be disconcerting.
</P>
<P>
   So the Fed sought to slow the economy whenever it seemed to be
expanding by more than 2.25 percent a year or so. That was
considered the outer limit, an inflationary trigger point, all
right for a few months or even a year, but beyond what the nation
could sustain for a significant period.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were all sorts of walls that economists put up in their
minds that ruled out the possibility of powerful economic growth,''
Collander said. ``It is these walls that are coming down.''
</P>
<P>
   The view of Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers reflects the
new consensus. ``Three to 3.5 percent,'' he said in an interview,
``is probably not an implausible number right now as a sustainable
growth rate for the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference may seem small, but the amount of money it
represents is considerable in the giant American economy, which
produces more than $9 trillion a year in goods and services.
Increasing that output by Summers' new rate means an additional
$345 annually for each person in the United States. That has been
happening, and then some, since 1996. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Dangers &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An Eerie Replay Of a Debt Buildup &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the risks _ the chief one is debt _ embedded in this growth
are considerable. Debt is why the 1990s expansion got off to such a
slow start. In the euphoria of the 1980s, huge amounts were
borrowed against real estate or to finance corporate acquisitions _
always with the promise that office rents or still-rising real
estate prices or cash flow from a ``restructured'' company would
more than cover the debt payments.
</P>
<P>
   The 1987 stock market crash, and the end of the expansion a
little more than two years later, dashed that promise.
</P>
<P>
   In the debt crisis that followed, hundreds of savings and loan
associations failed and banks had to write off billions in unpaid
debt. With considerable help from the Federal Reserve, the lenders
got back on their feet, but until they did Greenspan spoke of the
``head winds'' that were holding back the 1990s expansion in its
early years.
</P>
<P>
   A similar debt buildup is occurring now. Private-sector debt is
as high as it was in 1985, the peak in the '80s. By one measure,
total private-sector spending exceeds income and profits by an
amount equal to 4.5 percent of the gross domestic product, says
Wynne Godley, an economist at the Jerome Levy Economic Institute, a
research group in Annandale, N.Y. That figure is a record.
</P>
<P>
   But by another measure _ debt as a percentage of stock values
and home prices _ the borrowing is rather mild, roughly 14 percent
for households and 52 percent for businesses other than financial
institutions. Those percentages are no higher today than at the
beginning of the expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Much, then, is riding on the booms on Wall Street and in home
values. As long as they stay in place, the expansion should
continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If some shock broke the optimism in the financial markets, a
lot of people could be in a serious situation,'' said Laura
D'Andrea Tyson, a former economic adviser to President Clinton and
now dean of the business school at the University of California at
Berkeley. ``They have become indebted relative to their wealth
rather than their incomes, and that is a built-in vulnerability.''
</P>
<P>
   A recession must come. No economist doubts that. The only
questions are when, and with how much damage. The answers depend on
the extent to which innovation continues to drive growth, and on
the stock market's ability to stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even want to talk about a stock market collapse,''
said Solow, the Nobel laureate. ``What everyone would like to see
is the stock market stand still while companies and their profits
catch up.''

ALL POLITICS IS LOCAL, EVEN AT COCA-COLA  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 30) 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Questions may be italicized)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Atlanta has seen worse. After all, William Tecumseh Sherman
burned the city to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the restructuring announced last week by the Coca-Cola
Co. _ changes that include paring its work force by 6,000 and
taking charges of $1.6 billion _ probably wasn't exactly what the
local Chamber of Commerce had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has not been thrilled, either. Promises of big cost
cuts often lift the stocks of the companies announcing them. But
investors have been bailing out of Coke in a big way. Since the
announcement on Wednesday, the stock, long a pillar of the Dow
Jones industrial average, has lost more than $24 billion in market
value.
</P>
<P>
   John D. Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest, a trade
publication, took time last week to discuss the moves. Following
are excerpts from the conversation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Coke's move comes scarcely a month after M. Douglas Ivester
shocked just about everybody when he announced that he was stepping
down as chief executive. Is this his plan, or is it the product of
Douglas N. Daft, who will succeed him? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Ivester started a review process last summer, but the form
and extent it took largely incorporates Daft's vision of what the
company should be. Ivester had one vision for the company, and Daft
has another. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. At the moment Wall Street seems confused about what that
vision is. Tell us what you see.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Ivester used to talk a lot about building a very broad-based
capability for the company. But this restructuring will make Coke
much more focused.
</P>
<P>
   They will outsource things they used to do in-house and will
become a very marketing- and market-execution-driven company.
</P>
<P>
   This is a big company, but unlike a lot of other companies it is
extremely local and needs to have that focus to be successful. It
has to be in very, very close touch with local consumers, local
customers and local governments and regulators. Basically, what
Daft is doing is getting a lot of decision making and
responsibility out to local markets to better accomplish that.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. One criticism leveled against Ivester is that he allowed
Coke's relationship with its bottlers to deteriorate. Is this plan
bottler-friendly? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, they have lowered somewhat the levels of inventory
bottlers have to carry, and that is a positive. But that is not
where the impact on the bottlers comes from in this reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that at least some of the savings from the
restructuring will go into enhanced and additional marketing of the
brands in a whole variety of ways. That absolutely helps the
bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. By all accounts Ivester was forced out. Is Mr. Daft the right
man to be his successor? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The board had two choices if it wanted a good operator at the
top: Doug Daft or Jack Stahl. It now has both of them. ( Stahl will
be Coke's president)
</P>
<P>
   If you assume that macroeconomic changes are going to continue,
having someone like Daft at the helm is a positive move, because he
has done an extraordinary job building the business on the ground
in a huge diversity of difficult markets, from Indonesia and China
to India and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   He has a track record of introducing new products to respond to
consumer tastes in those markets. In the years to come, I think
there is going to be a lot of product innovation at Coke. More than
acquisitions, you will see Coke using its presence and distribution
strength to introduce new brands where there is an opportunity and
a need to do so. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are the reverberations from these changes likely to reach as
far as Purchase, N.Y., where PepsiCo is based? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Pepsi has already been through its reorganization. It has
shed its restaurant and bottling businesses, and a year or two ago
it streamlined its international business.
</P>
<P>
   If Coke's cost-cutting leads to a ratcheting up of its marketing
activity, that will certainly make the industry more competitive.
In many ways, that will be good for both Coke and Pepsi, because
the signals coming out of Atlanta are that they will focus on
brand-building, which is what Pepsi is doing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In his comments on Wednesday, Daft suggested that the changes
would cause Coke's growth rate to slow. Do you think that it can
grow at a double-digit pace? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. This year is very complicated, but over the next five to six
years this company should return to solid growth. Over that period,
it should absolutely produce double-digit growth on a sustained
basis.
</P>
<P>
   It simply has to be a great investment for two reasons: first,
the power of its brands, and its ability to get those brands out
into points of sale pervasively. Software operating systems will
come and go, how we access the Internet will change, but people in
New York, Shanghai and Jakarta will still be drinking Coke.

SPORTS COLUMN: PROFESSIONALS STILL IN NEED OF MENTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Friday afternoon, Bobby Bell, the former Kansas City
Chiefs linebacker and a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame,
lamented the passing of an era.
</P>
<P>
   Bell was on a panel composed of 1970 Super Bowl participants,
including two more former Chiefs, Willie Lanier and Jan Stenerud;
Lamar Hunt, the Chiefs' owner; Bud Grant, the former Minnesota
Vikings coach; and the Viking players Paul Krause and Alan Page.
</P>
<P>
   They were there to reminisce about the 1970 game, but they
talked about other things besides the Chiefs' 23-7 victory that
day.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said a lack of continuity in team leadership contributed to
a lack of closeness in franchises and locker rooms today, perhaps
making it seem as if the inmates were running the asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players back then, we were basically part of a family,''
said Bell, who still works for the Chiefs. ``We talked to each
other, we cared about each other as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the players now _ they don't look at it that way.
They're there for one thing: They play, and they're gone two years
later.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were the dark ages, of course. They may seem dandy now,
but players chafed under a draconian system in which teams kept
players as long as they wanted them, then discarded them at will.
There was continuity but no freedom.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of any long-standing infrastructure in teams, the new
survivors are individualistic, motivated, self-starting players.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Blaine Bishop could play in any decade, on any team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a sense of responsibility,'' he said Thursday. ``It's
my nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop has been driven by the slights directed at him:
``Everyone said I was too small, or I'm a step too slow. There was
always something.''
</P>
<P>
   He's 5 feet 9 inches, but Bishop is one of the Tennessee Titans'
pillars. The 200-pound safety was drafted in the seventh round by
Tennessee (then Houston) in 1993. Cris Dishman and Bubba McDowell
were his mentors in the pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bubba was the starter in front of me,'' Bishop said. ``He
taught me everything he knew about the position and how to play the
game, but also how to act like a professional even when you're not
in football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to do that, but it's kind of tough,'' the 29-year-old
Bishop said. ``The new generation of young guys coming into the
league, they have their own agenda; all you can do is talk to them
and let them know what's expected of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is it so difficult?
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to do a lot with the society,'' Bishop said. ``A lot of
the young guys come in today, and they are handed things. They
don't listen sometimes. You got to be harder with them and patient
with them. You have to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop has seen players self-destruct, talented players who had
two- or three-year careers when they should have had ones that
lasted seven or eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think those guys have been handed things,'' Bishop said.
``They went to big-time programs, but they don't have the work
ethic that I have. Once you get to this level, everybody's a great
athlete. You got to work hard to be better than those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Gray was a first-round pick of the Rams in 1985.
Currently coaching defensive backs with the Titans, Gray said that
mentors in the locker room had kept him from becoming complacent or
distracted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need that mentor,'' he said. ``You need an older guy to
teach the younger guy, `Hey, this league is not a one-year deal,
it's not a two-year deal.' The thing that an older guy will tell
you is: `Hey, stop burning that night oil, get in there and start
studying. The mental part is more important than the physical part.
You don't want to be just another guy.'''
</P>
<P>
   An old-school, hard-nosed coach like Dan Reeves, now with the
Atlanta Falcons, said he felt too many players, pampered and
coddled, might simply want to be ``just another guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves began his career in 1965, when players were serfs. What
he liked about the system was the firm infrastructure of leadership
within the organization, with the veteran larger than even the
biggest rookie ego. He said: ``When we came in, Coach Landry had
been there: `This is the way we do things.' It's different now.
There, if you did something wrong, you were gone. Guys have
contracts now that even if you wanted to, you couldn't do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   For modern players like Blaine Bishop, the key to a strong
locker room in the current sea of free agency is self-motivation
and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   The old-school coach wants a stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear is gone,'' Reeves said. ``To me, fear is the greatest
motivator of all.''

PUTTING A SHINE ON A DOLLAR THAT JINGLES IN YOUR POCKET  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 30) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Can Sacagawea succeed where Susan B. failed?
</P>
<P>
   The United States Mint and the Federal Reserve are trying again
this month to introduce a dollar coin that will win favor with the
public, 21 years after the Susan B. Anthony dollar landed with a
clank.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone liked the Susan B., and after an initial flurry,
it was rarely seen outside casinos and a few vending machines. Most
people avoided carrying them and quickly unloaded those they got.
</P>
<P>
   The design of the new coin, depicting Sacagawea (pronounced
sah-kah-jah-WAY-ah), the young Shoshone woman who helped guide
Lewis and Clark, is meant to overcome criticisms of the Susan B.
but still work in existing vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   At 4 cents apiece, the Sacagawea costs one-third more to make
than a paper dollar but will save the government a fortune if it
catches on: coins last more than 30 years in regular use, while
paper dollars wear out in 9 to 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   So this time, the government is spending $45 million on a
marketing program _ including hiding a few thousand in Cheerios
boxes and persuading Wal-Mart Stores to stock its cash registers
with them _ that mint officials hope will overcome the public's
reluctance to embrace a dollar coin.
</P>
<P>
   Philip N. Diehl, the executive director of the mint, spoke about
the Sacagawea in an interview late last week. Here are excerpts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The Susan B. Anthony coin flopped, and so did the dollar
coins that came before. Why try again? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It's true, we've never had a successful dollar coin. The
Susan B. was the most successful, and it was still considered a
major failure. The reason we're doing it now is because history has
caught up with us, and the dollar today is worth what a quarter was
25 years ago. Also, the vending industry is more sophisticated and
they are vending many more higher-value items. The U.S. coinage
system was becoming outdated.
</P>
<P>
   For years the demand for the Susan B. was just a trickle, so we
were dipping into the original supply of those coins. But then
around '94 or '95, the demand jumped to around 55 to 60 million a
year. The Postal Service was using them as change in their vending
machines, as were mass transit systems in Chicago and New York. By
1996, we realized we were going to exhaust the supply. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. People say the Susan B. Anthony failed because it was too
easily confused with a quarter. What have you done to make the
Sacagawea dollar distinctive? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There are three crucial differences. First, it's gold in
color, which is a strong visual cue that says, ``This is of higher
value.'' Second, it has a smooth edge, like a nickel. Third, it has
a wide border, which you can feel with your thumb when you reach in
your pocket. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How will this coin affect the vending industry? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Some people fear that this coin is going to encourage the
vending industry to raise prices, but I don't have that concern.
Dollar-bill acceptors break down a lot and are expensive to
maintain, so we expect vendors will have less cost with this dollar
coin. And most machines do not have to be retrofitted to accept
this dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Vending machines accept coins by reading their electromagnetic
fields. We found a metal alloy that, even though it's gold, the
vending machine reads it like it's a Susan B. Anthony. So to the
human eye and touch the Sacagawea and the Susan B. look very
different, but to a vending machine they look exactly the same. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some experts worry that the elegant design of this coin will
encourage collectors to hoard it out of circulation. Is this a
danger? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. No. In fact, we've used the collecting angle as part of our
plan for penetration. We wanted to create a coin that was so
beautiful, people would want it, and that would prime the
distribution pump. We've done that. Now, the trick is to get people
to use them, and not just in an initial burst in the first 12 to 18
months. We want to have people using the coin every day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. If this coin succeeds, will it make paper dollars obsolete,
as has happened in Canada? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think so. The conventional wisdom has been that a
dollar bill and a coin cannot coexist. If that were ever true, it
isn't anymore. I believe there's a substantial niche for the dollar
coin, and not just in the coin-operated industries, because we've
also had a strong response from over-the-counter retailers like
Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   We are promoting this coin more, like the Canadians did when
they introduced their dollar coin. In fact, our marketing campaign,
with Cheerios and the other tie-ins, is more robust than theirs,
and they were eliminating their dollar bill altogether.

   Mitar Vasiljevic, a Bosnian Serb accused of killing 135 Muslim
men, women and children by locking them inside two houses in
Visigrad in June 1992 and setting the buildings on fire, made his
first court appearance at the Yugoslavia war crimes tribunal.
Vasiljevic, a 45-year-old former paramilitary fighter, was arrested

   Secretary of Defense William Cohen said he would not object to a

NATO-led peacekeeping mission in Kosovo to the Eurocorps. Cohen
said that he approved of the proposal as long as it did not
diminish the European commitment to the peacekeeping mission in
Bosnia. The proposal was initiated by France, partners in the
Eurocorps with Germany, Spain, Belgium and Luxembourg. The plan
must be formally approved by NATO.

costs $10 million a year and is dependent on government
contributions, is considered important to helping to reduce food
shortages and in introducing lucrative animal stocks and cash crops
to get farmers to stop growing opium poppies, the only source of

 &HT;    Reject `greatest hits' history, Harvard scholar urges
 &HT;    By Kathy Whyde Jesse
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The history of the black church combined
Christian love of humanity with a deep questioning that made the
dominant culture squirm in its seat.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Scholar, author and social critic Cornel West urged
the black church to hold tight to that vision of its own history,
combining the interrogative nature of Socrates with the compassion
of Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   West, professor of Afro-American studies and philosophy of
religion at Harvard University, was the closing speaker of a
weeklong seminar for doctoral students at United Theological
Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and slender with a scarf wrapped around his neck, the
46-year-old West apologized for his hoarseness, but his voice
gained power in a speech that dripped with metaphor, wit, anger and
gentleness, in the style he learned from the black Baptist church.
A speech that included references to de Toqueville, Dostoevsky and
T.S. Eliot ended with an altar call.
</P>
<P>
   West told the standing-room-only crowd of about 200 students and
clergy, black and white, that the black church, and the larger
American society as well, was losing its sense of history because
of the ``market culture'' that cranks out historical ``greatest
hits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They do it to Martin (Luther King Jr.) every January,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   West said he has heard people say that King gave black people
civil rights, ``but Martin Luther King was one imperfect,
courageous brother, alongside a whole host of others. We've got to
keep him in the flow of history so that we are connected with that
flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans in general, but black folk in particular, are so
hungry and thirsty for a sense of history. But past, present and
future have become so fragmented, it is difficult to orient
yourself. Young people move from one fleeting now to the next
fleeting now.''
</P>
<P>
   West, who is an adviser for the presidential campaign of former
U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley, was critical of Thursday's State of the
Union address by President Clinton, which he said painted too rosy
a picture of the American landscape without taking into account
stagnating wages, the disproportionate number of unemployed black
men, and parents who work too hard to have time to nurture their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best of the black church would look at the State of the
Union through a different set of lenses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   America likes to view itself as ``the city on the hill,''
impervious to the weaknesses that have brought down other great
nations, West noted. ``But the best of the black church says,
'There is some history here you are denying. You are like any other
nation. You cannot transcend your history.'''
</P>
<P>
   The black church at its best is true to what West called its
``blue note: the darkness that is hidden and concealed; the
underside of American democracy.'' That dark side includes the
legacy of slavery, Jim Crow, and segregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``White supremacy is like a serpent wrapped around the leg of
the table of the signers of the Declaration of Independence.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge of the black church, he said, is to keep track of
the humanity of oppressors without capitulating to white supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always believed the Christian Gospel was absurd. How can
cracked vessels like ourselves love our way through the darkness of
the world? Can we love our neighbors as ourselves? Can we meet the
challenge? It's an open question,'' he noted, but added that it's
the trying that truly matters.

 &HT;    South's storm sends problems north
 &HT;    By Laura A. Bischoff
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Darryl Burns felt like crying Friday when he
learned Delta Air Lines had canceled his flight to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Burns had hundreds of dollars tied up in Super Bowl XXXIV
tickets, a hotel room and rental car, not to mention grand plans to
party with 10 buddies all weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Delta, fearing an impending winter storm, canceled or delayed a
number of flights into, out of and through its Atlanta hub on
Friday, a spokesman said. Sleet began falling in Atlanta Friday
evening with freezing rain after midnight, spokeswoman Alesia
Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safety was the reason we took the aggressive approach we
did,'' Watson said Friday evening. ``We've been pretty successful
in rerouting people into Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta reduced its flights at least through today, she said.
``We're very optimistic for Sunday'' returning to normal
operations, Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   A storm spread still more snow across the Deep South on Friday,
giving children from Arkansas to Georgia a rare chance to build
snowmen.
</P>
<P>
   The storm moved into the area after dumping up to 17 inches of
snow in Oklahoma. Between an inch and a foot fell in Alabama,
Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee before the storm stalled near
the Alabama-Georgia line.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi Gov. Ronnie Musgrove activated about 300 National
Guardsmen to help communities.
</P>
<P>
   Officials elsewhere also were treating the weather with urgency.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, which was surprised by 2 feet of snow this
week, Gov. Jim Hunt on Friday asked President Clinton to declare 26
counties disaster areas, which would make them eligible for federal
funds. About 13,000 customers remained without power in the state,
but they were expected to have it back by Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes requested the federal government declare
disasters in 39 counties because of an ice storm last week in
northern Georgia that left 500,000 customers without electricity
and caused an estimated $55 million in damage.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's storm is expected to cover a much greater area.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for Burns and other Delta customers, AirTran and other
airlines did not cancel all the flights. Burns re-booked on
AirTran's 3 p.m. flight and his party plans were back in gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beginning to work out,'' he said while eating a hot dog
at the Dayton International Airport lounge. ``Just so it's a good
game _ not a blowout one way or another _ after going through all
of this to get there.''

 &HT;    Artillery shells pound Texas ranch
 &HT;    By Richard L. Smith
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Army officials on Friday were still trying to find
out why several artillery shells rained down on a ranch causing
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Shoaf, a resident of the tiny community of King, was jolted
from her bath tub Wednesday about 8:30 p.m. when the shells,
believed to be fired from Fort Hood, came crashing into her yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard this terrible noise and I was on the side that it
hit,'' said Shoaf. ``I jumped out of the bath tub. I asked my
husband what the noise was. He said he saw shrapnel everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoaf and her husband, Robert, said four rounds of what they
were told were 155 millimeter howitzer shells exploded near the
four houses on their ranch. A 155 millimeter howitzer is a cannon
with a barrel diameter of 155 millimeters. Robert Shoaf said Army
officials told him the shells were fired from 7 1/2 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Shoaf said he called 911 after the shelling and that
Coryell County had notified Fort Hood of the incident. The
70-year-old said this was the first time anything of the sort has
happened.
</P>
<P>
   The Shoafs said the shells, some landing as close as 100 yards
from their home, caused extensive damage to their ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did extensive roof damage to our house and cracked the
foundation,'' Joan Shoaf said. ``Of the four houses, there was
damage to the roof of three and cracked sheet rock in one house.''
</P>
<P>
   A chandelier in her living room flew off and broke into pieces,
she said. Four small craters were left on the property by the
shells and several trees were damaged by shrapnel.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Hood officials weren't releasing details about the incident
Friday, saying an investigation is under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we learned of this, we immediately initiated an
investigation into the artillery training that evening,'' said Lt.
Col. Mary Ann Cummings, a Fort Hood spokeswoman. ``We sent
Explosive Ordinance Detection teams to the site to work with local
authorities and review any physical evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Cummings said evidence was found that ``leads to further
investigation.'' She said artillery firing on the huge Army post
has been suspended until the investigation is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the Shoafs said the shelling was a scary situation for
the couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to realizing how close to death we had come,'' Joan
Shoaf said. ``It could have blown up our house.''

   BEAVERCREEK, Ohio _ Rod Sharp figures if he plays his cards
right in Las Vegas, he could make thousands of dollars and
establish a new job for himself.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharp isn't looking to become a cardsharp. He and seven
partners are staging a trade show at The Paris Las Vegas Hotel from
May 15-17 that could gross $4.8 million and lead to more shows
around the world, Sharp said.
</P>
<P>
   The show will focus on computer certification and will feature
40 speakers, 70 workshops and hundreds of exhibitors. Computer
certification and training is a $2 billion a year industry, he
said. People can study for certification tests ahead of time, and
then attend workshops and take the tests at the show, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp said he expects 3,000 to 5,000 attendees, each paying
about $1,000, and several hundred exhibitors, each paying about
$1,500. Sharp lined up sponsors including Intel Corp. and Red Hat,
he said. He declined to say how many people have registered so far
but expects the number to pick up in March and April.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp, 40, became a technical writer after serving in the
military. His wife, Flo Sharp, is a Web site developer and
technical writer. The couple work out of their home, telecommuting
to sites around the country where they write technical manuals and
online help guides.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharps began working on the certification expo in September,
getting sponsors, establishing a Web site and marketing the event.
</P>
<P>
   If the Vegas show goes well, Sharp expects to conduct similar
expos in the Pacific Rim and Europe as early as 2001, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ So far, Prime Minister Ehud Barak has governed on
the basis of a pact of trust with the Israeli people.
</P>
<P>
   Trust me, he said, as the most decorated general in the
country's history, to make peace without compromising security.
Trust me, he said, to place peacemaking first and defer domestic
issues. Trust me, he said, to remain steady while you ride the
emotional ups and downs that seem embedded in our national
character.
</P>
<P>
   But what will happen to that pact of trust now that Barak's
campaign practices have come under criminal investigation, as
announced on Thursday? And how will that affect his moral standing
and his ability to summon the nation to back his peace moves, to
swallow his fiscal conservatism and to follow him into an uncertain
future?
</P>
<P>
   A good part of Barak's appeal to the Israeli electorate was his
image as a strait-laced, steely-eyed do-gooder. After three years
of a flashy prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who was greatly
mistrusted even by close associates, Israelis were drawn to Barak's
very lack of charisma.
</P>
<P>
   He was the anti-Netanyahu, a rough-hewn kibbutznik without his
predecessor's tastes for fine cigars, good wines and television
appearances. A lifelong military man, he was a political outsider,
and _ he made it seem related _ a supposed master of probity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was, in a way, like Carter after Nixon,'' said Yaron
Ezrahi, a political scientist at Hebrew University. ``Barak took
the high ground of leadership very effectively, even though there
was an element of Bonapartism.
</P>
<P>
   ``And because of that, this is not just a major shake-up or
fracture of the trust between Barak and the people. It goes even
deeper, to the trust of the people in the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now is not whether Barak's government will fall
over the state comptroller's finding on Thursday that his campaign
systematically violated campaign finance laws, which was followed
by the attorney general's immediate start of a criminal
investigation. That seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether his government's credibility will be
shaken and its resources drained by having to defend itself. And,
also, under those conditions, can it possibly succeed in one of its
primary missions _ to restore Israelis' faith in government, which
has been shaken by political violence and one too many scandals? By
establishing a broad-based coalition, Barak had sought to heal
divisions and return the country to greater normalcy.
</P>
<P>
   That primary mission, though, stood in service of his principal
ambition: peace, which will involve difficult territorial
concessions and require a public consensus. And to realize that
ambition, Barak needs to save the pact of trust, as was clearly
demonstrated in a recent poll. In it, about 70 percent of Israelis,
including many who were ambivalent about peace with Syria, said
they trusted Barak to reach a good agreement, one they could
endorse.
</P>
<P>
   And Barak also needs his former campaign staff, two of whom were
singled out by the comptroller and may be distracted for months by
the criminal investigation. He had reportedly counted on them to
lead his battle to win public opinion if the peace negotiations
with Syria or the Palestinians produced agreements. His successful
election campaign was to have served as a model for the campaign
for a national referendum on peace _ and now some of the election
campaign tactics have been deemed illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Barak himself was not implicated by the comptrollers' report,
which found that his associates had systematically circumvented
strict campaign finance restrictions by channeling illegal
contributions through nonprofit organizations. But the comptroller
did hold him responsible for their actions, and a poll Friday
showed that a majority believed that Barak was well-aware of what
they were doing.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and his associates have indicated that they will try to
show that the campaign laws they are accused of breaking are
unclear, even archaic.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said he will petition the Supreme Court to clarify the
law. And Yitzhak Herzog, the cabinet secretary who the comptroller
said served as a key conduit of illegal funds, said in an interview
published Friday that the campaign consciously ``acted on the basis
of a loophole in the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's strict campaign finance laws, which restrict individual
contributions to $400 and prohibit corporate and foreign donors,
were devised when Israel was still a strictly parliamentary system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Israel switched to a direct election system for its
prime minister. Israelis cast two ballots, one for a party list for
Parliament and the other for prime minister. That method created a
hybrid form of government, somewhere between a parliamentary and a
presidential system.
</P>
<P>
   It also created a tension between the candidate and his party,
since they were effectively conducting two campaigns under one
banner but the prime ministerial candidate took precedence. The
campaign finance laws, which were never rewritten, governed the
party and did not mention the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the prime ministerial candidate, in the new system, needed a
separate system of financing, and that gave rise to the nonprofit
associations, which Netanyahu first used in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the direct election law was passed, no serious body
looked into the question of how this would affect the issue of
financing,'' said Herzog, the implicated cabinet secretary. ``And
since there is no prohibition in the law, it is a permissible
act.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that admission, Israelis will ask themselves what made
Barak's team tempt fate over an ambiguous law. Was it the mentality
of the campaign war room that pushed them to take calculated risks
in the heat of battle? Was it arrogance? Was it a belief that the
law would not stand up under legal scrutiny?
</P>
<P>
   A Jerusalem Post editorial Friday lamented that Barak, ``with
his unusually ambitious agenda,'' would find himself in this
predicament.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a leader who was brought to the power in significant part
on the platform of restoring the rule of law,'' the editorial said,
``Ehud Barak will now be tested as to how he accounts for his own
behavior and that of his inner circle.''

U.S. ADMITS RADIATION PERIL TO WORKERS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After decades of denials, the government is
conceding that workers who helped make nuclear weapons beginning at
the dawn of the nuclear age were exposed to radiation and chemicals
that produced cancer and early death.
</P>
<P>
   The new finding _ that radiation exposure led to
higher-than-normal rates of a wide range of cancers among workers
at 14 nuclear weapons plants _ raises the prospect of compensation
to them. Although officials cautioned that any decision on that was
a long way off, they said a package could total tens of millions of
dollars for a group that might well include hundreds of families.
</P>
<P>
   The new conclusion comes from the government's most
comprehensive review of studies of worker health and raw health
data. The review accepts the conclusion of many of those studies,
some of them done under contract for the government, that workers
were made sick by their exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The finding goes far beyond an acknowledgment by the government
last July that one substance handled by weapons workers, beryllium,
had caused some of them to become ill from breathing beryllium
dust.
</P>
<P>
   Of the new conclusion, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said in
an interview, ``This is the first time that the government is
acknowledging that people got cancer from radiation exposure in the
plants.''
</P>
<P>
   The finding is detailed in a draft report prepared by officials
of the Energy Department and the White House with the cooperation
of a dozen government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton ordered the study in July, when the Energy
Department concluded that some of the workers at plants that had
supplied beryllium to the government for bomb-making had developed
beryllium disease, an incurable lung ailment. The president asked
for a broad study that would include the effects of radiation and
chemical hazards from uranium, plutonium and other substances.
</P>
<P>
   He also asked the group to develop a policy on compensation, but
that work has not been completed.

WASHINGTON: been completed.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Legislation proposed by Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., whose
constituents include some of the beryllium disease patients, calls
for payments to an estimated 500 to 1,000 former workers who either
have the illness or are at high risk of developing it. Total
payments in the beryllium cases could range from $15 million to $30
million a year, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One question that Congress would have to resolve in the
beryllium compensation, and that would have to be addressed in any
compensation plan developed as a result of the cancer finding, is
whether to make payments to survivors.
</P>
<P>
   In the 57 years since the Manhattan Project began processing
radioactive materials to produce bombs, the government has until
now minimized the hazards of radiation and chemicals, criticized
epidemiological studies that raised related questions and spent
tens of millions of dollars in defending itself against lawsuits
charging that the bomb plants had made workers sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, the role of government was to take a hike,''
Richardson said, ``and I think that was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   One expert on nuclear weapons manufacturing, Robert Alvarez, a
former Energy Department official, welcomed the government's
conclusion that many of its critics had been correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``A review of the studies by a body impaneled by the president
is official recognition,'' Alvarez said. ``That's what makes this a
big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel J. Guttman, a lawyer for the Paper, Allied-Industrial
Chemical and Energy Workers Union, which represents workers at 11
weapons factories, said of the draft conclusions, ``That's
stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The prior story line is, `What's the big deal, the risks were
marginal,' '' said Guttman, former executive director of a
commission formed by the Clinton administration to look into
improper radiation experiments using human subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Richard D. Miller, a policy analyst with the union, said the
change was remarkable because the Energy Department and its
predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission, had ``spared no
resources in seeking to defeat claims'' by employees who said they
had been made sick by radiation or chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary Richardson addressed a related issue last July,
describing the problem of workers employed by private companies
that had processed beryllium for weapons use. They could rarely
collect worker's compensation, a program geared to injury rather
than illness, and in any event their symptoms or diseases
frequently did not emerge until years after their employment ended.
Also, he said, the contractors who ran the factories for the
government argued that the link to the workplace could not be
demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said then that the government should pay for workers
made sick by beryllium, a toxic metal, and that radiation and
chemical exposures should be studied. That statement led to
President Clinton's request for the task force report.
</P>
<P>
   At one site that figured in the report's draft, K-25, a
now-shuttered Tennessee factory for enriching uranium, Mike Church,
the president of the Energy Workers' local, said, ``It would be a
start in the right direction, trying to get help for these people,
that the government is finally stepping forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The industrial process used at the plant exposed workers to
radiation and chemical hazards from uranium, plutonium and
fluorine. The union says workers at the plant have higher than
expected rates of leukemia, cancer of the lung and bladder, vision
problems and chronic fatigue syndrome, among other health problems.
The draft report, though, says only that workers there show more
lung cancer than the population at large. The study does not list
another plant that used the same industrial process, at Paducah,
Ky., where workers recently learned that their exposure included
plutonium as well as uranium.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The government has the names of workers and former employees who
died from cancer or other causes. Researchers using government
records have calculated the expected rates of various fatal cancers
from such groups. In some cases these rates are drawn from
epidemiological studies of general populations, in other cases they
are drawn from studies of workers in the weapons complex who have
been exposed to lower amounts of radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Among 14 plants, according to the draft report, a total of 22
categories of cancer, ranging from bone to bladder to leukemia,
occurred more often than expected. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The cancers listed in the report, most of them fatal, are
presumed to be caused by radiation and chemicals, although the
report does not address the precise scientific mechanisms and does
not clearly divide between chemicals and radiation in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   It also leaves open the question of how to compensate people who
worked in the complex and suffered illnesses now found at elevated
levels among their co-workers but which may not all be
occupationally related. It also raises the prospect that workers
will get sick in years to come from past exposures. Among the other
problems, acknowledged by officials at the Energy Department, is
that records of radiation doses and other exposures are poor at
many sites.
</P>
<P>
   The cancers were found among nearly 600,000 people who have
worked in nuclear weapons production since the start of World War
II. They range from leukemia and Hodgkin's lymphoma to cancer of
the prostate, kidney, salivary gland and lung. In addition to
several other operations at Oak Ridge, Tenn., where K-25 operated,
the draft also says that elevated cancer levels were found at
Savannah River in South Carolina and Hanford, in eastern Washington
state, where plutonium was manufactured; Rocky Flats, near Denver,
where the plutonium was shaped into weapons components, the Fernald
Feed Materials Center, near Cincinnati, where uranium was
processed, and at the Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos national
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the findings are drawn from epidemiological studies
performed from the mid-1960s onward, some of them disavowed by the
government at the time they were published. Others are from data
gathered by the Energy Department, which now owns the plants, its
predecessor the Atomic Energy Commission, or their contractors.
None of the research was done specifically for this study, which is
due to be finished in March.
</P>
<P>
   The report does not sum up the cancers, but a senior government
official familiar with its contents and preparation, said in an
interview that ``my guess, we could be talking about hundreds of
cases, in a population of hundreds of thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alvarez said that the number of victims would depend on how
many diseases are linked to radiation; if, as some epidemiologists
believe, radiation damages the human immune system and thus leaves
people vulnerable to a wide variety of diseases beyond those
cancers usually associated with radiation, then the number could
rise to the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The draft, however, explicitly states that the scientific
questions of causation were outside the task force's mandate.

 &HT;    N.H. DEMOCRATS WORRY ABOUT BITTER TONE OF CAMPAIGN
 &HT;    Updates in grafs 3-5 with dinner remarks.

<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ State Democratic leaders expressed concern Friday
night about the increasingly combative tone of the contest between
Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley in New
Hampshire's presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Chair Kathleen Sullivan, kicking off a state
party fund-raising dinner attended by both Gore and Bradley, said
that after the fighting and arguing of the presidential contest,
``we need to stick together and be family again.''
</P>
<P>
   She reminded the Democrats of the Rev. Jesse Jackson's
admonition after his defeats in the 1984 and 1988 campaigns: ``The
process makes us better, not bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gore and Bradley said their candidates did not plan to
stage a campaign skirmish in front of the party donors Friday
night. Both spoke at the fund-raising dinner following a full day
of campaigning in which Bradley continued his assault on Gore's
truthfulness.
</P>
<P>
   But after Gore left the dinner, Bradley raised the issue of
campaign finance irregularities by the Clinton-Gore re-election
campaign in 1996, the first time he has mentioned the issue in the
last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't clean our house, the Republicans will clean it for
us in the fall, and that will be a terrible direction for the
country,'' Bradley told the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, arriving at the dinner, told reporters that
she was concerned with the shift in Bradley's tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to play very well here,'' said the
popular governor, who has endorsed Gore. ``People appreciate the
need to draw distinctions on the issues, but when it starts getting
personal, the people of New Hampshire don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Decker, a Manchester businessman who supports Bradley,
complained that Gore was ``the source'' of the negative campaigning
by ``deliberately distorting'' Bradley's Senate record and his plan
for universal health care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say Bradley's attacks on Gore haven't been
provoked,'' Decker said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is seeking to walk a very fine line in the final days of
the campaign by attacking Gore without appearing to engage in the
same type of negative attacks that Bradley says he is against.
</P>
<P>
   The balancing act was not lost on Sonia Sheridan in Lebanon,
N.H., who posed Bradley a probing question at the conclusion of a
town hall meeting in Newport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm asking you, how can you deal with the sleaze factor
without yourself going through the same kind of tactics?'' Sheridan
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone misrepresents your position as Al Gore has done
consistently in this campaign, you call them on it,'' Bradley
responded.
</P>
<P>
   In a briefing with reporters, Bradley also disclosed that he had
experienced another episode of irregular heartbeat this week, the
latest of several in recent weeks. Bradley said the episode lasted
``about two hours'' and did not require medical treatment. The
condition, known as atrial fibrillation, is not life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, arriving in Portsmouth from his overnight trip to
Washington for the State of the Union speech by President Clinton,
refused to respond to Bradley's attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to emphasize the positive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Gore
stuck to his day's message _ that he is the only presidential
candidate with the know-how to keep the economy on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have just begun to prosper,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to strike a positive tone, the Gore campaign will begin
airing a 30-minute ad on New Hampshire television Saturday. It
includes scenes of Gore playing Frisbee with his wife and dancing
with his daughter at her wedding.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Bradley on Friday accused Gore of misleading voters about Gore's
own proposals for gun control and health care reform. He also
questioned Gore's commitment to abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   The assault on Gore's truthfulness came a day after Bradley
accused the vice president of distorting Bradley's record. Both
lines of attack reflected a sense of urgency in the Bradley
campaign over the potential outcome in next Tuesday's primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have invested a year of my life building a relationship with
the voters of New Hampshire,'' Bradley told reporters. ``I am
clarifying the record so they don't go into the last week believing
misstatements and mischaracterizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who trails Gore in most recent state polls, refused to
say if he needed to win next Tuesday in order to claim success in
the Granite state, saying only that he needed to ``do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign, however, sent more signals Friday that
Bradley was focused on a five-week battle with Gore leading up to
the big-state primaries March 7. The campaign reported that it
would enter February with nearly $20 million in the bank, including
$11.4 in federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign released its latest financial figures, too. They
showed the vice president with a nearly identical amount of money
available. Gore has an organizational advantage in most of the
upcoming primaries, however.
</P>
<P>
   In another development Friday, the Bradley campaign tacitly
acknowledged for the first time that Bradley is facing competition
from Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., among independents, New Hampshire's
largest bloc of voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley flew in former Sen. Lowell Weicker of Connecticut, a
former Republican who became an independent, to endorse him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully understand the independence of Senator McCain on the
campaign finance issue, but once you get past that one issue, the
only independent thinker and actor is Bill Bradley,'' Weicker told
voters at a town hall meeting here. ``Don't waste that vote.''
</P>
<P>
   After months of contrasting himself with Gore on the basis of
experience and leadership style, Bradley bluntly characterized Gore
as a manipulative politician who was insincere on some of the
Democratic Party's core issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley wrapped his criticisms around his latest campaign theme
of contrasting a new politics of ideas with an old politics of ``a
thousand promises and a thousand attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you listen to Al Gore speak you have to listen very
carefully, because old politics uses words in a very tricky
manner,'' Bradley told voters at a town hall meeting in Lebanon,
N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley asserted that Gore favors licensing handguns. ``But of
course unless you look at the clause he says 'new' handguns,''
Bradley said. ``If you don't listen very carefully it sounds like
he is right there for gun control, but the reality is that you have
to license and register all handguns.''
</P>
<P>
   On health care, Bradley said of Gore, ``He says he is for
universal health coverage, but his plan can't even begin to get to
universal coverage. So the illusion is created, well, he's there
fighting for me for universal health care coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question later, Bradley said Gore had a strong
``right to life'' voting record in Congress. ``Now he says he is
pro-choice, which is fine,'' Bradley said. ``Everyone should
evolve, but at least acknowledge where you've come from.''

GOOD HAIR DAY EARNS STARTING SPOT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CORVALLIS, Ore. _ USC freshman guard Nate Hair's career-high 13
points against Oregon has likely earned him a starting spot when
the Trojans face Oregon State tonight at Gill Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Hair hit 5 of 7 shots in a 68-67 loss to Oregon on Thursday,
including three 3-pointers, and played a career-high 35 minutes. He
also tied a career-high with five rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than likely I will go with Nate,'' USC coach Henry Bibby
said Friday. ``Nate played well. I like what he gave us off the
bench. He has always been able to make shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby has started freshman center Kostas Charissis the past two
games, but Charissis played only six minutes in the loss to Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   __ Under fire: Bibby was disappointed that guards Jeff
Trepagnier and Brandon Granville did not play better against
Oregon. Granville was 1 for 8 from the field and had only three
assists and Trepagnier was 3 for 10 from the field and 2 for 5 from
the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got two guys who haven't played with intensity,'' Bibby
said. ``They weren't in the game for us. If Brandon and Jeff played
for us . . . it's a 15-point game.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact the Trojans were in the game showed they might be
competitive even without stellar efforts from their top four
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we hit the last shot at the end, we would have won and
everybody didn't play well,'' forward Brian Scalabrine said. ``But
I really think we need to be more focused defensively. We were
focused for 20 minutes instead of 40.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Oregon protests: The Ducks were upset that referee Bob Sitov
awarded an extra free throw to Granville after determining that the
fans were shaking the rim at McArthur Court.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon athletic director Bill Moos said he would contact
Pacific-10 Conference commissioner Tom Hansen to object to the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think the basket doesn't shake at Duke?'' Moos told the
Eugene Register-Guard. ``It wasn't like we had people down there
shaking the thing. And now that our students and our crowd know
what it can do, it's going to be pretty hard to contain them.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Record setter: Trepagnier set USC's single-season school
record for steals with two against Oregon and has 64. The previous
record was held by Derrick Dowell, who had 62 in 1986-87.
</P>
<P>
   __ Reason for loss? USC's 45.3 percent field-goal percentage was
its worst showing since losing to Long Beach State on Dec. 16,
which just happened to be the Trojans' last loss. Oregon's 48.3
percent shooting percentage was the highest for an opponent since
the Long Beach game.

 FORBES PUSHES IMAGE AS CONSERVATIVE ALTERNATIVE TO BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NH-REPUBS, BUSH-NH)

 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ As Steve Forbes plies the narrow, snowy roads
here selling his conservative message, a second campaign is going
on behind the scenes, led by a formidable grass-roots organization
that is aiming especially at three crucial New Hampshire groups:
Catholics, anti-tax activists and gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Forbes is meeting with Cardinal Bernard Law, the
archbishop of Boston, to discuss abortion; telling the Gun Owners
of New Hampshire of his love of skeet shooting, or gaining the
support of top officials of the 10,000-member Granite State
Taxpayers Association, the state's largest anti-tax group, the
Forbes organization is hitting all the buttons on issues critical
to New Hampshire conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   This tripartite group, which the Forbes campaign began
organizing as far back as last March, is made up of people like
Emile Beaulieu of Goffstown, a conservative activist who
unsuccessfully ran for governor of New Hampshire in 1998 and is now
promoting Forbes to his vast network of conservative friends.
</P>
<P>
   Beaulieu has been making phone calls, putting up signs and
speaking on behalf of Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Forbes believes in God, family and morality, and he
doesn't owe lobbyists anything,'' Beaulieu said. ``That's what I'm
telling people, and people around here know and trust me.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting up Forbes as the conservative alternative to
front-runner George W. Bush is the cornerstone of the Forbes
strategy, both in New Hampshire and throughout the country. The
campaign's task is to build on Forbes' strong second-place showing
in Iowa and establish him as someone who can not only dent Bush,
but also be considered a viable presidential candidate, even though
he has never held public office.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign is less concerned about Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, who they feel will drop from the pack, a victim of a lack
of financing and his decision to enter only a handful of primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not our target,'' William Dal Col, the Forbes campaign
manager, said of McCain. ``We're going after the front-runner. If
he has a significant falloff, people are going to question whether
he's up to the task.''
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, a grass-roots effort brought in many new conservative
supporters, and Forbes is trying to re-create that success in New
Hampshire, but with adaptations to account for the state's
different political and social culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the potential for Steve to do well with the
disenfranchised,'' said Paul Young, the Forbes campaign's senior
political adviser for New Hampshire. ``Many of these people are
independent. Many of them are Democrats who have become
Republicans. Many are cynical. We have the potential to give a
different message to these independent voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Iowa Republicans are dominated by Christian conservatives
_ more than 40 percent of Iowa Republicans called themselves born
again _ New Hampshire is more than 40 percent Catholic. Of course,
many Catholics do not adhere to the church's anti-abortion stand,
and the state is about equally divided between abortion-rights
advocates and anti-abortion campaigners.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Forbes has taken a more subtle approach on
abortion. Gone are surprise visits from anti-abortion activists
like Phyllis Schlafly. In their place are more muted statements
about the sanctity of life and a ``New Birth of Freedom'' message
that includes the ``freedom to be born'' refrain Forbes repeats at
every stop.
</P>
<P>
   The state's formidable anti-tax organizations are the second
part of the equation. This is a state with no income tax and no
sales tax _ a place where every candidate signs an anti-tax pledge.
</P>
<P>
   To anti-tax activists here, Forbes' call for a flat income tax
is a dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Forbes has the best tax plan in place, he's been the
most consistent of all candidates,'' said George Lovejoy, president
of the Granite State Taxpayers Association and a former state
senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other candidate like him,'' Lovejoy said. ``He's
been steady and hasn't vacillated. This is something we knew about
him in advance. He's not one to switch back and forth. We are using
our influence wherever we can.''
</P>
<P>
   That means providing membership lists to the Forbes campaign,
inviting Forbes volunteers to speak at meetings of anti-tax
activists, helping with a direct-mail campaign directed at anti-tax
voters and taking out ads in local newspapers .
</P>
<P>
   More than 30,000 people belong to the Gun Owners of New
Hampshire, and, while the organization does not make endorsements,
Forbes has the backing of many of its leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Forbes has gone out of his way to talk to us,'' said
Craig Peterson, president of the gun owners group. ``He's very
solidly pro-firearms civil rights. And, he is someone who can win
this fall. The firearms groups here are really rallying behind
him.''

TURKISH MILITARY ACCUSES RELIGIOUS POLITICAL PARTY
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Conflict between the secular Turkish military
and the country's religious-oriented political party, which led to
the forced resignation of a prime minister in 1997, has flared up
again.
</P>
<P>
   Military commanders have asserted that the party, Virtue,
represents the same extremist mentality as a terrorist group that
claims to be acting in the name of Islam. In recent days, Turks
have been stunned by disclosures that the group, Hezbollah,
apparently gruesomely tortured and killed dozens of people that it
considered heretical. On Friday clerics at mosques throughout the
country condemned Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   Virtue is the country's main opposition party, holding 105 seats
in the 550-member Parliament. A senior prosecutor, Vural Savas, had
already asked the Constitutional Court to ban the party on the
grounds that it poses a ``clear and present danger'' to secularism
in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, when Hezbollah's apparent savagery was first
made public following the discovery of disfigured bodies buried at
its hideouts, there seemed little chance that the court would agree
to close Virtue. But in the wake of disclosures about the bodies,
the climate has changed palpably. With new discoveries, some 39
bodies have been found.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to say that we are somehow connected to this
bloody terror group,'' said Numan Kurtulmus, who heads the Virtue
organization in Istanbul. ``It is nonsense, because we strongly
support the ideas of democracy and human rights. But emotions are
running very high. Our party could be a victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Several prominent politicians and news commentators have
contended that Hezbollah could not have emerged in war-torn
southeastern Turkey without the cooperation of security agencies
there.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who suggested this connection was the Virtue leader,
Recai Kutan. He said that at the time Hezbollah was apparently
kidnapping and killing Kurdish nationalists in the early 1990s,
southeastern provinces were under emergency rule because of a
crackdown on a Kurdish insurgency and ``even a bird could not fly
there without the security forces knowing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the secret behind all those unsolved murders that have
been committed in the southeast over the last 10 years?'' Kutan
asked. ``Why did the authorities not launch a campaign against the
terror organizations?''
</P>
<P>
   Those remarks evidently outraged military commanders. On
Wednesday they issued a statement recalling that the Constitutional
Court has in the past closed three religious parties and suggesting
that Virtue was ``harboring guilty feelings'' in the wake of
disclosures about Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been seen with great regret that in a speech about the
Hezbollah terror group delivered on Jan. 25, the leader of a
political party made unjust and unseemly accusations against the
Turkish armed forces,'' the commanders said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This mentality, whose ultimate aim is to set up an Islamic
state, views the Turkish armed forces as the biggest obstacle
preventing it from reaching its goals. The Turkish armed forces,
with the support of the great Turkish nation, will never allow this
mentality to achieve its goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Such statements have great resonance here, because the
military's mistrust of Islamic political parties led it to pressure
Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan to resign in 1997, and later
helped persuade the Constitutional Court to ban his political
party, called Welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have asserted that the Virtue party of today is
nothing more than an extension of Welfare, and that Erbakan is
controlling it from behind the scenes despite the fact that he has
been banned from politics.

SUNUNU JOINS BUSH TEAM

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ The ranks of the Republican establishment
closed more tightly behind Gov. George W. Bush's presidential
campaign on Friday, as former Gov. John H. Sununu of New Hampshire
endorsed Bush, who once helped oust him as White House chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Sununu's blessing suggested a timely (for Bush) repair of a
political breach that dates back a decade, to when Sununu served as
President Bush's chief of staff. Sununu's blunt talk and combative
style rubbed much of official Washington the wrong way, and after a
series of public embarrassments, he resigned in 1991 under pressure
from people close to the president, including the loyal first son
who now seeks the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Sununu said the numerous journalistic accounts that
characterized his 1991 meeting with the younger Bush as angry and
bitter were erroneous. ``I have never had a problem with any
conversation I have ever had with Gov. Bush,'' Sununu said. ``I
have always considered him a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the present campaign, he said, ``I am absolutely
convinced that Gov. Bush is the correct choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona on Friday dismissed the endorsement
as a sign of ``a real kind of desperation in the establishment.''
He argued that Republicans were rallying around Bush because they
feared that McCain's proposals to overhaul campaign finance laws
would curb the power of the party and its moneyed supporters. ``I
wouldn't be surprised if every lobbyist in Washington endorsed
Bush,'' he said.

from a wintry blast earlier this week. (Pierre DuCharme/The

the rape and murder of an 11-year-old Albanian girl here, for which

Syria are threatening Eden Springs, the mineral water company and
one of the biggest investors and employers in the Golan Heights,

certainly return all or most of the Golan Heights to Syrian control

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `ANY GIVEN SUNDAY,' starring Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Dennis
Quaid, James Woods and Jamie Foxx. Directed by Oliver Stone (R, 160
minutes). Stone's brawling, hyper-macho professional football film
has enough in-the-thick-of-it playing-field action to satisfy the
fantasies of most armchair players. In the style of Stone's ``Wall
Street,'' the movie is also a crude morality play that pits the old
ways against the new with the veteran coach Tony D'Amato (Pacino)
embodying tradition and a young hotshot quarterback, Willie Beamen
(Foxx), the new. Although the acting is uneven (Ms. Diaz is
disappointing as a tough team owner), and the final scenes are
shamelessly ``Rocky''-ish, the movie delivers a credible,
action-charged vision of the frenzied world of professional sports
as a metaphor for the volatility of American culture (Stephen
Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `BOYS DON'T CRY,' starring Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny.
Directed by Kimberly Peirce (R, 114 minutes). This stunning debut
feature tells the strange and resonant story of Brandon Teena, who
despite being born Teena Brandon went on to create a charismatic
identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately wrenching tale may
sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into Theodore Dreiser's
idea of American tragedy. The film makes it hauntingly real and
even tenderly romantic, with the astonishing acting needed to make
it work. One of last year's best (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE END OF THE AFFAIR,' starring Ralph Fiennes, Julianne Moore,
Stephen Rea and Ian Hart. Directed by Neil Jordan (R, 105 minutes).
Jordan's intoxicating version of Graham Greene's 1951 novel, in
which an illicit affair becomes a far greater gamble than either
lover could have imagined. For this fearlessly eclectic filmmaker,
this is one more intelligent, brooding love story with a secret
twist. Fiennes and Ms. Moore breathe life into it with a dreamy,
erotic intensity that in no way trivializes the film's underlying
ideas about religious faith. Period detail (the setting is London
in the mid-1940s) is sumptuously heightened by the inspired costume
designer Sandy Powell (``Shakespeare in Love'') (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `FANTASIA/2000,' with James Levine and the Chicago Symphony
Orchestra and introductions by Steve Martin, Bette Midler, Levine,
Itzhak Perlman, James Earl Jones, Angela Lansbury, Quincy Jones and
Penn and Teller. Various directors (G, 75 minutes). The new
millennial version of Disney's 1940 groundbreaking fusion of
animation and classical music includes seven new segments and keeps
one from the original film (the wonderful ``Sorcerer's
Apprentice,'' starring Mickey Mouse). Despite the science-fiction
title and the Imax-size screen on which it is shown,
``Fantasia/2000'' is more backward-looking than futuristic. The two
best segments are ``Rhapsody in Blue,'' a witty
Manhattan-in-the-Jazz-Age homage to the caricaturist Al Hirschfeld
set to the music of Gershwin, and the finale (set to Stravinsky's
``Firebird Suite'') in which a cometlike sprite whooshes around the
globe explosively creating, destroying and renewing the planet's
life forms. Celebrity introductions lend the film the feel of a
deluxe corporate promotion. (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `GIRL, INTERRUPTED,' starring Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie.
Directed by James Mangold (R, 120 minutes). Except for being
several years too old for the role, Winona Ryder, an actress who
oozes high-strung intelligence, is ideally cast as Susanna Kaysen,
a precollege-age girl who lands in a Cambridge mental institution
in 1967 after a halfhearted suicide attempt. (The movie is based on
Ms. Kaysen's memoir.) The period details are perfect, and Ms. Ryder
has the courage to make her character a pain in the neck. But the
small, introspective movie is nearly stolen by Ms. Jolie as a
charismatic, brutally truth-telling sociopath who becomes Susanna's
best friend (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE GREEN MILE,' starring Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan,
David Morse, Doug Hutchison, Sam Rockwell and Bonnie Hunt. Written
and directed by Frank Darabont (R, 180 minutes). In adapting the
death row drama that Stephen King wrote in multiple installments,
the director of ``The Shawshank Redemption'' could have managed
more economy and fewer talky bits of business around the cellblock.
Still, this lengthy film is vivid and well played. Smooth ensemble
acting builds up to the discovery that a gigantic condemned man
(Duncan) is a prisoner with very special abilities, which gives the
film its mixture of religious overtones and mild horror. Hanks, as
a wry Southern prison guard, is so unaffectedly good that it's
redundant to say so (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `HOLY SMOKE,' starring Kate Winslet and Harvey Keitel. Directed
by Jane Campion (R, 95 minutes). Having roamed so gorgeously
through North Africa as a young hippie mother in ``Hideous Kinky,''
Ms. Winslet this time appears in India as Ruth Barron, a headstrong
young Australian seeking enlightenment. Eventually Ruth's mother
coaxes her home, where a ``cult exiter'' named P.J. (Keitel) is
waiting to wean Ruth away from her Indian guru. But as the film
moves from its early mix of rapture and humor into this more
serious, confrontational stage, it runs into trouble. It doesn't
help that Ms. Winslet's obvious strength and beauty leave Keitel's
P.J. looking overmatched (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE HURRICANE,' starring Denzel Washington. Directed by Norman
Jewison (R, 120 minutes). The life story of Hurricane Carter, a
middleweight contender who spent nearly 20 years in prison for a
triple murder he didn't commit, is a big, schmaltzy ballad of a
movie redeemed by Washington's moving, bone-deep portrayal of the
boxer from Paterson, N.J. But the movie plays fast and loose with
the facts, giving far too much credit to the members of a Canadian
commune who took up Carter's cause and all but eliminating his
heroic co-defendant John Artis from the story. And the minor
characters are either saints or monsters. Yet the story of a man
heroically fighting his demons and winning his freedom is still
inspiring (Holden). &QL;

   `THE LIFE AND TIMES OF HANK GREENBERG,' directed by Aviva
Kempner (not rated, 90 minutes). This unabashed valentine to
baseball's Hall of Fame slugger demonstrates how little mankind and
some of its sports figures have advanced since the 1930s and '40s
and reminds us how the persistence of bigotry stains a nation
founded on ideals like religious tolerance. The '30s and '40s were
the heyday of Greenberg, a son of Jewish immigrants who came out of
the Bronx to star with the Detroit Tigers, threaten Babe Ruth's
home run record and become the first man to win Most Valuable
Player awards at two positions, first base and left field. In
blazing his trail into the Hall of Fame, the tall, handsome
Greenberg became a target of anti-Semites. But his stardom, his
innate decency, his work ethic and his World War II record made him
a beacon of hope to many Jews. Taken as a whole, the documentary is
faithful to its title, valuable as history and resonant with
meaning for today (Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   `MAGNOLIA,' starring Tom Cruise, Melinda Dillon, Philip Seymour
Hoffman, William H. Macy, Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly and Jason
Robards. Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (R, 180
minutes). In ``Magnolia'' the colossally talented Anderson has set
up an artfully orchestrated symphony of intersecting L.A. stories,
with many of the cast members from his ``Boogie Nights'' assembled
to form a charismatic ensemble. The movie is saved from its own
worst ideas by the intimacy of the performances. Its single biggest
surprise is Tom Cruise in the role of a strutting,
obscenity-spouting cult figure named Frank Mackey (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `PLAY IT TO THE BONE,' starring Woody Harrelson, Antonio
Banderas and Lolita Davidovich. Directed by Ron Shelton (R, 124
minutes). This screwball sports comedy stars Harrelson and Banderas
as fading middleweight boxers and best friends summoned at the last
minute to fight each other as the opening act for a Las Vegas
heavyweight bout. The formulaic road movie follows them with their
pal and mutual ex-girlfriend (Ms. Davidovich) on their wisecracking
way from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, where they fight a brutal match.
The dialogue has sass, and the filmmaker's jaundiced vision of the
professional boxing world is very knowing, but the relationships
don't track (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `STUART LITTLE,' starring Geena Davis, Hugh Laurie and Jonathan
Lipnicki. Directed by Rob Minkoff (PG, 92 minutes). E.B. White's
1945 children's classic has been adapted into a lovely family film
about a little mouse (with the voice of Michael J. Fox) who is
adopted by humans but runs afoul of their fluffy white Persian cat,
Snowbell (Nathan Lane). The movie creates an enchanted storybook
version of New York and has what may be the most exciting toy-boat
race (in Central Park) ever filmed. Thanks to Lane's sly, wise-guy
vocal impersonation, Snowbell nearly steals a movie that is funny
and sweet but never cloying (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY,' starring Matt Damon, Jude Law,
Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Written
and directed by Anthony Minghella (R, 135 minutes). There are
diabolically smart surprises wherever you care to look in this
glittering thriller. Proving that the brilliance of ``The English
Patient'' was no fluke, Minghella shapes a hypnotic, sensually
charged adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's fascinatingly reptilian
murder story. The traffic-stopping cast includes Damon as the
dangerous chameleon of the title and, in a star-making role, the
English actor Jude Law as a rich dilettante who exerts a homoerotic
magnetism. Ms. Paltrow plays the odd woman out with the shrewdness
of a fine character actress, while Ms. Blanchett makes the
delirious most of her role as a needy American post-debutante. As
the story's odious playboy-snob, Hoffman is scene-stealingly
wonderful. Gorgeously photographed in Italy by John Seale (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TITUS,' starring Anthony Hopkins, Jessica Lange, Alan Cumming,
Harry Lennix and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Directed by Julie Taymor (R,
160 minutes). Ms. Taymor, the theater director and puppeteer who
created transfixing stage pictures in ``The Lion King'' and ``Juan
Darien,'' has turned Shakespeare's goriest tragedy, ``Titus
Andronicus,'' into a powerful contemplation of murderous revenge
enacted throughout history. Hopkins is ghoulishly funny and tragic
as the title character, whose political stupidity sets in motion a
devastating chain reaction of killing, torture and retaliation. Ms.
Lange is Tamora, the captured Goth empress who strikes back.
Although the movie's British theatrical and American film acting
styles don't mesh, Ms. Taymor's vision is realized with a
shattering force in time-traveling imagery that blends ancient Rome
with Mussolini's Italy and contemporary cyberpunk flash (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `TOPSY-TURVY,' starring Allan Corduner and Jim Broadbent.
Directed by Mike Leigh (R, 161 minutes). Leigh's grandly
entertaining ``Topsy-Turvy'' is one of those films that create a
mix of erudition, pageantry and delectable acting opportunities,
much as ``Shakespeare in Love'' did last year. Instead of a
love-struck young playwright, it presents the curiously matched
personalities of the librettist William Schwenk Gilbert and the
composer Arthur Sullivan in the midst of a robust, knowing,
frequently hilarious look at the musical theater over which they
held sway (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   FILM SERIES:
</P>
<P>
   `THE AMERICAN PLACE: LANDSCAPE IN THE EARLY WESTERN (AND A FEW
LATER CLASSICS).' An opportunity for a new look at the Old West is
at hand at the Museum of Modern Art, where a monthlong series
highlighted by early westerns is in progress. Spanning the history
of the genre, the series features more than 50 films in 30
programs, including works that extend from Edwin Porter, D.W.
Griffith, Thomas H. Ince, John Ford, Charles Chaplin and Allan Dwan
to Victor Fleming, Victor Seastrom, Sam Peckinpah, Mel Brooks,
Clint Eastwood and Jim Jarmusch. A choice double bill is offered at
6:30 Saturday night. One half consists of ``Blazing the Trail''
(1912), a 12-minute pioneers-versus-Indians tale directed by Ince,
a producer, director, screenwriter, actor and visionary who brought
spectacular action and high standards to the western. The other
half is ``The Searchers'' (1956), Ford's magnificent and
influential account of a dogged seven-year hunt for a girl
kidnapped by Indians. The cast includes John Wayne, Jeffrey Hunter,
Vera Miles, Ward Bond and Natalie Wood. Continuing through Feb. 24,
at the Museum of Modern Art, the series, is free with museum
admission: $10 for adults, $6.50 for students and people 65 or

GLENN RATED AS A-OK AFTER SPACEFLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Ohio, Fla., Texas)   (jw) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ John Glenn endured the effects of spaceflight as
well as, if not better than, the younger astronauts who accompanied
him on his nine-day space shuttle mission in 1998, scientists said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting on the scientific outcome of the 10-day mission, which
ended on Nov. 7, 1998, when the space shuttle Discovery landed at
Cape Canaveral, Fla., the scientists said Glenn, then 77, responded
as well as astronauts half his age. The flight made Glenn, who at
the time was a senator from Ohio, the oldest person to travel
through space.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results are inherently exciting because they challenge the
concept of the elderly being frail individuals,'' Dr. David
Williams, director of the Life Sciences Center at the Johnson Space
Center in Houston, said in a presentation of mission results at the
National Institutes of Health here.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of reports, researchers said Glenn returned from
space with no more bone loss or muscle atrophy than the other six
crew members of the Discovery. In addition, they said, he recovered
proper muscle tone and balance about as well as his colleagues as
they readapted to the Earth's gravity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably would have predicted that the older individual
would take longer to readapt after returning to Earth,'' Williams
said, ``but these results force us to re-examine our
preconceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, a Democrat who retired from the Senate at the end of
1998, gained fame in February 1962 when he became the first
American to orbit Earth.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged Friday that while his good results did not prove
that every older person could do well in space, the mission was ``a
toe in the door'' for considering more elderly people for space
flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists ought to submit more research proposals to NASA
that call for testing older people in space because of the
similarities between what happens to people in space and what
happens when they age,'' Glenn said in an interview. ``I hope my
performance gives them more confidence that they can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arnauld Nicogossian, the National Aeronautical and Space
Administration's associate administrator for life sciences, said
there were no current plans to fly more elderly astronauts. But he
said the space agency would work with the National Institutes of
Health and other research agencies to develop studies to address
such issues.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn lobbied NASA to include him on a shuttle flight by
pointing out the parallels between the biological effects of aging
and space travel. Both elderly people and astronauts experience
muscle loss, decreased bone density, sleep disturbances, hormone
imbalances, weakened immune defenses and problems with balance and
orientation. Although scientists do not know if the same underlying
mechanisms cause these problems in both groups, they believe
knowledge and treatments developed for one may help the other.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said Glenn's heart rate before, during and after the
flight was slightly better than the average of 12 younger male
astronauts on their missions. And while his muscles, like those of
the other astronauts, regained their tone shortly after the
mission, Glenn's remained slightly swollen for a longer time, said
Dr. Adrian LeBlanc of the Baylor College of Medicine. LeBlanc said
the slowness of muscle recovery might have stemmed from Glenn's
extensive post-flight travel and other activities.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, who wore a sensor-studded harness and helmet for sleep
studies during part of the mission, also showed some slightly
different results when resting, said Dr. John Charles, program
scientist for the Discovery flight. He said Glenn would awaken and
go back to sleep during the middle of his sleep period, something
the former astronaut said he did not remember doing.
</P>
<P>
   The only adverse effect Glenn suffered was nausea for several
hours after landing, something that 20 percent of astronauts
returning from space also experience. In general, Charles said,
Glenn's post-flight data in most areas was better than that for his
younger companions. He credited this to Glenn's extraordinary
health before the flight, attributed to a life of exercise and
watching his weight. ``He did pretty good for a 40-year-old guy,''
 &UR;  &LR; Charles joked.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said he would love to fly another space mission, but his
wife, Annie, would not allow it. ``I'd be very happy to go up
again,'' he said. ``If there was a specific area that NASA wanted
me to investigate, I'd go up in a minute.''

<P>
   It feels inappropriate to use the phrase that is normal for such
moments during other election campaigns: ``they're off.''
</P>
<P>
   America's election campaigns seem never to have a proper
beginning, moving as they do from preparatory committees to
non-declarations to further fund-raising and on, at last, to
declarations.
</P>
<P>
   All this amid votes by what, to outsiders, seem bizarrely small
and unrepresentative groups of people, starting with the ``straw
poll'' in Iowa last August and, well, starting again with the Iowa
``caucuses'' this week, in which fewer than 180,000 people turned
out to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as is traditional, this small oddity in one of America's
least-populated states has carried the proud badge of being the
beginning of the campaign proper.
</P>
<P>
   And, though New Hampshire's vote next week will offer more solid
evidence of how the battle is proceeding, the results in Iowa do
offer that most crucial of assets _ or liabilities _ in a campaign,
namely a psychological advantage _ or disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   On that measure, however, the Iowa vote was a tad dispiriting.
Clear victories, and thus psychological advantages, were won by the
candidates who, for as much as two years, have always been the
nominees-presumptive, namely Al Gore and George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there were even signs after the vote that Gore and Bush
felt it was already time to train most of their fire on each other,
rather than on their Democratic and Republican rivals respectively.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling may change, amid the snows of New England. The hope
must be that it will. For the most interesting, and potentially
healthiest, battles are those between the nominees-presumptive and
their closest rivals, not between Gore and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   An early defeat of Bill Bradley by Gore, and of John McCain by
Bush, would stifle at birth a debate that in any case has been
painfully stunted by the compression of the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, this would be a debate that put some of the big issues
of American public policy squarely in front of the public. One
would be health care, notably how to improve the care available to
America's 40 million uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, knowing the trouble President Bill Clinton got into on the
issue, would sooner play this down. The great advantage of
Bradley's prominence so far in the campaign has been to force
health care back on to the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, three issues stand to suffer if Bush
runs swiftly to victory. One is foreign policy, on which Bush
prefers vagueness while McCain speaks out in a more forthright way.
</P>
<P>
   Another is campaign finance, McCain's trademark issue, but one
the well-padded Bush (like Gore) would rather not examine too
closely.
</P>
<P>
   The third, and most prominent, is tax. The danger here is that
Bush may win too easily with an irresponsible policy _ and then get
stuck with it during the fight against Gore in the summer and
autumn.
</P>
<P>
   All Republicans seem to feel obliged to promise to cut taxes,
even though, with the economy steaming ahead, lower taxes are the
last thing America needs (unless they are financed by big cuts in
spending).
</P>
<P>
   McCain's tax plan is at least more responsible than Bush's. The
Republican front-runner has not, it seems, learned the lesson of
the 1986 Gramm-Rudman tax reform (which Senator Bradley supported):
that to simplify the tax code, eliminating loopholes and
distortions, is a higher and more valuable goal than mere cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Why not debate that in New Hampshire? &QL;

their closest rivals, not between Gore and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   An early defeat of Bill Bradley by Gore, and of John McCain by
Bush, would stifle at birth a debate that in any case has been
painfully stunted by the compression of the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, this would be a debate that put some of the big issues
of American public policy squarely in front of the public. One
would be health care, notably how to improve the care available to
America's 40 million uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, knowing the trouble President Bill Clinton got into on the
issue, would sooner play this down. The great advantage of
Bradley's prominence so far in the campaign has been to force
health care back on to the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, three issues stand to suffer if Bush
runs swiftly to victory. One is foreign policy, on which Bush
prefers vagueness while McCain speaks out in a more forthright way.
</P>
<P>
   Another is campaign finance, McCain's trademark issue, but one
the well-padded Bush (like Gore) would rather not examine too
closely.
</P>
<P>
   The third, and most prominent, is tax. The danger here is that
Bush may win too easily with an irresponsible policy _ and then get
stuck with it during the fight against Gore in the summer and
autumn.
</P>
<P>
   All Republicans seem to feel obliged to promise to cut taxes,
even though, with the economy steaming ahead, lower taxes are the
last thing America needs (unless they are financed by big cuts in
spending).
</P>
<P>
   McCain's tax plan is at least more responsible than Bush's. The
Republican front-runner has not, it seems, learned the lesson of
the 1986 Gramm-Rudman tax reform (which Senator Bradley supported):
that to simplify the tax code, eliminating loopholes and
distortions, is a higher and more valuable goal than mere cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Why not debate that in New Hampshire? &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RUMNEY, N.H. _ Roy Loveys, the locksmith in this charming
snow-shrouded town, is a conservative World War II veteran who
proudly rolls up his sleeves to show his battle scars, so it might
seem natural that on Tuesday he would vote for another old Navy
man, Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But, no, that would be too simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one thing I don't like about McCain,'' fretted
Loveys, a tall chatterbox with a personality as warming as the fire
blazing in his living room's wood stove a few feet away. ``I heard
from a friend that he was captured during the Vietnam War and when
he was a prisoner he went over to the other side. You seen the
movie ``King Rat''? He cooperated with the enemy just like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Loveys got the details mixed up. McCain resisted the
Vietnamese and despite torture refused to be released ahead of
fellow fliers who had been captured earlier. Nonetheless, Loveys
understanding of events is such that he is planning to vote for
Steve Forbes in Tuesday's Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   As candidates, consultants and pollsters fine-tune their
messages and seek to seduce the hard-to-get New Hampshire voter in
preparation for the nation's first primary, interviews in Rumney
underscore that voters can make black boxes seem easy to
understand. There may be a logic to voting, but there is also often
an illogic that fires the electoral process, and when voters choose
candidates the process is sometimes neither rational or irrational,
but extra-rational.
</P>
<P>
   Loveys' mistake is, of course, not a common one. But
conversations with dozens of ordinary people in Rumney, a village
70 miles northwest of Manchester, found remarkably few voters who
paid much attention to candidate debates or newspaper reports about
major issues. On the other hand, there were plenty of people who
cited voting plans that might drive a seasoned campaign manager to
tears.
</P>
<P>
   Take the other half of the Loveys family, Frances, a grandmother
who refers to her husband as a hero and prods him to tell of the
six invasions in which he participated in World War II. Mrs. Loveys
explained that they like George W. Bush but added regretfully,
``You know, he was involved in that banking scandal a few years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   A banking scandal?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah!'' Mrs. Loveys nodded emphatically. ``It was a big deal.
Real pity, too, because Bush seems like he's a good man.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps she means Bush's younger brother, Neil, who was
implicated in a Denver savings-and-loan scandal?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, was it his brother?'' Mrs. Loveys asked, looking stricken.
``Oh really? Goodness me.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the ink spilled and broadcasts beamed in recent days
about abortion, taxes, health care and other controversies, the
good citizens of Rumney rarely brought them up in explaining how
they were going to vote. In this town of 1,440 spread about the
foothills of the White Mountains, few people seemed particularly
interested in the candidates or knowledgeable about their
positions, even though they and other New Hampshire citizens are
almost surely more interested in, and informed about, the campaign
than people in other states.
</P>
<P>
   After all, people in Rumney cannot help but hear about the
candidates. Almost every evening at dinner there is a phone call
proclaiming everything but the immaculate conception of one
contender or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, I just hang up on them,'' said Bernard Peas, a school
bus driver. ``But last night I got a call about Forbes, and the gal
seemed really nice, so I didn't hang up at the beginning. I just
told her to dig a hole in the ice and throw him in. And then I hung
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The one issue that seems to resonate as strongly in Rumney as on
the airwaves is negative campaigning. People who shrugged at tax
cuts or education complained passionately about the way Republican
and Democratic candidates alike criticized one other.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dow household, 10-year-old Stephen and his mother, Anne,
were watching ``Good Morning America'' on Thursday, with clips of
the debate the night before in which Vice President Al Gore and
former Sen. Bill Bradley accused each other of unfair attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just like kids fighting, the way they argue like
that,'' Stephen said contemptuously. He, like some others
interviewed, favors Bush because he sometimes says nice things
about his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   When the subject of disputes came up, they sometimes seemed
distorted, like an exceptionally fuzzy television image. In the
local diner, a waitress named Becky Weeks was just saying that she
liked McCain when the cook, Todd Merrifield, interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see what McCain said about his daughter?'' he asked. ``He
used to say it's a woman's choice, and now that his 15-year-old
daughter is thinking of it, he says it's a family decision.''
</P>
<P>
   (In fact, McCain has always been against abortions. His daughter
is not pregnant, but when he was asked whether he would let her
have an abortion if she became pregnant, he initially said that the
final decision would be hers and then later that it would be a
family decision.)
</P>
<P>
   At the gas station, which also sells everything from corncob
pipes to fishing lures, Jim King explained why he was not paying
much attention to promises about taxation, health and education.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pie in the sky,'' said King, who criticized all the
candidates but said that the least-worst was Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Bradley because he tells it like it is,'' King said.
``He says the way he's going to go, and even if you don't like it,
you've got to like a man like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Others in Rumney found that characteristic in other candidates,
especially McCain. Indeed, it was striking how many independents
(who can vote in either the Democratic or Republican primary) said
that they were wavering between Bradley and McCain, even though in
traditional ideological terms this makes no sense: Bradley is a
liberal Democrat and McCain, on most issues, is a conservative
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably going to do Bradley or McCain,'' said Patrick
Hanigan, a 34-year-old proprietor of a local grocery store. Hanigan
paused, beamed and added, ``I think Bradley and McCain should team
up on a ticket. They'd be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the impression outside New Hampshire that the candidates
are rattling doorknobs everywhere, most Rumney residents have seen
the contenders only on television. Rumney may be more or less in
the middle of the state and on a highway, but no candidate has come
here, although several have been to Plymouth, 10 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Tunnell, a 91-year-old widow who remembers the
administration of Woodrow Wilson, says that voters, for all their
lapses, are much better informed than they used to be. Mrs.
Tunnell, who sat in her living room underneath the head of a
white-tailed deer whose antlers she uses as a clothes rack (``this
house was too old to have closets''), said that voters today were
much more likely to read newspapers and know something about the
issues than a generation or two ago.
</P>
<P>
   So how will people decide who to vote for?
</P>
<P>
   At the grocery store, Hanigan's mother, Peggie, is puzzling over
that question. She does not like Bradley (``I don't like his
voice'') or Gore (``He's too friendly with Bill Clinton''). But
with time running out, she adds: ``I guess I'll wait until I get to
the voting booth and then figure it out.''

<P>
   For a few chaotic hours last weekend, Ecuador was gripped by the
kind of tragi-comic political drama that was commonplace in Latin
America a generation ago, but that many hoped lay in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Indian farmers joined a nationalist army colonel to seize the
Congress, proclaim a ``junta of national salvation,'' and force the
overthrow of Jamil Mahuad, the country's elected president.
</P>
<P>
   The armed forces' commander at first joined the coup, but,
pressed by the United States, restored civilian government by
handing the presidency to Gustavo Noboa, the vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   All's well that ends well? No.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, bloodshed was averted, and democratic appearances
have been preserved. Mahuad, decent but weak, was deeply unpopular.
Ecuadoreans' living standards have been devastated by disasters,
natural and financial.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to stabilize the economy were not helped by the IMF,
which first encouraged Ecuador to default on some of its debt, then
dallied over coming to its aid.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad's final, desperate, decision to junk Ecuador's sad sucre
and adopt the dollar infuriated the Indian protesters. But none of
that remotely justified his overthrow.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Ecuador has seen the first successful Latin American
military coup since Haiti's in 1991. It sets an ugly precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Noboa, who has pledged to push ahead with dollarization, may for
a while fare better. But the armed forces are now clearly the
arbiters of Ecuador's political life.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they began to assume that role in 1997, when they
consented to the dismissal of another elected president, Abdala
Bucaram, though he had at least been (hastily) impeached by
Congress, for ``mental incapacity'' and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, Ecuador's politics have long resembled a tropical
opera buffa. The country's deep regional cleavages exacerbate the
fragmentation of its party system, denying its presidents reliable
legislative majorities, and blocking all efforts at economic
reform.
</P>
<P>
   But Ecuador's coup comes on top of other recent setbacks to
Latin American democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In Peru, an autocratic president, Alberto Fujimori, is seeking a
third term, though all but his own lackeys hold this to be
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   In Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, once a coup leader and now an elected
president (admired by Ecuador's seditious colonel), has aroused
fears of dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   And Colombia's democratic government has turned to the United
States for massive military aid in an effort to control leftist
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Some pundits have started to write obituaries for Latin American
democracy. That is mistaken. Worrying as these setbacks are, they
need to be put in perspective. The authoritarian threat is largely
confined to the much-troubled Andean countries (and Paraguay).
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a contrary trend is at work. It involves the
strengthening of such democratic institutions as legislatures and
local government, at the expense of all-powerful presidents,
capable of decreeing market-opening reform from above.
</P>
<P>
   That may worry some investors, but it is encouraging a more
consensual kind of politics.
</P>
<P>
   To take two recent examples, in both Argentina and Mexico
governments lacking legislative majorities have approved austere
and responsible budgets with the support of some of their
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In many countries in the region, a military coup remains almost
unthinkable. Even so, Ecuador offers a warning.
</P>
<P>
   The severe recession that struck South America last year has
damaged, though not destroyed, the enthusiasm for both economic
reform and democratic government.
</P>
<P>
   That should not come as a surprise: only the naive ever thought
democracy would effortlessly flourish in countries that are still
mostly poor and unequal. The good news is that it is not about to
wither. &QL;

COMEBACK TIME IN JAPAN FOR 3 BIG BROKERAGE FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan's three largest brokerage firms reported their
best profits in a decade Friday, illustrating a strong comeback
from severe weakness just a few years ago and defying predictions
of their demise.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is true that much of their recent good fortune can be
attributed to soaring stock prices in the Japanese market, the
firms did manage to eke out profits in a much tougher environment,
proving that they can survive the sweeping regulatory changes that
were the most prominent feature of Japan's Big Bang financial
overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Commissions were deregulated last fall, leading to price cuts,
and foreign financial services companies and online trading firms
have given the Japanese firms stiff competition. Moreover, Japanese
banks are scrambling to offer many of the same services provided by
their broker cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Bang has been the least of any of these companies'
worries,'' said Paul Heaton, a financial services analyst with
Deutsche Bank in Tokyo. ``Lots of analysts were saying it would
spell big trouble for the Japanese brokers, but that was absolute
nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the brokerage firms' most recent results are proof that
Western-style restructuring and retrenchment pay off handsomely
when markets begin to boom.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the asset bubble in the Japanese economy broke,
the firms began cutting back and reorganizing. Between 1991 and
1998, Japanese brokerage firms eliminated 1,000 branches and cut
employment to 95,000 from 150,000. ``Brokers have cut costs
dramatically, and people don't really recognize that,'' Heaton
said.
</P>
<P>
   So, when the Japanese stock prices took off at the beginning of
1999, brokerage firm profits did, too.
</P>
<P>
   Underwriting was also strong in the last quarter, and analysts
estimate that this year will bring 200 to 400 initial public
offerings in Tokyo as well as moves by established publicly traded
companies to capitalize on the equity market's boom.
</P>
<P>
   Nomura Securities Co., the biggest Japanese brokerage firm,
indicated that it earned 77 billion yen, or $719.8 million, in its
third quarter. The gain was a sharp turnaround from a loss of
177.49 billion yen that Nomura reported for the full fiscal year
that ended in March. (Nomura, like the other Japanese brokerage
firms, reports earnings on a cumulative basis; it reported that it
earned 131.79 billion yen for the period from April to December.)
Revenue climbed to 773.4 billion yen for the nine-month period,
topping the 625.35 billion yen for the full fiscal year that ended
in March.
</P>
<P>
   Nomura is benefiting from plans to break up its vast empire,
starting with the spinoff of the Nomura Research Institute, which
provides information technology products and support and is
considered one of Nomura's best assets.
</P>
<P>
   It also clearly intends to stay competitive. In a highly unusual
move, Nomura announced that it had lured Kiyokazu Okubo, a
financial institutions analyst, away from the Dutch financial
services firm ABN Amro. Japanese brokerage firms are typically
unwilling to pay the top salaries that analysts for foreign firms
command, but Okubo's move suggests that that is changing.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue of Daiwa Securities Co., the second-largest brokerage
firm in Japan, soared to 479 billion yen, or $4.48 billion, thanks
in part to an increase in Internet accounts and to greater investor
enthusiasm for mutual funds. Daiwa reported a nine-month profit of
103.76 billion yen.
</P>
<P>
   Nikko Securities Co. of which Citigroup owns nearly 10 percent,
indicated earnings of 46.56 billion yen, or $435 million, for the
quarter. It reported a profit of 101.19 billion yen for the nine
months. Nikko also reported revenue of 381.63 billion for the last
nine months.

</P>
<P>
   That should not come as a surprise: only the naive ever thought
democracy would effortlessly flourish in countries that are still
mostly poor and unequal. The good news is that it is not about to
wither. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDONDERRY, N.H. _ Locked in a tight race with Sen. John McCain
four days before the nation's first primary, Gov. George W. Bush
has taken steps to cushion himself against a possible loss here by
intensifying advertising and organizational efforts in states where
he had not planned such heavy early investments.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few days, Bush campaign officials said they
purchased advertising time on radio stations in Delaware in advance
of the Republican primary there on Feb. 8, and pumped additional
money into an advertising drive in South Carolina, which holds its
primary Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign had not planned a large-scale effort in
Delaware. But campaign officials said they changed course to assure
as potent a victory there as possible so if Bush loses in New
Hampshire it would not appear that his support is eroding in states
with subsequent contests.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those efforts, which Bush advisers described as an
insurance policy, officials said they believe a victory in New
Hampshire is within reach, despite most polls showing that McCain
is ahead. To that end, the Bush campaign stepped up its purchase of
advertising on Boston television in a final push that also includes
telephone calls and mailings aimed at Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   On one station in Boston, for example, the Bush campaign has
purchased an addition $50,000 of broadcast time for this weekend,
on top of more than $100,000 previously purchased.
</P>
<P>
   To convey a daily sense of momentum _ and try to dominate the
news _ the Bush campaign has been pulling out big names to appear
with the governor on the stump. On Saturday, the campaign was
planning a surprise appearance by former President George Bush, who
was to appear at his son's side at a concert of country singer
Travis Tritt in Milford, N.H. Friday, former Gov. John Sununu
endorsed Bush; on Thursday, it was Jack F. Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   In another attempt to come on vigorously in the final weekend,
Bush's advisers said they were considering broadcasting a
commercial that would contrast his tax-cutting plan with McCain's.
The advertisement would feature a clip of a moment from a debate
where McCain said of Clinton's tax-cutting plan: ``Maybe President
Clinton's looks too much like mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers said they had to move this week to shore up
their organizations in Delaware and South Carolina as a precaution
because by Tuesday if would be too late _ in the event that Bush
loses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, when we wake up Wednesday morning we've got to be
ready to shift ground quickly if necessary,'' said one senior
adviser to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Trying, perhaps, to play down expectations, several advisers
said they feared that Bush had not completely recovered from his
failure to campaign more aggressively in this state last year _ and
his failure to mix more with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is truly running a national campaign,'' said Gov. John
Engler of Michigan, an adviser to Bush, who noted that McCain has
concentrated his resources here. ``He's now trying to play catch-up
in New Hampshire.'' He added: ``We are competing everywhere. But I
don't think the people of Michigan are sitting at the edge of their
chairs to find out what the people of New Hampshire think.''
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Bush said they were confident that his campaign has
the resources and endorsements around the country to outlast McCain
even if the senator triumphs on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, John McCain has to win New Hampshire,'' said Ralph
Reed, a Bush adviser. ``We want to win. But he has to win. Whatever
the outcome, we fight on and, at some point, he runs out of supply
lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Other advisers to the governor said they were increasingly
concerned that if Bush loses here and does not perform
overwhelmingly in subsequent states, that could undermine his
biggest selling point among many Republicans: that he has the
popularity to win in the general election. In fact, a Wall Street
Journal/NBC News poll published Friday found that Vice President Al
Gore _ coming on strong after his easy win over Bill Bradley in the
Iowa caucuses on Monday _ is now in a dead heat with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   While Steve Forbes, the wealthy magazine publisher, placed
second to Bush in the Iowa caucuses, Bush advisers said they were
far more concerned about McCain. Ultimately, they said, they do not
believe Forbes is electable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time we gave a nomination to a person who was not
elected to anything was Eisenhower _ and he won World War II,''
Engler said. ``It's not going to happen. It's a Bush-McCain race.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dave Carney, a Republican strategist here who worked for
President Bush, said of the governor's efforts here, ``It should
have been put away a long time ago.'' But, he added, ``This week,
he's had the best week he's had.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Bush's advisers said they are concerned that Forbes,
with his deep pockets, could spend enough on television commercials
to wound them _ as he did with Bob Dole here four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Dal Col, Forbes' campaign manager, dismissed McCain as
not having the resources to be competitive down the road.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's success in this state _ as measured by the polls and by
the huge crowds he is attracting _ has begun to frustrate some Bush
aides. They particularly expressed concern about McCain's
suggestion that Bush is not as prepared to be president. At the
headquarters in Austin, some Bush workers refer to McCain's bus,
the ``Straight Talk Express,'' as the ``Double Talk Express.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the drive to beat McCain on Tuesday, the Bush
campaign is counting on the strength of the campaign apparatus of
Sen. Judd Gregg. But Mike Murphy, an adviser to McCain, said the
ability of the Gregg organization to deliver voters to the polls on
election day is vastly overstated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't even deliver a pizza,'' he said.

<P>
   Take the bosses of the world's 1,000 largest companies,
accounting for four-fifths of world industrial output, and 33
national leaders, including the president of the United States.
Assemble them in a secluded Swiss ski resort, and then surround
them with gun-toting police.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder that the annual meeting of the World Economic
Forum in Davos this week has become, to some, a sign that there is
a global economic conspiracy perpetrated by the white men in dark
suits who run the world's multinational corporations?
</P>
<P>
   Many people _ and not just the folk with ponytails and placards
who disrupted last December's meeting of the World Trade
Organization in Seattle _ now think of multinationals as more
powerful than nation states, and see them as bent on destroying
livelihoods, the environment, left-wing political opposition and
anything else that stands in the way of their profits.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is new. Three decades ago, multinationals were
already widely denounced as big, irresponsible, monopolistic
monsters.
</P>
<P>
   But they then went through a period of being sneered at as
yesterday's clumsy conglomerates, before being lauded in the 1990s
(including by Third-World leaders in Davos) as the bringers of
foreign capital, technology and know-how.
</P>
<P>
   Yet now the hostility has returned. One explanation is the sheer
speed at which multinationals have recently expanded abroad. This
has made them the most visible aspect of globalization, buying some
local firms and driving others out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Even to rich, well-run countries, their sheer size can seem
threatening. Thus the Irish sometimes fret about the fact that
foreign firms account for almost half of their country's employment
and two-thirds of its output; and Australians point nervously to
the fact that the ten biggest industrial multinationals each has
annual sales larger than their government's tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Such clout needs to be used with care, if it is not to be seen
as a threat to national sovereignty and democratic accountability.
</P>
<P>
   For example, countries may feel that their freedom to set taxes
as they wish is threatened by the ability of multinationals to
shift profits, or operations, from one country to another.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, too, a multinational does something stupid.
Nike, Shell, Enron, Monsanto, McDonald's: each has recently made
errors of judgment that united opposition at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   And multinationals face strong incentives to behave badly. Thus
those in the natural-resource and mining business often cozy up to
whichever regime is in power, however nasty, in order to protect
their investment.
</P>
<P>
   Those making consumer goods frequently flit to whichever country
offers the best deal on labor costs at the moment. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (500-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 450) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What most companies fear more than resentment abroad, though, is
the protest at home. Typically, they still employ two-thirds of
their work force and produce more than two-thirds of their output
in their home country which, in the case of 85 percent of
multinationals, is one of the wealthy members of the OECD.
</P>
<P>
   Here, they have been the easy targets of non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), which understand perfectly well the value to
themselves, in prestige and membership, of running a campaign which
succeeds in humbling a mighty corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, NGOs have been able to harness both the
discontent of those who believe globalization destroys jobs, and
the ill-focused unhappiness felt by the children of the prosperous
baby-boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   Just as John Kenneth Galbraith warned their parents that the
world would soon be run by huge, unaccountable corporations, so
this new generation seizes on the similar fears expressed in books
such as Naomi Klein's ``No Logo.''
</P>
<P>
   To the well-meaning, honorable folk who generally run
multinationals, all this is a travesty. They listen: even the World
Economic Forum has invited representatives of 15 NGOs to put their
case.
</P>
<P>
   They try: they set guidelines for dealing with environmental
safety and sexual harassment in countries where no such words exist
in the local tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Their corporate morality is a great deal better than that of the
average government: most would kick out a chairman who behaved like
Bill Clinton or Helmut Kohl. They are at least as accountable (to
their shareholders and the law) and a good deal more transparent
than the average NGO.
</P>
<P>
   Individual firms are as capable of doing harm as is any other
entity. But as a class the multinationals have a good story to
tell.
</P>
<P>
   In the rich world, according to OECD research, foreign firms pay
better than domestic ones and create new jobs faster. That is even
more true in poorer countries: in Turkey, for example, wages paid
by foreign firms are 124 percent above average and their work
forces have been expanding by 11.5 percent a year, compared with
0.6 percent in local firms.
</P>
<P>
   Big foreign firms are also the principal conduit for new
technologies, as is clear from the fact that 70 percent of all
international royalties on technology involve payments between
parent firms and their foreign affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   As for the environment, most research suggests that standards
tend to converge upwards, not downwards. In other words, the NGOs,
also as a class, often get their way.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigners need big business as a tic-bird needs a
wildebeest. By alighting on big companies, they can often force
through changes that would be hard to achieve through the political
process alone.
</P>
<P>
   They can claim a seat at international negotiations, even though
they represent nobody but their members. They can even influence
what happens in distant countries: it is easier to change things in
Nigeria by boycotting Shell than by lobbying the Nigerian
government.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the balance of power is not what it seems. Big
companies now come and go at lightning speed: one-third of the
giants in America's Fortune 500 in 1980 had lost their independence
by 1990 and another 40 percent were gone five years later. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,125) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Globalization is as much of a threat to lumbering giants as to
smaller folk, and often a boon for the nippy little firms that
create most of today's new employment and wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The merger waves that attract so much attention, and fear, more
often reflect defensive efforts by the corporate establishment than
the predatory acts of world-dominating devils.
</P>
<P>
   Multinationals should continue to listen, to try to do no harm,
to accept the responsibilities that go with size and wealth. Yet,
in the main, they should be seen as a powerful force for good. They
spread wealth, work, technologies that raise living standards and
better ways of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps if a few bosses took to the streets with placards, that
message might more readily get across. &QL;

<P>
   Take the bosses of the world's 1,000 largest companies,
accounting for four-fifths of world industrial output, and 33
national leaders, including the president of the United States.
Assemble them in a secluded Swiss ski resort, and then surround
them with gun-toting police.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder that the annual meeting of the World Economic
Forum in Davos this week has become, to some, a sign that there is
a global economic conspiracy perpetrated by the white men in dark
suits who run the world's multinational corporations?
</P>
<P>
   Many people _ and not just the folk with ponytails and placards
who disrupted last December's meeting of the World Trade
Organization in Seattle _ now think of multinationals as more
powerful than nation states, and see them as bent on destroying
livelihoods, the environment, left-wing political opposition and
anything else that stands in the way of their profits.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is new. Three decades ago, multinationals were
already widely denounced as big, irresponsible, monopolistic
monsters.
</P>
<P>
   But they then went through a period of being sneered at as
yesterday's clumsy conglomerates, before being lauded in the 1990s
(including by Third-World leaders in Davos) as the bringers of
foreign capital, technology and know-how.
</P>
<P>
   Yet now the hostility has returned. One explanation is the sheer
speed at which multinationals have recently expanded abroad. This
has made them the most visible aspect of globalization, buying some
local firms and driving others out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Even to rich, well-run countries, their sheer size can seem
threatening. Thus the Irish sometimes fret about the fact that
foreign firms account for almost half of their country's employment
and two-thirds of its output; and Australians point nervously to
the fact that the ten biggest industrial multinationals each has
annual sales larger than their government's tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Such clout needs to be used with care, if it is not to be seen
as a threat to national sovereignty and democratic accountability.
</P>
<P>
   For example, countries may feel that their freedom to set taxes
as they wish is threatened by the ability of multinationals to
shift profits, or operations, from one country to another.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, too, a multinational does something stupid.
Nike, Shell, Enron, Monsanto, McDonald's: each has recently made
errors of judgment that united opposition at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   And multinationals face strong incentives to behave badly. Thus
those in the natural-resource and mining business often cozy up to
whichever regime is in power, however nasty, in order to protect
their investment.
</P>
<P>
   Those making consumer goods frequently flit to whichever country
offers the best deal on labor costs at the moment. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (500-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 450) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What most companies fear more than resentment abroad, though, is
the protest at home. Typically, they still employ two-thirds of
their work force and produce more than two-thirds of their output
in their home country which, in the case of 85 percent of
multinationals, is one of the wealthy members of the OECD.
</P>
<P>
   Here, they have been the easy targets of non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), which understand perfectly well the value to
themselves, in prestige and membership, of running a campaign which
succeeds in humbling a mighty corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, NGOs have been able to harness both the
discontent of those who believe globalization destroys jobs, and
the ill-focused unhappiness felt by the children of the prosperous
baby-boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   Just as John Kenneth Galbraith warned their parents that the
world would soon be run by huge, unaccountable corporations, so
this new generation seizes on the similar fears expressed in books
such as Naomi Klein's ``No Logo.''
</P>
<P>
   To the well-meaning, honorable folk who generally run
multinationals, all this is a travesty. They listen: even the World
Economic Forum has invited representatives of 15 NGOs to put their
case.
</P>
<P>
   They try: they set guidelines for dealing with environmental
safety and sexual harassment in countries where no such words exist
in the local tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Their corporate morality is a great deal better than that of the
average government: most would kick out a chairman who behaved like
Bill Clinton or Helmut Kohl. They are at least as accountable (to
their shareholders and the law) and a good deal more transparent
than the average NGO.
</P>
<P>
   Individual firms are as capable of doing harm as is any other
entity. But as a class the multinationals have a good story to
tell.
</P>
<P>
   In the rich world, according to OECD research, foreign firms pay
better than domestic ones and create new jobs faster. That is even
more true in poorer countries: in Turkey, for example, wages paid
by foreign firms are 124 percent above average and their work
forces have been expanding by 11.5 percent a year, compared with
0.6 percent in local firms.
</P>
<P>
   Big foreign firms are also the principal conduit for new
technologies, as is clear from the fact that 70 percent of all
international royalties on technology involve payments between
parent firms and their foreign affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   As for the environment, most research suggests that standards
tend to converge upwards, not downwards. In other words, the NGOs,
also as a class, often get their way.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigners need big business as a tic-bird needs a
wildebeest. By alighting on big companies, they can often force
through changes that would be hard to achieve through the political
process alone.
</P>
<P>
   They can claim a seat at international negotiations, even though
they represent nobody but their members. They can even influence
what happens in distant countries: it is easier to change things in
Nigeria by boycotting Shell than by lobbying the Nigerian
government.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the balance of power is not what it seems. Big
companies now come and go at lightning speed: one-third of the
giants in America's Fortune 500 in 1980 had lost their independence
by 1990 and another 40 percent were gone five years later. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,125) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Globalization is as much of a threat to lumbering giants as to
smaller folk, and often a boon for the nippy little firms that
create most of today's new employment and wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The merger waves that attract so much attention, and fear, more
often reflect defensive efforts by the corporate establishment than
the predatory acts of world-dominating devils.
</P>
<P>
   Multinationals should continue to listen, to try to do no harm,
to accept the responsibilities that go with size and wealth. Yet,
in the main, they should be seen as a powerful force for good. They
spread wealth, work, technologies that raise living standards and
better ways of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps if a few bosses took to the streets with placards, that
message might more readily get across. &QL;

USC FOOTBALL GETS THREE COMMITMENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC's football recruiting class took a big leap
forward Friday when the Trojans secured three oral commitments, led
by prep All-American strong safety Matt Grootegoed of Mater Dei
High in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   Grootegoed (5-foot-11, 220 pounds) selected USC over UCLA and
Michigan. His high school coach, Bruce Rollinson, said he is the
best player ever to attend Mater Dei.
</P>
<P>
   Another highly regarded player, defensive lineman Nathan Goodson
of Temescal Canyon High, also committed, along with junior college
tight end Doyal Butler of Mesa (Ariz.) Community College.
</P>
<P>
   Goodson (6-5, 265) selected USC over Arizona and is considered
one of the top players in the state at his position. Butler (6-5,
220) originally signed with Purdue two years before transferring
back home to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Rancho Cucamonga linebacker Traison Lewis has
reaffirmed his commitment to USC after making visits to other
schools, including Wisconsin. USC now has 21 commitments.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans remain in the running for several top uncommitted
players ,including San Diego Mira Mesa teammates Teyo Johnson
(quarterback) and Amon Gordon (linebacker), Oxnard wide receiver
Keary Colbert, Fresno City College tailback Maurice Morris and
Notre Dame of Sherman Oaks defensive lineman Travis Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett and his staff visited Gordon on Friday
night.

<TEXT>
<P>
   These days the surprises in American politics all seem to come
from the right.
</P>
<P>
   It was surprising enough that the animatronic Steve Forbes
should have garnered 30 percent of the vote in Iowa. It is even
more surprising that the next name on the list, ahead of two of the
country's most distinguished senators, was that of a black man who
has never held elective office.
</P>
<P>
   After all, publishing-billionaire Forbes has been carpet-bombing
the state with dollar bills since 1996. Alan Keyes, a member of
that rarest of breeds, hard-rightists of color, has nothing to
offer but himself.
</P>
<P>
   A fortnight ago nobody would have predicted the Keyes boom. But
since then 4,000 volunteers have signed up with his campaign and
ululating crowds have started to appear wherever he speaks.
</P>
<P>
   This is unlikely to stop with Iowa. In a straw poll at the
Southern Republican Leadership Conference on Jan. 22, Keyes came
second to George Bush for the presidency (albeit by a modest 8
percent of the vote to a thumping 79 percent) and second to
Elizabeth Dole for the vice-presidency.
</P>
<P>
   A Zogby poll on Jan. 25 showed Keyes in a statistical draw with
Forbes for third place in New Hampshire. Which is all very
peculiar, given that Keyes makes an even odder politician than the
blink-free billionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is merely gauche when it comes to dealing with the press.
Keyes is ferocious.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him some trite question about his favorite dessert (apple
pie with a crumbly crust, for the record) and he is likely to
accuse you of moral and intellectual bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Praise him for his silver tongue and he is likely to accuse you
of racism.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes can even be tough on his supporters. During a recent rally
he ordered his fans to stop applauding. ``I've seen it all
before,'' he thundered. ``People stand up and applaud for things
and say they believe them. And then they go out and they cast their
vote in ways calculated to do God knows what.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes is a man of contradictions: a Roman Catholic who draws
much of his support from evangelicals; an opponent of multilateral
institutions who puts great store on being called ambassador, a
title he earned while working at UNESCO; and a conservative who
plays the race card with even more enthusiasm than Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the presidential debates he addressed George W. as
``Massa Bush'' to ridicule his timidity on taxes. When a chat-show
host praised him for his eloquence he likened the compliment to
saying, ``Oh, he dances real well.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is he shy when it comes to direct action. Four years ago a
television network in Atlanta made the mistake of restricting a
televised Republican debate to the four leading candidates. The
ambassador, who was then making his first bid for the presidency,
set up a campsite outside the studio and stormed it repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassment of seeing the country's only black
presidential candidate carted off to prison in handcuffs so
traumatized the networks that they are never likely to make the
same mistake again.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, Keyes is an intellectual in a party that is
profoundly suspicious of any ideas that do not lead to tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just that he has a PhD in political theory from
Harvard University (where, incidentally, he shared a room with a
conservative pundit, Bill Kristol). It is also that he cares so
visibly about ideas. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He regards the time he spent studying political theory with
Allan Bloom as a life-transforming experience, and the spirit of
the author of ``The Closing of the American Mind'' can be detected
in almost everything he says.
</P>
<P>
   Most politicians like to relate abstract questions to concrete
problems. Keyes is incapable of hearing a concrete problem (a case
of flu? a burst water main?) without thinking about its abstract
significance. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So why is the ambassador such a hit with the right? The simple
answer is that he is a mesmerizing speaker, a man who can hold his
audience spellbound for hours without the benefit of a note.
</P>
<P>
   But before Keyes eviscerates us for racism, we should add that
his success depends as much on content as on performance. Keyes is
as vehement in his opposition to abortion as anybody. He wears a
gold lapel-pin in the shape of a ten-week-old fetus's feet.
</P>
<P>
   But he rests his case both on the Bible and, more originally, on
the Declaration of Independence, arguing that you need to apply the
declaration to unborn children in exactly the same way as Lincoln
applied it to slaves.
</P>
<P>
   He weaves his anti-abortion sentiment into a majestic
disquisition on the nature of freedom. The cheapening of life
inevitably leads to the corrosion of liberty, he argues; and, as
the descendant of slaves, he has more interest than most in saving
America from ``the howling moral void.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 50 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what Bloom would have thought of his protege's
decision to engage in a bit of body surfing this weekend, to the
raucous accompaniment of Rage Against the Machine. But it is
understandable that Keyes should be elated after so many years in
the wilderness. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,125) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He will now have several months to do what he likes doing best:
exercise his rhetorical gifts before a national audience. There is
no reason why he should not go on. But is what is good for Keyes
good for the conservative movement?
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the ambassador is that the very qualities that
endear him to true believers _ his silver tongue and moral
absolutism _ tend to terrify the rest of America.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes may be perfectly logical when he calls for the complete
abolition of the ``slave'' income tax (why bother with
half-measures like the flat tax?) or when he argues that the
division between church and state has no basis in the Constitution.
But most Americans smell extremism.
</P>
<P>
   The simultaneous rise of Keyes and Forbes has not only left the
right divided. It has left it divided between two leaders who, for
very different reasons, have precious little chance of breaking
into mainstream politics.
</P>
<P>
   Enoch Powell, a British politician to whom Keyes bears a
remarkable resemblance, once observed that ``all political careers
end in failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes's own career has never been more successful than it is at
the moment. The worry, from the point of view of his legacy, is
that his rise is both a symbol and a guarantee of the
marginalization of the conservative movement that he loves. &QL;

absolutism _ tend to terrify the rest of America.

half-measures like the flat tax?) or when he argues that the

<TEXT>
<P>
   These days the surprises in American politics all seem to come
from the right.
</P>
<P>
   It was surprising enough that the animatronic Steve Forbes
should have garnered 30 percent of the vote in Iowa. It is even
more surprising that the next name on the list, ahead of two of the
country's most distinguished senators, was that of a black man who
has never held elective office.
</P>
<P>
   After all, publishing-billionaire Forbes has been carpet-bombing
the state with dollar bills since 1996. Alan Keyes, a member of
that rarest of breeds, hard-rightists of color, has nothing to
offer but himself.
</P>
<P>
   A fortnight ago nobody would have predicted the Keyes boom. But
since then 4,000 volunteers have signed up with his campaign and
ululating crowds have started to appear wherever he speaks.
</P>
<P>
   This is unlikely to stop with Iowa. In a straw poll at the
Southern Republican Leadership Conference on Jan. 22, Keyes came
second to George Bush for the presidency (albeit by a modest 8
percent of the vote to a thumping 79 percent) and second to
Elizabeth Dole for the vice-presidency.
</P>
<P>
   A Zogby poll on Jan. 25 showed Keyes in a statistical draw with
Forbes for third place in New Hampshire. Which is all very
peculiar, given that Keyes makes an even odder politician than the
blink-free billionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is merely gauche when it comes to dealing with the press.
Keyes is ferocious.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him some trite question about his favorite dessert (apple
pie with a crumbly crust, for the record) and he is likely to
accuse you of moral and intellectual bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Praise him for his silver tongue and he is likely to accuse you
of racism.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes can even be tough on his supporters. During a recent rally
he ordered his fans to stop applauding. ``I've seen it all
before,'' he thundered. ``People stand up and applaud for things
and say they believe them. And then they go out and they cast their
vote in ways calculated to do God knows what.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes is a man of contradictions: a Roman Catholic who draws
much of his support from evangelicals; an opponent of multilateral
institutions who puts great store on being called ambassador, a
title he earned while working at UNESCO; and a conservative who
plays the race card with even more enthusiasm than Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the presidential debates he addressed George W. as
``Massa Bush'' to ridicule his timidity on taxes. When a chat-show
host praised him for his eloquence he likened the compliment to
saying, ``Oh, he dances real well.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is he shy when it comes to direct action. Four years ago a
television network in Atlanta made the mistake of restricting a
televised Republican debate to the four leading candidates. The
ambassador, who was then making his first bid for the presidency,
set up a campsite outside the studio and stormed it repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassment of seeing the country's only black
presidential candidate carted off to prison in handcuffs so
traumatized the networks that they are never likely to make the
same mistake again.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, Keyes is an intellectual in a party that is
profoundly suspicious of any ideas that do not lead to tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just that he has a PhD in political theory from
Harvard University (where, incidentally, he shared a room with a
conservative pundit, Bill Kristol). It is also that he cares so
visibly about ideas. &QL;

TIMES CO. PLANS STOCK ISSUE TO TRACK ITS INTERNET ASSETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER and FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times Co. announced plans Friday to issue a new
class of stock that will track the value of the company's Internet
properties. In doing so it becomes one of the first newspaper
companies moving to capitalize on investor enthusiasm for the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The cash raised from the offering will be used to finance the
investment needs of the Internet operation, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Trading in the new stock is intended to reflect the results of
the Internet operations of the company _ operations that have
experienced a rapid rise in revenue, and losses, in recent years.
For the nine months ended last Sept. 30, the filing said, Times
Company Digital, the Internet division, had $15.3 million in
revenue, up 48 percent from the corresponding period of 1998, and
net losses of $11.7 million, up 108 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission Friday showed that like many Internet companies, Times
Company Digital has not shown a profit and ``expects to incur
substantial net losses for the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's filing did not indicate how many shares would be
sold or at what price, although in calculating the filing fee it
used a figure of $100 million to be raised. Nor did it say what
part of the new stock _ to be called class C _ would be offered to
the public and what part would be retained by the company. All
proceeds of the offering will be allocated to Times Company
Digital.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking stock is designed to be valued in relation to specific
assets of a corporation _ in this case, the Internet properties of
the Times Co., including nytimes.com, boston.com, golfdigest.com,
winetoday.com and abuzz.com, a site that was introduced this month.
</P>
<P>
   Several other newspaper companies, including Knight Ridder and
Tribune Co., have each isolated their Internet assets in a single
division, laying the groundwork for later public offerings if they
choose to move in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Co. said it had reserved a part of the new class C
shares to be sold at the initial public offering price to its
directors, its employees and holders of class B shares, the
controlling stock that is held primarily by members of the extended
family of the chairman of the company, Arthur Sulzberger Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Although the offering was evidently aimed at capturing some of
the high valuations for Internet-related shares _ and at giving the
company the ability to use stock options to compensate employees _
it was announced on a day when Internet stocks performed poorly.
The Street.com Internet index fell 5.8 percent, though it is still
up more than 500 percent since the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The new shares, to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange
under the ticker symbol TCD, will pay no dividend, the filing said,
although the company's other shares will continue to pay dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Although tracking stock trades like normal common stock, it is
legally different. Times Company Digital will remain part of the
Times Co., with a 10-year license to use the trademarks and news
reports generated by The New York Times, The Boston Globe and other
subsidiaries of the Times Co.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Times Company Digital will pay the company $5 million
a year, a fee that will rise once revenue tops $50 million. The
maximum fee will be $17 million plus 5 percent of revenue above
$200 million.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made after the end of the day's trading in
New York Times class A shares. Those shares fell 68.75 cents, to
$46.3125, in New York Stock Exchange trading.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Rich Fine, an analyst for Merrill Lynch, said Friday
night that the prospects for Times Company Digital ``are actually
pretty good,'' pointing to the 10 million users who have registered
at The New York Times on the Web. Registration, a strategy designed
by Martin A. Nisenholtz, the chief executive of Times Company
Digital, gives advertisers details about the audience they hope to
reach.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fine added, however, that balancing the needs of two groups
of shareholders can be tricky. ``You have to keep them both
happy,'' she said. ``Sometimes there are difficult decisions you
have to make.''

   DELHI _ Investors seeking opportunities in developing countries
count a large healthy population as a plus. If they specialize in
testing drugs and other medical therapies, the lure may be a lot of
the not-so-healthy.
</P>
<P>
   India has such people in industrial quantities, and
contract-research organizations (CROs), which undertake clinical
trials and other services for pharmaceutical companies, are
beginning to notice.
</P>
<P>
   Their activities are one of the odder ways in which India is
making more of a mark in services than it ever has in the export of
manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
   Quintiles Transnational, a big CRO based in North Carolina, is
one pioneer. Its Indian joint venture began three years ago and now
has a staff of 40 and a score of customers, mainly American and
European pharmaceutical and biotech firms.
</P>
<P>
   Covance, a CRO from New Jersey, has started clinical trials in
India and may expand its operations.
</P>
<P>
   Indian companies have also spotted an opportunity. Nicholas
Piramal, a pharmaceutical company in Mumbai, recently hired a chief
executive for a new clinical-trials business that it hopes will
have revenues of 100 million-120 million Indian rupees ($2.3
million-2.8 million) within three years.
</P>
<P>
   Max India, which among other activities makes bulk
pharmaceuticals, has signed a deal with an affiliate of Harvard
Medical School to conduct clinical trials in India and in other
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   The potential return on investment in India's infrastructure for
conducting clinical trials ``is tremendous,'' says Renu Gupta,
Covance's vice-president of global safety and medical therapeutics.
</P>
<P>
   The advantages look so obvious it seems a wonder that more
companies have not entered the market sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Discovering and developing a new drug is expensive; the industry
claims to spend as much as $500 million to bring a new molecule to
market. A big chunk, perhaps a third of the total, goes towards
clinical trials. Much of that is spent just before seeking
regulatory approval on ``phase-three'' trials that use lots of
human subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Since the life of a patent begins to ebb away from the moment it
is filed, near the start of the entire process, each day saved on
testing can bring millions of dollars in extra revenues to the
patent's owners.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, the biggest drug-consuming countries, the
United States, Japan and the European Union, agreed on common
standards for running clinical trials. In principle, America's Food
and Drug Administration should now accept data from a trial
anywhere in the world that meets those standards.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical trials in India ought to be cheaper and faster than
those in developed markets. CROs can hire researchers, nurses and
computer staff at less than a third of western wages.
</P>
<P>
   India's billion potential guinea pigs suffer not just from
tropical and poor-country diseases such as malaria and
tuberculosis, but increasingly from ailments such as cancer, heart
disease and AIDS, which trouble rich countries.
</P>
<P>
   Though Indians are spread out and mainly live in rural areas,
people with serious ailments flock to advanced hospitals in cities,
which makes them accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Ferzaan Engineer, the boss of Quintiles's venture, says that for
some diseases this can dramatically cut the time needed to bring
new therapies to market. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 375 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 525) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until now, though, multinational drug companies and the CROs
that work for them have preferred to test therapies closer to home.
In part this is because large trials are also marketing efforts:
doctors who test the drugs are more likely to prescribe them, and
drug firms prefer that their patients be rich.
</P>
<P>
   When pharmaceutical firms have looked further afield, it has
been to countries such as Brazil and Turkey, which offer more
sophisticated health-care facilities and higher incomes than India.
Even China has attracted more interest, despite India's
English-speaking doctors and technicians.
</P>
<P>
   But India itself shares some of the blame for this neglect.
Until recently, Indian clinical trials mostly tested knock-off
versions of western products for the local market. India thus lacks
the institutions, know-how and procedures that make internationally
acceptable trials possible.
</P>
<P>
   The country's excellent doctors are said to have an
old-fashioned regard for their own authority, which can interfere
with giving patients the sort of information they need to
participate in trials.
</P>
<P>
   Patients may disappear to their villages in mid-trial. Few
health workers know how to keep records as fastidiously as
international trials demand.
</P>
<P>
   The trials infrastructure, says Dr. Gupta, is ``embryonic.''
</P>
<P>
   Firms also worry about bureaucracy. Indian regulations make it
difficult to transport biological samples; the process of getting
government approval for a trial can take up to two years,
eliminating the head-start that pharmaceutical firms hope to get
from working in India.
</P>
<P>
   Swati Piramal, Nicholas Piramal's chief science officer, says
regulatory delays are ``the single biggest hurdle.'' Just as bad,
India does not yet fully protect pharmaceutical patents, which
makes drug firms understandably nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the ticklish issue of multinationals testing drugs
in a poor country. Many trial participants are too unlettered to
understand what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arun Bal, head of the Association for Consumers Action on
Safety and Health in Mumbai, alleges that subjects are often asked
to sign consent forms in English and that women are pressured into
signing by their families.
</P>
<P>
   Many hospitals lack independent ethics committees, which are
supposed to look after the welfare of patients participating in
trials. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Few Indians will be able to afford the drugs once they come to
market, especially after patent rules are tightened up. Yet,
properly monitored, international trials ought to improve India's
health-care standards.
</P>

   DELHI _ Investors seeking opportunities in developing countries
count a large healthy population as a plus. If they specialize in
testing drugs and other medical therapies, the lure may be a lot of
the not-so-healthy.
</P>
<P>
   India has such people in industrial quantities, and
contract-research organizations (CROs), which undertake clinical
trials and other services for pharmaceutical companies, are
beginning to notice.
</P>
<P>
   Their activities are one of the odder ways in which India is
making more of a mark in services than it ever has in the export of
manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
   Quintiles Transnational, a big CRO based in North Carolina, is
one pioneer. Its Indian joint venture began three years ago and now
has a staff of 40 and a score of customers, mainly American and
European pharmaceutical and biotech firms.
</P>
<P>
   Covance, a CRO from New Jersey, has started clinical trials in
India and may expand its operations.
</P>
<P>
   Indian companies have also spotted an opportunity. Nicholas
Piramal, a pharmaceutical company in Mumbai, recently hired a chief
executive for a new clinical-trials business that it hopes will
have revenues of 100 million-120 million Indian rupees ($2.3
million-2.8 million) within three years.
</P>
<P>
   Max India, which among other activities makes bulk
pharmaceuticals, has signed a deal with an affiliate of Harvard
Medical School to conduct clinical trials in India and in other
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   The potential return on investment in India's infrastructure for
conducting clinical trials ``is tremendous,'' says Renu Gupta,
Covance's vice-president of global safety and medical therapeutics.
</P>
<P>
   The advantages look so obvious it seems a wonder that more
companies have not entered the market sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Discovering and developing a new drug is expensive; the industry
claims to spend as much as $500 million to bring a new molecule to
market. A big chunk, perhaps a third of the total, goes towards
clinical trials. Much of that is spent just before seeking
regulatory approval on ``phase-three'' trials that use lots of
human subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Since the life of a patent begins to ebb away from the moment it
is filed, near the start of the entire process, each day saved on
testing can bring millions of dollars in extra revenues to the
patent's owners.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, the biggest drug-consuming countries, the
United States, Japan and the European Union, agreed on common
standards for running clinical trials. In principle, America's Food
and Drug Administration should now accept data from a trial
anywhere in the world that meets those standards.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical trials in India ought to be cheaper and faster than
those in developed markets. CROs can hire researchers, nurses and
computer staff at less than a third of western wages.
</P>
<P>
   India's billion potential guinea pigs suffer not just from
tropical and poor-country diseases such as malaria and
tuberculosis, but increasingly from ailments such as cancer, heart
disease and AIDS, which trouble rich countries.
</P>
<P>
   Though Indians are spread out and mainly live in rural areas,
people with serious ailments flock to advanced hospitals in cities,
which makes them accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Ferzaan Engineer, the boss of Quintiles's venture, says that for
some diseases this can dramatically cut the time needed to bring
new therapies to market. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 375 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 525) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until now, though, multinational drug companies and the CROs
that work for them have preferred to test therapies closer to home.
In part this is because large trials are also marketing efforts:
doctors who test the drugs are more likely to prescribe them, and
drug firms prefer that their patients be rich.
</P>
<P>
   When pharmaceutical firms have looked further afield, it has
been to countries such as Brazil and Turkey, which offer more
sophisticated health-care facilities and higher incomes than India.
Even China has attracted more interest, despite India's
English-speaking doctors and technicians.
</P>
<P>
   But India itself shares some of the blame for this neglect.
Until recently, Indian clinical trials mostly tested knock-off
versions of western products for the local market. India thus lacks
the institutions, know-how and procedures that make internationally
acceptable trials possible.
</P>
<P>
   The country's excellent doctors are said to have an
old-fashioned regard for their own authority, which can interfere
with giving patients the sort of information they need to
participate in trials.
</P>
<P>
   Patients may disappear to their villages in mid-trial. Few
health workers know how to keep records as fastidiously as
international trials demand.
</P>
<P>
   The trials infrastructure, says Dr. Gupta, is ``embryonic.''
</P>
<P>
   Firms also worry about bureaucracy. Indian regulations make it
difficult to transport biological samples; the process of getting
government approval for a trial can take up to two years,
eliminating the head-start that pharmaceutical firms hope to get
from working in India.
</P>
<P>
   Swati Piramal, Nicholas Piramal's chief science officer, says
regulatory delays are ``the single biggest hurdle.'' Just as bad,
India does not yet fully protect pharmaceutical patents, which
makes drug firms understandably nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the ticklish issue of multinationals testing drugs
in a poor country. Many trial participants are too unlettered to
understand what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arun Bal, head of the Association for Consumers Action on
Safety and Health in Mumbai, alleges that subjects are often asked
to sign consent forms in English and that women are pressured into
signing by their families.
</P>
<P>
   Many hospitals lack independent ethics committees, which are
supposed to look after the welfare of patients participating in
trials. &QL;

BUDDHISM NEARS MAINSTREAM IN U.S., AUTHOR SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The principles of Buddhism have long intrigued American
intellectuals, back to the days of Henry David Thoreau and the
Transcendentalists a century and a half ago. Among spiritual
seekers, the dharma got a boost in the 1950s, when Zen attracted
the interest of Beat generation figures such as Jack Kerouac and
Allen Ginsberg.
</P>
<P>
   But these days _ after a long increase in native-born converts
and an influx of hundreds of thousands of Asian immigrants who have
established their own temples _ it may be worth asking whether
Buddhism has become much more a part of America's increasingly
pluralistic religious mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   That question was put to Richard Hughes Seager, an associate
professor of religious studies at Hamilton College in Clinton,
N.Y., and the author of a new book, ``Buddhism in America,''
published by Columbia University Press, that is part of a series of
concise but detailed studies of religion in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Seager said he thought Buddhism in the United
States could no longer be described as an ``alternative'' faith
primarily attracting seekers. ``If you go through the immigrant
communities,'' he said, ``you're going to find people who really
want mainstream status, who are working hard to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Given how decentralized and varied Buddhist groups are in the
United States, comprising different traditions and ethnic groups,
it is not easy to know how many practitioners there are. Seager
said research suggested that 2 million was a safe estimate, with
immigrants outnumbering converts 3 to 1. (If that is the case, then
there are nearly as many Buddhists in this country as there are
Episcopalians.)
</P>
<P>
   But if immigrants are the majority, the popular literature on
Buddhism is written by converts. ``If you go out and say, `I want
to learn something about Buddhism in America,' you will find
hundreds and hundreds of books by Euro-Americans,'' Seager said.
``You have to work very, very hard getting beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the best-known exponent of Buddhism for many Americans is
a frequent visitor to the United States: the Dalai Lama, the exiled
spiritual leader of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   With his outspoken emphasis on peace, the Dalai Lama has, in
effect, ``done so much good public relations for Buddhism,'' Seager
said. ``All of my undergraduates have heard of the Dalai Lama.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviving a Dialogue
</P>
<P>
   The past year proved an important one for Christian churches
reaching major ecumenical agreements. In August, for example, the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America voted to enter into full
communion with the Episcopal Church, a pact less than a merger, but
one that would allow the churches to share clergy and collaborate
on social service projects.
</P>
<P>
   This week came the news _ notable, but less momentous _ that the
Orthodox churches in the United States were reviving a
long-suspended ecumenical dialogue with Episcopalians.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups have an old friendship, dating to the days when
some Orthodox immigrants from Eastern Europe worshiped in Episcopal
parishes before they established their own churches.
</P>
<P>
   But discussions about common ground collapsed in 1991 when
Archbishop Iakovos, then leader of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese,
suspended the dialogue, citing differences over ordaining women as
priests (something the Episcopalians do and the Orthodox do not)
and ordaining noncelibate gays (which some Episcopal bishops do,
while the Orthodox oppose it).
</P>
<P>
   In resuming the dialogue, both sides are expected to focus on
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Robert Stephanopoulos, dean of the Greek archdiocese's
Holy Trinity Cathedral in New York, said talk would center on
``reviewing a lot of the issues we have dealt with in the past,
building on consensus and avoiding those issues that brought us to
a closure.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching Out in Los Angeles
</P>
<P>
   An unusual note in interfaith relations was struck this month in
Los Angeles when a Roman Catholic priest, a Mormon bishop, the
rabbis at a Conservative synagogue and the head of an Islamic
center decided that they would sponsor a billboard at a busy
intersection, Santa Monica and Westwood Boulevards.
</P>
<P>
   In a variation of a famous phrase by Rene Descartes, the
17th-century French philosopher and scientist, the sign proclaims:
``I think, therefore I pray.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Sherre Zwelling, one of the rabbis at Sinai Temple, said
the idea was to promote interfaith cooperation. She said those
participating ``would love to see'' the idea reach beyond Los
Angeles.

<P>
   NEWPORT, N.H. _ A day after some of his top aides said he was
likely to attack Vice President Al Gore for campaign finance
abuses, former Sen. Bill Bradley held back his toughest punches
Friday and instead accused Gore of being dishonest on the issues of
abortion and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   But later in the evening, Bradley talked in general terms about
the embarrassment the Democratic Party suffered from the
Clinton-Gore campaign's aggressive fund raising in 1996. He did not
mention the vice president by name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to face up to the fund-raising scandals of 1996,''
Bradley told a gathering of New Hampshire Democrats Friday night.
``They were disgraceful for both Republicans and Democrats, but
they were most embarrassing for Democrats, because we're the party
of the little guy. We're the reform party.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, at an event intended to appeal to New Hampshire's large
number of independent voters, Bradley picked up the endorsement of
former Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut, a Republican
turned independent. He then proceeded to attack Gore's integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do great things if we don't have a politics that drags
us down,'' Bradley told a crowd of more than 250 people that
gathered in an old opera house here, just four days from New
Hampshire's Democratic primary, the first in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley stopped short of mentioning Gore's aggressive fund
raising for the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996, as some of his aides
had predicted he would. Many people consider the issue to be Gore's
greatest political liability, largely because Attorney General
Janet Reno has investigated fund-raising phone calls made by
President Clinton and Gore from the White House. She decided there
was no evidence of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to avoid criticizing Gore about those events
reflected disagreements among Bradley's top advisers over how to
approach a potentially potent, and contentious, line of attack
against the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   It also suggested that Bradley's advisers, and Bradley himself,
remain uncertain about how far they want to take their newly
aggressive attacks on the vice president, which began just this
week.
</P>
<P>
   In discussions that went late into Thursday night, some advisers
argued that Weicker's announcement would be an ideal time to raise
the fund-raising issue. But others said it would muddy the message
of the event: an appeal by Weicker to independent voters. Bradley
himself was involved in those discussions, the aides said.
</P>
<P>
   While the advisers decided against mentioning Gore in
criticizing the 1996 fund raising, they said Friday day that
Bradley might yet attack the vice president on the issue this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gore said Friday that his campaign would refrain
from attacks. Arriving in New Hampshire after a trip to Washington
for the State of the Union address, Gore said, ``I'm going to
emphasize the positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, who is trying in these final days to win
over New Hampshire's independent voters, made almost no reference
to the president's address. But he did seek credit for being part
of an administration that has overseen a near-record economic
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was asked in local television interviews about Bradley's
stepped-up aggressiveness in attacking him. But after months of
insinuations that Bradley's proposed economic program would blow
the surplus and risk taking the country into recession, he was
determined Friday to stay above the fray.
</P>
<P>
   ``See,'' Gore said, ``I'm not going to get down to that level.
I'm going to continue to emphasize a positive agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said repeatedly that the voters did not want to hear
negative attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Bradley used his New Hampshire campaign
appearances to accuse Gore of being untruthful about three issues
of great importance to many Democratic voters; abortion, health
care and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   At a morning event in Lebanon, Bradley asserted that Gore had
used ``tricky'' words to mislead voters into thinking that he
supported the licensing of all owners of hand guns, when he had
actually called for licensing only new buyers.
</P>
<P>
   And he asserted that Gore has said he supports universal health
care without offering such a plan. Gore contends that his proposal
for expanding health care would cover nearly as many people as
Bradley's plan, and at a much lower cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you listen to Al Gore speak, you have to listen
very carefully,'' Bradley said. ``Because old politics uses words
in a very tricky manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in response to a reporter's question, Bradley asserted
that Gore had been dishonest about changes in his views on
abortion. Gore says he has always supported a woman's right to an
abortion, but Bradley asserts that the vice president was once an
opponent of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad his position evolved,'' Bradley said. But, he added,
``Why does his camp say he's always held this position?''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign also began running a television commercial
Friday describing him as the only presidential candidate who has
consistently supported a woman's right to an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign countered by releasing a letter signed by more
than 40 Democratic members of Congress vouching for the vice
president's support of abortion rights and urging Bradley not to
create ``differences that do not exist'' between the two Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's appearance with Weicker was unabashedly aimed at
independent voters, who can vote in either the Democratic or
Republican primaries in New Hampshire. Political analysts say many
independent voters are wavering between Bradley and Sen. John
McCain, the Republican presidential contender.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Weicker urged those voters not to ``waste'' their
votes on the Republican. ``Do not confuse independence with the
Republican Party,'' he said. ``The only independent thinker and
actor is Bill Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference, Bradley said he thought President
Clinton's State of the Union speech on Thursday had been full of
good proposals. But he added that he was disappointed that it did
not include a call for universal health care.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 30)  
 (af)  
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh, the might-have-beens. Picture Thomas Middelhoff, chief
executive of Bertelsmann, on a global stage two weeks ago, sharing
a photogenic _ if stilted _ group hug and high-fives to celebrate
the stunning union of his German media conglomerate with America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, last week found a solitary Middelhoff marooned by a
snowstorm in his stark office on the 24th floor of the Bertelsmann
tower overlooking Times Square in Manhattan. In a hastily arranged
conference call, he resigned from America Online's board, prompted
by the company's announced merger with Bertelsmann's media
archrival, Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   The parting was friendly, even sentimental, by corporate
standards. Stephen M. Case, the chief executive of America Online,
said he would never forget how Middelhoff, as a rising Bertelsmann
official, had nurtured a struggling AOL with timely investments in
the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But Middelhoff _ a Dusseldorf altar boy turned
Concorde-commuting media titan _ had little time for wistfulness.
Though he still believes that Bertelsmann, the world's
fourth-largest media conglomerate, would have been the ``best
partner'' for AOL, Middelhoff, 46, professes no disappointment that
key members of the foundation that owns Bertelsmann refused to
surrender the 164-year-old company's independence.
</P>
<P>
   And, besides: Who has time for hypotheticals when your job is
achieving nothing less than cultural transformation _ on the
Internet's frantic schedule _ in a rigidly traditional corporation
with its heartbeat and headquarters in a small German city and with
78,000 employees around the world?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to reach every brain to explain that we have nothing
less than an industrial revolution,'' Middelhoff said in an
interview last week. ``That makes it necessary to change how we see
and run our business. That means speed is king. That means we have
to be decentralized on the one hand and also more corporate. We
have without any question a generational change at Bertelsmann.''
</P>
<P>
   Middelhoff's manner is so relentlessly cheerful that some
company executives joke that it must mask something sinister. But
his task is daunting. To compete in a landscape of exotic new media
hybrids like CBS-Viacom or AOL Time Warner _ the latter further
engorged by its deal last week to absorb the EMI Group's music
business _ he must reinvent the structure and customs of a global
empire made up of 600 separate businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In the 14 months since Middelhoff assumed leadership of
Bertelsmann, he has been a fervid evangelist, promoting the
necessity of increasing the pace _ and the risk-taking _ in
Bertelsmann's efforts to integrate its core music, magazine, book
publishing and printing businesses into the digital economy.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann, he says, must move like ``a fleet of fast,
maneuverable frigates'' _ instead of a huge ocean liner _ toward
his goal of digitizing every element of the company's sprawling
holdings, from the written word to distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be No. 1 in media e-commerce business,'' Middelhoff
said with a strong German accent. ``And from Bertelsmann's
perspective, it's more important for us than to own a share in
AOL.''
</P>
<P>
   With Time Warner's deal-making in the last two weeks,
Middelhoff's preaching has taken on a more urgent tone.
Bertelsmann, he said, intends to increase sharply its budget for
acquisitions _ in part by spinning off more of its Internet
properties, giving the company some of the cyberstock that is
today's media-deal currency.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the shopping spree, he said, will be to strengthen
Bertelsmann's position in magazine publishing, where it ranks No. 2
in the world, and in music, where the Time Warner-EMI deal leaves
it a badly trailing No. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say media executives like Middelhoff should be
focusing on deals that preserve access to online services _ deals,
say, like Time Warner's with America Online. ``They need to ensure
that they have access to distribution in the new economy, as well
as access to talent and capital in sufficient amounts, and the
ability to make decisions very quickly,'' said David Brodwin, an
associate partner at Andersen Consulting. ``Few have been able to
do this without partnering or acquiring.''
</P>
<P>
   Middelhoff said that he, too, was prepared to make deals with
Internet companies, but that for now his focus was gaining
dominance in media sectors, like music.
</P>
<P>
   There had been reports in London that Bertelsmann would make a
counteroffer for EMI's music business, but Middelhoff denied such
plans. Bertelsmann, he said, discussed a deal with EMI executives
in 1998, only to break off conversations because the price they
were demanding was too high _ and that price, he noted, was a
figure less than half of what Time Warner is paying to fold EMI's
music holdings into a 50-50 joint venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``So now the question is: Do we have the financial power to
develop our positions _ or, let me say, to protect them?''
Middelhoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Answering his own question, he said Bertelsmann was prepared to
take what for it would be a dramatic step to maintain its
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the decisive measure of success or failure for
Bertelsmann's companies has been a formula that some of its
American executives call the holy grail but in German is rendered
gesamtkapitalrendite _ the return on assets, or on total capital
employed.
</P>
<P>
   For almost two decades, the rate has been set at 15 percent, a
value established by Reinhard Mohn, a fourth-generation descendant
of the company's founder. Mohn, 78, created the contemporary
Bertelsmann, building the company from a publisher of Protestant
hymnals into a book-club powerhouse and now a multimedia giant.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Bertelsmann Foundation rejected a deal with
America Online in November, Middelhoff said Mohn _ who still serves
on the foundation's board _ decided in principle to reduce the
return he expects.
</P>
<P>
   The new figure hasn't been established, but relaxing the
standard will free yet more money for acquisitions, Middelhoff
said, ``depending on what dog comes along.'' Already, Bertelsmann
has budgeted at least 20 billion marks _ a little more than $10
billion _ for deal-making in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The company wants to deepen its pockets, too, by taking some
units public. Likely spinoffs this year are BOL.com, which in just
a year has become the No. 2 online bookseller in Europe, and Lycos
Europe, of which Bertelsmann owns 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   European newspapers have speculated that Bertelsmann will sell
to the public its 50 percent stake in AOL Europe, but Middelhoff
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a clear strategy. The entire Bertelsmann organization
got the wake-up call much earlier than any other media company,''
he said. ``We don't see any reason to face any disadvantage in our
style of organization _ as long as we are not sleepy and are
aggressive.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As chief executive since November 1998, Middelhoff if nothing
else lives at the pace he is convinced Bertelsmann must adopt if it
is to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   From offices at the company's headquarters in Gutersloh _ a city
of 100,000 on the edge of the Teutoburg Forest, about two hours
from Dusseldorf _ and his suite in Times Square, he presides over
the unwieldy conglomerate through travel so constant that he
sometimes wakes up wondering where he is.
</P>
<P>
   His international e-mail messages number about 120 a day; the
father of five, he also uses the keyboard to keep in touch with his
older children.
</P>
<P>
   When a hit-and-run skier smashed into him in the Italian Alps a
few weeks ago, Middelhoff continued his Paris-to-New York flights
with a broken collarbone. Some Bertelsmann executives say he roams
the globe at ``Thomas speed,'' his own personal time warp, but
others worry that he's charging ahead too quickly, leaving stunned
underlings trailing behind.
</P>
<P>
   He was chief executive-designate when Bertelsmann acquired
Random House early in 1998, solidifying its position as the largest
English-language publisher in the world. Later that year,
Middelhoff struck a deal to become partners in an online
bookselling venture in the United States with Barnes &AMP; Noble, after
briefly flirting with Amazon.com when his negotiations with Leonard
Riggio, Barnes &AMP; Noble's chief executive, grew testy.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he has been in the thick of negotiations to establish
a joint venture combining the titans of the book club business,
Time Warner's Book-of-the-Month Club and Bertelsmann's Doubleday
Direct.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the spate of deal-making has been Middelhoff's
calculated strategy to drive Bertelsmann deeper into digital
territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Barnesandnoble.com partnership, for example, enabled
Bertelsmann to scrap expensive plans to start its own online
bookstore in the United States; the company was also able to cash
in when part of the electronic bookseller was spun off in a public
stock offering. But the alliance has not been a perfect match. The
stock has drifted, and top officials, including the chief
executive, have swiftly shuffled in and out.
</P>
<P>
   Along with its investments in AOL Europe and Lycos Europe,
Bertelsmann has created a string of electronic bookstores called
BOL.com, with Web sites individually tailored for various European
countries. Recently, the company joined with Seagram to create
Getmusic.com, a Web site that promotes artists from the two
companies' labels and sells CDs online. And in Germany, Bertelsmann
created an electronic auction house called Andsold in just three
months last year.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, ``I would have said Bertelsmann was clearly ahead
of the pack with respect to the Internet,'' said Peter A. Kreisky,
a consultant for Mercer Management Consulting, which advises media
and entertainment companies. ``Bertelsmann got it very early on,
because of Thomas Middelhoff and only because of Thomas Middelhoff.
He integrated the Internet as an intrinsic part of every single
business.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Middelhoff's departure from the America Online board
and the transformation of AOL into a media rival, Bertelsmann may
have lost something indefinable, but crucial, Kreisky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What AOL did was give them a seat at the front of the train,
able to really view the track ahead without any filtering,'' he
said. ``They were standing next to the driver, and they could see
very clearly.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On a cool autumn night in Berlin, Middelhoff reveled in the new
media order. His driver and Mercedes awaited him outside a
painfully hip party at Dresdner Bahnhof, a train station
transformed for the evening with dangling chandeliers, shag rugs
and hooded male and female dancers in ice-blue leotards.
</P>
<P>
   He was almost giddy that night as he mingled among 1,200 guests
celebrating Bertelsmann's public stock offering for Pixelpark, a
Web site designer it had acquired. ``This is my world!'' he exulted
as he left the party. ``And do you understand that I like this
world?''
</P>
<P>
   Middelhoff had reached this universe on a career track as swift
as the pace he prizes in business.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Bertelsmann board skipped over a generation of
older executives and anointed him the company's next chief
executive. Eleven years earlier, he had signed on as a managing
assistant at the Mohndruck Graphische printing plant in Gutersloh.
He quickly rose to become the head of the Elsnerdruck printing
plant, where, in an act that has become company legend, he fired
his predecessor, who was planning to help him in the transition.
</P>
<P>
   Middelhoff's roots are in Westphalia, in northern Germany, a
rural area once known for its thriving textile factories. Battered
by competition with Asian plants, many of those factories closed in
the 1980s, including his father's business; his mother is a
physician-turned-homemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career, he drew the attention of top executives; by
the late 1980s, some German followers of the company said, his name
appeared on a list of 10 potential successors to Mark Wossner, the
chief executive since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, he assured his rise in the leadership through a
risky bet in 1995, early in the digital epoch.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of investing with Microsoft to start an online service
in Europe, Middelhoff negotiated a deal to acquire a 14.9 percent
stake in America Online. The Bertelsmann board balked at that deal
_ some in the company derisively referred to it as ``Thomas' little
toy,'' giving Middelhoff a taste of what it was like to lead a
company in new directions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Bertelsmann bought a 5 percent stake, an investment
that rocketed in value and gave Middelhoff a shiny Internet glow.
The 50-50 joint venture in Europe followed.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, in designating him for the top job, the board
passed over a more seasoned executive, Michael Dornemann, now
chairman of BMG Entertainment, the company's music business. Like
Wossner before him, Middelhoff was relatively young and could lead
Bertelsmann for up to 15 years before reaching 60, the company's
mandatory retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also Middelhoff's more open and engaging manner that
the leadership found appealing. The board was looking for someone
who could cultivate contacts with international business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Middelhoff ``came across as the great communicator and
visionary,'' recalled Rudi Gassner, 57, the chief executive of
Bertelsmann's BMG Entertainment International, who is retiring
Monday. ``People talk about his American spirit, because without
fear or reservation he approaches people.''
</P>
<P>
   As chief executive, Middelhoff has consciously set out to make
contacts with influential people and celebrities in the United
States. He has flown to Kennebunkport, Maine., for lunch with
former President George Bush, a Random House author. He regularly
sends gifts of CDs, current books and hand-signed notes to
prominent business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   His free spirit has not always been well received, Gassner said.
``Most of the traditional employees are kind of stunned and don't
really know how to deal with it, especially if they are older,'' he
said. ``One of the things that I've been saying to Thomas is that
when you charge ahead the way he is, don't forget to look behind,
because you may not have your troops behind.''
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts wonder if Middelhoff is himself too sluggish _
especially in Europe _ despite his mantra that speed equals
survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bertelsmann is rather weak,'' said Carsten Schmidt, an analyst
for Forrester Research in Amsterdam. ``They've done too much in too
many directions, and they're always late.'' Though Andsold was
created quickly, he noted that it nonetheless was the fourth player
in its market; likewise, Bertelsmann's electronic bookstore trailed
_ and copied _ Amazon.com in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann, Schmidt said, remains secure in its partnership
with America Online in Europe, because ``Time Warner's content
doesn't match Bertelsmann's European offerings.'' At the same time,
he and other analysts still expect that Bertelsmann may have to
find a partner in the United States to secure its access to digital
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The deals are sure to keep coming. On Friday, Mannesmann,
Germany's biggest cellular company, confirmed talks with
Bertelsmann and American Online to join in their European venture _
a link that would give Bertelsmann another channel to media
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   As he faces these challenges, Middelhoff continues to try to
tweak the Bertelsmann culture _ always with the ultimate aim of
moving faster. He has eliminated the cherished academic titles that
people used in addressing one another around the German
headquarters, replacing ``Dr.'' with a simple ``Herr'' or ``Frau.''
The formality created walls and probably stifled challenges from
lower-level employees, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, there have been tensions between the old and new
generations that have tested even the close relationship between
Middelhoff and Wossner, now the chairman of the Bertelsmann
Foundation, with offices across a swan lake from Middelhoff's in
Gutersloh.
</P>
<P>
   Wossner sent shudders through the company with his candid
remarks in an article last summer in Der Spiegel. In particular, he
was irritated with Middelhoff's comments at a news conference in
which he used a German term for gnat waste to describe a television
station that the company sold.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions were smoothed over by the fall, but even then the
two men could not agree on a description of their complicated
relationship. Middelhoff had a habit of saying that Wossner, 60 and
silver-haired, was akin to his father. In an interview, Wossner was
quick to describe himself as Middelhoff's ``elder brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Wossner's qualms, he publicly supports Middelhoff.
``You have to be the right man in your time,'' he said. ``And
Thomas is without a doubt the man that is exactly right for the
company that we have become.''

ANTI-SEMITISM AGAIN AN ISSUE IN SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an effort to needle New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani about his appearance on the same dais with an Austrian
political leader who once praised Hitler's policies, Hillary Rodham
Clinton released a letter Friday asking people to ``express their
concern'' that the leader, Joerg Haider, might share power in an
Austrian coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was the latest grenade in a war between the two
unofficial candidates for U.S. Senate, who in recent weeks have
accused each other of appearing at events where either a speaker or
another guest has been accused of anti-Semitism. Both candidates
are seeking crucial support from Jewish voters.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's letter was written to Edgar M. Bronfman,
president of the World Jewish Congress, as a follow-up to a
conversation they had within the last month about her Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 17, Martin Luther King's Birthday, Giuliani appeared on
the same dais with Haider at a dinner in New York, said Howard
Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's spokesman. Giuliani did not sit near
Haider. The mayor's spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel, has said he did not
know that Haider would be there.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor's presence was seized upon by Mrs. Clinton's
campaign after Bruce Teitelbaum, Giuliani's campaign manager,
criticized her for appearing at a separate event that day at which
a Queens minister spoke disparagingly about having lost his job at
a company that had been owned by a Jew and was taken over by
another Jew. Mrs. Clinton was out of the room when the remarks were
made, but she later denounced them.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, during his weekly radio call-in show, Giuliani made
fun of Mrs. Clinton. ``I didn't hear, I didn't know, I couldn't
have told, I wasn't sure, maybe it was, maybe it wasn't, it wasn't
this way, it wasn't that way, who knows, you couldn't tell, I don't
know,'' the mayor said, mimicking Mrs. Clinton in a singsong voice
and chuckling at the end.
</P>
<P>
   In her letter to Bronfman, Mrs. Clinton said, ``I certainly
share your concern about the growing political strength of Joerg
Haider,'' and added that his record of ``intolerance, extremism and
anti-Semitism should be of concern to all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum said the mayor had no comment on the letter.

FOR OFFICERS IN DIALLO CASE, A YEAR OF SCORN AND ISOLATION 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The four police officers accused in the shooting
death of Amadou Diallo spent much of the past year cloistered in
their homes or lawyers' offices, avoiding demonstrations outside
their houses and shunning news reports that they thought miscast
their case.
</P>
<P>
   They worked for the Police Department in desk jobs where the
people were new to them and the pace was far slower than what they
had come to expect on street patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Under their lawyers' orders, they avoided bars and parties lest
they be drawn into angry confrontations or be seen in situations
that would create the appearance that they did not understand the
magnitude of the Diallo tragedy. Even a setting as harmless as a
backyard barbecue had the potential to become a scene of constant
questioning or awkward silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have actually been very low key,'' one officer, Sean
Carroll, said in an interview. ``I've kept away from large
gatherings and family functions while I try to deal with this and
maintain my privacy. People try to mean well, but they always want
to talk about the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   To many, of course, the officers' year of anguish, scorn and
isolation is small price to pay for Diallo's death. But lawyers for
the officers, whose trial on murder charges begins Monday in
Albany, say they are eager to explain, for the first time, what
happened on Feb. 4 when they fired 41 bullets at Diallo as he stood
unarmed in the vestibule of a Bronx apartment building. Since the
shooting, the officers have spoken through their lawyers, saying
they fired because they believed, mistakenly, that Diallo had a
gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants this to happen so he can put this thing behind him,''
said James Culleton, a lawyer for one of the officers, Richard
Murphy. ``Until this trial is over, he does not feel like he can
resume his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and supporters of the Diallo family said the officers
created their own ordeal, which the officers' critics characterized
as a trifling when compared with the pain of the dead man's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever strain the police officers are under,'' said Anthony
Gair, a lawyer for Amadou Diallo's mother, Kadiatou, ``it in no way
compares to the strain or anguish that she has suffered during the
last year because her son is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The four officers about to go on trial _ Carroll, Murphy, Edward
McMellon and Kenneth Boss _ were members of the same plainclothes
patrol unit, but not routine partners, when fate and a shortage of
unmarked patrol cars cast them together last February for a night
tour in a red Ford Taurus. Their names have been inextricably
linked ever since, although they have not seen one another much
since the shooting, except at legal strategy sessions. They did
meet once socially, several months ago, when they went to dinner at
a Queens restaurant with several police officials, said Stephen
Worth, the lawyer for McMellon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time they are together it could be claimed that they are
cooking up a story, so we have discouraged them from meeting,''
Worth said.
</P>
<P>
   Only Carroll has revisited the scene of the shooting, to help
the defense team reconstruct what occurred, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting, the officers were placed on desk duty. At
the end of March, they were criminally charged and suspended
without pay. They returned to work and the payroll on April 30, in
accordance with their union contract, and now serve with pay _ but
without their guns or badges _ in nonenforcement positions.
</P>
<P>
   All the officers, except for Murphy, had been involved in
shootings and civilian complaints before Diallo's death. But each
of the shootings was found to have been justified, and all of the
complaints were ruled unsubstantiated. Internal police evaluations
had rated all four officers as competent or highly competent, and
they were all known as active officers who together had logged more
than 400 arrests, most of them for felonies.
</P>
<P>
   It is nearly impossible to make an arrest where they work now.
Carroll, a former student pilot, has been serving as a dispatcher
in the aviation unit, summoning aircraft to crimes in progress.
Murphy answers phones in an electronics shop. McMellon has a desk
job at a police office in Brooklyn. Boss monitors surveillance
camera images from a police garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy wants to work,'' said Steven Brounstein, Boss'
lawyer. ``He wants to be a contributor, and he feels like he is
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Boss' friends and family describe him as depressed, saying he
resumed smoking after the shooting and lost interest in exercise
until his father, a retired construction worker, pushed him to stay
active. ``I can't describe in words what I feel like watching my
son go through this,'' the officer's father, Ken Boss, said.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said he had not been able to get away and had had
trouble finding time for his family, given his job and the constant
meetings with his lawyer, John Patten.
</P>
<P>
   The absence from home has been particularly troubling, he said,
because his children are old enough to understand what is going on.
(Murphy has a 1-year-old boy and McMellon and Boss are single.)
Carroll's son, Ryan, is 7 and has had trouble sleeping and ``is
afraid of a lot of things.'' Carroll said he also blamed stress
from the case for a stroke his father had last month.
</P>
<P>
   Some family members have tried to respond with gestures of
support in the face of withering criticism that the officers and
their unit, the Street Crime Unit, have received. For weeks after
the shooting, Murphy's wife, Sharon, took to wearing his Street
Crime Unit jacket when she went for walks in their neighborhood in
Queens. None of their neighbors in Fresh Meadows ever said anything
negative, Culleton said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, all the officers say their neighbors have been
sympathetic, even when protesters showed up. Last March, when a
20-car parade of demonstrators drove past Carroll's home in
Babylon, N.Y., his neighbors never flinched, he said. Instead, they
often brought over groceries and other supplies. ``They were pretty
much looking after my children whenever I wasn't home,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The officers have drawn support from other quarters as well. In
March, as the protests were unfolding, Cardinal John O'Connor, who
has tried to show concern for both the Diallo family and the
police, sent the officers notes, assuring McMellon, in one, that he
was in the cardinal's prayers ``during this time of great anguish
for all of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the officers and their lawyers said they understood
that the anguish of the Diallo family was deeper, even though they
insist that their action in firing that night was reasonable.
Brounstein, for example, said Boss was so traumatized by the
shooting that he could not respond in its aftermath to a
supervisor's question.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels terrible about it,'' Brounstein said. ``He's a human
being. No one is blowing smoke off of their gun.''
</P>
<P>
   But Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields said remorse
alone would not satisfy the many New Yorkers who cannot fathom how
the officers came to fire so many times. ``People can see that they
are remorseful and have gone through a lot themselves,'' she said,
``but that does not remove the strong desire to see this case move
forward and see an outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if many people, particularly African-Americans, could
accept an acquittal, Ms. Fields, who is black, said she was not
sure. So many people are so angry over the death, she said, ``I
don't know how open minds are.''
</P>
<P>
   The officers understand that they will face a difficult time,
even if they are acquitted, several of their lawyers said, because
there is a good chance they would then confront Police Department
disciplinary charges. But they all said they wanted to return to
the force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always thought that being a police officer is one of
the noblest professions,'' Carroll said. ``I will always think
that, regardless of the outcome of the case.''

<P>
   In mid-January, the venerable auctioneers at Sotheby's added
``dot.com'' to its name and seemed to give a signal to the art
world that even its most exclusive members might have to shake off
their clubby airs and join the egalitarian Internet bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   ``This world has been too intimidating and rarefied,'' said
Sotheby's president, Diana ``DeDe'' Brooks, who has been personally
steering the firm's online venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our site to be a friendly place to the potentially
millions of people who've never bought art before.''
</P>
<P>
   Marketing art to the online masses is nothing new. But the way
that Sotheby's is doing it raises doubts about whether the
255-year-old firm with the most famous name in the business can
remain on its pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, its dot.com strategy has been about as clear as
Galle glass.
</P>
<P>
   The ``new'' site _ sothebys.com _ is not the firm's first;
sothebys.amazon.com was launched last November, via the famous
online bookseller's ``portal.''
</P>
<P>
   This existing site offers downmarket collectibles for a broad
audience _ it has, for example, a ``special sale for lovers'' for
Valentine's Day _ while sothebys.com is designed to offer pricier
fine-art pieces for the more discerning collector.
</P>
<P>
   Its star item at the moment is a copy of the first edition of
the American Declaration of Independence, which is on offer for $4
million-6 million.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken Sotheby's a year and more than $40 million to get
to this fork in the road. In January 1999 the firm announced plans
to develop a Web site with enough fanfare to give the company's
share price a sharp (if premature) boost from the so-called ``net''
effect.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman said then that ``only distinguished art
professionals will be selling objects on this site.'' But now the
firm has decided to open the flood gates.
</P>
<P>
   It has signed up 4,700 ``Internet associates,'' a motley
collection of dealers who can offer their goods for sale via the
Sotheby's sites but who (as Sotheby's makes crystal clear) remain
fully responsible for the authenticity of anything that they offer.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the ``distinguished art professionals'' corralled into
the scheme at an early stage by Brooks herself are less than
overjoyed at finding themselves forced into company that they might
not want anywhere near the well-polished portals of their high-rent
galleries.
</P>
<P>
   There are persistent worries about the quality and authenticity
of online art, and of the people selling it. The inaugural auction
on Nart.com, a rival online auction house, was disturbed by
concerns that a star Picasso drawing might be a forgery. In the
end, it was withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's sites too are having their start-up problems. Some
customers of sothebys.amazon.com have had to wait over six weeks to
receive their goods.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-January when John Fiebach, a financial trader in
Philadelphia, finally received the antique American picture frame
that he had bought at an online auction in late November, it was
broken and had obvious glue spots where someone had tried to fix
it.
</P>
<P>
   For the top end of the art market, there remains considerable
skepticism about the principle of online dealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What galleries are selling is elitism,'' says William Bartman,
director of the Art Resources Transfer gallery in New York. ``It's
a very, very private club intended not to let people in, and if it
gets too big, collectors won't want to be a part of it any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Some galleries are not letting the online masses get a shot at
their best art works because ``placing'' a work in an important
collection is critical to developing an artist's reputation (and
market value).
</P>
<P>
   Giuseppe Eskenazi, one of London's leading oriental art dealers,
still feels that ``what we sell is something that needs to be
looked at and discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he was one of Sotheby's first Internet associates, he
has not yet offered anything for sale online. But he does concede
that the online art market ``could be a snowball. It all depends
what happens in the United States.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 700) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mike May, an analyst at Jupiter Communications, a technology
consulting firm, predicts that the market will grow, but only
slowly because ``everyone in this category is selling twice:
they're spending money to convince customers of the concept of
buying art online, and then they have to convince them to buy the
art here, at their site.''
</P>
<P>
   At the lower end of the market, Sotheby's main problem is the
formidable competition that it faces. Existing sites have already
proved that people are prepared to spend thousands of dollars on
objects that they've never seen in three dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   Customers like the online capacity to compare prices (almost for
the first time ever) and, by and large, they find the sites'
logistics are working well. Return rates reported so far are, on
average, less than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new sites are also reaching parts that other art can't. For
some sites, up to 90 percent of their sales are going to first-time
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Many new customers are finding the anonymity of online buying
attractive. It allows them to request a 10-foot painting to match
their coral couch without being made to feel like a philistine. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The existing sites seeking to sell art can be divided into
three: those selling mass-produced prints and posters (art.com and
worldprints.com, for example); sites that circumvent dealers and
galleries by representing artists directly (paintingsdirect.com,
nextmonet.com); and sites that put the existing art world online _
both galleries (such as onview.com, to be launched in February, and
eartgroup.com) and auctions (eBay.com and gavelnet.com).
</P>
<P>
   This last group, which presents Sotheby's with its main
competition, is changing the shape of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Antique shops and galleries, if not actually closing down, are
increasingly being left empty by their owners. They are choosing to
stay at home in order to carry on their business around the clock
via their laptops, modems and (predominantly) eBay.com. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,050) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EBay is the big threat to Sotheby's at the lower end of the
market. It has a clever system whereby buyers give sellers points
for service, and this ``feedback'' is posted on the site, giving
vendors a strong incentive to play fair.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's is trying to claw its way into this market by
demanding that its Internet associates sign a three-year contract
declaring that they will not sell goods in excess of $300 anywhere
online other than via Sotheby's own sites.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than tying dealers in, however, this questionable
restraint of trade is merely encouraging them to cheat on their
contract and seek ways around it. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until Sotheby's is seen to have a comparable position online to
that which it commands offline, dealers are reluctant to give up
their other online opportunities. For some of them, online business
is considerable.
</P>
<P>
   One London antique dealer, for example, now does 90 percent of
its business online (from a standing start less than a year ago).
Almost all of it is with customers in the United States, customers
who would never have popped into the dealer's shop.  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,250) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the top end of the market, Sotheby's competition continues to
come from its traditional rival, Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   The ``other'' London auction house, echoing with French accents
since being taken over by a French businessman, Francois Pinault,
first decided not to go online and then changed its mind.
</P>
<P>
   Now it says that it plans to launch a site this spring, and
Edward Dolman, its recently appointed chief executive, has
confirmed that it intends to concentrate on ``the top end of the
market'' _ meaning that it will eschew Valentine's Day specials.
</P>
<P>
   Crucially, though, Christie's is differentiating itself by
promising to authenticate all its site's offerings itself. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF LAST TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,400) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Collectively these sites are bringing big changes to the art
world. Other markets have already shown that the Internet has the
power to overturn the old order of things completely, and very
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's has been at the heart of the art market for a very
long time. Going, going...? &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   ELKO, Nev. _ It is a narrow dead-end dirt road, ribbing along a
narrow canyon for barely more than a mile before it hits
wilderness. Snow puts it out of commission for half the year, rains
can do it in entirely, and even then, only hikers and campers
really miss it, as a means to a favorite trail head.
</P>
<P>
   But South Canyon Road in Jarbidge (population: 20) has become
much more than the sum of its snowed-in, washed-out parts. A tussle
between people here in Elko County and the U.S. Forest Service over
the rebuilding of the road has become a cause for anyone anywhere
who is fed up with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   This all started after the Jarbidge road, which sits at the
northern tip of Elko County, only a few miles from Idaho, washed
away for the umpteenth time in 1995. The Forest Service offered to
rebuild the road, then backtracked after studies determined that
reconstruction would create silt and pollution runoff that would
harm rare bull trout in the Jarbidge River.
</P>
<P>
   That reignited the always-simmering battle in the West for local
control over land, much of it owned by the federal government. Last
fall, a group of Nevadans calling themselves the Jarbidge Shovel
Brigade tried rebuilding the road. They were issued a restraining
order and stopped. Then they declared war.
</P>
<P>
   Casualties so far include the director of the Forest Service for
the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest (which includes Jarbidge), who
resigned this month, saying that the harassment and intimidation by
the ``anti-feds'' had reached a dangerous pitch, not to mention the
always uneasy peace between federal employees and the ranchers,
miners and loggers who live off the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are saying, Enough is enough, and this Jarbidge
road is where we have to make a stand,'' said Mike Nannini, an Elko
County commissioner who has been one of the most relentless critics
of federal departments like the Forest Service and Fish and
Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   From talk shows to newspaper editorials to meetings and forums
and supermarket checkout lines, Shovel Brigaders have inundated the
public with warnings of what might lie ahead if the government was
allowed to do what it wished.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Shovel Brigade is growing with a fervor
throughout the West and at least half a dozen states elsewhere.
This weekend, just in time for the annual Cowboy Poetry Festival,
which attracts tourists and reporters to Elko from all over the
country, a convoy of semitrucks carrying 10,000 shovels is
scheduled to arrive here from Montana, Utah, Idaho, northern
California, Oregon and South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   The shovels, symbolizing support for the locals who plan to
rebuild the road on the Fourth of July, will be placed around town
during a parade that begins in front of the local office of the
Bureau of Land Management.
</P>
<P>
   Rallying points include the Elko County Courthouse, where a
30-foot shovel paid for by the Shovel Brigade stands on the lawn
like a monument.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hurst, a Eureka, Mont., logger who organized the shovel
collection, said he hoped it was the beginning of a political
movement that would force presidential and Congressional candidates
to take notice this election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about 1,400 feet of road that washed out in
Jarbidge, Nev.,'' Hurst said.
</P>
<P>
   For Hurst, the issue is personal. As the federal government
protects more plant and animal species under the Endangered Species
Act, he said, people who have made their livelihoods off the land
are left to wither away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am in danger of having to shut down because of lack of
access to timber in our national forest,'' he said. ``I am
currently hauling logs, burnt fire-killed logs, from Alberta, 500
miles away, when 15 miles from my plant trees are lying on their
side, dead and rotting, and we do not have access to those trees,
largely because of the Endangered Species Act.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most controversial aspects of the federal
government's decision to close the Jarbidge road was a Department
of Interior emergency declaration designating the bull trout as
threatened after Elko County bulldozed 300 feet of the road in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The listing of that bull trout is one of the phoniest things
they came up with,'' said state Assemblyman John Carpenter, who
helped organize the Shovel Brigade. ``These fish are doing fine;
the population is stable.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Nevada Division of Wildlife opposed the listing of
the bull trout as threatened. ``They are very secure in their
habitat,'' said Gene Weller, the head of fisheries for the state
division. ``Numbers are low; there's not a lot of them. But they
are in numbers that are commensurate with their habitat.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Weller said, the division opposes rebuilding the road.
``Roads in stream bottoms are not good for fish,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Even though the road should not be built, we believe
the fish should not be used as a pretext.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Matt Holford, executive director of the Nevada chapter of
Trout Unlimited, a national nonprofit conservation organization,
said studies pointed to a further reduction of the bull trout
population, which makes its southernmost habitat in North America
in the Jarbidge River.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nevada Division of Fish and Wildlife did a watershed
analysis that showed that this road gets washed out about every
other year and has to be rebuilt,'' said Holford, who appealed the
United States Forest Service's initial decision to rebuild the road
on the grounds that it had not studied the effects on the fish
populations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we have to'' rebuild, he said, ``the river washes
out the road, throwing the sediments back into that river. We go
back in the summer, driving, and throw in more sediment. They've
been rebuilding this road ever since the Forest Service put it in
in 1910, at great expense to the taxpayers and the fish
populations.''
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, where shovels were sold out of stores less than a
week after Hurst announced his ``Shovels of Solidarity'' campaign,
a visit earlier this week by the former supervisor of the
Humboldt-Toiyable National Forest was met with protests by members
of a timber group.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Flora, who served as supervisor of the Humboldt-Toiyabe
National Forest (the largest in the lower 48 states), for only 18
months before resigning Jan. 1, said her tenure was poisoned from
the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd worked in rural areas for 22 years,'' Ms. Flora said,
``and I understood the concerns, especially considering the
president's initiatives to preserve national forests. But their
attacks became personal. My employees were refused service at
restaurants or shunned, or kicked out of a motel.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the history of violence toward federal departments in
Nevada _ in the last five years, two federal office buildings and
one federal van were blown up, though suspects were never arrested
_ Ms. Flora said she resigned to send a message that the situation
was out of control.
</P>
<P>
   There is no end in sight to the standoff. Sen. Harry Reid,
D-Nev., went to Elko last year to broker a truce between the county
and the Forest Service, but left with no deal.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the issue, Reid said, is historical. With 87 percent of
the land in Nevada in federal hands, rural populations have been
bumping up against land restrictions _ for grazing, water and the
like _ for more than a century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of big problems in Nevada,'' he said. ``We have
water problems. We have problems with land involving tens of
thousands of acres. We have approximately 65 million acres we have
to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   As for that speck of road in Jarbidge? ``I'm working on that
right now,'' Reid said. ``I'm doing my best right now.''

BENCH NOT YET A CONCERN FOR LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Lakers have cruised to the best
record in the league on the backs of the NBA's top scoring trio,
but the offensive dropoff after Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and
Glen Rice is steep.
</P>
<P>
   No one else is averaging double figures and it's a rare night
that anyone other than those three breaks the 10-point barrier. But
coach Phil Jackson doesn't consider the Lakers' heavy reliance on
the Big Three a liability. Not yet, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would guess a majority of teams in the NBA are about the
same,'' he said, ``only they may not have the same prolific three.
. . . Teams have scorers, and other people that are role players or
workers, doing other jobs out there on the floor. However, our
situation, the three of them stand out because they all have
averages that are close to 20 points or more.''
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Friday's game, O'Neal, Bryant and Rice averaged a
combined 67.7 points, 68 percent of the Lakers' offense. The next
highest trio is the Detroit Pistons' Grant Hill, Jerry Stackhouse
and Christian Laettner (64.5 points), followed by the Milwaukee
Bucks' Glenn Robinson, Ray Allen and Sam Cassell (63.2 points).
</P>
<P>
   When O'Neal, Bryant or Rice falter, the Lakers have no sure-fire
safety net. Derek Fisher is averaging 8.4 points, Ron Harper 7.4
and Rick Fox 6.9. Then it drops off to Tyronn Lue (6.0 points), who
hasn't played since Nov. 15. A concern down the road?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't follow that train of thought,'' Jackson said. ``I
think the minutes and shots will change if Rick was playing minutes
or Robert (Horry) was playing big minutes. I think both of them
could have a hand in scoring at some level, too, out there. And
Derek has scored rather well when he was a starter earlier this
season. . . . Eventually, we're going to have to have a punch off
the bench, someone that comes in and gives us some offense.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Slumping: Jackson's hoping for a revival from Fox. The former
starter is shooting a career-low 42.5 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not playing well. I'm sure he'd admit that himself,''
Jackson said. ``He's struggled for awhile. . . . He has not nearly
been a consistent performer for us.''

<P>
   An off-duty police officer in Providence, R.I., was shot and
killed by two other officers early Friday morning when he came to
their assistance in a confrontation with an armed man.
</P>
<P>
   The dead officer, Cornel Young Jr., 29, was the son of the
highest-ranking black police officer on the Providence force, Maj.
Cornel Young, commander of the city's community police division.
</P>
<P>
   The officers who shot him are white, said two former members of
the Providence Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who was not in uniform, saw a man with a gun confronting
the two officers outside Fidas Restaurant on Valley Street, and he
rushed to help them with his gun drawn, Chief Urbano Prignano said.
</P>
<P>
   The officers ordered both men to drop their weapons, and when
Young did not, they shot him, Prignano said.
</P>
<P>
   The armed man, Aldrin Diaz, dropped his gun. Diaz was charged
with murder Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The two officers are on administrative leave, with pay, said
Maj. Martin Hames, a police spokesman. Hames did not release their
names.
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general's office is investigating the
shooting.

AT SUNDANCE, THE PARTY IS THE MAIN EVENT

 By LINDA LEE

<P>
   PARK CITY, Utah _ The Palm Pilot was the accessory of choice at
this year's Sundance Film Festival. It was essential for keeping
track of the intensive schedule of screenings and making sense of
the array of parties, which ranged from packed gatherings in condos
to an ice cream social for Tammy Faye Bakker and RuPaul to a swank
benefit for AIDS research, which drew Lisa Marie Presley, Edward
Furlong and John Lydon (who? you know, Johnny Rotten).
</P>
<P>
   Marisa Tomei and Melissa Joan Hart were among the dancers at an
all-night rave for the movie ``Groove'' on the first weekend of the
festival, which ended on Jan. 29. Deep into the morning, the joint
was packed with ravers and blessed with D.J.s who kept kicking up
the beats per minute. Someone could die at a party like that and
not have the space to fall down; besides, the bass line alone would
have kept a heart beating.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Harrison, the director of ``Groove,'' which is, not
surprisingly, about the rave music scene, bragged: ``We had our
attorney dancing without his shirt on, right in front of the stage.
My mom was dancing, and she's 65 and from the Midwest. She said, `I
can feel the music in my feet!'''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison, who sold his movie to Sony Pictures Classics that
weekend for $1.5 million, had reason to dance through the night
with his co-producer, a young woman named Danielle Renfrew. ``A
year ago, we came to Sundance with a postcard and a script and our
relationship,'' Harrison said of the attempt to raise money for
``Groove.'' ``We thought we'd meet bigwigs, and instead we got the
brush.''
</P>
<P>
   And now? ``We got a call: `Would you like to come to dinner with
Nick Nolte and Emily Watson?''' he said. ``I mean, movie stars?
Free food is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Renfrew added, ``We still get excited about the idea of free
food.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyro filmmakers can count on the party scene at Sundance to
provide them with plenty of giveaway food and drink, as well as the
occasion to meet studio executives and movie stars _ if someone
like Josh Hartnett counts as a movie star. In fact, so intense is
the socializing at the 10-day independent film festival that the
refrain ``Where's the party tonight?'' is often the first thing one
hears in the morning. The partying, with its promise of networking
and deal-making, can sometimes seem more important than watching
movies.
</P>
<P>
   The British talent behind ``New Year's Day,'' about a teen-age
suicide pact, was enjoying free food on the first Sunday morning of
the festival at a brunch for their film. Ralph Brown, an actor who
wrote ``New Year's Day,'' was reminiscing about his recent brush
with a big Hollywood studio film, when he played Ric Olie in ``Star
Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My face was on Coke bottles and Taco Bell and I was even an
action figure, but I wasn't invited to the premiere,'' he said,
seated at a banquette after toying with a brunch burrito. ``It's
just not common human decency.''
</P>
<P>
   At Sundance, with his friend Suri Krishnamma having directed
``New Year's Day,'' Brown said he felt the warmth of human decency.
He was also proud of getting songs by the Welsh band Gorky's
Zygotic Mynci onto the soundtrack. (Although it sounds like a Monty
Python word, ``mynci'' is ``monkey'' in Welsh.)
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The hot ticket on the first weekend was for ``Committed,'' a
romantic comedy starring Heather Graham. Sighted at the screening
were Ben Affleck (his brother, Casey, is in the film), Matt Damon,
Rob Morrow, Fisher Stevens and Liev Schreiber. ``One of the great
things is that Casey's brother obviously is a famous actor, and he
has other famous actor friends, and they drove out here,'' Ms.
Graham said. She plays Joline, a space cadet at the center of
``Committed'' who believes in marriage long after her husband has
left.
</P>
<P>
   It is Ms. Graham's movie, but even she couldn't get some friends
into the screening. Instead, she took them to a Miramax dinner
party at the restaurant 350 Main. ``We hung out and we drank,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She has a laugh that contrasts with her Breyers vanilla ice
cream complexion, a flat, yet fluttery Phyllis Dillerish
ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. ``And then we went to some party in some
condo,'' she said. ``We wandered around trying to find it. It was
the middle of the night and it was freezing cold. And when we
finally got there, it was so crowded. We had to wait until people
were leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so we finally got in, and there was no alcohol. Finally,
someone led us to the secret closet where there was some warm beer.
And my boyfriend'' _ Ed Burns, the movie director _ ``proceeded to
pocket about five or six bottles of that. Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.''
</P>
<P>
   Those tight red leather pants her character wears in the film?
She wants viewers to know they're from Earl. Ms. Graham said: ``I
love their clothes. I'm wearing their jeans right now.'' She stood
up at Bergies, another restaurant on Main Street, and demonstrated
how the jeans fit what looked like a Size 2 body.
</P>
<P>
   Famke Janssen, the Bond girl who now looks like Julia Roberts,
wore what seemed to be her grandmother's afghan turned into a skirt
to the premiere of her well-received film, ``Love and Sex,'' which
deals with the pitfalls of long-term relationships. Her film
relationship is with Jon Favreau, who is usually cast as a
meat-headed heavy in Hollywood films. At the premiere, Favreau
explained why he loved doing independent films: ``It's only in them
that I'm allowed to get the girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Hawke, who stars in a modern-dress version of ``Hamlet''
(the kind of movie in which ``To be or not to be'' is delivered in
a video store), was at another Miramax party at 350 Main,
accompanied by his wife, Uma Thurman. So why Hamlet? Why now? ``I
liked the clothes,'' he said. ``Helmut Lang and Hugo Boss.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we done?'' he asked a reporter, spying a baby dressed in
pink at the party. ``You know, we have a baby at home. How old do
you think this one is? A year? I'm going over there to play with
that baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian Bale, who stars in ``American Psycho,'' said he was
dodging the intense party scene whenever possible. For one thing,
the airline had misplaced his bag, leaving him with only the
clothes he wore on the plane, nothing like the Master of the
Universe duds by Nino Cerutti he wears in the film. ``They promised
me the entire wardrobe,'' he said. ``I don't know what I'd wear
them for, but I just want to have them. I want to open up my closet
and have 15 suits _ all pinstriped, '80s, double-breasted.''
</P>
<P>
   In preparing for the role of a Wall Streeter who is a serial
killer, Bale had to develop a fit body to show off the
sharp-tailored suits. His hair is creepily long in the film, and he
has the ultrasmooth complexion of a well-tended prince. ``They
would give me hot towels at the end of every day, and facial
massage,'' he said. ``A lot of pampering.'' He also used a sun bed
to work up a full-body tan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a fair amount of nude scenes in the movie, so I
couldn't have lines,'' he said. (One of those nude scenes earned
the film its NC-17 rating.) But weren't there any delicate areas
that needed protection during tanning? ``Well, I did wear
goggles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a huge role for Bale, who is best known in this country for
playing the handsome next-door neighbor in ``Little Women.'' Which
makes his role in a controversial movie like ``American Psycho,''
based on a book by Brett Easton Ellis that was condemned for its
violence toward women, something of a surprising turn. He was
apprehensive about the premiere. ``Beforehand, we all met up and
had dinner,'' he said. ``And I had a fair few drinks, to calm
myself. Pinot grigio. It did the trick.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 23, RuPaul, who was credited in the film ``The Eyes of
Tammy Faye'' as RuPaul Charles (who knew he had a last name?), was
at the Holiday Village Cinema II in a local shopping mall for a
campy late-night screening of the film. He is the narrator of the
surprisingly positive documentary. Tammy Faye Bakker was there,
too, monopolizing the false eyelash quotient for the evening.

   RuPaul was dressed butch in western wear, from a pony-skin coat
to tan boots with matching gloves to a substantial brown leather
hat. He had just come down the mountain from MGM/UA's Golden Globes
party at the Silver Lake ski lodge. ``Great food!'' he said. ``And
we saw Michael Ironside.'' He paused. ``Is that the name? His head
blows up in `Scanners.' Look, I'm talking so fast because I had
three cups of coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``I bought the hat at Cowboy Collectibles here.''
About the pony-skin coat, he said:``I was worried. There were these
protesters on Main Street with those signs `Fur is dead.' So I
walked on the other side of the street, because I didn't know if
pony skin was fur or not.''
</P>
<P>
   A discussion ensued, and it was decided that pony skin was more
like leather than fur. The next day, a reporter approached the
sidewalk protesters with the same question: Is pony skin fur?
``It's not fur, exactly,'' said a young man wearing an antifur
sandwich board. ``But it's gross. You tell RuPaul to come down here
and talk to us.''

   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ A few weeks ago, when The Union Leader, New
Hampshire's largest newspaper, endorsed Steve Forbes for president,
the endorsement was lukewarm. It included the line, ``Some would
say he looks like a geek.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few days, the paper has pulled out all the
stops. On Tuesday, the main headline on the results of the Iowa
caucuses emphasized Forbes' second-place finish: ``Forbes tests
Bush in Iowa.'' A front-page editorial asserted, ``Forbes is true
heir to Reagan's legacy.'' Another front-page headline was,
``Forbes has good night, but not so for Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a front-page editorial referred to the ``smug
attitude and smart remarks'' of Gov. George W. Bush and called him
``Governor Smirk.''
</P>
<P>
   One editorial inside declared that ``Forbes has Bush running
scared.'' A second called Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Vice
President Al Gore ``birds of a feather.'' And a third criticized
Alan Keyes' demeanor. Three more columns either supported Forbes or
attacked his opponents.

RAMS PUNTER HORAN GETS A SUPER SECOND CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  ATLANTA _ As late as the first week of November, Mike Horan
was putting in at least six hours a day as a loan officer for a
mortgage establishment called the Dunhill Company in Littleton,
Col.
</P>
<P>
   At 40 years old, the career of the long-time NFL punter had
seemed to come to an unwanted conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept waiting for the telephone to ring, but it never did,''
said Horan, who last season had performed his art for the Chicago
Bears and before that had drawn paychecks from the Philadelphia
Eagles, Denver Broncos, New York Giants and St. Louis Rams. ``But I
kept in shape. I'd work out and punt on a regular basis. I was
ready to go at any moment. I was just waiting for a call.''
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited call finally came on Nov. 8, one day after the
Rams' punter, Rick Tuten, went out for the season with a hip
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Mike Horan, one of only two Long Beach State football
players performing in the NFL _ Terrell Davis is the other _ found
himself doing what he has been doing for a living since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Mike was impressing the Rams coaching staff with his
lengthy punts that had a knack for keeping return men off balance
and also with his well-regarded proficiency as a holder on
field-goal and extra-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   And, suddenly, Mike Horan finds himself back in another Super
Bowl after performing in three losing ones with the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a more unlikely participant in Sunday's match between
the Rams and Tennessee Titans than Mike Horan?
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, when November rolled around and I didn't hear from
any teams, I thought I was done for the season,'' said Horan. ``But
I knew I still could punt. I had a good year punting last season
with the Bears. The problem with me was my age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams want to go with younger guys, and you really can't blame
them. They're less expensive and teams are always building toward
the future. You just don't build for the future with a guy in his
40s.''
</P>
<P>
   But the left-footed Horan, who played for Dave Currey at Long
Beach State during the 1980-81 seasons, has turned out to be a
surprising late-season acquisition for the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike's done everything we've asked of him,'' said Dick
Vermeil. ``The guy is just such a professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Horan might not boom his punts as far as he once did or
have as long a hang-time. But those fellows who field his punts
seldom have been able to advance far with the football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm more of a directional punter now,'' said Horan.
``I try to kick it in such a way that guys aren't able to return it
very far. If a punter consistently boots the ball over 50 yards and
the returners consistently bring the ball back 15 to 20 yards, then
he's not doing his job.''
</P>
<P>
   The married father of three children _ his daughters are 12 and
14 and his son is 10 _ doesn't plan to retire after the Rams-Titans
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know for sure after the Super Bowl is that I'm going to
go back with my family to Littleton,'' he said. ``But I won't
retire from football. I didn't retire this season. The NFL is going
to retire me. When my phone stops ringing for good from NFL teams,
then I'll be retired. But until then, I'll be ready to punt. Why
not? It's fun and it has its financial dividends. It sure beats
being a loan officer.''

TUESDAY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, IT'S A SURE THING: HE'S NO. 1
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.H., Vt., Mass.)   (jw) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As a 101-year-old multimillionaire who was turned on to
politics by a Teddy Roosevelt speech and lives in a New Hampshire
town where the voter turnout is routinely 100 percent, Neil
Tillotson certainly cannot be called a typical American voter.
</P>
<P>
   But he might be called emblematic of New Hampshire voters, who
carry such disproportionate weight in the presidential primary
process because they go first.
</P>
<P>
   For Tillotson, you see, is the first of the first, the primary
voter of the nation's first primary, coming up on Tuesday. A
still-active businessman with offices in Boston, his home is in
Dixville Notch, N.H., and since the 1960s that White Mountains
hamlet has cast all its votes just after midnight on primary day,
the results quickly flashed by news organizations across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   And each primary, Tillotson, who himself put Dixville Notch on
the political map soon after moving there four decades ago, has led
the line to the town's ballot box, back when there were only seven
voters, and now when they number about 30.
</P>
<P>
   This small, upright, bow-tied person, like his small, twangy,
New England state, cannot possibly be called representative of all
American voters. But like many here, he takes his political role so
seriously it is hard to object to his dibs on going first.
</P>
<P>
   Though not retired, Tillotson takes the time to meet with most
candidates. He thinks seriously about the state of the world and
reads so many magazines that he complains of lacking time for
books. And he is so irreparably eye-on-the-ball sensible that he
plays down the very hype he has helped create.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my viewpoint, the voting first is not the important
thing,'' he said. ``The important thing is here's a town with, for
many elections, 100 percent of the voters voting. That's a lot more
important than voting first or last.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually the two are connected, explained Hugh Gregg, a former
New Hampshire governor, who is a leading historian of the primary.
By law, Gregg said, Dixville Notch cannot close its polls so
quickly unless it has 100 percent of the voters accounted for, and
so the town makes sure it has absentee ballots from everyone who
cannot attend.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Dixville Notch consists of little more than the
Balsams, a grand old country resort that Tillotson bought at
auction back in 1954 (it cost a mere $185,000, he says), largely
for sentimental reasons, because his forebears had farmed in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all the Dixville Notch voters are Balsams employees,
but there is no sinister conspiracy involved: A few years after
buying the Balsams, Tillotson moved to Dixville Notch and simply
found that he had no place to vote, because the community was
unincorporated. So he acted to win incorporation for the town
solely for voting purposes.
</P>
<P>
   As he tells it, he has not consciously hyped the Dixville Notch
vote. Rather, after some reporters had begun covering the town's
post-midnight balloting, the comforts and multiple telephones of
the resort caused it to catch on as a great place for them to spend
primary night.
</P>
<P>
   For all his primary primacy, Tillotson is no political operator.
By his own account of his century-long life, he sounds instead like
a North Country boy with Yankee ingenuity who set out to improve
the world through technological progress and constructive business
dealings _ and succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Brought up in Beecher Falls, Vt., Tillotson set off for the big
city, Boston, when he was about 15, he said, and never finished
high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I had in the world was in my pocket,'' he said,
although when asked what had actually been in his pocket, he paused
for more than a minute to remember. (Some money, a comb, a
handkerchief.)
</P>
<P>
   He served in the cavalry in World War I, worked for a rubber
company a few years, then went into the rubber business for
himself, making a cat-shaped balloon. That balloon business soon
expanded into companies with factories around the world, and
Tillotson has not worked for anybody else since 1933.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his business dealings have centered on 50-50
partnerships. ``There are two words that to me are very important:
`for' and `with,''' he said. ``You work for me or with me.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not know _ and does not want to know _ how much he is
worth. ``It would become too important,'' he said. ``I want to
accomplish things. I want to do things.''
</P>
<P>
   In a candidate, he said, ``I think the first thing you look for
is honesty _ is the guy honest? The next thing is, has he got a
brain? And is he emotionally reasonably stable?''
</P>
<P>
   Tillotson has voted for Democrats in his time, he said, but
believes he is registered as a Republican _ or maybe as a
``nothing.'' He never says who will get his vote, but there are a
couple of hints that this year it will be George W. Bush. Among all
the candidates who made the pilgrimage to Dixville Notch, he said,
``the only one I deliberately spent time with was Bush, because I
did not have a favorable impression, and I really wanted to see if
I spent a little time with him, whether that would pass.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically,'' he said, ``it did.''
</P>
<P>
   One awkward question had to be asked: Is there not a No. 2 voter
who has been waiting for decades for Tillotson to kick the bucket
so that his No. 1 spot can be claimed? No, Tillotson said, there is
no strict order of voters after him.
</P>
<P>
   Tillotson still commutes every few days between his office on
the Boston waterfront and his Dixville Notch home, and though he
has a pacemaker and recently took a nasty fall down a flight of
stairs and fought through a bout of pneumonia, he has no intention
of retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the world is a wonderful place,'' he said with a broad
grin that dollars to doughnuts has remained unchanged for nigh on
100 years. ``I don't want to retire from it.''

   CRITICIZING THE DUTCH
</P>

   When Steve Forbes said scornfully that doctors in the
Netherlands practice euthanasia when ``they want a hospital bed,''
a Dutch reporter objected, saying doctors in Holland were not
killing patients to get their hospital beds. But Forbes, speaking
at a high school in Manchester, said of Dutch laws on terminating
care for the critically ill, ``The thing has been abused and
doctors admit they abuse it.''

   Gary L. Bauer campaigned Friday in Manchester, Merrimack, and
Nashua, N.H., and addressed students at New England College in
Henniker. In his speech at the college Bauer said, ``What I think
my party needs to do is nominate someone, that would be me, who is
as aggressive about conservative ideas as Bill Clinton and Al Gore
are on liberal ideas.'' Bauer later addressed the Rockingham County

   Would his son, Andrew, be selected as the Democratic
vice-presidential candidate? an Italian newspaper asked former Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo of New York. ``It is a very probable hypothesis,''
Cuomo told the Corriere della Sera. ``Andrew would be the first
Italian-American vice president of the country, the best way to
debunk so many odious prejudices against us Italians.'' Cuomo, in a
clarifying interview with The New York Times, said that Corriere
had over-interpreted his remarks. ``I said of course his name has
been mentioned as a possible vice president. Of course he'd be a
good vice president. What do you want me to say? He'd be a terrible
vice president?''

   ENDORSEMENT OF BRADLEY

   One of the largest newspapers in New England representing the

marriages as major reasons for its support.

</P>
<P>
   NON-VOTERS VOTE
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley has captured the votes of 44 percent of
first-graders voting on-line at www.scholastic.com. But
11th-graders are overwhelmingly behind Republicans _ 72 percent for
the maverick John McCain, 16 percent for front-runner George W.
Bush ( Bradley has a measly 3 percent). Overall, Bush is leading
among the more than 47,000 young non-voters who have cast
electronic ballots, with 39 percent. Student voters polled by
Scholastic magazines have been a bellwether of presidential
politics for 50 years: The only time they were wrong was when they
picked Richard M. Nixon in 1960.

DAVOS MAN'S VISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By H.D.S. Greenway  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Editorial Notebook) DAVOS, Switzerland _ The term ``Davos
Man,'' allegedly coined by Harvard's Samuel Huntington, has come to
stand for the new class of information age entrepreneurs,
politicians, and academicians who recognize and seek to harness the
forces of globalization, free trade, and open markets and who come
from all over the world to meet here every year for the World
Economic Forum. But the globalization age is not universally
popular, and the antithesis of Davos Man, in a term coined by MIT
economist Paul Krugman, a participant at Davos this year, is
``Seattle Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Man, Krugman wrote in The New York Times, ``believes
that globalization is purely and simply a way for capitalists to
exploit the world's workers.''
</P>
<P>
   The ghost of the Seattle demonstrations against the World Trade
Organization and the failure of the WTO delegates to reach
agreement on a new round of tariff reductions haunt this year's
Davos session with the realization that open markets are not as
assured as was once thought. As Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair
put it: ``There is no pretending that the outcome of Seattle wasn't
a setback for free trade.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most articulate of Seattle Men is AFL-CIO chief John
Sweeney, who told delegates here  &UR; yesterday &LR;  that Seattle was just
an opening shot, that open markets are not an end in themselves,
and that ``the seeds for rejection of globalization'' were sown by
10 years of reckless behavior that ignored both workers' rights and
environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Mexico's President Ernesto Zedillo who spoke for the
emerging world when he answered Sweeney by saying that a ``peculiar
alliance'' of ``environmentalists, trade unions of developed
countries, and some self-appointed representatives of civil society
are gathering around a common endeavor: to save the people of
developing countries from development.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, no member of this alliance would recognize that it
is seeking to inflict intentional damage on anyone, least of all
the poor people of less advanced countries,'' he continued. ``Some
of them would claim naively, others cynically, that they want
exactly the opposite'': to save the developing world from the
horrors of globalization. ``Ardently and sometimes in an altruistic
tone, each puts forward its own motive for being globaphobic,''
Zedillo said. But all their arguments come down to one word:
``protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo argued that homogeneous labor standards are a worthy
goal but unreachable in the short run, and if enforced, they would
snatch away the developing world's best chance to climb out of
poverty, which, in turn, is the only chance to achieve worldwide
labor standards. ``In the absence of absolute free labor mobility''
_ i.e., all of Mexico moving to the United States _ ``trade is
actually the most powerful instrument for making labor conditions
converge across nations in the long run,'' Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who insist that trade depends on Third World workers being
paid First World wages ``ignore the fact that frequently the
alternative for those workers is extreme rural poverty or marginal
occupation in the urban informal sector of the economy, where
hardly any labor rights can be made effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Zedillo said he is strongly committed to labor
standards, what he opposes is ``the invocation of those rights'' to
destroy employment opportunities for poor workers in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
   As for the argument that free trade has led to environmental
degradation, Zedillo said that since trade favors economic growth,
``it brings about at least part of the necessary means to preserve
and remedy the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Increased incomes from trade-related economic growth also help
to make people demand an improved environment,'' he said.
Furthermore, employment opportunities in export activities
``encourage people to give up highly polluting marginal
occupations.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney is not wrong in saying that workers' rights and
environmental concerns have to become a part of the globalization
process. But it would be a tragedy of worldwide dimensions if
Seattle Man managed to harm the very things he advocates by
mistakenly and harmfully raising barriers to free trade.

<P>
   The new railroad era opening for travelers along the Boston-New
Haven-New York corridor this week has modest beginnings, but it
heralds improvements with far wider implications. In the long run,
patience will yield gains not only for rail travelers but for air
and bus commuters as well.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday at 6:15 a.m., the first electric-powered Amtrak train
is scheduled to leave South Station for the run to New York. It
will have the distinction of eliminating a long wait in New Haven
to switch from diesel to electric engines. That alone will allow
the train to reach Penn Station in New York City by 10:10 a.m.,
cutting nearly an hour off the usual run. A second electric-powered
train will leave at 5:00 p.m. making a similar run, and two
northbound trains will leave New York at 8:35 a.m. and 4:55 p.m.
for Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In time, all nine of the runs between the two cities will be
converted to electric as Amtrak augments its current fleet of 50
electric locomotives by at least 15. Improved service, even at this
level, should attract more ridership among travelers now crowding
through Logan Airport.
</P>
<P>
   That modest gain will be eclipsed by the arrival of the really
high-speed Acela trains, which will serve riders all the way to
Washington in runs that will take about six hours. But the Acelas,
originally expected to appear last fall, may not arrive until the
middle of the year after problems with wheels and suspensions have
been cleared up.
</P>
<P>
   The Acelas will, if successful, open the possibility of similar
service in other major transportation corridors around the country,
which could relieve congestion at a number of crowded airports.
</P>
<P>
   These prospects justify congressional as well as public
patience. Congress wants Amtrak to eliminate its operating
deficits, currently running about $500 million annually, by 2002.
That will require added ridership along with higher fares for
better service, and reaching the goal may take longer. The wait,
however, could be worth it. And the process begins Monday morning
at 6:15.

COMMENTARY: OF RUDENESS AND RICHES

<TEXT>
<P>
   Half the commercials during Sunday's Super Bowl will be for
young dot-com companies, and some not-so-young executives in New
York will be watching with mixed emotions. They're delighted at all
the money flowing back east to Madison Avenue and the old-media
world here, but they have some qualms about the people spending it.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a middle-aged executive, someone who has dutifully
climbed the hierarchy of an ad agency or public relations firm, it
is disconcerting to be begging for business from a guy just out of
college worth $15 million. And he still doesn't own a suit.
</P>
<P>
   He may show up late for the meeting, announce he has to leave
early and spend his few precious minutes explaining to you how your
business works. He cuts you off in midsentence. He is on Internet
time. He needs a proposal yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   If you ruin your weekend to provide it, you may never hear back
from him. If you get the job, you get to ruin your weekends for the
next month, at which point you may be ordered to do it all over
again, or simply be replaced by another agency. Or maybe by then
the dot-com will be bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say how widespread dot-com rudeness is, because
most of the oldsters who endure it do not complain publicly. They
are too polite _ and too burdened with mortgages to offend such
rich clients. On the record, they say that most dot-com people are
perfectly professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Off the record, some of these 20-somethings are idiots,'' said
one middle-aged communications consultant. ``They have minimum
experience and maximum attitude. They think they must be smart
because they made so much money, but they don't even know the right
questions to ask. They make you jump through hoops and then don't
even give you the courtesy of a response.''
</P>
<P>
   Another executive, who switched in his 40s from magazine
publishing to the Internet, blames short-term thinking for the
rudeness. ``In old media, you knew you were going to be working
with the same people a year later,'' he said. ``In new media it's
all about today, about this deal. These are not the sort of people
who buy green bananas. They figure if they win today, they'll have
$20 million, and then it won't matter if anyone calls them rude or
unethical.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason McCabe Calacanis, 29, the editor of the Silicon Alley
Reporter, has little patience for such complaints. ``People
interpret this industry as rude because the pace is so fast,'' he
said. ``It's like being on the sidewalks of New York during rush
hour _ you can't expect someone to say `excuse me' if they bump
you. It's like putting Latrell Sprewell in the NBA of the 1950s.
Some people will be appalled because he plays with reckless
abandon. But you know what? It sells tickets and wins games.''
</P>
<P>
   One person who tries to bridge the cultural gap is Jerry
Colonna, 36, the managing partner of Flatiron Partners, the
Internet venture capital arm of Chase Manhattan. He has seen some
old-media types trying to go native when they switch to an Internet
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't put on earrings,'' he said, ``but they try to be
hip by switching to casual clothing _ sometimes inappropriate stuff
like golf pants. It can be like Rodney Dangerfield going back to
school. We advise against it. We say: `We're not asking you to wear
a goatee. We're asking you to provide adult supervision. We need
you to keep the kids from ticking off the clients.'''
</P>
<P>
   Colonna told of one painfully unsupervised encounter of a young
dot-com executive trying to sell Web advertising to a middle-aged
media buyer with a billion-dollar budget: ``The guy shows up late,
not wearing a suit, and he's completely arrogant. Just goes on and
on about how indispensable his company is. Finally the media buyer
stands up, takes a drag on her cigarette and says: `Listen, bucko,
when you've had 40 years of profitability, come back. The meeting's
over.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of revenge, though, is possible only when you have
money that the dot-com people covet. Most New Yorkers are in the
opposite situation. We can't afford to make enemies directly. But
as discreet, sophisticated adults, we could insult them behind
their backs if we had the right term _ something along lines of
``Eurotrash,'' that wonderful weapon used against a previous
invasion of rich louts.
</P>
<P>
   Several possibilities, including ``e-trash'' and ``cyberjerks,''
are being tested in focus groups. Other suggestions are welcome
either by snail mail or the Internet (jtier(at)nytimes.com).
Results will be published next week.

TWO SLAYINGS THIS WEEK RELATED TO OCTOBER 1998 KILLING, SAY POLICE
 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES C. FITZPATRICK  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The drive-by shooting of a young girl 15
months ago in Kansas City, Kan., sparked a quest for vengeance that
left two persons dead this week and seven persons charged with
murder, law enforcement authorities said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Wyandotte County District Attorney Nick Tomasic said the persons
charged with this week's slayings in Kansas City, Kan., ``feel that
justice wasn't done'' in the October 1998 slaying of Shanelle
Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel...that the people responsible got away with it,''
Tomasic said. ``That's the word we're hearing from the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one person was convicted in Shanelle's death, although
testimony at the trial indicated several other persons were in the
car from which shots were fired. Curtis Coleman, 15 at the time of
the shooting, was tried as an adult, convicted of first-degree
murder and sentenced to life in prison. He has no chance of parole
for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tomasic, those bent on vengeance against the others
responsible, or against associates of those responsible, struck
back this week.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph A. Morton, 21, was gunned down Monday night near 20th
Street and Longwood Avenue, just south of Quindaro Boulevard. On
Wednesday afternoon, Christopher B. Union, 33, and a 44-year-old
companion were ambushed near 30th Street and Spring Avenue as they
sat in a parked pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Tomasic said the people who ambushed them fired about 60 rounds
at the pickup, hitting it more than 50 times. Union was killed, but
the other man escaped with no serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Tomasic said he did not think that either Morton or Union was in
the car from which Shanelle Cooper was shot, but he said they could
have been friends or associates of Shanelle's assailants. However,
Tomasic said he believed the 44-year-old man who was wounded
Wednesday had been in the car from which Shanelle was shot.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's and Wednesday's slayings prompted a hurriedly
assembled, high-level meeting Thursday morning between police and
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   At that meeting, several top police officials, including the
acting chief, two majors and a captain, laid out elements of the
case and identified several suspects for Tomasic. Only one, a
19-year-old man, was in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Tomasic said that as the group talked, Lt. Dennis Ware, head of
the homicide unit, was paged about 10:30 or 11 a.m. and learned
that two of those being sought had been arrested at 20th Street and
Grandview Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   With the aid of the FBI and the Kansas City Police Department,
officers then set out to find the four other persons wanted in
connection with the Morton and Union slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Officers spotted the men about 1 p.m. Thursday in a McDonald's
restaurant parking lot at Interstate 70 and Prospect Avenue in
Kansas City. The suspects' car left the lot, and the officers
followed. Other officers placed stop sticks at I-70 and Wyandotte
Street, and the suspects' car drove over them, blowing out the
tires.
</P>
<P>
   The occupants of the car allegedly tossed one gun onto the Lewis
and Clark Viaduct and another over the side before the car came to
a stop about 100 yards into Kansas. Police arrested the four
occupants and recovered the weapons that had been thrown out of the
car.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the defendants are charged with first-degree murder in
both cases. Assistant District Attorney Chris Schneider identified
the adults as Michael B. White and Ronald Weaver, both 18, and the
juveniles as Keith D. Mays, Shawndell D. Mays and Carvelle England,
all 16.
</P>
<P>
   Also charged in the Morton slaying is Sampson England, 18. Peter
J. Davis, 19, is charged in the Union slaying.
</P>
<P>
   All were in custody Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider said all the defendants live in Kansas City, Kan.
Tomasic said he would try to have the juveniles certified to stand
trial as adults. He also said police were looking for suspects in
some other recent shootings believed to be linked to the quest for
vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just hope some innocent person doesn't get killed,''
Tomasic said.
</P>
<P>
   Shanelle Cooper, a fifth-grader at Chelsea Elementary School,
was in her front yard when she was shot in the chest and shoulder
the night of Oct. 14, 1998. Moments earlier, witnesses told police,
a car full of young men had stopped to let Shanelle and two cousins
cross Tennyson Street, where Shanelle lived.
</P>
<P>
   Shanelle's mother, Tracy Mays, speculated at the time that the
shooters were upset at her 15-year-old son and some of his cousins.
She said she didn't know what had started the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Tomasic and a police official said they didn't know whether
Keith Mays and Shawndell Mays _ two of the juveniles arrested
Thursday _ were related to Tracy Mays.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Mays could not be reached for comment Friday.

<P>
   The battle for the premium-fare passenger, in which airlines
offer luxury more typical of a cruise ship, has risen to this: One
major airline will soon introduce a private cabin equipped with a
double bed.
</P>
<P>
   The cabin, on Virgin Atlantic, will go for about $9,000 for one
person _ or about $18,000 for a couple _ on a trans-Atlantic trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to put the romance back into flying,'' said
Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Group, the parent of Virgin
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the real target is business travelers. The airlines
have good reason to be concerned about their comfort. Surveys of
business travelers _ who buy only 20 percent of all tickets but
account for about half of industry profits _ reveal that executives
would rather snooze during long flights than dine on caviar and
Cabernet.
</P>
<P>
   Competition is becoming intense to add more in-flight bunks,
although most are spartan affairs. British Airways will begin
replacing business-class seats in March on flights between New York
and London with single beds that the airline boasts have been
tested by a NASA scientist to deliver better sleep. Virgin Atlantic
is also introducing a new lounger for business class. By spring of
next year, American Airlines will have swapped its first-class
lounge chairs with seats that convert into beds on all
trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific flights.
</P>
<P>
   Seats that fold into single beds have long been reserved for
first-class passengers, who pay about $9,000 for roundtrip
trans-Atlantic slumber. Within the next several months, business
travelers will have comparable cots at about half the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Within three years, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic will
spend about $800 million between them to improve premium service,
beyond a $10 billion plan to buy new jets. British Airways predicts
that its new bed will increase its share of business travelers
between the United States and London, one of the industry's most
profitable routes, by almost 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Flat-lying beds are cherished perks, since few business
travelers have sampled them. A typical British Airways flight from
New York to London has only 14 single beds that are sold as
first-class seats. By reconfiguring business class with new beds,
which are less private than the first-class models, an additional
70 passengers can have them.
</P>
<P>
   In-flight beds on routes across the Pacific are almost
exclusively reserved for first-class passengers. British Airways
said that its business-class bed will be installed on all long-haul
flights, including those to Asia, within the next 18 months. ``One
reason that you are seeing all these improvements among the
airlines now is that the environment has become so competitive,''
said Carl Michel, head of the commercial group for British Airways.
``On some routes, passengers can choose between 10 airlines. ''
</P>
<P>
   The airlines have a long history with beds, even though some
industry executives want to pass them off as new amenities. In the
1930s, the Douglas Sleeper Transport, which was used on long night
flights, carried as many as 16 people in sleeping berths that were
about 3 feet wide and almost 6 1/2 feet long. MGM Grand Air, which
was controlled by Kirk Kerkorian and operated primarily between Los
Angeles and New York, had private compartments in the late 1980s,
with seats that folded into double beds.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, beds disappeared to make room for more seats,
lofting airline revenue. The trend to drop amenities has reversed
recently, with airlines conjuring up new luxuries to lure
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Several major airlines _ including British Airways, Qantas and
Singapore _ have private pods with seats that convert into single
beds as part of first- class service. Such posh features have begun
to drift down into business-class cabins. Passengers who book an
upper-class seat, the equivalent to British Airways' business
class, on any Virgin Atlantic flight can be buffed up by a masseuse
and manicurist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The carriers keep raising the bar in terms of their premium
cabin product,'' said Sam Buttrick, an airline analyst at
PaineWebber. ``The leading- edge business class at its inception
was an enhanced coach. But many business classes are now better
than what was offered in some first-class cabins five or six years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   First class these days tends to be the domain of top corporate
executives, royalty, entertainers and the super rich, with other
affluent people choosing business class.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines are not neglecting economy-class passengers
entirely. Some are adding videos to the backs of seats and making
chairs more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways and Virgin Atlantic conducted extensive research
in developing their beds. Branson said that passengers appreciate
his airlines' luxuries so much that they go out of their way to try
them. About half of Virgin's passengers are willing to be wakened
just to have a complimentary manicure, Branson said.
</P>
<P>
   To introduce the double bed, which will be about 4 1/2 feet wide
and slightly more than 6 feet long, Branson will create a
first-class cabin, which will require that he buy larger jets to
get the extra space.
</P>
<P>
   Branson jokes that the private double berths will herald a new
era for in-flight sex. ``We are legitimizing the mile-high club,''
he said. But he believes that 90 percent of his double-bed
customers will be business travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these people who buy the bed tickets will be
executives trying to get from point A to point B,'' Branson said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, Virgin will also introduce a seat that
converts into a bed for upper-class passengers. Branson admits that
the seat does not lie fully flat, which has already earned snickers
from British Airways executives.
</P>
<P>
   While the Virgin Atlantic recliner will remain in straight rows
of two within the cabin, British Airways will couple its new
business-class beds like lounge chairs. Some will face forward and
others backward.
</P>
<P>
   In part of the bed, British Airways will include an electrical
outlet, so that passengers can use their computers longer, and a
phone. After passengers griped about standing in line to get their
baggage, British Airlines will allow its business travelers to
carry on 41 pounds of luggage, double what they were allowed
before.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of in-flight bunks has ignited the rivalry
between Virgin Atlantic and British Airways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of Virgin's double bed is a marketing gimmick,'' said
Michel. ``Richard Branson has been promising that for years. The
real argument against a double bed is that couples rarely travel
together on business. What happens when one wants to stay up and
the other wants to lie down?''
</P>
<P>
   Affable on most matters, Branson turns almost icy when talking
about his London rival. Noting that British Airways may lose
millions of dollars this year _ the airline's earnings have
declined in recent quarters _ Branson said ``that just shows that
you get your just deserts when you don't keep your quality up.''
</P>
<P>
   More elaborate luxuries are on the way. Airbus said that its
proposed new jumbo jet, which can hold more than 500 passengers,
could be equipped to include several lounges and sleeping
compartments.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways may one day hold parties in its cargo holds. The
airline said it was considering converting some cargo space into a
cinema.

<P>
   With the presidential primary calendar earlier than ever, most
of the candidates were campaigning in New Hampshire last Thursday
when President Clinton delivered his final State of the Union
address. It was not an encouraging contrast.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's speech was far longer than the shrinking
attention span of many Americans, it was on target in returning
time and again to fundamental issues that will shape the nation and
the world well into the century. It set ambitious goals and
proposed concrete steps toward many of them.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential candidates as a group have said less in a year
than Clinton did in 89 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   This surely is one reason a great many Granite Staters _ perhaps
even more than usual _ are still undecided only days before their
primary, a trend described by polls and confirmed by interviews.
Voters are listening attentively to these candidates but yearning
for something more.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Thursday night seemed to have it. His ``bridge to the
21st century'' was pure rhetorical flourish, but he backed it up
with solid proposals on education, job training, Social Security,
and Medicare _ all couched in a strategy to carry this generation
into an unknown era as safely and productively as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential candidates, by contrast, offer remedies that
are timid, incremental, and seem designed not to inspire but to
avoid offending. For boldness, the 1992 campaign was better. Rarely
do the candidates of either party betray any recognition that the
nation and the world are indeed at an extraordinary pivot point in
history, with economies and international relations all linked more
closely than ever and changing with ever-redoubling rapidity.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunities, and threats, of this new, fast-changing world
should be an underlying theme of this year's campaign. There is
still time for the candidates to articulate ambitious, far-sighted
goals _ attracting votes in New Hampshire and around the country.

THROW OUT CONVENTIONAL WISDOM 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing ever seems to pan out the way the experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the ``crowding out'' theory so popular when federal
budget deficits were out of control? The experts said as Uncle Sam
had to borrow more and more to fund growing deficits, private
borrowers would be ``crowded out'' as Washington hogged the pool of
available credit capital.
</P>
<P>
   The result, the experts warned, would be higher prices for
borrowed money in the form of higher interest rates. In reality,
interest rates kept trending downward even as budget deficits kept
expanding. The red ink record was $290 billion in 1992 and experts
were predicting $500 billion deficits by decade's end.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, key rates kept receding from the sky-high levels
of the early '80s to closer to historical norms. Then a funny thing
happened. Two funny things, actually.
</P>
<P>
   One was that deficits went away to be replaced by surpluses
before the decade ended. The revenue bonanza responsible for what
should have been a happy turn of events has even made it possible
for Uncle Sam to pay down some of the publicly held federal debt.
When the Treasury closed the books on 1999, the marketable portion
of the national debt was about $75 billion lower than when 1999
dawned. Not much in the grand scheme of things, to be sure, but
progress nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   So what's happened since surpluses eased federal borrowing
demands on the credit markets? Has anyone contemplated the irony of
how interest rates have been rising now that ``crowding out'' is no
longer a concern?
</P>
<P>
   Despite debt reduction and reduced borrowing needs by Uncle Sam,
the yields on all key Treasury issues have soared. The three-month
bill yields a percentage point more than it did a year ago, and the
30-year bond's yield recently was nearly a point and a half higher.
More astoundingly, the yield on the 10-year note is a couple of
percentage points higher _ even higher than the long-bond yield.
</P>
<P>
   When shorter maturities yield more than longer maturities, the
result is what credit marketeers call an inverted yield curve. It's
not generally viewed as a healthy situation. Inverted yield curves,
it's worth noting, sometimes signal recessions.
</P>
<P>
   So, here's the deal: The market has turned expert wisdom on its
head. All those years of warnings about how big budget deficits
would be destructive to the credit markets never proved valid. Now,
in a period of budget surplus, declining levels of marketable
national debt, and relatively low inflation, the bond market became
a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was the second worst year for bond investors since the
early '70s. Those largely invested in what everyone knows are the
safest of safe investments, long-term Treasury bonds, took one of
the worst baths of all.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on here? What's wrong with this picture? One answer
is that it's probably a good thing to beware of experts bearing
conventional wisdom. Another answer that it's probably a good thing
to be careful what you wish for. How many people loaded up on bonds
in the past couple of years believing that an era of emerging
budget surpluses was a slam-dunk way to make money playing the
credit markets?
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make grown people cry.

EDWARD LOGUE, 78, DIES; FOUGHT URBAN DECAY
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Conn., Mass., N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward J. Logue, an urban development czar who organized radical
renewal programs to combat municipal decay in the Northeast, died
Thursday at his home in West Tisbury, Mass. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   In a career spanning three decades, Logue spent the 1950s
renewing New Haven, Conn., the 1960s revitalizing Boston and the
1970s running building programs in New York state. Throughout, he
said, he was always guided by his humanistic motto of ``planning
with people.''
</P>
<P>
   His critics, however, said he was highhanded, confrontational
and ``another Robert Moses'' _ a reference to the imperious New
York City master builder.
</P>
<P>
   Logue's greatest triumph was his development of the Boston
waterfront, which he called a ``Walkway to the Sea.'' Officially,
it is the Faneuil Hall-Quincy Market restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit a series of themes just right for the time,'' wrote
Bernard J. Frieden and Lynne B. Sagalyn in their book ``Downtown,
Inc.'' (MIT Press, 1989). ``For a mass public that had discovered
gourmet food, the central arcade served it up in volume and with
flair. For a public with a fresh interest in history, the market
presented authentic 150-year-old buildings and cobbled paths rich
with historic associations. For a generation that had discovered
sidewalk cafes and bustling piazzas in Europe, the market brought
these pleasures home.''
</P>
<P>
   Other elements of the ``New Boston'' that Logue devised and
oversaw were the new Government Center, the completion of the
Prudential Center and a broad overhaul of neighborhoods that gave
the city a fresh self-image and attracted tourists from around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   It became one of the most copied community development projects
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Logue made his first big splash in the mid-1950s when Mayor
Richard Lee of New Haven named him development administrator, and
Logue oversaw the rebuilding of the city's downtown. Given broad
authority that previously had been parceled out among several
agencies, Logue reshaped much of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the first, if not the very first, to figure out
how to tap federal funds that were sitting out there waiting to be
used for redevelopment projects,'' said Norman Marcus, who worked
with Logue as general counsel to the New York City Planning
Commission from 1963 to 1985.
</P>
<P>
   But Logue's work in New Haven is not judged a success today.
``It's been heavily criticized,'' Marcus said. Partly that was
because it took too long to do _ quite a few years,'' he said. ``By
the time it was finished, it was too late. The market was gone.
Shopping had shifted from downtown to the malls in the suburbs. The
green had become a wasteland.''
</P>
<P>
   But that would not be understood for years to come, and
consequently Mayor John Collins of Boston hired Logue to head
Boston's Redevelopment Authority. From there Logue went on to New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes to his detriment and sometimes to great acclaim, Logue
thought big.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to say you've got to think big if you want to get
anywhere,'' Marcus said. ``But his appetite was larger than his
ability to digest. He often reached too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a force with tremendous energy,'' Marcus continued.
``Ed wasn't the kind of person who would sit down at the table and
negotiate. He intended to run things by himself. In New York City,
there were people who resisted that. They didn't want another
Robert Moses-type strong man. Ed scared a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus also praised Logue for his daring and imaginativeness.
``When he came to Charlotte Street, a notorious scene of desolation
in the South Bronx, he decided not to do the obvious thing and
build row houses or six-story apartment buildings there,'' Marcus
said. ``Instead, he built single-family houses with yards and white
picket fences. Some people laughed at first. But he was a smart
fellow. That redevelopment worked because he was recreating the
American dream, and they're still there today.''
</P>
<P>
   But apart from the South Bronx, Logue's efforts in New York
City, at the behest of Mayor John Lindsay, are widely regarded as
failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although Mayor Lindsay had hired him, he eventually decided to
back the constituency that opposed Ed,'' Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Joseph Logue was born on Feb. 7, 1921, in Philadelphia,
one of five children of Edward J. and Resina Fay Logue. He was a
graduate of Yale in 1942 and its law school in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, he served in the Air Force, winning the Air
Medal with clusters.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he was legal secretary to Gov. Chester Bowles of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Among other jobs, he led Nelson Rockefeller's New York State
Urban Development Corp. and his own company, Logue Development, a
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Logue is survived by his wife, Margaret DeVane Logue; a son,
William DeVane Logue of West Hartford, Conn.; a daughter,
Katherine, of West Tisbury, and four grandchildren.

<P>
   Francis Haskell, who wrote influential books on art patronage
and the history of taste and who was a professor of art history at
Oxford University from 1967 to 1995, died on Jan. 18 at his home in
Oxford, England. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was liver cancer, said a spokesman for The New York
Review of Books.
</P>
<P>
   Haskell published his first book, ``Patrons and Painters: A
Study in the Relations Between Italian Art and Society in the Age
of the Baroque,'' in 1963. Its emphasis on the social history of
the period was a departure at a time when art scholarship was
largely focused on connoisseurship. Illuminating in its ideas and
engagingly written, the book has long since attained classic
status.
</P>
<P>
   After being appointed professor at Oxford, Haskell embarked on
what proved to be a careerlong investigation of the history of
taste. He focused on the cultural mechanisms that have dictated
patterns of collecting and the rise and fall of artists'
reputations. And he considered how modern attitudes about art,
often very different from those of the past, have shaped the
writing of art history and determined what art is valued and what
is not.
</P>
<P>
   In addressing these ideas, he shifted his attention from the
Baroque to 19th-century academic art, the subject of
``Rediscoveries in Art: Some Aspects of Taste, Fashion and
Collecting in England and France,'' which appeared in 1976 and won
the Mitchell Prize in Art History the next year.
</P>
<P>
   This book was followed by ``Taste and the Antique: The Lure of
Classical Sculpture 1500-1900'' (1981), which was written with
Nicholas Penny and traced the decline and fall in popularity of the
``classical ideal'' in Western sculpture. In 1993 came ``History
and Its Images: Art and the Interpretation of the Past'' (1993),
about ways in which older art has been used and misused as a source
of historical information. At the time of his death, he had
completed a book on the growth of public exhibitions of art in the
19th and 20th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Haskell's books have been widely admired for their historical
breadth, intellectual vitality and stylistic grace. Haskell was
also well known to U.S. readers as an essayist, particularly for
his contributions to The New York Review of Books, where he
appeared regularly since 1964.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Larissa, a former curator of the
Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia.

CHRISTIE'S SAYS IT IS COOPERATING WITH ANTITRUST INQUIRY IN ART
WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Christie's, the worldwide auction house, said Friday
that it had given federal investigators information about
``possible conduct'' at the firm that was relevant to an antitrust
investigation in the art world.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for its cooperation, the company was ``conditionally
accepted'' into a Department of Justice amnesty program, according
to a statement by the company's general counsel, Jo Backer Laird.
She said the conduct had taken place before new ownership took over
a year and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York
shook up Manhattan's rarefied art world three years ago by
subpoenaing truckloads of documents from Christie's; its archrival,
Sotheby's; and more than a dozen more of the city's most prominent
dealers. Among numerous practices said to be under investigation
was possible collusion by Christie's and Sotheby's in setting
sellers' commissions, fees that sellers paid to the auction houses.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Laird refused to describe the nature of the information
presented to the investigators or the specifics of what its
involvement in an amnesty program would entail.
</P>
<P>
   A call to the U.S. attorney's office was not returned. Law
enforcement officials said that subjects of civil prosecution can
be treated more leniently if they volunteer information about
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The statement came a month after Christopher M. Davidge,
Christie's chief executive for six years, abruptly resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's was bought in 1998 by Francois Pinault, the French
investor who owns Au Printemps, France's largest department store,
and Chateau Latour wines.
</P>
<P>
   Until March 1995, the two dominant houses charged flat
commissions of 10 percent on sales. Then Christie's announced a
change, to take effect that September, that replaced the flat
commission with a sliding scale ranging from 2 percent to 10
percent, depending on the size of the sale. Shortly after the
Christie's announcement, Sotheby's followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   Any collusion in setting the commissions would constitute an
illegal restraint of trade under the Sherman Antitrust Act.
Penalties for violations can include substantial fines and
imprisonment of up to three years.
</P>
<P>
   If the companies had fixed their rates, they would have
prevented sellers from trying to negotiate with the two houses for
better fees.
</P>
<P>
   While neither Sotheby's nor Christie's would discuss the
investigation, people familiar with the investigation said that
employees, ranging from secretaries to top executives, have been
subpoenaed to testify. Galleries, as well as the auction houses,
are said to have spent tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees
in the course of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation surfaced publicly in filings by Christie's
with the London Stock Exchange in 1997. At the time, the company
said that the Justice Department was ``seeking documents relating
to the conduct of the U.S. art market'' and said that it ``believes
it has acted properly at all times.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company moved its New York headquarters to new
offices in Rockefeller Center. Around the world, it auctions more
than $1.6 billion in fine art and decorative objects annually.

POLITICAL ACTION FOR THE ARTS

<P>
   The National Endowment for the Humanities ought to be a real
endowment. Instead of having its chairman begging for funds in the
halls of Congress, the endowment should have a pot of money and
live off the interest. A $4 billion pot, says the endowment's
chairman, William Ferris, could yield millions of dollars a year. A
similar pot should support the National Endowment for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Built up over time with public and private dollars, actual
endowments would be a buffer against stormy politics _ legislators
who cut their teeth threatening to slash or eliminate funding for
the humanities and the arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're wasting time with minds at risk,'' Ferris says of the
perpetual uphill fund-raising battle.
</P>
<P>
   He has a point. Legislators may justifiably want to criticize
specific actions taken by the endowments. But that should not
obscure the larger mission of promoting creative American work and
thought.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, the national arts and humanities endowments push
excellence. One example is ``My History is America's History,'' a
Web site and guidebook from the National Endowment for the
Humanities. It encourages people to be historians, researching
their family backgrounds and adding the results to an on-line
collection.
</P>
<P>
   In December the National Endowment for the Arts announced $20
million in grants.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the endowments' successes also show their financial
limitations. Great educational programs, for example, are available
only in some schools.
</P>
<P>
   Calling for a true endowment is good work for any or all of the
presidential candidates. And for now it's an easy job. A champion
can launch the idea _ even raise start-up funding _ and pass the
torch to future leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of government as usual and news stories about battered
defenders of culture, there could be interest-bearing accounts that
finance the best American creativity.

FRIEDRICH GULDA, 69, CLASSICAL-MUSIC REBEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Austria)  (js) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Friedrich Gulda, an iconoclastic Austrian pianist and composer
who was as renowned for his jazz performances as for the
intellectual clarity of his Bach, Mozart and Beethoven
interpretations, died on Thursday at his home in Weissenbach,
Austria. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   The Austria Press Agency reported that the cause was heart
failure.
</P>
<P>
   Gulda rebelled against the formalities of the classical music
world in grand and often comical ways. In the 1950s, he began
sitting in with jazz bands _ sometimes celebrated ones, like Dizzy
Gillespie's _ while he was touring as a recitalist and concerto
soloist. By the mid-1950s he was including jazz improvisations on
his recital programs, and by the early 1970s he was refusing to
announce his recital programs in advance. He reportedly once
performed a concert in the nude, and last March he faxed news
agencies a false report of his own death, apparently to promote a
concert at which he was to be resurrected.
</P>
<P>
   His eccentricities had a marked effect on the classical side of
Gulda's career: he went from being a pianist once described by
Harold C. Schonberg in The New York Times as ``a continuation of
the great German traditions of piano playing exemplified by
Schnabel and Backhaus'' to one with a small but devoted following.
He continued to perform in Europe _ he was planning to celebrate
his 70th birthday with a concert next May _ and he made plenty of
recordings. But his appearances in the United States were rare
after the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Although it often seemed that he had torpedoed the classical
side of his career with misguided antics, Gulda usually gave the
impression that his rebellion was rooted in deeply held principles.
Having accepted the Beethoven Bicentennial Ring from the Vienna
Academy of Music in 1970, he quickly reconsidered and returned it,
citing his objections to the conservativism of classical music
education.
</P>
<P>
   Still, listeners who kept tabs on Gulda through his recordings
were rewarded by illuminating performances in which the elucidation
of musical structure was prized over virtuosic flashiness. His
recording of both books of Bach's ``Well-Tempered Clavier'' on the
Philips label is highly regarded among collectors, and he was
represented by two volumes in the Philips Records ``Great Pianists
of the 20th Century'' compendium, released last year. Typically,
his installments included George Shearing's ``Lullaby of Birdland''
alongside the Chopin Ballades and a Beethoven concerto.
</P>
<P>
   Gulda was born in Vienna on May 16, 1930, and studied at the
Grossmann Conservatory and the Vienna Academy of Music. His public
performing career began immediately after he won the Geneva
International Pianists' Competition at age 16.
</P>
<P>
   His interest in jazz blossomed in the 1950s as well. Although he
had performed improvisatory jazz informally during his earlier U.S.
tours, in 1956 he made a celebrated debut at Birdland in New York.
He also performed at the Newport Jazz Festival. He started several
groups of his own, from small combos to a big band, the Eurojazz
Orchestra. In 1968 he established the International Musikforum, a
school for students who wanted to learn improvisation, in Ossiach,
Austria.
</P>
<P>
   He never abandoned classical music, but he insisted that his
jazz and classical performing be regarded as equal aspects of his
musical personality, with composition often bridging the two. His
discography frequently drove home that point.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s he recorded two very different albums in
close proximity: one was ``The Meeting,'' a set of improvisatory
duets with the jazz pianist Chick Corea; the other was Mozart's
Concerto No. 23, with the early-music specialist Nikolaus
Harnoncourt. Around the same time, he also released a recording
that brought together a probing, propulsive reading of Beethoven's
Sonata in C minor (Op. 111) with his own bleak ``Winter
Meditation.''
</P>
<P>
   As a composer, Gulda was an eclectic who drew on his jazz
interests for orchestral works like ``The Veiled Old Land,'' ``The
Excursion,'' the Symphony in F and a free adaptation of
Shakespeare's ``Measure for Measure'' called ``Drop-Out, Oder
Gustav der Letzte.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two sons, Paul and Rico.

FASCISTIC FORCE IN AUSTRIA

<P>
   As a general rule, the European Union's reluctance to meddle in
the domestic politics of its member states betokens a sage respect
for the necessary balance between national independence and
continental cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   But the current case of Austria, where the mainstream
conservative People's Party is negotiating the terms of a governing
coalition with the extremist Freedom Party, justifies the European
Union's unusual interference in one country's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Freedom Party, Joerg Haider, has become
notorious for his praise of Adolf Hitler's employment policies and
for declaring that veterans of the Nazis' Waffen SS are ``decent
people of good character.'' Under political pressure, the demagogic
Haider has offered apologies for these obscene public statements.
</P>
<P>
   But Haider's fascistic penchants are not confined to nostalgia
for the Third Reich. In last October's parliamentary elections, he
appealed to xenophobia and racism, insinuating that foreign
immigrants, immoral and inferior, were stealing Austrian jobs. He
also intimated that the EU was complicit with immigrants in
depriving native Austrians of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The center-right People's Party, Haider's would-be partner in a
new government, initially dismissed objections from EU members by
claiming they came only from leftists.
</P>
<P>
   Then the French president, Jacques Chirac, telephoned Austria's
President Thomas Klestil to express what a French government
spokesman described as a ``deep concern about the evolution of the
political situation in Austria.'' Chirac's conservative credentials
can hardly be questioned. His meddling in Austrian politics was a
justified effort to signal Vienna that the broad spectrum of
European democracy must not include the political heirs of fascism.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium has called a special meeting of the EU to help deter
Austria from making itself a pariah among the democratic states of
Europe. Political leaders in Vienna ought to heed the good counsel
of their fellow Europeans.

<P>
   Justice M. Dolores Denman, the first woman to serve as presiding
judge in the Appellate Division of New York state Supreme Court,
died on Jan. 17 at her second home in Naples, Fla. She was 68 and
lived in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling with cancer for months, she announced in late
December that she planned to step down from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Denman, a former Buffalo city judge and Erie County Court
judge, was elected to state Supreme Court in 1976. The next year,
Gov. Hugh L. Carey appointed her to the Appellate Division, Fourth
Department, covering western New York.
</P>
<P>
   After an unsuccessful run for state attorney general in 1978,
she was re-elected to state Supreme Court with bipartisan support
in 1979 and was reappointed as an associate justice of the
Appellate Division in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Mario M. Cuomo named her presiding justice for the 22
western counties of the Fourth Department in 1991. She also served
on the five-member administrative board of the state's Unified
Court System.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Dolores Welch was born in Buffalo. She was a 1957 honors
graduate in English and American studies at the University of
Buffalo. She earned her law degree at its School of Law in 1965 and
began her legal career that year in the Panama Canal Zone. She was
an assistant prosecutor in Erie County before becoming a city judge
in Buffalo in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her husband of 35 years, James Denman; two
sons, Daniel Stanton of Ridgewood, N.J., and James L. Denman of
