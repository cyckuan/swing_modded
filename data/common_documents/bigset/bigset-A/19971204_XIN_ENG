<HEADLINE> Baht Plunges to New Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The baht plunged further today,
setting a new record low of more than 42 baht against the US
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The selling rate today closed at 42.50-42.65 baht against one
dollar on the onshore market and it was once quoted at 43.05 baht
against one dollar.
</P>
<P>
On the offshore market, the baht also closed at 43.30-42.85
against the dollar today.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai today told reporters that the
slump of the baht today was mainly triggered by the turmoil on the
international monetary market.
</P>
<P>
However, local analysts said that heavy selling of the baht for
dollars by local businessmen to repay the dollar debts by the end
of this year attributed to the plunge of the baht today.

<HEADLINE> EU Adopts Guidelines for 1998 Employment Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The young and adult alike will
be offered fresh starts to land jobs next year as the European
Union is striving to improve employment in its member states.
</P>
<P>
The striving effort was adopted today by the European
Commission following the conclusion of the European Council on
employment held on November 20 and 21.
</P>
<P>
Every unemployed young person will be offered a new start, in
the form of training, retraining, work practice or job, before
reaching six months of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Unemployed adults are also offered fresh starts before reaching
12 months of unemployment, according to the final proposal adopted
for guidelines for member states' employment policies for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The proposal highlighted the EU's employment strategy of
employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal
opportunities for men and women.
</P>
<P>
Active measures will be required of member states to improve
the employability of the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
A fixed target will be set for increasing the number of the
unemployed who are offered training or retraining to gradually
achieve the average of the three most employed member states, or
20 percent at least.
</P>
<P>
Social partners in member states are also urged by the proposal
to conclude as soon as possible agreements with a view to
increasing the possibilities for training, work experience and
traineeship to promote employability.
</P>
<P>
Actions of the member states alone will not suffice, said the
commission, the executive agency of the 15-nation union which now
has an average unemployment rate at 10.7 percent as of October.
</P>
<P>
The commission also appealed to school systems in member states
to improve their curricula in order to reduce substantially the
number of young people who drop out of schools early on.
</P>
<P>
The commission proposal urged schools to equip young people
with greater ability to adapt to technological and economic
changes and with skills relevant to the labor market by means of
implementing or developing apprenticeship training where
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
The final proposal will be adopted by the social affairs
council meeting of the EU slated for December 15.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Heads for Reconciling with Qatar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- President Hosni Mubarak today
embarked on a voyage aimed to clean grudges with the Gulf light
weight Qatar through the mediation of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak left here on a previously unannounced visit to Riyadh,
accompanied by ministers of information and foreign affairs,
presidential cabinet chief and political advisor.
</P>
<P>
The visit came one day after Mubarak received a message from
Saudi King Fahd on a fence-mending between Egypt and Qatar and sent
his foreign minister Amr Moussa to Riyadh on a lightning visit to
get acquainted with the details.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has been on good terms with both Egypt and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani today
regretted growing strains with Egypt and announced he is leaving
for Saudi Arabia today to remove misunderstanding, the Qatari News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a pre-departure statement at Doha Airport, the emir told
reporters that he will meet with his "brothers" King Fahd and
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
He said he could not miss this chance to express his
appreciation of King Fahd's initiative and sincere efforts exerted
by Saudi Crown Prince, Deputy Premier and Head of the National
Guard Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian-Qatari ties deteriorated in October as Egypt was ready
to boycott the fourth Middle East and North Africa Economic
Conference, of which Qatar was the host. Cairo cited lack of
progress in the Middle East peace process as the reason for its
absence at the Arab-Israeli conference in Doha.
</P>
<P>
Qatar responded with a ban on the entry of nationals of Egypt
and other nine countries as a security precaution for the Doha
meeting, infuriating Cairo and other Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
On November 12, a senior Qatari official accused Cairo of being
the "maestro" in an abortive 1996 coup to oust the Gulf sheikdom's
emir, who himself toppled his father in a bloodless palace coup in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has denied the charges and repeatedly implied that Cairo
was above trading insults with Doha.
</P>
<P>
As the crack deepened, Egyptian foreign minister Moussa last
week asked Qatari ambassador to Cairo for an explanation of the
coup accusation and recalled his ambassador to Doha for the second
time in less than three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Moussa had said relations with Qatar would be kept even at the
least possible levels so as not to worsen the already tense
inter-Arab relations.

<HEADLINE> Blair Positive N.Ireland Peace to Be Settled by May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said he believed a Northern Ireland peace deal could be
reached by next May.
</P>
<P>
"We have the May deadline and I think that we can make it,"
Blair said in an interview with Irish television today.
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a recognition on the part of them that
progress is there to be made soon rather than later. Obviously we
will do everything we can to move it on," he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Ireland set next May as the target for the parties
to produce proposals that the government will put to referendums
in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
The multi-party peace talks on the fate of Britain's divided
province started in September after the Irish Republican Army
(IRA) called a cease-fire in July. The truce enabled the IRA's
political wing Sinn Fein to join other parties in Northern Ireland
to the peace talks together with the two governments for the first
time to try to find an end to decades of conflict.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three high-security long-term IRA prisoners were
transferred from British jail to a prison in the Irish Republic
today, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Their transfer followed top-level contact between London and
Dublin. It is seen as a key confidence-building move aimed at
advancing the slow-going peace process.

<HEADLINE> US Congressman for Talks in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi today held talks with visiting U.S. congressman Tom
Campbell on regional and bilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from the Foreign Ministry was quoted by the
Ethiopian News Agency as saying that Premier Meles briefed the
congressman on efforts underway on the part of the different
Somali factions to bring about national reconciliation in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said, the two sides have also discussed the
initiative of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development
(IGAD) in helping the conflicting parties in Sudan, who are
engaged in a war that has so far cost the lives of more than a
million people, to reach a negotiated settlement.
</P>
<P>
Meles also briefed Campbell about Ethiopia's difference with
the International Monetary Fund, and told him that the government
of Ethiopia will go ahead with its reform measures in spite of
the differences, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the spokesman, Ethiopian Foreign
Minister Seyoum Mesfin today also held talks with the visiting
U.S. congressman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said, Seyoum had discussed with the congressman
about the situation in Somalia, Sudan and countries of the Great
Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
The two sides, he said, also discussed issues regarding to the
use of the Nile water.
</P>
<P>
Seyoum told Campbell that all the countries of the Nile river
should be able to tackle the problem standing in the way of
communal usage of the river.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's desire to obtain her share of the waters of the
Nile is ever more pressing, due to the nation's increasing water
need for irrigation, hydropower generation and other purposes,
Seyoum said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. congressman arrived here yesterday for a four-day
working visit to Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> Europeans More Eurosceptic Than 2 Years Ago: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Four Europeans in 10 now
believe their countries benefit from European Union membership
whereas 36 percent, or almost as many, believe otherwise.
</P>
<P>
The latest Eurobarometer poll conducted by the European
Commission, published today in the European Report journal, found
that European citizens have become more sceptical than two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
The trend of having come to doubt the benefits of EU membership
in the last two years has been particularly strong in Italy and
Belgium while support for the union has increased in Denmark,
Luxembourg, Britain and Spain.
</P>
<P>
Forty-six percent of the Europeans polled regard membership as
a "good thing," 15 percent as a "bad thing," and 30 percent have
no opinion either way.
</P>
<P>
A majority of citizens, 51 percent, claim to be Europeans up to
a point while the proportion of those faithful to their national
status remains constant at 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
Support for the single currency has also fallen over the past
two years, down by 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Forty-seven percent of the Europeans support the introduction
of the single currency in 1999 whereas 40 percent are against it
and 13 percent do not know for sure.
</P>
<P>
Questioned over EU enlargement, the Europeans greatly supported
the accession of Switzerland (72 percent) and Norway (69 percent).
</P>
<P>
These were followed by Iceland (56 percent), Malta (49
percent), Poland (46 percent), the Czech Republic (43 percent) and
Cyprus (40 percent).

<HEADLINE> Further German Rate Hike Unlikely This Year: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the German
central bank predicted today that Germany is unlikely to take
another move to raise its key interest rates in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Ernst Welteke, a board member of the Bundesbank, told the
German investment magazine Boerse Online that a rate hike was not
an issue for the moment because there was no major inflationary
danger in Germany and Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, he also cautioned that the situation might change if
the U.S. dollar climbed sharply against the German mark in the
coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
Michael Heise, chief economist with the German DG Bank, today
said that he did not expect any German rate increases before
February or March next year.
</P>
<P>
The modest domestic economic growth and the slow price
increases did not justify a rate hike in Germany, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that a dollar exchange rate, which currently
fluctuated between 1.70 and 1.80 German marks and could even
increase to 1.85 marks next year, would not arouse major
inflationary risks in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Germany's two key interest rates, the discount rate and the
Lombard rate, have been kept unchanged at 2.5 percent and 4.5
percent since April 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the other benchmark rate, the securities repurchase
rate, was raised sharply from 3.0 percent to 3.3 percent in early
October.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Close Down Factories Without Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government today
warned to close companies without adequate health and safety
measures in order to reduce occupational deaths and injuries.
</P>
<P>
Opening a seminar on health and safety at work places
organized by the National Social Security Authority (NSSA) here,
Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare Minister Florance
Chitauro said stringent measures to ensure improvement in safety
at work places will continue to be implemented.
</P>
<P>
"The NSSA will continue to be more aggressive and even close
down more companies or work places which are sub-standard in the
year 1998," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision to close down the affected factories
came after a research which shows that 80 percent of work places
lack adequate health and safety measures.
</P>
<P>
The lack of proper management of health and safety issues in
the work environment resulted in disabling injuries and deaths on
workers averaging over 20,000 annually for the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Chitauro said the NSSA would next year implement a program
called "results oriented program" in which health and safety
officers would be placed at work places with high rate accidents
to monitor implementation of safety programs.
</P>
<P>
This year the NSSA issued about 55 prohibition notices to
companies and work places with sub-standard work conditions that
have injured or killed employees.
</P>
<P>
The prohibition notices said that the companies and work
places would be forced to close if they do not improve the safety
conditions.

<HEADLINE> Astronauts Aboard Columbia Begin Second Spacewalk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Two astronauts aboard the
space shuttle Columbia today floated out the hatch of shuttle and
successfully conducted five hours of test for space station
equipment during their spacewalk.
</P>
<P>
American Winston Scott and Japanese Takao Doi floated out of
Columbia's airlock into the shuttle's cargo bay at 4:20 a.m. (0920
GMT) to begin their second spacewalk of the mission. They set up a
small hand-operated crane that NASA designed to help spacewalking
astronauts assemble the new international space station. Scott
then used the crane to move a box.
</P>
<P>
In the outing hours, Scott also held up the robotic camera and
then let go, watching as the camera slowly propelled itself with
little jet thrusters. The roving eye flitted high above the
shuttle's open cargo bay, sending live views of Columbia and the
astronauts down to Earth.
</P>
<P>
The crewmen couldn't conduct the test during last week's
spacewalk because they had to chase a runaway science satellite.
</P>
<P>
The satellite rescue took up almost half of the seven and a
half hours during their November 24 spacewalk. Scott and Doi did
not have time to use the crane to lift a 50-pound object or to
release the prototype camera.
</P>
<P>
The second spacewalk was urgently arranged by NASA before the
satellite was back on board the shuttle for Friday's trip home
because space station construction is to start within half a year
and there was no arrangement for more spacewalks before the first
assembly flight next June.
</P>
<P>
A crane similar to the one tested will be used all the time to
move objects outside the space station.

<HEADLINE> Toyota to Set Up Auto Assembly Plant in Northern France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese auto-maker Toyota
will set up a new assembly plant in Valenciennes in northern
France, which will create about 1,000 jobs in the first phase of
development by 2001, said government officials today.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and Toyota President
Hiroshi Okuda will officially announce the plan next Tuesday, said
reports.
</P>
<P>
Toyota will invest 3.5 billion francs (600 million US dollars)
in the first phase by 2001, and 1.5 billion francs (250 million
dollars) in the second phase by 2005, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
The plant will be capable of producing 100,000 automobiles each
year from 2001, and will double its capacity of production by
2005.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Industry, Finance and Economy Dominique
Strauss-Kahn confirmed today that Toyota will set up an auto
assembly plant in France without providing further details.
</P>
<P>
The installation of a plant in France will allow Toyota to
pierce through the French market, where it sold only 17,562
vehicles in 1996, or 0.8 percent of the total sold in the country,
said Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
The location of Valenciennes will also allow Toyota to expand
its market in nearby Germany and get back-up from its plant in
Britain through the Channel Tunnel.
</P>
<P>
The strong presence of automobile industry in northern France,
its proximity to Belgium and the Netherlands, the good quality of
the local labor force as well as France's decision to enter the
European monetary union in the first wave are also elements which
encouraged Toyota to choose Valenciennes to establish the plant,
said AFP.
</P>
<P>
Among the competitors of Valenciennes were Longway in the
Lorraine region of France, Ireland and Poland.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Ruling MPs Support Netanyahu Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen members of the
Knesset (Parliament) of Israel's ruling parties have issued a
statement in support of the cabinet plan of conditional troop
withdrawal from the West Bank, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The statement, initiated by Roman Bronfman of the Yisrael
Ba'aliya (Israel Immigration) party, also called for advancing the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The statement were signed by Knesset members of the Yisrael
Ba'aliya party, the Third Way party, the Gesher (Bridge) party and
other coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
Israeli cabinet Sunday approved Netanyahu's proposal to pull
out troops from West Bank under the condition that the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) steps up fight against terrorism. But the
plan set no date and extent of the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties, however, lashed out at the plan, calling it
as a hindrance to peace. Labor Party whip Raanan Cohen described
Netanyahu's plan as "the continued burial of the peace process."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Labor will submit a no-confidence motion
against the Netanyahu government.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing Meretz leader Yossi Sarid charged that Netanyahu
only pretended to push forward the peace process and said the
government decision has nothing new.
</P>
<P>
But Likud spokeswoman Ronit Eckstein rejected the charges of
the oppositions, saying "it is difficult for the Labor to accept
the fact that while the left-wing parties sing and dream about
peace, it is only the Likud government which furthers a stable and
safe peace agreement."
</P>
<P>
The Third Way party whip Yehuda Harel called on the Labor "to
ignore narrow political interests" and to support Netanyahu in
carrying out the pullback plan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel's four-member ministerial committee,
authorized to draw up a map and timetable for the withdrawal,
convened this morning. It was expected to reach a conclusion as
early as Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Resents Russian Arms Export to Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu today sent a harsh message to Russian President
Boris Yeltsin over Russia's supply of missile technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The message was given by Netanyahu to visiting Russian Deputy
Foreign Minister Victor Possavalyuk when they held talks here in
the Prime Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Office said Netanyahu delivered the
"sharp message" to Yeltsin "despite good relations between Israel
and Russia and the desire to advance those relations."
</P>
<P>
In the message, the statement said, Netanyahu hinted that
bilateral relations could be harmed by Moscow's continued supply
of ballistic technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told Possavalyuk that Israel viewed with great
severity the supply of such technology to Iran, because it is "a
matter of survival for Israel." "The arming of Iran automatically
endangers not only Israel, but other countries as well, including
Russia itself," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
Possavalyuk said he would pass the message on to Yeltsin,
adding that in any case he hoped the relations between the two
countries would remain good and not be harmed.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Netanyahu reviewed the diplomatic process
in the region and Israeli Cabinet's Sunday decision on
conditionally carrying out the second-phase Israeli troop
redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Possavalyuk said Russia put emphasis on the redeployments. He
added that in order to improve bilateral relations, Russian Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin would visit Israel in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
Possavalyuk, who was appointed by Yeltsin as the Middle East
peace envoy, arrived here for a visit to explore ways of pushing
forward Israeli-Palestinian peace process and reviving
Israeli-Syrian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He already met with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy
Tuesday, voicing Russia's readiness to help renew the multilateral
talks which he said are a key component of the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The Russian envoy even offered Moscow as a venue for such
talks.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Court Orders Striking Workers Back to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 3 (Xinhua) -- After several hours'
deliberations, Israeli National Labor Court judges today ordered
the striking Trade Union workers to return to their jobs by 6
p.m. this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide strike was launched by Israeli Trade Union this
morning in protest of government plans for wages reform and
privatization.
</P>
<P>
Upon receiving the court order, the Trade Union leaders have
been meeting to consider their next steps and how to respond to
the court decision.
</P>
<P>
Trade Union Chairman Amir Peretz is due to meet with Finance
Minister Ya'akov Neeman at the Presidential residence in Jerusalem
this evening in an effort to work out the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman has called for a resolution for
the controversy between the Treasury and Trade Union in order to
"prevent the collapse of the economy and services".
</P>
<P>
Some 700,000 workers reportedly took part in today's stoppage,
which paralyzed many sectors of national economy.
</P>
<P>
Most government offices and companies were shut down while
hospitals, telecommunications, banks, post offices and other
services were affected.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Manufacture Association estimated the damage from
today's strike at 53 million shekels (about 15 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The industrial action was triggered by Neeman's remarks on
Monday, in which he called striking workers "exploding bombs" and
"enemies from within." Peretz declared the strike Tuesday at an
emergency gathering of thousands of union members in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The strike was the latest in a Trade Union battle against
government economic reform plans, which have sparked fears that
worker's rights would be prejudiced.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, 150,000 clerks and municipal workers staged a
two-day strike against cost-cutting measures taken by local
authorities. They resumed work only after the National Labor
Court issued a back-to-work order.

<HEADLINE> France: NATO Military Structure Reform Incomplete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- France said today that the reform
of the NATO integrated military structure remains "incomplete" and
thus does not allow France to re-integrate into it.
</P>
<P>
"The reform of the military structure of NATO remains
incomplete in what concerns the development within the heart of
the alliance of the European identity of security and defense and
in what concerns the need of a better sharing of responsibilities
between Europeans and Americans," said French Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
She said that because of this, France considers it not prime
time for it to return to the structure now.
</P>
<P>
But she praised the agreement reached in Brussels Tuesday by
NATO countries on the reform of the military structure as "an
important step in the process of adaptation of NATO" and toward "a
greater flexibility and a rationalization of the military
structure of the alliance."
</P>
<P>
France abstained from Tuesday's voting at the half-yearly
defense ministers' session in the NATO headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
"The reform should continue and France remains ready for
dialogue," said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
The Western military alliance reached an agreement upon its new
command structure after two major disputes were solved via mutual
agreements between Greece and Turkey, Britain and Spain.
</P>
<P>
NATO plans to reduce its regional headquarters from 65 to 20
and make regional headquarters more international with up to 50
percent of officers from countries other than the host country.
</P>
<P>
Spain will be able to return by 1999 to the NATO integrated
military structure from which it withdrew in 1986, along with the
entry into the structure by three new members of NATO: Poland, the
Czech Republic and Hungary.

<HEADLINE> US New Home Sales Take Slim Drop in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. new home sales
declined in October, for the second time in three months, but
still remained at a relative high level, the Commerce Department
said here today.
</P>
<P>
New single-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 797,000, 1.7 percent lower from September.
</P>
<P>
However, nationwide sales for this year's first 10 months were
running 6 percent ahead of the same period last year. Besides,
October also marked the 22nd month of sales higher than 700,000,
the longest such stretch since the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that the robust job market and low mortgage
rates are forces behind the development trend. Nevertheless,
they're expecting sales to level off next year.
</P>
<P>
The inventory of unsold new homes totaled 290,000 in October.
That's a 4.4 month supply at the current sales rate. It was the
10th consecutive month that the ratio has been below five months,
the most since the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
By region, sales of new homes fell 1.6 percent in the Northeast
to 63,000, the lowest level since May 1996, and 1.5 percent in the
Midwest to 128,000, the lowest since March. They plunged 5.7
percent in the West to 230,000. In the South, sales rose 1.3
percent to 377,000, the best since February.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide median price of a new home was 141,500 U.S.
dollars in October, down 1.6 percent from a year earlier.

<P>
MOSCOW, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian Premier Viktor
Chernomyrdin and his visiting Yugoslav counterpart, Radoje Kontic,
today held two-hour talks and signed a package of documents on
further development of bilateral cooperation, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed an agreement on granting a state credit by
Russia to Yugoslavia to finance deliveries of Russian equipment,
goods and services.
</P>
<P>
They also concluded a memorandum to liberalize trade between
Russia and Yugoslavia, an agreement on military and technical
cooperation as well as a program of cooperation in culture,
education and science for 1998-2000.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting Chernomyrdin told reporters that Russia will
do its utmost for the earliest return of Yugoslavia to the United
Nations as well as other international political, economic and
financial organizations.
</P>
<P>
Kontic, for his part, praised Russia's positive role in
settling the crisis on the Balkans. He underlined that, apart from
problems of the peace process in the region, special attention at
the talks was given to improvement of Russian-Yugoslav trade and
economic relations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He noted, "The reached understandings give guarantees for
normalizing our relations."
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav premier arrived in Moscow Tuesday evening for a
two-day official visit, the first one by Yugoslavia's head of
government to Russia since the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was
formed in 1992.

<HEADLINE> UK Launches Pre-Christmas Anti-Drink-Drive Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
launched a pre-Christmas anti-drink-drive campaign which urges
motorists to have no alcohol at all before driving, said local
press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The central message of the 2 million pound (3.4 million US
dollar) campaign is to "Have none for the road" and that any
drinking increases the risk of having an accident that can cause
death or serious injury.
</P>
<P>
The three-week television and radio advertising blitz for the
first time targets young women as one of the groups most likely to
offend in addition to the traditional target groups of 17 to
24-year-old males and middle-aged men.
</P>
<P>
The campaign came in advance of government proposals to reduce
the permitted alcohol limit.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that government officials will consult in the
new year on a scheme to decrease the limit from 80 milligrams of
alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood to 50 milligrams.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Transport Minister Gavin Strang said that he wanted
to cut the annual deaths in drink-related accidents, which have
remained static at about 540 for each of the last four years.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraq announced today that all
the removed under-monitoring equipments had been fully returned to
their original places, a sign of Baghdad's cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency INA quoted a senior official as saying
that the Iraqi leadership issued directives to this effect so that
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on eliminating Iraqi weapons of
mass destruction can easily resume its work in the country.
</P>
<P>
The equipment was evacuated to other places as a precautionary
measure to ensure their safety against potential U.S. military
attack, the Iraqis had claimed.
</P>
<P>
Hussan Mohammed Ameen, director general of Iraqi National
Monitoring Department, the Iraqi counterpart of UNSCOM, said the
U.N. arms inspectors, who resumed their work on November 22,
visited all the sites from which the equipment was removed.
</P>
<P>
They had ascertained that the equipment returned had absolutely
not been used over the period from October 30 to November 22 when
inspection was suspended, said Ameen.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official demanded that UNSCOM objectively present
the U.N. Security Council and world public opinion with the
results it had concluded in this respect.
</P>
<P>
U.N. arms inspection entered its 12th day in a row since the
arms experts returned to Baghdad on October 21. The Iraqi have
been cooperative with no incidents being reported during the
inspection.

<HEADLINE> Blair Halts New Gas-Fired Power Stations to Save Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said today he would do everything he could to assist the
coal industry.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in parliament, the prime minister, "We want to
preserve as much of the deep-mined coal industry as we possibly
can."
</P>
<P>
Miners, who have seen their numbers plummet in the past decade
from nearly 250,000 to 20,000, have called for help to prevent the
closure of more coal mines because of a fall in sales to power
generators.
</P>
<P>
To aid the coal mine sector, Blair announced a moratorium on
power station approvals, saying that the National Grid Group Plc
had been advising the government for some time of the dangers of
relying too much on gas-powered fuel stations.
</P>
<P>
The coal industry itself has predicted up to 5,000 jobs may go
and eight pits could close as the country's biggest mining firm --
RJB Mining Plc -- has a hard time securing new supply contracts.
</P>
<P>
"We are working as intensively as we can to try and ensure that
the generators and RJB come together," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
"We obviously want to preserve as much of the deep mined coal
industry as we possibly can," he added.
</P>
<P>
There were 170 coal mines in 1984 but the number has been
reduced to a mere 23. At the same time, nearly 250,000 people
worked in the coal mines in the early 1980s, but their numbers
have dwindled rapidly as cheaper and cleaner gas replaced coal as
the electricity generators' favorite fuel.
</P>
<P>
The advance of gas is now gathering pace as long-term coal
supply contracts between RJB and the generators expire on March
31.

BONN, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The German airline Lufthansa
announced today that it will use a special electronic detector to

</P>
<P>
The new device is said to be able to detect the radio waves
sent by a working mobile phone. From now on until the end of
January, a total of 30 such devices will be tested on Lufthansa
flights, the company said.
</P>
<P>
The on-board use of mobile phone is banned because it can

by the German government in summer, an offender could face up to
two years in jail in Germany.

<HEADLINE> France Open to Take Part in Compensation Fund of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- France today said it remains
open to participate in the international fund to compensate the
families of the victims of Nazi robbery during World War II, but
said it has not taken any decision on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the fund was announced Tuesday in London
by the United States and Britain at the international conference
on Nazi gold.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said
that France will not make any official announcement during the
four-day conference in London, which the French authorities
described as "purely historical" rather than political in nature.
</P>
<P>
France is expected to recover 2.2 tons out of 5.5 tons of the
remainder of Nazi gold seized by the Allies from Germany after the
war.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports quoted French representatives at the London
conference as saying Tuesday that France will compensate the Jews
robbed by Nazis on its soil by itself, instead of through the
international fund.
</P>
<P>
"The position of France on the international fund remains open.
A partial participation is possible," said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that each state having the right to retrieving its
part of Nazi gold should also have the right to decide which way
to re-distribute them to the victims of Nazi robbery.
</P>
<P>
"The idea of an international fund inscribes itself in this
context, in order to give the states having the right the
possibility of choosing between a contribution to this fund or
following a step of the same nature in the national framework,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that how France will re-distribute the remainder of
Nazi gold to be returned will be decided by the Matteoli
Commission, which was set up in February by the government to
investigate the situation of robbery of Jews by Nazis in France
during the occupation period.
</P>
<P>
"This commission will publish a report in the coming days,"
said the spokeswoman, adding that the French government is keeping
"close concertation" with Jewish and other representative
organizations.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Leaves Mexico for Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin left here for home this morning at the conclusion of his
four-day state visit to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Upon departure, he cabled his thanks to his Mexican
counterpart, E. Zedillo, for the warm reception accorded to him
during his stay in the Latin American country. It was the first
visit to Mexico by a Chinese head of state in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
President Zedillo unexpectedly came to the airport to see Jiang
off and the two leaders hugged each other before Jiang climbed the
plane.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and Zedillo held talks Monday on bilateral relations and
major international issues. They agreed to establish partnership
of overall cooperation between the two countries for the next
century.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo, speaking at a dinner in honor of President Jiang
Monday evening, stressed that his government attaches importance
to developing cooperative ties with China, as the two countries
hold identical or similar views on many international issues.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang, on his part, reiterated China's willingness to
better relations with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
China and Mexico established diplomatic relations in 1972 and
trade between the two countries reached 539 million U.S. dollars
in 1996 and is expected to grow to 700 million dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents were present Monday at a signing ceremony at
which several agreements on cooperation in such fields as
consulate affairs, sports, social science and agriculture were
inked. These agreements will surely give a new push to the
ever-growing bilateral ties, they believed.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders have met for five times so far. They both
called the visit by Jiang to Mexico a success.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang came over here from a four-day state visit to
Canada, where he met with Canadian leaders and business
representatives.
</P>
<P>
He also attended the fifth informal Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) leaders' meeting held in the Canadian west
coastal city of Vancouver on November 24-25. At the meeting Jiang
stressed, among other things, the need for promoting economic and
technological cooperation among the APEC members, while continuing
to pursuit trade and investment liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Among his entourage were Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen and Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu
Yi. This has pointed to China's readiness to develop both
political and economic relations with foreign countries.

<HEADLINE> Russia Starts Ballistic Missiles Reduction in Barents Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia started elimination of
its ballistic missiles carried by submarines in the Barents Sea
today, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
The first RSM-52 missile was launched at 9:00 Moscow time (0600
GMT) from a nuclear submarine in the Barents Sea. At a height of
about 3.5 kilometers and 100 kilometers from the shore it
destroyed itself.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the operation was being watched by seven
military experts from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The action was taken under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
(START-1). A total of 20 missiles will be disposed of on December
3-4. Another 11 missiles were planned to be destroyed today.
</P>
<P>
The START-1 treaty signed in December 1994 allows no more than
6,000 nuclear warheads on deployed intercontinental ballistic
missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, as well as
re-entry vehicles used for testing and training.
</P>
<P>
According to the Itar-Tass, Russia has already scrapped over
800 launching pads for intercontinental ballistic missiles and
submarine-launched ballistic missiles, about 2,000 missiles, 20
nuclear submarines and more than 50 heavy bombers.
</P>
<P>
The United States has destroyed over 600 launching pads for
intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched
ballistic missiles, about 450 missiles, 22 nuclear submarines and
more than 270 heavy bombers.

ADDIS ABABA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- An aid agreement of
providing 12,500 tons of relief food to Ethiopia was signed here
today between the governments of Canada and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is signed in response to the recent appeal to
the international community made by the Disaster Prevention and
Preparedness Commission of Ethiopia to mitigate food shortage
surfaced due to rain failure this year in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Disaster Prevention and Preparedness
Commissioner Simon Mechale said the currently signed aid

food shortage surfaced in various parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Canadian ambassador to Ethiopia Gabriel Lessard said that
Canada had previously provided wheat valued at three million U.S.
Dollars through the World Food Program in response to the food
needs in pastoral areas.
</P>
<P>
Canada provides approximately 12,000 tons annually through
partner non-governmental organization for food for development
activities in food deficit areas throughout the country, the
ambassador added.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Italy Supports Joint Cypriot Team for EU Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Italy wishes that the Turkish
Cypriots will join the delegation of Cyprus to negotiate the entry
of the island into the European Union (EU), a senior Italian
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Italy always supports the strategy of EU's enlargement and
Cypriot efforts to become an EU member, Italy's Deputy Foreign
Minister Piero Fassino told reporters after a meeting with
Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Fassino said that the EU and Italy are convinced that "it is
important that this negotiation should be held by a Cypriot
delegation which could be represented by all components of the
island."
</P>
<P>
He said that during his separate meetings today with Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash, he made it clear that "Italy wishes there is a joint
delegation representing all the island."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus submitted its application in 1990 for full membership to
the EU, which has decided that the accession negotiations begin
early next year.
</P>
<P>
But the breakaway Turkish Cypriots opposed the move and
suspended its talks with the government on a peaceful solution to
their protracted problem.
</P>
<P>
The government has suggested that the Turkish Cypriots be
represented in the accession negotiations. The EU and its member
states have been intensifying efforts to persuade the Turkish
Cypriots to accept the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Fassino came here before a summit of the EU due next week in
Luxembourg to discuss the issue of enlargement, which is expected
to include Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot south and a
Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkey sent troops to take
over the northern third following a failed pro-Athens coup.

<HEADLINE> Landmines Ban Treaty Signed in Ottawa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The landmines ban treaty
officially opened to signing here today, and Canada became the
first to put its signature on the global convention.
</P>
<P>
Some 120 countries are expected to sign the treaty today and
Thursday at the ongoing treaty-signing conference on a global ban
on landmines here.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, negotiated and adopted in Oslo, Norway, in
September, bans the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of
anti-personnel landmines.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who is here for
the meeting, witnessed the first signatures of the treaty, saying
it is "a historic victory for the weak and vulnerable of our
world."
</P>
<P>
"The Ottawa Convention is a landmark step in the history of
disarmament," Annan told hundreds of delegates from government and
non-government organizations and international agencies.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that it will provide the final impetus for a
universal ban, encompassing all mine-producing and mine-affected
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Once the treaty has been signed, "we must now turn our energies
and our imaginations to the cause of mine-clearance, so that this
victory today does not become a hollow one," Annan noted.
</P>
<P>
This call was echoed by Cornelio Sommaruga, president of the
International Committee of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
Though the ban on anti-personnel mines will "save lives and
limbs," it will "do nothing to improve the plight of the hundreds
of thousands of existing victims whose needs have barely begun to
be addressed," Sommaruga said.
</P>
<P>
"In some respects banning anti-personnel mines was the easiest
of our challenges," he said. He called for more efforts and money
to be put into the clearance of some 100 million existing mines
planted worldwide and provision of adequate assistance to victims.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien announced at the signing
ceremony that his country will contribute 100 million dollars (70
million US dollars) over the next five years to help make the
treaty work, including expanded humanitarian assistance for
landmine victims.

<HEADLINE> Grundig Television Can Switch Itself Off: Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The electronics company Grundig
has launched a range of televisions which switch off automatically
when the viewer has left the room.
</P>
<P>
Many modern TVs include standby mode, which is activated by
pressing a button on the remote-control handset.
</P>
<P>
In this mode, the picture and sound are turned off, but the set
still consumes some electricity -- a red indicator light tells you
that the set is still powered up.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that half of all TV sets in Britain are never
switched off, but left in standby mode when the owner has finished
watching.
</P>
<P>
Grundig's new sets are designed to save power and reduce the
owner's electricity bill.
</P>
<P>
According to Grundig, the new sets feature the eco-switch,
which is operated by a remote control handset and an on-screen
menu.
</P>
<P>
The viewer can decide that the set will automatically switch
off after say, 60 minutes in standby mode, and then activate the
eco-switch by pressing a button on the remote.
</P>
<P>
At the pre-set time, the eco-switch mechanically pushes the
television's power switch into the off position.
</P>
<P>
Grundig says its new system could save television owners up to
35 pounds (56 US dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
Keith Armour of the German company said, "If everyone switched
their television off at night, we could probably save enough power
to shut down a power station."

LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- British Airways (BA) is talking
to Boeing and Airbus Industrie about buying more than 50
single-aisle aircraft for its regional services.
</P>
<P>
There are reports that BA is in the market for a more
comprehensive moderization of its fleet, involving orders for up
to 160 jets, including wide-body aircraft.
</P>
<P>
BA said Tuesday its initial priority is the replacement of its
regional fleet of largely Boeing aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The new aircraft would be based at Birmingham, flying on BA's
domestic routes, and at London's Gatwick airport, serving the
airline's European network, it added.
</P>
<P>
The airline wants to standardize the fleet around a single
family of aircraft in the 120-160 passenger range.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in the circle said there is a straight choice between
Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 families of jets with Boeing the
favorite.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Efforts Made to Ensure Free, Fair, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government,
political parties and church organizations have been making
efforts to ensure free, fair and non-violent election campaigns
leading to the December 29 General Election in the country.
</P>
<P>
In order to regulate the behavior of all political parties and
candidates, the dissolved Seventh Parliament passed an Electoral
Code of Conduct for the country's second multi-party elections.
</P>
<P>
Prepared by Kenya's Electoral Commission (EC), the code binds
political parties to behave peacefully and avoid electoral
violence, intimidation and bribery.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 27 registered political parties in the east African
country, 21 has so far signed the code, indicating that they
would follow the code during the campaigning period and the
polling day.
</P>
<P>
It is mandatory that every political party and candidate
intending to contest the elections subscribe to the code, and
parties will not be eligible to field candidates at any level
unless at least two senior officials sign the document.
</P>
<P>
According to the code, parties are required to condemn
violence and intimidation, to avoid using or publishing
inflammatory language, to ensure that no weapons of any kind are
carried to political meetings.
</P>
<P>
The code also requires political parties to do nothing to
impede another party's access to voters for canvassing membership
and soliciting support, and to refrain from bribery and other
inducements.
</P>
<P>
Following recent incidents in which mobs stoned convoys of
opposition presidential candidates Mwai Kibaki and Raila Odinga
last month, the EC has ordered the Police Commissioner of Kenya
to investigate the incidents.
</P>
<P>
The code provides that infringement of the code can bring
penalties such as a formal warning, fines, withdrawal of air time
on the public media, prohibition against holding public meetings,
and even banning a culprit from entering a specified place.
</P>
<P>
The code empowers the Electoral Commission to bar a candidate
or party from campaigning if found guilty of encouraging
violence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Kenyan Police has announced that all
presidential candidates would be provided with round-the-clock
police protection after presentation of nomination papers on
December 3 and 4.
</P>
<P>
Local media pointed out that as violence had been the bane of
Kenyan politics, especially in recent years, protection of
president candidates by Kenyan police was essential for a
peaceful campaigning.
</P>
<P>
The National Convention Executive Council (NCEC), a lobby body
of opposition leaders pressing for constitutional reforms before
the General Election, announced publicly last month that it
dissociated itself from calls to disrupt the coming General
Election.
</P>
<P>
NCEC leader Kivutha Kibwana declared at a press conference
held on November 28 that "anyone who disrupts the elections will
not be doing so with the mandate of the NCEC."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the National Council of Churches of Kenya
has warned Kenyans against boycotting the elections and condemned
those threatening to unleash violence on the polling day.
</P>
<P>
The church body disclosed that it would organize a week of
peace prayers starting from December 7 to 14, which would be
followed by a "March for Peace" in all villages, towns and
cities.
</P>
<P>
At the polling day, The Electoral Commission said, journalists
will for the first time be allowed to escort ballot boxes to and
from counting halls to ensure fairness.
</P>
<P>
Previously, only agents of the candidates, election observers,
security personnel and presiding officers were allowed to
accompany the boxes.
</P>
<P>
The whole process of inspecting and sealing the ballot boxes,
closing the apertures of the boxes and sealing them, and
escorting the boxes to the counting hall remain at the presence
of all above-mentioned persons.
</P>
<P>
The Electoral Commission Chairman Z.R. Chesoni noted at a
daily briefing on December 2 that "it is the process and not
whether or not ballot boxes are transparent which will ensure
free and fair elections."
</P>
<P>
He explained that the procedure does not allow room for ballot
boxes to disappear or be introduced nor does it allow stuffing
boxes with unofficial ballot papers.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it would be difficult to rig the elections.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Denies Sending Warships to S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria today denied the
dispatch of three warships to Sierra Leone, saying that it was
the military junta that was making lies.
</P>
<P>
The junta, which seized power in the May 25 coup this year,
said on Tuesday the Nigerian contingent in the west African
peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) based in Liberia had sent naval
vessels to the territorial waters of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Up to Monday night, the three vessels were 70 nautical miles
off the Sierra Leonean coast, the junta said in a press
statement.
</P>
<P>
But the Nigerian military authorities have refuted the claim.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Xinhua late this afternoon,
defense spokesman Col. Godwin Ugbo said "this is a lie".
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why the junta made such lies," he said.
</P>
<P>
No plan has been made to transfer ECOMOG troops withdrawn from
Liberia under a phased pullout plan to Sierra Leone, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is up to ECOWAS (the Economic Community of West African
States) to decide," Col. Ugbo added.
</P>
<P>
The defense spokesman, however, agreed that ECOMOG is to
tighten economic sanctions and blockade on that country in a bid
to force the junta to implement the peace agreement signed last
October in Conakry, Guinea.

Under the Conakry peace plan, the junta will hand over power
to the ousted civilian government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah
next April.
</P>
<P>
But the junta has reportedly repudiated the accord by refusing
to disarm the national army and accept Nigeria's dominance in
ECOMOG which is mandated to monitor the peace process in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
The latest meeting between ECOWAS representatives and the
junta on the implementation of the peace plan went in deadlock
last week when agreement was not reached on such critical issues.

ECOMOG Force Commander Major-general Victor Malu threatened on
Monday to increase especially military pressure on the junta to

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Visits UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel said here today that the military agreement
between Turkey and Israel is for training cooperation, which is
not directed against other countries.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish-Israeli agreement is just a military training
pact, not a security cooperation deal and not aimed at damaging
the interests of any other states," Demirel told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Demirel, arriving here this afternoon on a two-day visit to the
United Arab Emirates, would hold talks shortly with President
Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan.
</P>
<P>
He said Turkey would never ink any agreements that would harm
its Arab "brothers." Ankara signed two agreements on military
cooperation with Israel last year, sparked strong protest from the
Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Demirel blamed Arab states for baselessly accusing the
agreements of threatening their security.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult for me to understand such explanations that
the military pact is under aims of damaging the interests of Iraq
and other (Arab) countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Demirel arrived here early Wednesday after a visit to Oman. He
was to fly home Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries have attacked Turkey, a predominantly
Muslim, but politically secular country for "betraying the
interests of the Islamic world.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Teachers Strike for Better Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese teachers from public
and private schools today staged a one-day warning strike to
protest government's failure to keep its promises and commitment
to improve their conditions.
</P>
<P>
George Saade, head of the Lebanese Teachers' Syndicate which
called the strike, said today's strike was echoed by all teachers
without exception.
</P>
<P>
A key commitment the government failed to meet is the
readjustment of salary scales and grading of jobs, which was
approved by parliament some three years ago. The government is
still unable to raise funds to enforce it.
</P>
<P>
Saade said that if the government does not respond to today's
strike for better pay, the syndicate will escalate measures and
stage a three-day strike, to be followed by an open-ended strike
if necessary.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Lebanese Minister of Education, Youth
and Sport, Jean Obeid, affirmed his support to teachers' demands,
which he said are legitimate.
</P>
<P>
But he said he opposed the form they have taken to voice their
grievances. Negotiations are continuing and some legal bills and
proposals have been tabled before the parliament for debate, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that there will be results before the end of this
year.

<P>
NAIROBI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's nine Presidential
candidates today presented their papers to the new Chairman of
the Electorall Commission, Samuel Kivuitu, thus kicking off the
election campaigning for the December 29 General Election.
</P>
<P>
Kivuitu was appointed on Tuesday when former Chairman Z.R.
Chesoni was named Kenya's new Chief Justice.
</P>
<P>
Incumbent President Daniel arap Moi was the first presidential
candidate to present his papers and he was followed by opposition
Democratic Party of Kenya candidate Mwai Kibaki and later by
Raila Odinga of the National Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
President Moi, 73, facing challenges from some new comers,
will be seeking the top seat, hoping to extend his 19 years
political career as president to 24 years.
</P>
<P>
Kibaki, 66, who was the presidential candidate in 1992
elections, will be returning to the coming presidential race
while Raila Odinga, Charity Ngilu and others are joining the race
as the new comers.
</P>
<P>
The presidential poll is believed to favour Moi and his ruling
Kenya African National Union because of division and poor
organization of the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Out of 27 registered political parties in the East African
country, 12 are expected to field presidential candidates for the
second multi-party elections.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Iran to Adopt 9-year Compulsory Education System </HEADLINE>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Reserve Says Asian Crisis Affect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
said today that American manufacturers and farmers are starting to
feel the impact of financial crisis in some Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
"Asian financial turmoil and currency weakness have adversely
affected demand for manufactured and agricultural exports," the
Fed said in its "Beige Book" report, a survey of economic
conditions by its 12 district banks.
</P>
<P>
"Some districts report increased competition from imports," it
said.
</P>
<P>
Today's report, based on information collected before November
24, proves that some economists have been worrysome over the
eventual impact on this country.
</P>
<P>
Five of the Fed's district banks which include Boston,
Philadelphia, Cleveland, Dallas and San Francisco already have
noted the affect of weakened demand from Asia. A sixth, Atlanta,
said manufacturers are scaling back production in anticipation of
weaker demand.
</P>
<P>
Two regional banks of San Francisco and Dallas said Asia's
turmoil has hurt demand for agricultural exports.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said, "virtually all regions are experiencing tight
labor markets, with some reporting increased wage pressures in
specific industries and occupations with labor shortages."
</P>
<P>
As Christmas is approaching, "retailers are generally
optimistic about the sales outlook," the report said. But they
"are having a particularly difficult time in hiring and retaining
seasonal workers."
</P>
<P>
Despite rising wages, "price pressures remain neutral on
balance," the report said. "increasing overseas competition
appears to be offsetting any effects of wage gains."
</P>
<P>
On balance, the Fed said district banks "report a continued
moderate pace of economic growth."
</P>
<P>
Today's survey will be used when the Fed policy-makers meet on
December 16 to discuss interest rates. When Asia's chaos began
spreading to world financial markets, most economists had been
predicting the central bank would lift interest rates to slow the
economy as a bid to prevent inflation. But recently, many have
said the dampening imact of Asia's proble ms could postpone any
rate increase well into next year.

<HEADLINE> AL: Sanctions on Iraq, Libya Obstruct Arab Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the Arab
League (AL) said today that the sanctions imposed against Iraq and
Libya are preventing the establishment of an Arab common market.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Ibrahim, secretary general of Al's Arab Economic Unity
Council Hassan Ibrahim "the Arabs are required to enhance joint
action in light of this state of affairs for realizing a tangible
Arab future."
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Libya have been suffering under the United
Nation-imposed sanctions since the early 1990s. The Arab League
has been working towards the lifting of the embargoes.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim made the remarks on the sidelines of the 66th session
of the Arab Economic Unity Council.
</P>
<P>
The Council has decided to make the Arab common market the main
concern of the current session that opened at the AL headquarters
here today. Egypt, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Jordan, Yemen and
Mauritania are the members of the council.
</P>
<P>
The meetings are expected to work out an executive protocol on
the full implementation of the common market's regulations in the
seven member countries that endorsed its formation as of January
1998, he added.
</P>
<P>
The regulations stipulate full customs exemption for all goods
and commodities flowing in these countries.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim said that efforts are now made to set up a mini Arab
market to include the seven member states in preparation for
expanding it to cover others of the 22-member Arab League.
</P>
<P>
Other topics on the agenda include discussion of a report on
the changes in global economy, developments in the Arab economy in
1996 and Palestinian economic conditions under the Israeli
blockade.

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Proton Beams Effective in Curing Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Researchers said today that
proton beams originally designed for use in nuclear physics
research have proven effective in curing several types of cancer.
</P>
<P>
The advantage of proton beam technology over conventional
radiation is it does no harm to surrounding tissues, researchers
told the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North
America, which was held in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
Proton beams, produced by particle accelerators called
cyclotrons or synchrotrons, have produced better results than
conventional radiation treatment against advanced cancers of the
prostate, bone and eye.
</P>
<P>
A uniform radiation dose of the beams can be targetted at the
tumor while at the same time delivering zero dose to the healthy
tissue, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
A study of 645 men with prostate cancer at Loma Linda
University in California found proton beam therapy was as
effective as surgical removal of the prostate in curing the
cancers four years after treatment.
</P>
<P>
Proton beam treatment of a type of cancer that attacks the base
of the skull was effective for 92 percent of 180 patients,
compared to about half of patients treated with standard radiation
therapy, doctors at three Massachusetts facilities said.
</P>
<P>
An added benefit to patients who underwent proton beam therapy
was that only a small number suffered incontinence, compared to 40
percent of those who underwent the surgery.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Qatar Heal Rifts After Saudi Mediation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Mediated by Saudi Arabia,
Egypt and Qatar today patched up their disputes during a meeting
in Riyadh between the leaders of the two countries, the Saudi
Press Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad
Bin Khalifa Al-Thani held talks in the Saudi capital under the
sponsorship of Saudi King Fahd.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held in an "amicable" atmosphere and resulted
in "the return of the relations between both brotherly states back
to normal."
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the leaders of the two countries appreciated
the successful fence-mending mediation and efforts by King Fahd.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian-Qatari relations deteriorated in October when Egypt
was ready to boycott the fourth Economic Conference of the Middle
East and North Africa in Doha.
</P>
<P>
Qatar responded with a ban on the entry of nationals of Egypt
alongside other nine countries as a security precaution for the
Doha conference, infuriating Cairo and other Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Adding fuel to their row were Qatar's charges that Egypt had
plotted the 1996 coup attempt to overthrow the Gulf sheikdom's
emir. Egypt rejected the charges and demanded for an explanation.
</P>
<P>
Signals for solving the crisis came to the fore Monday as their
war of words on the media eased amid intensive mediation by Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The reconciliation bids involved messages sent by King Fahd to
the leaders of Egypt and Qatar and visits by their foreign
ministers to Riyadh before today's summit.
</P>
<P>
Upon leaving for Riyadh, Qatar's emir expressed sorrow for
"what happened between the two countries" and said his "meeting
with Mubarak comes to erase any misunderstanding between the two
sides."
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa asserted Tuesday during
his visit to Riyadh that Cairo does not want to escalate the
crisis and is keen to maintain relations with Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Sheikh Hamad have left Riyadh for home after their
rapprochement meeting.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. nationwide
first-time claims for jobless benefits dropped by 3,000 in the
week ended November 29 to the lowest level in five weeks, the
U.S. Labor Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
New applications for unemployment insurance totaled a
seasonally adjusted 303,000, a little dip from a revised 306,000 a
week earlier, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
Last week's total was the lowest since 299,000 during the week
ended October 25. Analysts believe a claims level below 320,000
reflects a tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
Except for a 334,000 total on the week ended November 15, new
claims have remained below 320,000 for 13 weeks, the longest
string since a 26-week stretch ended in February 1989.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate dropped to 4.7 percent in October, lowest
since October 1973, while payrolls grew by 284,000.
</P>

During the week ended November 22, 43 states and territories
reported increases, seven registered declines and three were

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina said that the peace agreement with Chittagong Hill Tracts
tribal leaders was "a milestone in our national development and
prosperity."
</P>
<P>
Addressing editors of the national newspapers and news agencies
in Dhaka this afternoon, the prime minister said, "We want peace
and stability and rational socio-economic development of all
regions of the country."
</P>
<P>
"We hope the agreement will put an end to the war-like

and stability of the hilly regions," she stated.
</P>
<P>
She said that under the agreement full guarantee was given to
economic prosperity, social security and overall development for

<HEADLINE> French Interior Minister Defends Liberal Immigration Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- French Interior Minister
Jean-Pierre Chevenement defended the liberal immigration law he
presented to the National Assembly today.
</P>
<P>
The law met strong opposition from right-wing parties and
reserve from some leftist parties.
</P>
<P>
"France marches by absorbing, and the more it preserves its
capacity to integrate, the more it can do it," said Chevenement in
a speech at the National Assembly as it prepared to debate the law.
</P>
<P>
The law will greatly ease restrictions on immigration and stay
by foreigners in France, in contrast to immigration laws adopted
by two previous conservative governments.
</P>
<P>
"Beyond immigration, the real subject is integration," said the
minister. "The natural diversity of the French people has been
enriched since the middle of the 19th century by the contributions
from the people of Europe and the world."
</P>
<P>
The debate on immigration came one week after another liberal
law on nationality presented by the Socialist government was
adopted by the parliament. The law allows all children born of
foreign parents in France to obtain French nationality by the age
of 18.
</P>
<P>
"The process of integration, which is in the heart of the
Constitution and the conception itself of the French people,
continues," Chevenement said. It will careen through the republic
for decades to come, he added.

BRUSSELS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission -- the
European Union's executive body -- today decided to finance six
development projects in South Africa with an aid package of 107.1
million ECUs (119.6 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The funding will come from the European Reconstruction and
Development Program for South Africa, which has a budget of 500
million ECUs in grants for the period from 1996 to 1999.

The EU fund will also help improve infrastructure and the
quality of working skills in local governments in two South
African provinces. In addition, it will provide regular health
care to some 300,000 of the most disadvantaged residents in the
Western Cape.
</P>
<P>
The fund will also be earmarked to build more multi-functional

<HEADLINE> US Secretary of State to Visit Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Anercio Cadete confirmed here today that U. S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will visit Angola on
December 12.
</P>
<P>
While revealing Albright's African tour, Cadete said, this is
Albright's first visit to Angola since she became the secretary
of state in January this year. She visited Angola last year when
she was U.S. representative to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Albright's forthcoming visit to Angola aims to acquaint
herself with the preparations for the next meeting between heads
of Angola's warring sides, namely President Eduardo dos Santos
and Jonas Savimbi, chairman of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
She will also want to get better understanding of the present
situation in the Angolan peace process and the problems it is
facing.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said as one of the three observing countries,
the United States plays a major role in the Angolan peace
process.
</P>
<P>
They believed that Albright's visit at this critical moment of
the implementation of the 1994 Lusaka Peace Accord, will surely
push forward the slowly moving peace process in the country.
</P>
<P>
This is Albright's first African tour after she took office as
secretary of state. Besides Angola, she will also visit Ethiopia,
Uganda, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa
and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Article On Re-opening Cross-Straits Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- "Cross-Straits Relations"
magazine will carry an article by Xiao Zhiguang calling for
re-opening talks between the mainland and Taiwan, saying that the
mainland has taken steps to arrange this but Taiwan has refused an
invitation.
</P>
<P>
The Association for the Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
asked Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation to visit the mainland
without taking an explicit stand on political negotiations,
calling talks between the two a symbol of their sincerity.
</P>
<P>
Compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits understand that
improving relations is a politic issue and that political
negotiations on ending the across-straits state of hostility in
accordance with the "one China" principle should be held, the
article says, and that if talks between the two avoid touching on
political issues and only focus on routine matters it is not very
practical.
</P>
<P>
From February 1996 to September 1997, Taiwan authorities
repeatedly said they would end cross-Straits hostilities by
holding negotiations, but when President Jiang Zemin called for an
end to hostilities and for negotiations in accordance with the
"one China" principle in his report at the 15th National Party
Congress, Taiwan authorities said that Taiwan should be recognized
as an "independent sovereign country," the article says.
</P>
<P>
If political negotiations begin, political differences can be
discussed according to the "one China" principle, and a solution
acceptable to both sides to economic or other general matters can
be found by avoiding politically sensitive issues, it says,
concluding that the talks between the two sides on how to proceed
with political negotiations will be conductive to future
consultations and will break the deadlock in the way of talks.
</P>
<P>
The author of the article says he hopes Taiwan authorities can
give a sincere response to Jiang's appeal and show their sincerity
about political negotiations, which depend on the attitude of
Taiwan authorities.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- China's Tibet Autonomous Region
gave an award of 250,000 yuan today to a leading State-owned beer
producer to promote reforms and to develop the economy here.
</P>
<P>
The award, which went to the Lhasa Beer Corporation Ltd., was
the first of its kind and bore the title "Leading Enterprise in
Reform". Also, the autonomous regional government decided to give
the company a refund as a reward. It has given 10.06 million yuan
in profits to the government.
</P>
<P>
However, the autonous regional government only kept 5 million
yuan and will return the remainder to the enterprises as its
development fund for next year.
</P>
<P>
The company had in fact run in the red for many years, and was
still 29-million yuan in debt just two years ago.
</P>
<P>
But, with 36-million yuan loaned from Sichuan Province, the
enterprise underwent a series of reforms and brought in advanced
technology and production equipment. It is now a key enterprise in
Tibet, with an annual production of 20,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Xu Mingyang, vice-chairman of the autonomous regional
government, called on the 700 State-owned enterprises in Tibet to
follow suit and carry out reforms to develop their production and
economy.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Countries Differ over Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Major differences have emerged
among the member states of the Organization of Islamic Conference
(OIC) over the hot topic of Middle East peace process although all
of them consider Israel as the biggest threat to the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
Most of the OIC members agreed with the Middle East peace
process, sources close to the current OIC experts meeting here
told Xinhua today, but some voiced their opposition to the process
in today's discussion of the OIC political committee.
</P>
<P>
There were hot debates over the issue of Middle East peace
process this morning and big differences appeared, they said.
</P>
<P>
The OIC Experts have been working for the last three days on
draft resolutions to be reviewed by foreign ministers of the
organization and be adopted by heads of state in the Eighth OIC
Summit scheduled for December 9-11 in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that most of the OIC members said that it was
necessary to continue the peace process to bring a lasting peace
in the region despite the hardline stance of the Israeli Likud
government towards the issue.
</P>
<P>
They believed that the only way out of the current impasse was
the implementation of the agreements reached between Israel and
the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
However, some countries held the view that there was no use to
hold talks with a state like Israel, saying that the Middle East
peace process has run into a deadlock and the Islamic countries
should seek other ways to "liberate the occupied land of the
Arabs."
</P>
<P>
Iranian deputy foreign minister and spokesman of the Eighth
OIC Summit Mohammad Javad Zarif confirmed the differences among
the OIC members over the Issue of Middle East peace process
without mentioning their names, saying that it was natural for
the OIC members to have different views.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Zarif said debates would
continue over the issue of Middle East peace process this
afternoon, reiterating that the full restoration of the legitimate
rights of the Palestinians was the only way to solve the issue.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the OIC experts have not reached agreements
over the issues of Islamic human rights and international
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
However, Zarif noted, the OIC experts have reached an agreement
over the issue of the formation of Islamic common market and
proposed to set up a special committee under the OIC to follow up
the issue.
</P>
<P>
With the development of regional economic cooperation, he said,
the OIC member states should improve their economic cooperations
in various fields.
</P>
<P>
The economic cooperation among the OIC members will help
strengthen the solidarity of the Islamic countries and improve
the south-south cooperation, he said, terming cooperation and
consultation as two major principles of the OIC.
</P>
<P>
About the issue of Iraq, Zarif said, the political committee
adopted a draft resolution with the opposition of the Iraqi
delegation.
</P>
<P>
Without specifying the draft, he said that the OIC experts
stressed the importance to safeguard the independence, sovereignty,
territorial integrity of Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Urged Govt Officials to be Accountable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba today urged government officials to be accountable to the
people of Zambia or else they may be punished.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the swearing-in ceremony at the state house for
newly-appointed Vice-President Christon Tembo, defense chiefs and
other officials, Chiluba said with sadness that some ministers
are abusing their offices by not following laws and established
procedures.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said he will not tolerate any indiscipline among
ministers who want to do things in their own way.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that he will not hesitate to punish "erring"
ministers, stressing that they should be responsible to the
people who are their "real masters".
</P>
<P>
"I have no time to bargain with ministers to tell them what to
do," the president said, adding, "ministers should put aside
their pomp and pride and open up to the people they serve."
</P>
<P>
Chiluba noted that some ministers stop respecting people when
they take up office because they feel they are "bigger" than what
they are. This arrogant attitude, he argued, must be changed.
</P>
<P>
Besides Tembo, those sworn in today include Major General
Solomon Mumbi who replaced former army commander Nobby Shimbeye,
Sande Kayumba who took over the air force instead of Ron.
Shikapwasha as well as several other officials and justices.
</P>
<P>
In a major government reshuffle Tuesday which affected most of
the ministerial portfolios including the posts in the ministries
of defense and foreign affairs, Chiluba appointed Tembo as
vice-president to replace Brigade General Godfrey Miyanda.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle, according to Chiluba, is designed to "reinforce
and rejuvenate" the cabinet following the October 28 abortive
military coup.

<HEADLINE> Maintaining Transportation Order During China's Spring Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- China is preparing for the
upcoming Lunar New Year, its traditional Spring Festival, when
millions of farmers working in cities will return to their
villages for family reunions, causing serious transportation
problems, according to central departments.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo told officials at a meeting today
that orderly movement is good for social and economic development
and for ordinary people, and asked Party committees and
governments to start making arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held jointly by seven departments, including
the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Public Security, the
Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Special offices should be set up to oversee the work, he said,
and governments should persuade some people to stay where they
are, while transportation departments need to do more.
</P>
<P>
For four years, the State Council has held meetings to address
this problem, with more surplus rural laborers in cities. The
central government's basic policy is to encourage these farmers to
try to find work closer to their hometowns.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that cities should create more employment
opportunities, and find ways of increasing farmers' income. He
said that China will build labor markets, improve controls on this
movement, and better educate farmers and train them.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Down to New Four-year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Falling gold prices have
driven the beleaguered Australian dollar down to a new four-year
low today.
</P>
<P>
Overnight, the Australian dollar fell to a new four-year low of
67.26 US cents. During the day's session, the Australian dollar
traded as low as 67.30 US cents, closing at 67.38 US cents.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Bank corporate exchange senior dealer Stavros
Nitis said the Australian dollar opened at 67.70 US cents, but
could not sustain that level. The currency was weighed down by
speculation of further weakness in the gold price.
</P>
<P>
"Rumors of more selling of gold by South American central banks
are causing a bit of concern in the gold prices, and that's
putting a dampener on the Aussie as well," Nitis said.
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch analyst William O'Neill said that the news that
Argentina sold its gold reserves is symptomatic of central bank
thinking worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Argentina's central bank confirmed in a statement earlier that
it has sold around 4 million ounces of gold -- all of the
country's non-minted gold -- in the first half of the year for
1.485 billion US dollars, or 370.22 per ounce.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, central bank deputy governor Stephen Grenville
told reporters that it was too early to assess the impact of the
Asian slowdown on Australian growth, or on monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
Against the yen, the Australian dollar finished at 86.99 from
87.06 yesterday. It was also at 1.1947 marks, from 1.2006.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Tanzania Battered by Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Following months of
drought, Tanzania is now battered by floods as continuous rains
over the past few weeks have displaced hundreds of families and
cut off roads to thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 families are rendered homeless when floods
destroyed their houses following torrential rains in Magu and
Geita districts here last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The floods have forced the resettlement of 186 families in
Kisesa village, and destroyed Bujora Primary School buildings and
1,116 hectares of crop in Magu, said Jomo Walae, an official with
the district council.
</P>
<P>
According to him, a 30-year-old woman, Suzi Mahebe, had her
left leg broken when her house collapsed on Sunday afternoon
following the rains which poured down for a whole day, reported
Daily News today.
</P>
<P>
The official said the affected families are in urgent need of
food and medicines.
</P>
<P>
Halima Khatib, Geita district commissioner, said the floods
have seriously affected the Nderema Village.
</P>
<P>
About 3,200 acres of maize, beans and sorghum have been washed
away, she said. A team of experts have been dispatched to the
village to assess the impact of the Sunday floods.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the Mbeya Region in southwestern Tanzania, a
40-year-old woman named Sabina Mwakyusa, and her nine-year-old
son, Hassan Fidelis Elias, died instantly when a wall of their
house collapsed following heavy rains. The woman's another child
was rescued by neighbors fortunately.
</P>
<P>
The recent floods have also blocked the traffic for 90 percent
of residents in Same District, in the northern region of
Kilimanjaro, according to The Guardian today.
</P>
<P>
The floods have caused severe landslide, damaging most roads
in the mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
What is more, the rains have made 360 kilometers of roads
impassable, cornering 203,400 residents out of a total of 226,000
in the areas.
</P>
<P>
Communication in Chome-suti, Mamba Vunta and Maore divisions
have been cut off, Kangwa said.
</P>
<P>
Seven buses from Dar es Salaam to Gonja are stranded at
Mkomazi, he added.
</P>
<P>
The rains over the past few weeks, however, have replenished
water at major dams, easing power shortages in this eastern
African country, said Tanzania Electric Supply Company Managing
Director, Baruany Luhanga Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has been forced to adopt a power rationing system
since September because of the drought. This is the second time
for Tanzania to carry out such a system since 1993. But more
rains might change the situation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee, today asked Party officials to study Deng Xiaoping
Theory and policies of the 15th Party national Congress more
extensively.
</P>
<P>
Hu made the remarks at the opening ceremony today of a course
on Deng Theory and the spirit of the 15th National Congress of the
CPC at the Party School of the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee, of which he is president.
</P>
<P>
The course is for members and alternate members of the CPC
Central Committee. Hu asked them to play a leading role in holding
Deng's banner high and studying Deng Theory.
</P>
<P>
The decision to offer the course came in response to President
Jiang Zemin's report at the 15th Party Congress of the CPC and his
comment on improving senior officials' political awareness and
making them good theorists.
</P>
<P>
Hu asked officials to understand the theory by focusing on the
fundamental issue: "what is socialism and how to build socialism",
and said that they need to have an understanding of the theory's
historical significance and its guiding position. He said that
CPC members should bring the socialist cause pioneered Mao Zedong
and Deng Xiaoping and other revolutionaries into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Party officials should implement the 15th Party National
Congress policies emancipating their minds, seeking truth from
facts, seizing opportunities, and forging ahead, he said,
stressing the importance of combining theory with practice, which
is a Maxist working style.

<HEADLINE> India's 11th Parliament Dissolved, New Polls Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 4 (Xinhua)-- India's 11th Lower House of
Parliament was today dissolved ending a political uncertainty and
paving the way for fresh polls early next year.
</P>
<P>
The communique on dissolution of the House was issued by
President K.R. Narayanan shortly after he met with care-taker
Prime Minister I.K. Gujral and Finance Minister P. Chidambaram
this noon.
</P>
<P>
The president's decision came after the Cabinet unanimously
recommended Wednesday night that the House be dissolved so that a
fresh mandate could be obtained from the people.
</P>
<P>
The dissolution of the House has brought to an end nearly
one-month-long political uncertainty triggered by the Jain
Commission Interim Report on former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi's
assassination in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The report was tabled before the two Houses on November 20 by
the United Front (UF) government. Since then the normal session of
Parliament was disrupted by Congress MPs, who strongly demanded
the removal of three Cabinet ministers from the Dravida Munnetra
Kazhagam (DMK), one of the UF constituents, from the Gujral
government for its involvement in the assassination case.
</P>
<P>
The UF, however, time and again rejected Congress demand, for
it maintained that the report was just an interim one and it
needed further investigation.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Congress withdrew its support to the
government on November 28. As a minority government, the Gujral
government tendered its resignation soon afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Both the Congress Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),
the two major national parties, have expressed their desire to
form next government and asked the president to give them time
for the purpose. Yet neither of the party could muster enough
support to fulfill their wishes in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The president signed the proclamation dissolving the House
after coming to the conclusion that "people needed a reprieve from
the political instability".
</P>
<P>
The six-page presidential communique said, "The President has
borne in mind the paramount importance of national cohesion,
political integrity and the need to ascertain the democratic will
of the people."
</P>
<P>
The 11th Lower House of Parliament, which saw three prime
ministers come and go, has had the second shortest term -- 18
months and a half in Indian history, second to the ninth House
which lasted only 15 months since December 2, 1989. A.B. Vajpayee
and Deve Gowda had to quit after losing confidence votes, and I.K.
Gujral resigned on his own after withdrawal of Congress support.
He was asked by the president to head the care-taker government.
</P>
<P>
The life of the 11th House was cut short by the inherent danger
of minority government totally depending on outside support of a
single party and having to exist in considerable unease at the
will and pleasure of the other party.
</P>
<P>
The Left and the BJP welcomed the dissolution of the House. The
Left said that this would put an end to the "horse-trading by the
BJP" and charged the Congress with plunging the country into a
crisis. The BJP said that none else but the Congress and the UF
should be held responsible for terminating the life of the present
House three and half years ahead of its tenure.
</P>
<P>
The House was constituted after the general elections held in
April-May, 1996. The Rashtriya Janata Dal today accused some UF
constituents of ignoring the financial implications of mid-term
elections and creating a situation for dissolution of the House.
</P>
<P>
the president today also issued an order that fresh elections
be completed and the new House constituted by March 15 next year.
</P>
<P>
Election Commissioner G.V.G. Krishnamurty said today that fresh
elections will be held between the third week of February and
first week of March next year.
</P>
<P>
Share prices plunged in the stock exchange market this
afternoon immediately after dissolution of the House as foreign
institutional investors and bull operators indulged in nervous
selling. Market players, who had been making speculative purchases
in the past few sessions on hopes of some solution to the
political crisis, turned active sellers at all levels pulling
scrips to recent lows.

<HEADLINE> Roads Situation Improved in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Minister of Public Projects and
Housing Roberto White said Mozambique's over 8,350-km-long roads
have been repaired to different extent in the past four years and
some 12,000 km highways maintained.
</P>
<P>
White made the statement Wednesday at the third national
symposium on road and bridge maintenance, the Noticias paper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
He said, 350 km roads have been completely rehabilitated while
6,000 km were only under preliminary repairment. The rest of the
2,000 km are third grade roads which have been repaired mainly
under manpower.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the minister noted, only 870-km highways in the
country were in a good state, which made up of three percent of
all roads in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Now the number reached 4,540 km, which accounts for 16 percent
of the country's roads.
</P>
<P>
White announced that 15,000-km roads will be maintained in
1998, most of which belong to dirt roads which are difficult for
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has a total of 30,000-km-long highways, 4,000 km of
which are asphalt roads. During the 16-year-long civil war, most
of the roads had been damaged.

BRUSSELS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Oil-producing countries from
central Asia and from around the Caucasus and Black Sea areas met
today in a European Union conference on regional development of
oil and gas transmission infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the two-day meeting is both to help the newly

networks they inherited from the former Soviet Union and to ensure
trade and security of supply.
</P>
<P>
The conference launched a high-level debate among
representatives from the NIS states, the EU member states, eastern

The outcome of the meeting is expected to facilitate the flow
of oil and gas between the NIS states and to assist producers and
transit countries in accessing European markets.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, according to EU officials, is also important in
the context of the future enlargement of the 15-nation union in
that it will secure the necessary investment for the

<HEADLINE> German Economy Continues Export-Led Growth in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Germany's gross domestic product
(GDP) continued its export-led growth in the third quarter, rising
one percent over the previous quarter and 2.4 percent over the
same period of 1996, according to official data released today.
</P>
<P>
The growth followed a same one-percent GDP rise registered in
the second quarter from the first quarter, said the Federal
Statistics Office in Wiesbaden.
</P>
<P>
Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt expressed welcome in Bonn to
the data, believing it raises the economic prospects for a 2.5
percent growth for 1997 as projected.
</P>
<P>
German economy rose 1.4 percent in 1996, and 1.9 percent in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The statistics office attributed the third quarter GDP rise to
continued strong exports, which grew by 13.2 percent over the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Another contributing factor was the increase in capital
equipment investments, at 5.2 percent in the third quarter, a
record since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The office also reported that in the third quarter, Germany's
labor productivity was up 3.7 percent, accompanied with a net loss
of 461,000 jobs compared to the same period last year, and a 2.4
percent drop in per-unit production costs -- the sharpest drop
since the 1990 German unification.
</P>
<P>
The gross income of employees was down 0.3 percent from the
third quarter of 1996, said the office, in contrast, corporate and
capital gains were up 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
Germany's private consumption dropped by 0.3 percent in the
third quarter, the office added.
</P>
<P>
The third quarter data released also showed a slowdown in
economy in the eastern part of the country. The real GDP growth
of the eastern part was 1.5 percent, compared with western
Germany's 2.4 percent.

DAR ES SALAAM, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
is still looking for an appropriate investor in the Tanzania
Telecommunication Company Limited (TTCL) which is scheduled for
privatization by 1999.
</P>
<P>
Communications and Transport Minister William Kusila told
President B. Mkapa in Songea on Tuesday that the company is lined
up for divestiture under the ongoing restructuring of parastatal

660,000 million US Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government is also exploring the probability of selling
some shares to TTCL workers, Kusila said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government has made headway in the
installation of a modern telephone network which has made
telephone communication easily accessible to many people.
</P>
<P>
The minister mentioned some of the completed telephone network
projects such as the phone lines linking Dodoma and Mwanza,
Dodoma and Dar es Salaam, and Dar es Salaam with other
municipalities and towns like Zanzibar, Pemba, Tanga, Moshi and
Arusha by installing 3,840 lines from 960 previously.
</P>
<P>
A bigger telephone exchange has been installed in Dar es
Salaam adding telephone lines to 6,000 people from 1,400.

China has dispatched nine women and 11 men, Russia has sent in
10 men and eight women while Turkey has seven women and 12 men for
a total of 276 men and 180 women at the Championships.
</P>
<P>
The Championships will be the last with 10 weight classes for
men and nine for women as the weightlifting tournaments will only

<HEADLINE> China Reserves Right to Use Anti-Personnel Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- China will not give up the
right to use anti-personnel mines (APLs) on its own soil so as to
form defensive capabilities, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said
today.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Tang Guoqiang said that in April 1996, the Chinese
government announced that China would not export APLs that failed
to meet the technical specifications of the amended Protocol even
before its formal entry into force. Currently, China is giving a
positive consideration to the early ratification of the new
Landmine Protocol.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the earliest States Parties to the Conventional
on Prohibition or Restriction on the Use of Certain Conventional
Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have
Indiscriminate Effects (CCW) and Protocol II (Landmine Protocol)
of the CCW.
</P>
<P>
"We are of the view that the general principle on solving the
landmine problem should be one that takes balanced account of both
humanitarian concerns and the legitimate military needs of
sovereign states for self-defense," Tang said when answering a
question at a press conference this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the issue of security is in itself a
humanitarian concern. National conditions and defense needs vary
from country to country. For many countries, especially those
lacking advanced defensive weapons, APLs remain an effective means
of self-defense, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government has always pursued an
independent foreign policy of peace. The sole purpose of its using
APLs within its territory is to safeguard national unity and
territorial integrity and ensure the peaceful life of the Chinese
people. Before an alternative of APLs is found, China must reserve
the right to use APLs on its own soil so as to form defensive
capability, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman declared: "Based on the above-mentioned position,
China does not intend to sign the Convention on the Prohibition of
the Use, Stockpiling, Production, and Transfer of Anti-Personnel
Mines and on Their Destruction."
</P>
<P>
"However, we respect the sovereign choice made by these
countries reaching the Convention in Oslo and understand their
humanitarian desires and concerns," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has sent an observer delegation to the
signing conference of the Convention to be held in Ottawa, Canada,
on December 3 and the parallel roundtable on international mine
clearance and assistance.

on Wednesday the move is to soil the ploy of some citizens who
allegedly resolved to derail the military government's transition
to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
He also warned on the procedure at the polls, saying a voter
must not carry two cards and that "due penalties await any
erring voter".
</P>
<P>
According to the police commissioner, the dense population of
Lagos, estimated at about 10 million, "makes it the most complex
state to control".
</P>
<P>
State Administrator Colonel Mohammed Marwa has also released
12 million Naira (about 150,000 U.S. dollars) to NECON as
logistic support for the election.
</P>
<P>
In Delta State, one of the country's major oil production
bases in the southern coast, 3,000 policemen are scheduled to
undergo training on election logistics today.
</P>
<P>
They will be deployed to the polling stations across the state
before election begins on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NECON on Wednesday suspended the polls in four
constituencies in Warri, the oil town of the state, owing to the
fragile peace there.
</P>
<P>
Local communities went into repeated clashes over the
relocation of the local government seat from the area of one
community to another shortly after the local
government election earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The clashes claimed tens of lives and led to great economic
losses as many houses, vehicles and infrastructure facilities
were damaged.
</P>
<P>
The skirmishes also halted oil production for some time.
</P>
<P>
"Elections in the four state constituencies should be
suspended forthwith until the contentions are resolved," resident
Electoral Commissioner Musa Salihu said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Osun State in western Nigeria said on Tuesday that it would
proceed with the assembly polls in the feuding communities of Ife
and Modakeke.
</P>
<P>
Bloodshed was also triggered off by the relocation of local
government headquarters from Madakeke to Ike-Ogbo in Ile-Ife area
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
State Police Commissioner Sunday Aghedo said all the state's
1,882 polling stations will be placed under police surveillance
to nip any violent act in the bud.
</P>
<P>
The state government has ordered some 3,000 policemen to be
ready for Satursday's election. They will either be stationed in
polling stations located in troubled areas or go on motorized
patrol.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are complaints over funds by politicians and
last minute disqualification of candidates for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
But NECON officials have allayed these fears and urged them to
be orderly in their campaigns, saying the list of contestants
issued to each of the political parties and the press was the
authentic and the final one.
</P>
<P>
To make the election free and fair, at least 150 independent
foreign observers are invited to monitor the polls.
</P>
<P>
The observers, which include United States and British
nationals, will arrive in the country today and head straight for
Abuja, where they will be accredited for the exercise by
officials of the foreign ministry and NECON.
</P>
<P>
As for the last minute preparations, the NECON resident
electoral commissioner to Lagos State said, "Hopefully before
Friday, everything will be in place and by Saturday morning, we
will be ready for the election."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Releases Two Iranian Prisoners of War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 4 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi Foreign Ministry
spokesman said that Iraq released two Iranian prisoners of war
(POWs) this morning.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency INA said the two Iranians were
arrested in 1991 in Iraqi territory.
</P>
<P>
They were handed over to Iranian authorities under the
supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said
INA.
</P>
<P>
The release was ordered by President Saddam Hussein "in
expression of Iraq's sincere willingness to settle pending issues
with Iran, particularly in relation to humanitarian matters."
</P>
<P>
This also reflected Iraq's "principled policy based on
establishing good relations with world states in general, and
neighbors in particular," said INA.
</P>
<P>
The release came only days ahead of the convening of the eighth
Islamic summit in Tehran, Iran in which Iraqi leaders are expected
to participate, and apparently in response to an Iranian
initiative.
</P>
<P>
Iran released some 500 Iraqi POWs a week ago.
</P>
<P>
The POW issue has long been a sticky point in improving
bilateral relations since the two countries ended their eight
years of brutal war in 1988. Each side accuses the other of
withholding POWs.

<P>
FREETOWN, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Military sources in
southeastern Sierra Leone charged today that an upsurge in
attacks by the Kamajor militiamen has killed three people,
including a business woman recently.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, traditional hunters known as
Kamajors ambushed a commercial truck with over 200 bags of rice
on Wednesday in Jembeh along the Bo-Kenema road in the eastern
part of the country.
</P>
<P>
"They shot and killed Musu Kannch, a business woman who owned
part of the rice stock as well as two men who wanted to put up
resistance," an eye witness said, adding that another man was
seriously wounded in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Kamajors also attacked a Sierra Leone Red Cross truck in
Moyamba in the south, stripped naked a west European official
belonging to the organization and forced three Sierra Leone
officials to lie down for several hours in the sun before they
were released and the relief consignment seized.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said the Red Cross has suspended its
operations in the area as a result of the attack.

GUANGZHOU, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Guangdong and Guizhou
police have smashed a drug trafficking gang and seized 27.5
kilograms of heroin.
</P>
<P>
Six suspects involved in the drug case were arrested with
400,000 yuan and a motorcycle used in drug trafficking and
smuggling was seized.
</P>
<P>
In October, the Guizhou Provincial Public Security Department
was informed that the gang was going to transfer heroin from
southwestern China's Yunnan Province to Guangzhou, capital of
southern China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Acting on the tip, Guangzhou police immediately organized a
task force for 24-day surveillance which led to the arrest of five
suspects.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou Province police and their colleagues from Guangzhou
went to Puning City in Guizhou and arrested Chen Songyou for drug
trafficking and seized 27.5 kilograms of heroin, 400,000 yuan and
the motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
Police also believe that Chen has sold 3.8-kilograms heroin in
Puning City since 1996.

<HEADLINE> China Seeks Unprecedented Feat in Asian Women Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Five-straight-time champion
China is seeking a unique sixth title in a row at the 11th Asian
Women's Soccer Championship to be kicked off here tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Without any ups and downs, the odds-on favourites will surely
accompolish the unprecedented feat, said Chinese team manager Jing
Zhengming.
</P>
<P>
"We should not have any major problems in winning the
Championship at home turf," Jing told the reporters.
</P>
<P>
Posing any threat to China's ambition are both DPR Korea and
Japan, which have five Asian Championship Cups, two Asian Games
Cups and an Atlanta Olympic silver plate in their trophy cabinet,
said Jing.
</P>
<P>
"China is ready for tough challeges from both Japan and DPR
Korea, but we enjoy our measurable advantages," Jing said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, China will initiate its defending voyage with a
crucial match against DPR Korea, which Jing values as a potential
pivotable clash in Group B which also includes outsiders of the
Philipines and Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
The last time that China took on the Koreans, who have been
mysteriously described as unpredictable, dated back to June, 1996
when China earned a 2-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
The DPR Koreans, who have been absent from the international
arena ever since, further condense their mystique as their coach
Myong Tong Chan parried any question from reporters after their
close-door practice here.
</P>
<P>
Jing believed the DPR Koreans enjoy the calibre of entering the
last four along with three seeded squads of China, Chinese Taipei
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The top three squads of the tournament will qualify for the
third World Women's Soccer Championship to be held in the United
States in two years.

<HEADLINE> Hani Killers Acted on Behalf of CP, Says CP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The killers of South
African Communist Party (SACP) leader Chris Hani had acted on
behalf of right-wing Conservative Party (CP), CP leader Ferdi
Hartzenberg said.
</P>
<P>
It could be argued that Hani's murder had served the CP's
cause, South African Press Association quoted him as telling the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission in Pretoria Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hartzenberg was testifying in the amnesty hearing of former CP
parliament member Clive Derby-Lewis and Polish immigrant Janusz
Walus, who were convicted of the April 1993 assassination of Hani
outside his Boksburg home near Johannesburg International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
Both are serving life sentences. They are seeking amnesty for
the crime on the grounds that it was politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
Hartzenberg told the commission's Amnesty Committee that the
CP had never distanced itself from Derby-Lewis, even after his
conviction for the murder. Instead, it started a fund to pay for
his legal costs.
</P>
<P>
He said the killers could have interpreted party leaders'
militant talk at the time as a sanction to use violence to
promote the CP's aims.
</P>
<P>
"I said some strong things myself which could have been
interpreted as an instruction to do something," Hartzenberg said.
</P>
<P>
The CP viewed Derby-Lewis' act in the same way as the African
National Congress reacted to the planting of a bomb by an ANC
cadre in a Durban restaurant a few years ago. The explosion
claimed the lives of nine people.
</P>
<P>
The CP approached the Hani killing in the same way,
Hartzenberg said. The country was plagued by violence at the
time, and political murders were commonplace.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the option of achieving the CP's aims through
political ways was being eroded by agreements between the ANC and
the National Party, Hartzenberg said. There was little doubt in
the CP's mind that South Africa was heading for a one-party state
governed by the ANC/SACP alliance.
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to avoid living in such a dispensation, and
realized we will have to walk our own road of freedom. We were
living in a violent society and knew we would have to defend
ourselves."
</P>
<P>
"Hani was enemy number one of the Afrikaner," Hartzenberg
said.
</P>
<P>
Hani had obtained the second highest number of votes in the
policy-making National Executive Committee of the ANC, and one
could assume he would succeed Nelson Mandela as president,
Hartzenberg said.

<P>
BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- China's two academic giants
announced here today that they have added 174 scientists to the
country's academic list, increasing the number of academicians to
1,015.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has elected 58 new
academicians this year, most of whom work in basic scientific
research and fields closely connected with national economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The age of the new academicians averages 60.9 years, and the
two youngest newly elected members are 43. The election increases
the CAS members to 610 and reduced the average age of the
CAS' academicians by one year to 69.9.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE) has added 116
academicians, with one elected from the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region for the first time.
</P>
<P>
More have been elected from scientists working on major
projects such as the Three Gorges Dam and marine oil development.
</P>
<P>
The CAE has stressed the attention to experts working at the
forefront of production, with seven scientists working in
factories among those elected.
</P>
<P>
The age of the CAE's new academicians averages 64.5 years; the
youngest is 50. The election has increased the CAE membership to
439.
</P>
<P>
The two academies elect new academicians once every two years,
with no more than 60 added to the CAS and no more than 120 to the
CAE. China has 34 scientists belonging to both of the academies.
</P>
<P>
The youngest academician in the country is Che Chi-ming, 39,
from Hong Kong University.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Orders Unilateral Ceasefire With Leftist Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today ordered a 30-day unilateral suspension of military
offensives against the leftist rebel group, the New People's Army
(NPA), during the Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
The unilateral ceasefire will take effect from December 6, 1997
to January 4, 1998 and may be extended for another 30 days
depending on any positive development, according to an order
signed by Ramos.
</P>
<P>
However, the order said that the ceasefire will not cover
normal law enforcement functions.
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire shall by itself be a "safe-conduct pass" to all
insurgents during the period covered provided that they do not
carry their firearms, explosives and other deadly weapons, Ramos
said.
</P>
<P>
The Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National
Police are under orders to respect the ceasefire order.
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire will also provide a conducive climate for the
resumption of peace negotiations between the government and the
NPA's political wing National Democratic Front (NDF) in the
Netherlands on December 8.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Fortunato Abat earlier recommended to the
president the unilateral ceasefire as part of the government's
sincere effort for the resumption of peace talks with the NDF.
</P>
<P>
Abat said the military has accepted a proposal by the NPA to
stop temporarily military operations for 48 hours after the
release of a police officer and an army master sergeant held
captive by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
He expected that the NPA would release on Friday the two
hostages who were captured on October 30 when about 40 NPA rebels
raided the town of Rodriguez in the southern province of Rizal.
</P>
<P>
The government suspended the peace negotiations with the NDF
following the capture of the two hostages.
</P>
<P>
The NDF, the political arm of the Communist Party of the
Philippines, has fought the government for more than three decades
in some areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
Military statistics estimated that from a high of 25,600 NPA
fighters in 1986, the number of the NPA members has gone down to
5,000 as of November 30 this year.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Needs to Improve Management of Materials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania need to improve
poor management of materials have caused huge losses to the
country, Vice-President Dr Omar Ali Juma said.
</P>
<P>
"It is sad to note that the meagre resources that we possess
have often been wasted, lost either deliberately or due to lack
of necessary knowledge," Juma told the 12th Materials Management
Professionals' Annual Conference, held in the northern region of
Arusha Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Vice-president attributed the losses to the failure of
using professionals appropriately, saying the materials
management sector actually has enough manpower to control the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Competent professionals must be utilized to ensure that all
kinds of materials are properly managed, Juma told 160 delegates
to the conference.
</P>
<P>
In order to save the nation from huge losses, those who manage
the materials and purchase goods must have relevant skills,
knowledge and necessary qualifications to undertake the job, Juma
said in a speech read on his behalf by the Arusha Regional
Commissioner, Daniel Ole Njolay.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Asia Urged to Strengthen Regional Transport Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Asian-Pacific transport and
communications officials and experts here today urged the
governments in the region to speed up the region's infrastructure
development, especially those regional transport projects.
</P>
<P>
The call was made during the Third Session of the Transport and
Communications Committee of the United Nations Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), which closed here
today.
</P>
<P>
Efficient and reliable transport and communications systems are
indispensable for national economic and social development and for
countries' integration into the regional and the global economy,
said the delegates from 28 Asian-Pacific countries.
</P>
<P>
They also stressed the importance of the Regional Action
Program (RAP) adopted at the Ministerial Conference on
Infrastructure in New Delhi in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
The program contained 64 activities, such as the Asian Land
Transport Infrastructure Development (ALTID) project encompassing
the Trans-Asia Railway (TAR) and the Asian Highway.
</P>
<P>
It was introduced with an aim to implement the New Delhi Action
Plan on Infrastructure Development in Asia and the Pacific, which
was adopted at the 51st Session of the ESCAP Commission in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The four-day event was also briefed on the development of
Asia-Europe land bridges, including the UN projects on Transport
Corridor Europe Caucasus Asia (TRACECA), a "new silk road", and
north-south corridors, namely, Northern Europe-Russia-Central
Asia-Persian Gulf Corridor and North-East Asia Corridor.
</P>
<P>
On other areas, participants attending the meeting showed great
concern over the cross-border transport of dangerous goods, urging
Asian-Pacific countries to toughen their rules and regulations and
set up related bodies to curb the problem.
</P>
<P>
They also proposed to establish an interim secretariat of the
Asia Infrastructure Development Alliance within ESCAP to promote
the private sector's participation in the regional infrastructure
development.

<HEADLINE> Dalian Secures Chinese Soccer League Title in Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, CHINA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Dalian
Wanda succeeded in retaining the title of the Chinese Soccer
League in advance after beating Guangzhou Apollo 2-0 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wanda secured the title with five rounds remained and improved
its unbeaten record to 51, the third that Wanda pockets the title
in the four-year-old league wherein the squad also won in 1994 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
Wanda's head coach Chi Shangbin said that "I hope the China
soccer move into the top class in Asia with great potentials to
compete against the best teams in the world."
</P>
<P>
From 14 wins and three draws, Wanda has scored 45 points after
the 17th round, 16 points clear of second placer Shanghai Shenhua
and third-ranked Beijing Guo'an, who would still lagged behind one
point even with a 100 percent record in the remaining matches.
</P>
<P>
Wanda, who has won the title first time at home, took the most
possession of the match by scoring the first in the 28th minute
when Wang Tao curled an angled free-kick on the brink of the box.
</P>
<P>
Four minutes before the break, Wang Tao's flank cross flew
towards Hao Haidong, top scorer with 11 in the league, who chested
down the ball before an Apollo defender tapped in an own goal.
</P>
<P>
Wanda kept its momentum in the up front but failed to extend
the lead with poor finishes in the second half.
</P>
<P>
The home spectators were filled with joys and flamed fireworks
to celebrate the club's victory after the game.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Urges ECOWAS to Lift Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's military ruler
today appealed to Sani Abacha, chairman of Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS), to lift the sanction and embargo
imposed on his country by the regional leaders.
</P>
<P>
The foreign affairs officials quoting a letter by Major Johnny
Paul Koroma to the ECOWAS, expressing his "grave concern over the
afflictions on the ordinary Sierra Leoneans."
</P>
<P>
"Since the Conakry Agreement (on October 23) has mandated the
(military) government to continue to govern and conduct the
affairs of state without hindrance for a period of six months,
the sanction and embargo should be lifted," said Koroma.
</P>
<P>
"The health and welfare of the citizens is our direct
responsibility and Sierra Leoneans are now looking up to us as a
government to fulfill their needs and basic requirements," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Koroma went on saying, "the continuing imposition of sanction
and embargo on all commodities entering Sierra Leone makes
neither sense, nor can it be in the interest of peace and the
ordinary people of Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
"The people of Sierra Leone cannot be expected to survive for
six months without imports of food, fuel and medicine," Koroma
noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the letter, public and private transportations
are "slowly grinding to a halt due to the non availability of
petrol; the masses are forced to walk long distances to earn
their livelihood; the prices of all basic goods have been more
than doubled and drug and health services are becoming
increasingly inaccessible."
</P>
<P>
Farmers and other producers of perishable items "cannot get
their produce to the markets, the national electrical power
generation is at a standstill and (there is) a pending inability
to treat any water at all in the very near future," he added.
</P>
<P>
Koroma argued in the letter that lives of many Sierra Leoneans
have been placed at stake by what looks like an indiscriminate
and arbitrary imposition of sanction that is well destined to
brutalize the people of Sierra Leone through starvation and
disease.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said it is doubtful whether the letter will
make any impact on ECOWAS.

<HEADLINE> HK Business Summit Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The annual Hong Kong Business
Summit opened here today to discuss the recent currency-market
turmoil, review Hong Kong's economic changes after the handover
and forecast its business challenges ahead.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the one-day meeting, sponsored by the Hong Kong
General Chamber of Commerce and attended by hundreds of key local
business people, Administrative Secretary of the Hong Kong Special
 Administrative Region (SAR) Anson Chan said that "the gloomy
predictions about the 'death of Hong Kong' have not come true."
</P>
<P>
"The facts are that the key ingredients of our success story
remain firmly rooted in Hong Kong," she said. "No one present here
today, I hope, will disagree with me that the transition of Hong
Kong has gone well -- that was not the view held by many people
six months ago."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong returned to China on July 1, after 156 years of
British rule. And the SAR is exactly 156 days old.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting entitled by "Hong Kong: 156 Years and 156 Days",
Chan also expressed her optimism in Hong Kong's future, noting
that her optimism "is not based on blind faith, but on objective
facts."
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the leading Hong Kong businessmen, Deputy Chief
 Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority Norman Chan
said: "As Hong Kong enters into a new era under the framework
of 'one country, two systems' and 'Hong Kong people governing
Hong Kong,' our attention has recently been focused on the
financial turmoil in the region and its effects on Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, given its sound fundamentals, robust monetary and
banking system, huge foreign reserves, flexibility and resilience
in coping with external shocks, would be the first economy to
rebound after this episode, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chan stressed the need to keep confidence that, while in the
short run the markets may become more volatile or they may
overshoot from time to time and there may be pain involved during
the adjustment process, economic fundamentals should prevail in
the end.

<HEADLINE> Liberian President Visits Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President Charles
Taylor is scheduled to wind up his two-day official visit to
Nigeria today.
</P>
<P>
Taylor arrived at the Nigerian capital of Abuja on Wednesday
against the background of reported soured relations between his
government and the west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG).
</P>
<P>
Details of the issues being discussed are to be known but
observers noted leaders of the two countries would X-ray the
brewing threat to the existing relations between Liberia and
Nigeria on one hand and Liberia and ECOMOG on the other hand.
</P>
<P>
Taylor was reported recently as warning ECOMOG force commander
Victor Malu not to exceed his mandate during the
process of restructuring the Liberian armed forces.
</P>
<P>
According to the Abuja peace plan, ECOMOG is to help the
Liberian government to re-build and train the post-war army, but
Taylor was reported as saying his government would go ahead by
itself.
</P>
<P>
Taylor also ordered ECOMOG to quit Liberia and not to use
Liberian territory to launch attacks on the recalcitrant military
junta in neighboring Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
On the Sierra Leone issue, Taylor also reportedly asked the
international community during his visit to Guinea last weekend
to allow the crisis to be solved within the framework of a former
treaty signed among Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said, the alleged feud between Taylor and Malu may
have been responsible for the increasing hysteria among Nigerians
in Liberia with their reported harassment by Liberian security
agents.
</P>
<P>
The alleged harassment led to the fleeing of over 3,000
Nigerians back to the country last week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ECOMOG began last Monday to withdraw from Liberia
under a phased pullout program in line with the Abuja Peace
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
A communique is expected before the end of Taylor's visit,
which is the third since the former warlord became president in
August this year.

<HEADLINE> 90 Percent of Thailand's Debt for October Rolled over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 90 percent of
Thailand's short-term foreign debts which came due in October will
be rolled over, according to the Nation daily today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign creditors have agreed to roll over about 6.3 billion
U.S. dollars' worth of credit extended to the Thai private sector.
The total debts matured in October amounted to 7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to Bank of Thailand figures, Thailand's total foreign
debts coming due within one year amount to 39 billion dollars. Of
the total, 37 billion dollars are of short-term debt.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the 7 billion dollar debt which came due in October,
an additional 5 billion dollars and 6 billion dollars came or will
come, due in November and December respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, the central bank did not say how much would be rolled
over for those two months.
</P>
<P>
The roll-over plan for October was revealed by the central bank
 Wednesday to soothe investor fears after the Thai currency hit an
all-time low of 43.05 to the U.S. dollar Wednesday afternoon. The
baht closed at 42.55 to the dollar, having lost about 63 percent
of its value to the dollar since its float in early July.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Central Bank Governor Chaiyawat Wibulswasdi
Wednesday quashed rumors that Thailand would stop paying its debts
and declare a debt moratorium.
</P>
<P>
He said that a debt moratorium was "not being considered at
all," adding that pressure for Thai companies to repay their debts
will ease early next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 4 (Xinhua)-- Indian President K.R.
Narayanan today dissolved the Lower House of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The President's decision came after the care-taker Cabinet
unanimously recommended Wednesday night that the House be
dissolved so that a fresh mandate could be obtained from the
people.
</P>
<P>
The dissolution has brought to an end nearly a month-long
political crisis triggered by the Jain Commission Interim Report
on former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi's assassination in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The report was tabled before the two Houses on November 20.
</P>
<P>
As soon as it was tabled, the Congress MPs immediately stood up
and demanded the removal of three ministers of the Dravida
Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), one of the constituents of the United
Front, from the Gujral government. But the demand was rejected by
the United Front.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Congress, the main supporter of the Gujral
government, withdrew its support to it on November 28.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, the Gujral government resigned.
</P>
<P>
The new Lower House is expected to be formed by mid-March next
year.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Borrow Heavily on Foreign Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese cabinet has approved an
economic reform package that includes a controversial borrowing of
up to 2 billion U.S. dollars in foreign currency, a press report
said today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the 28-point plan, ushering in across-the-board
austerity measures, was endorsed overwhelmingly in a cabinet
session Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The projected huge foreign borrowing - long-term, lower
interest loans in a basket of foreign currencies - is to cover the
perpetual post-war budget deficit and reduce local debts, thus
helping the country out of the financial straits.
</P>
<P>
The plan was worked out and agreed upon by Lebanese President
Elias Hrawi, House Speaker Nabih Berry and Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri after successive rounds of hard negotiations among them
late November.
</P>
<P>
After the cabinet session, Hariri explained to reporters that
the decision to borrow foreign currency is considered out of its
lower interest rates than local currency loans.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate on local currency could amount to between 16
to 18 percent as against half this rate on French Franc or U.S.
dollar loans, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that local loans had to be repaid much earlier
than long-term foreign debt. It usually takes a maximum of two
years before local debts should be repaid while foreign currency
loans can last as long as 10 years.
</P>
<P>
At present, Lebanon's national debt has reached 13 billion
dollars and deficit has climbed to 60 percent of the gross
domestic product, overshooting the forecast 36 percent in early
this year's budget.
</P>
<P>
Hariri disclosed that the government's ultimate aim was to
ensure that local debts don't exceed 50 percent of the
government's overall borrowings.
</P>
<P>
Now the government's local obligations account for nearly 80
percent of the overall debt.
</P>
<P>
However, some economists and parliament members disagreed with
the plan, saying the borrowing will not be able to solve the
radical problem and no doubt have negative effects on future
generations.
</P>
<P>
The plan must go to the parliament for debate along with the
government's austerity state budget bill for 1998.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: IMF Rescue Entails Painful Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 4 (Xinhua) -- With the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) bailout loan to help overcome its financial crisis, the
South Korean economy will face a painful restructuring, which
could bring about massive layoffs, soaring inflation, slashed
capital spending and more closings or mergers and acquisitions in
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The 55-billion-dollar IMF rescue package will help South Korea
dodge the financial crisis in meeting its external debt
obligations and easing foreign exchange crunch.
</P>
<P>
However, because the IMF has attached harsh conditions to the
bailout, drastic and painful changes will be inevitable in the
years to come, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The Letter of Intent signed by Seoul and the IMF is known to
contain four parts: fiscal retrenchment, an earlier-than-scheduled
opening of the capital market, improvement in the management of
large conglomerates and stringent financial reforms including the
restructuring of troubled financial companies.
</P>
<P>
First of all, a long-running business downturn is in store,
coupled with soaring unemployment, high interest rates and heavier
taxes.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's demand to trim the economic growth rate to three
percent for next year will cause the jobless rate to surge above
six percent, sending more than one million people out of work.
</P>
<P>
Fiscal retrenchment will in turn push up money market rates for
a long period of time. A 10-percent cut in government spending
will lead to curbs of rural development projects, infrastructure
layout and education investments.
</P>
<P>
Significant tax rises will bring about deep concerns about a
business slowdown and inflation.
</P>
<P>
These demands will also bring drastic changes to the country's
trading, finance and corporate sectors. More than anything else, a
financial Big Bang has become a reality.
</P>
<P>
In the financial sector, foreign takeovers of domestic banks
and other financial institutions will be possible, raising fears
that the outdated financial industry might be dominated by
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
With the raising of foreign stock ownership ceiling and the
earlier opening of the short-term bond market, the financial
market will be exposed to the rapid movement of hot money on a
full scale. Should another currency crisis attack the country
again, its upheavals will be greater.
</P>
<P>
Trade regime is expected to change. Some import restrictions
will be abolished and local carmakers and other companies will
face full blown competition from foreign manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Business conglomerates will be forced to adjust to the new
management environment under the agreement, which mandates
stricter disclosure rules and accounting regulations and sharper
cuts in debts.
</P>
<P>
For most part, analysts say, the conditions attached to the
package are badly needed if the country's outdated economic system
is to be brought in line with international standards. In fact,
many of the IMF conditions are in line with the economic policies
being implemented by the government.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read after the signature of the agreement
Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Lim Chang-yuel said that these
reform measures will have great impact on the economy, but the
country will be able to recover a normal growth rate and post a
surplus in international payments as from the year 2000 if they
are successful.

<HEADLINE> EPA Head: Japan's Economy at Standstill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The head of Japan's Economic
Planning Agency (EPA) admitted today that the country's economy is
in a worse state than the government has been maintaining.
</P>
<P>
"It's appropriate to just say the economy is at a standstill
without adding such phrases like 'in the process of recovery' as
the government used to do," EPA Director General Koji Omi told a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
The EPA has been saying in its monthly reports since February
1996 that the economy is heading for recovery.
</P>
<P>
Japan's economy has been slowing down since April, following
the consumption tax hike from three percent to five percent.
</P>
<P>
Citing recent economic data showing sluggishness, including the
gross domestic product (GDP) figures for the July-September period
announced Wednesday, Omi said that the state of economy is
becoming severer.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the GDP data for the second quarter of fiscal 1997,
which showed growth of only 0.8 percent from the previous quarter,
or at an annualized rate of 3.1 percent, Omi said the figures were
slightly worse than he had expected.
</P>
<P>
Japan's economic growth rate for the fiscal year, which ends
next March, will be less than one percent, far below the
government's target of 1.9 percent, Omi said.
</P>
<P>
It would be the first time since fiscal 1994 that Japan's
economic growth rate falls below one percent.

<HEADLINE> Economic Crisis Not to Affect Reactor Commitment: S.Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will continue to
proceed with the light-water nuclear reactor project in Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) despite the current economic
difficulties, a high-ranking official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The North Korean reactor project is not only a commitment to
the international community but also an obligation," the official
of the Presidential Office said. "We should not change our
position on the project, although we are in an economic crisis."
</P>
<P>
The official also said that the project could play an important
role in enhancing security on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The official made the remarks in response to the speculations
that South Korea's troubled economic situation might affect its
commitment to the reactor project in the north.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said that South Korea will share most of
the construction cost, which was fixed at 5.17 billion
U.S. dollars by the Korean Peninsula Energy Development
Organization last week.
</P>
<P>
The cost to be borne by South Korea is estimated at 3.5-4
billion dollars or about seven percent of the International
Monetary Fund's 55-billion-dollar bailout package.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Turkey to Improve Its Human Rights Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish government is
determined to double its efforts to improve its controversial
human rights record in the coming year, a senior official has
said.
</P>
<P>
State Minister Hikmet Sami Turk, who is responsible for
human rights affairs, made the remark in an exclusive interview
with local newspaper Daily News, which is published today.
</P>
<P>
Turk said that the Human rights Coordination Board under
the Cabinet has already worked out a series of measures aimed
at making some positive changes in human rights.
</P>
<P>
These measures include those of fighting government corruption
and restricting the alleged "uncontrollable elements" in the
state organs, he added.
</P>
<P>
The authorities concerned have started human rights courses in
schools of various levels so as to give them a better
understanding of the importance of human rights, Turk said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has reportedly singed with Britain an agreement on
human rights education among police and prison staff, who are
often accused of human rights violation by Western countries and
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is willing to cooperate with all friendly countries
in the sector of improve human rights," the state minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Turk also said that the Turkish General Staff would pay
more attention to the human rights situation in southeastern
Turkey, where the government troops have been fighting the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party rebels.
</P>
<P>
"Respect for human rights should not be neglected, even when
the struggle against terrorism continues," he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the criticism of Turkey's human rights by European
countries, Turk stated that these countries should take an
impartial position on this issue.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has been urging Turkey to improve its human
rights situation, which is as a major obstacle to Ankara's bid
for full EU membership.

<HEADLINE> American Companies Bullish over Business in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 4 (Xinhua) -- American companies have a
very positive medium-term outlook for Hong Kong's business
environment against the backdrop of the recent economic turbulence
in the region, a survey showed today.
</P>
<P>
Over 96 percent of the respondents expressed a "very favorable"
or "favorable" view of Hong Kong's business environment over the
next ten years, as revealed by the results of the 1997 American
Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) business confidence survey.
</P>
<P>
The level remained unchanged from last survey.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly we're quite surprised to see such a high rate... and I
think there are a couple of reasons and very significant messages
that come out of this," Vice Chairman of AmCham Jeffrey Muir told
a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Number one is that, "it indicates a very strong, positive vote
for how the transition is being handled. American companies have
found the transition has gone ahead even better than imagined,"
said Muir.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the high level came out against the
economic turbulence in the region, since the survey was conducted
between October and November.
</P>
<P>
He listed the major reasons as the following: the impact of the
regional situation has yet to be felt by Hong Kong, and the
turbulence also bears a positive element, that is, reduction in
rental costs in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
As in previous years, maintenance of the rule of law and free
flow of information ranked as the most important factors in
assessing Hong Kong's future as a center for international
business and finance.
</P>
<P>
For the next three years, 97 percent of American companies
anticipate their business performance to be "good" or
"satisfactory". Over 55 percent intend to expand operation in
Hong Kong while 39 percent would conduct business as usual.
</P>
<P>
The survey results confirmed that Hong Kong will remain the
preferred location for regional headquarters for AmCham member
companies. For companies with regional headquarters in Hong Kong,
89 percent will retain Hong Kong as their regional center.
</P>
<P>
Less than 2 percent said they plan to relocate their regional
office, with Shanghai being a preferred choice.
</P>
<P>
The results also reflected a positive view toward commercial
prospects on the Chinese mainland. The successful summit between
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and his U.S. counterpart Bill
Clinton, and the improved bilateral relationship are expected to
benefit American businesses.
</P>
<P>
Over 94 percent of the respondents believe the outlook for the
business climate over the next five years is positive. Some 72
percent of AmCham member companies currently have operations on
the mainland compared with 56 percent five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The survey results suggested this trend is likely to continue.
</P>
<P>
The annual survey, entering its eighth year in 1997, was
conducted by ACNielsen-Survey Research Hongkong, a professional
survey firm, on behalf of the leading chamber of commerce in Hong
Kong, from October 6 to November 14.
</P>
<P>
A total of 560 companies responded by mail or fax, representing
a satisfactory response rate of 51 percent, said AmCham President
Frank Martin.

<HEADLINE> 10,000 Australian Firefighters Preparing for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 bushfires
continued to burn throughout the New South Wales (NSW) state today
as up to 10,000 firefighters and thousands of other emergency
officials and volunteers prepared for a two-day resurgence of
searing temperatures and strong winds.
</P>
<P>
NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) Commissioner Phil Koperberg said
in Sydney the forecast change in the summer weather from today's
milder conditions meant the state would be on "full alert"
tomorrow, with all urban and rural fire crews on standby.
</P>
<P>
"The Bureau of Meteorology has briefed us this morning to the
effect that we're going to have two adverse days Friday and
Saturday before the passage of some unstable air," Koperberg was
quoted by the Australian Associated Press (AAP) as saying.
</P>
<P>
About 8,000 and 10,000 firefighters would be placed on standby
tomorrow to fight any major outbreaks around the state, compared
with the 6,000 so far brought into action in the state in
southeast Australia.
</P>
<P>
A total of 400,000 hectares had been burnt out across the
state, with 62 fires still out of control and another 111 either
under control or contained, the RFS said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Despite today's milder weather and considerable success in
containment work, no significant progress had been made in putting
out any of the state's major blazes.
</P>
<P>
"We're now into day eight of this operation and we've very
little sign of any significant relief," Koperberg said.
</P>
<P>
There were grave concerns that the Lithgow fires, which claimed
lives of two firefighters Tuesday, and blazes in the Hawkesbury
area to Sydney's northwest could merge to form a disastrous front,
but Koperberg said all efforts were being focused today to avoid
that situation.
</P>
<P>
In the Coonabarabran area of northern NSW, thousands of
firefighters, including dozens recruited from the Queensland state
nearby, continued to battle the state's biggest blaze today.
</P>
<P>
More than 170,000 hectares of bushland as well as a third of
the Pilliga scrub between Coonabarabran and Narrabri had been
burnt out by this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Visiting the area, NSW Premier Bob Carr said the worst was not
yet over, with firefighters bracing for 50 kilometers per hour
winds and dry conditions forecast for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"That combination of high winds, high temperatures and low
humidity is what we are all dreading in this region as Saturday
approaches. So let's all pray for a break in the weather," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, firefighters in the Western Australia
state, western Australia, today claimed victory over a series of
bushfires that burnt out more than 400,000 hectares, AAP said.
</P>
<P>
The fires, ignited by lightning since Friday, created one of
the largest bushfire crises seen in the state's north.
</P>
<P>
An area of national park and cattle country was ravaged 200 km
north to south and 250 km east to west.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Step Up Crackdown on Illegal Alien Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will step up crackdown
on illegal foreign workers, and unskilled foreign laborers will
not get their work permits renewed, so as to preserve jobs for
Thai people.
</P>
<P>
Some research agencies have forecast that by the end of the
year, about a million Thai people would have lost their jobs as a
result of the economic crunch and factory and construction site
closures.
</P>
<P>
The Thai labor and social welfare and interior ministries will
cooperate to work out measures to deal with the illegal labor
problem, according to a source at the Labor Ministry today.
</P>
<P>
Ss for those legal unskilled foreign workers, numbering
300,000, their work permits will not be renewed when they expire
next year, except for those working in the fields where there are
still labor shortages, according to Labor and Social Welfare
Minister Trairong Suwannakhiri.
</P>
<P>
Companies found hiring illegal immigrants could face shutdown,
Trairong said.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago when the Thai economy was still good, the Thai
government, in spite of strong opposition from labor
organizations, allowed the use of cheap foreign labor, mostly from
Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos.
</P>
<P>
The decision had resulted in an influx of illegal foreign
workers, who are willing to do hard work with low pay.
</P>
<P>
Official estimate puts the number of illegal foreign workers in
the country at about one million.

<HEADLINE> Pak GDP Growth Rate to Increase by 2.9 Percent: Aziz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's growth rate of the
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is expected to increase by 2.9
percent to 6 percent in the 1997-98 fiscal year starting from July
1, Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said here today.
</P>
<P>
Aziz made these remarks while inaugurating a roundtable
conference organized by the Economist Conference of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate will increase mainly on account of 5 percent
growth in agriculture and 7.2 percent growth in manufacturing
sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, inflation rate will come down from 11.8 percent to 9
percent, budget deficit from 6.2 percent to 5 percent of the GDP,
and current account deficit from 6.5 percent to 5.3 percent of the
GDP, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the government will soon launch a
new phase of the reforms aimed at consolidating the gains and
breaking new grounds.
</P>
<P>
This will include areas such as investment for value-added
product exports, expansion of infrastructure, improvement in labor
laws and deeper administrative reforms, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
He said that preparations were also underway for launching
"Pakistan 2010 Program" and the Ninth Five-Year Plan to provide a
longer term vision for the advancement of the nation.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that in a fast globalizing scenario, the
emphasis would have to be on ensuring competitiveness for goods
and services in the world market.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Continue Trade Liberalization, Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
not hold back on its trade liberalization and privatization
programs, which have helped revitalize the economy during the last
four years, President Fidel Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Liberalization of the country's financial and banking sectors
will continue and the privatization process will also proceed as
scheduled, a press release issued today by the Presidential Press
Office quoted Ramos as telling foreign bankers Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with foreign bankers Wednesday night, Ramos said
instead of slowing down or reversing gear on trade liberalization
and privatization, the government will deepen pro-market reforms
in order to position the country as Asia's most attractive
investment haven once the currency turmoil in the region blows
over.
</P>
<P>
"The comparative strength of the Philippine economy has
encouraged us to deepen the pro-market reforms we have
instituted," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Consistent implementation of economic reform, Ramos said, is
necessary to "make the Philippines the most attractive in
investments terms."
</P>
<P>
In view of the currency crisis striking the country in July,
the government decided to review its tariff reduction program and
planned to slow down tariff reduction for industries that are
having difficulty in competing with imports.
</P>
<P>
The United States earlier issued a strong warning against the
Philippines over a plan to slow down on the reduction of tariff
rates of imported products, saying this could "cast strong doubt
on the consistency of the Philippine policy in this area."

<HEADLINE> Huangshan Scenery Attracts More Overseas Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, December 4 (Xinhua) -- A record 190,000 overseas
tourists visited Huangshan in east China's Anhui Province during
the first 10 months of this year to enjoy the well-known natural
scenery on Huangshan Mountain.
</P>
<P>
The number of overseas tourists visiting the area during the
first ten months of 1997 more than doubled the number for the 1996
period. Huangshan led the nation's top 24 cities with famous
scenic attractions in the number of foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
More than 3.7 million overseas and domestic tourists visited
Huangshan during the first 10 months of the year, up 36 percent on
the 1996 period.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has listed Huangshan Mountain scenic sites
as protected natural and cultural areas.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China's Nuclear Wasteland Attracts Explorers, Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Lop Nur, a nuclear wasteland in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, is becoming a
top attraction for explorers and tourists.
</P>
<P>
A prosperous history, an adverse natural environment, rich
cultural relics, unsettled academic questions, a vanishing
civilization and an ancient city on this vast wasteland all
contribute to attracting explorers and tourists.
</P>
<P>
The death of Chinese explorer Yu Chunshun, who died while
walking through the area in June of 1996, aroused concerns from
both domestic and overseas explorer and travel circles.
</P>
<P>
A year later, an explorer from Xinjiang declared that he had
successfully walked through Lop Nur on his own. In September of
this year, a Xinjiang athlete successfully crossed the wasteland
by motorcycle. In October, 100 Chinese tourists walked through Lop
Nur, often called a "zone of death."
</P>
<P>
A dozen foreign exploring teams from Japan, Britain and
Singapore have trekked the wasteland in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
Lop Nur, a communications hub on the ancient Silk Roads, was a
huge lake and marshland until it dried up in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Exploration in the area dates back to the late 19th century,
when a Russian explorer visited there and captured a wild horse in
1876. Fourteen years later, the legendary Silk Roads city of
Lolan, a bustling commercial center 2,000 years ago, was
discovered by a Swedish archeologist.
</P>
<P>
Disputes in academic circles now focus on the reasons for the
disappearance of the ancient Lolan Kingdom and the drying up of
Lop Nur lake.
</P>
<P>
Several dry female corpses, known as "Lolan Beauty," have been
discovered in the area.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists He Dexiu said, "Lolan has been listed as a site
of cultural relics under state protection. There are many tombs
unearthed and numerous cultural relics such as stone tools, coins
and pieces of porcelain scattered on the earth's surface."
</P>
<P>
Another unsettled question is how people live in this region,
known as "a forbidden zone."
</P>
<P>
In 1964, a group of 100 people was found alive in the area and
evacuated to other places.
</P>
<P>
Most present-day explorers and tourists come to Lop Nur just to
experience the adverse natural environment featuring howling
winds, terrible drought and searing sunlight.
</P>
<P>
A survey of tourists' motives for visiting shows that 80
percent of them are seeking an adventurous experience.

<HEADLINE> Thai Bank Governor Urges Investors Not to Panic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Thailand Governor
Chaiyawat Wibulswasdi has urged investors not to panic over the
further decline of the baht.
</P>
<P>
He said on Wednesday that pressure on the baht stemmed from
regional concerns about the South Korean financial crisis, in
addition to strong year-end corporate dollar-buying in the Thai
market.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday the baht continued its week-long slide against the
US dollar, setting a historic low of 42.55 to the dollar onshore,
more than 63 percent down since the float of the baht five months
ago.
</P>
<P>
The baht dropped to a record low of 43.05 to the dollar in
early afternoon trading, but strengthened on the Bank of
Thailand's intervention to close at 42.55.
</P>
<P>
Offshore, the baht was quoted at 42.30 to the dollar in late
trading.
</P>
<P>
Chaiyawat predicted that the pressure would ease once
negotiations between South Korea and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) are concluded, according to the local press today.
</P>
<P>
He added that additional funds of 1 billion dollars would be
made available by the IMF to Thailand if necessary in the event
that South Korea and Indonesia have to withdraw their previous
pledge to the Thai standby credit program.
</P>
<P>
However, Olarn Chaipravat, chairman of the Thai Bankers
Association, Wednesday blamed the fall to a rush for dollars by
anxious Thai corporations facing foreign debt repayments.
</P>
<P>
He said concerns about the baht's value had pushed local
corporations to buy dollars and forward swaps to hedge against
exchange risks, which in turn put downward pressure on the value
of the baht.
</P>
<P>
Some money market analysts said the baht could weaken further,
as debt repayment by Thai companies at the end of the year would
put further downward pressure on the baht.
</P>
<P>
Some dealers agreed that the baht would hit 45 to the dollar
unless local and regional sentiment improves.

<HEADLINE> Skeleton of Early Mammal Found in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
confirmed that a prehistoric mammal, whose skeleton was unearthed
in Jianshan Valley of northeast China's Liaoning Province, lived
here as long ago as 130 million years.
</P>
<P>
The 13-centimeter-long fossilized skeleton is believed to
belong to symmetrodonta, the earliest mammal in the world. The
skeleton is so well-preserved that each part can be clearly
identified with only the tail missing.
</P>
<P>
The animal resembles a mouse, but has a sharper and longer
mouth. Experts believe that it has close kinship with the common
ancestor of both the marsupials and placentals.
</P>
<P>
The skeleton was named "Zhanghe Beast" after its donator, Zhang
He, an amateur collector, who sent the fossil to the Institute of
Vertebrate Paleontolgy and Paleoanthropolgy (IVPP) of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Hu Yaoming, 31, the major researcher on "Zhanghe Beast" in
IVPP, told Xinhua that it's the first well-preserved symmetrodonta
skeleton.
</P>
<P>
Before the recent discovery, scientists knew the existence of
such an animal only from odd fossil pieces of lower jaws or teeth.
</P>
<P>
Hu said the dating of "Zhanghe Beast" was based on two
factors: the large number of fossils of primeval birds, reptiles,
fish and invertebrates found at the same location of "Zhanghe
Beast"; and isotopic chronology tests.
</P>
<P>
Ye Jie, deputy director of IVPP, said that 130 million years
ago dinosaurs were the main animals on Earth, and mammals began
multiplying rapidly about 65 million years later.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of "Zhanghe Beast" will shed new light on the
origin of the mammal and its early evolution as research
continues, Ye said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Leader Asks Anti-Graft Officials to Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has asked three top anti-corruption officials to
resign in order to settle their dispute and enable the country's
anti-graft organ to work properly.
</P>
<P>
Justice and Constitutional Affairs Minister G. L. Peiris said
at a press conference this morning that Commissioner Rudra
Rajasingham, Chairman T. A. D. S. Wijesundera and Director General
Nelum Gamage of the Permanent Commission on Bribery and Corruption
have been asked to quit by the president.
</P>
<P>
Because of the dispute between the top officials, the
functioning of the commission has been very seriously impaired,
Peiris said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has a primary responsibility to ensure
that the commission is able to function properly.
</P>
<P>
That is the reason that the president has taken the step to
remove them, the minister said, adding that the matter has also
put before the parliament for discussion.
</P>
<P>
The president's intervention came at a time when a long-drawn
controversy between the commission and its director general has
developed into a crisis which has reduced the commission to a
virtual breakdown.
</P>
<P>
The commission had asked its director general to appear before
subordinate officials of the commission to explain allegations
that she had drawn holiday and risk allowances without
authorization.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she was asked to explain the role she had played
during investigations into corruption allegations against two
suspects with whom her husband was reported to have business
relations.
</P>
<P>
In reaction, the director general filed a petition to the
Supreme Court, claiming the commission was treating her with
"malice and hostility."
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources here said a new team is to be named soon
to head the anti-graft body.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Former Secretary General
of the United Nations Kurt Waldheim has called for the expansion
of the Security Council to make it more representative of world
powers.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council has to be restructured because its
composition does not reflect the present situation," said Waldheim
in an interview with the local daily Arab Times published today.
</P>
<P>
He picked Japan, Germany, Brazil and India as candidates for
the permanent members of an enlarged Security Council, according
to the daily.
</P>
<P>
Waldheim, who is currently on a private visit to Kuwait, took
the top post of the world organization in January 1972 for two,
five-year terms.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the number of the non-permanent members of
the Security Council should be increased to between 20 and 25 from
the current 15 to reflect the current political situations of the
world.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the U.N. for not performing well in recent years
and being undermined by national interests of certain "great
powers."

<HEADLINE> Australia to Offer 1 Billion US Dollars to South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Australia today promised to
contribute 1 billion US dollars to an international back-up fund
as part of a 55 billion dollar rescue package agreed upon between
South Korea and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said today the contribution
would form part of a second line of defense which would be called
upon in the event that IMF, World Bank and Asian Development Bank
resources proved insufficient for South Korea to complete a
required restructuring program.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time Australia has agreed to provide aid to
an Asian country hit by the currency turmoil in the region in the
past few months, following its 1 billion dollar aid to Thailand
and a same sum to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
But, Costello said he expected the South Korea rescue would be
the last after IMF interventions in Indonesia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Costello said "the government's willingness to provide support
for the Republic of Korea reflects the importance it attaches to
Australia's relationship with a major trading partner and its
strong commitment to the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Costello told reporters in Canberra that he expected the IMF
intervention in South Korea would finally end the spread of the
financial contagion from Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is the second major destination for Australian
exports.

<P>
SHANGHAI, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
economic and commercial center, witnessed active private trading
in foreign exchange during the first 10 months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the turnover for private foreign exchange
trading at the Bank of Communications for the January-October
period surged by 290 percent on the previous year's period, with
the highest daily trade volume surpassing five million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition to normal over-the-counter transactions, the Bank
of Communications also offers trading via telephone and trading at
night.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to offer private foreign
exchange trading in the second half of 1993. The Shanghai branch
of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications were the first
financial institutions to introduce related services.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the volume of foreign exchange
trading has increased significantly in recent months, with the
increase, at least in part, attributed to turbulence on financial
markets in Southeast Asia.

NEW DELHI, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
taken various measures to help poor and backward areas in the
country develop their economy in an effort to alleviate and
eradicate poverty.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, about one-third of the
population in India live under the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Since India's independence in 1947, successive governments have
 regarded poverty alleviation and eradication as one of their
priorities and carried out various programs for their realization.
</P>
<P>
A main measure is the establishment of the National Backward
Classes Finance and Development Corporation, a non-profit company
to promote economic and development activities for backward
classes.
</P>
<P>
Besides, both the central and state governments have worked out
special assistance plans and programs for the purpose of poverty
alleviation.
</P>
<P>
The government has also adopted preferential policies
encouraging private and foreign investments in poor areas to help
boost agricultural and industrial production.
</P>
<P>
Various workshops and training centers were also set up at
various levels in the country to train people in poor areas on
production skills and techniques to enhance their self-employment
capacities.
</P>
<P>
The government has also provided special allowance for poor
people to buy cheaper daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government has paid great attention to
adult education in poor areas. Every year the government and
non-governmental organizations send students and volunteers to
poor areas to help the people there learn how to read and write.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister I. K. Gujral earlier this year even suggested
that each middle-school and university student should at least
help three people overcome illiteracy before they get graduate
certificates.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Indian government has also made efforts to
enhance cooperation with other South Asian countries in
alleviating and eradicating poverty.
</P>
<P>
At the sixth summit of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in 1991, poverty
alleviation was given the highest priority.
</P>
<P>
At the eighth SAARC summit held here in 1995, the heads of
state of member countries reaffirmed their commitment to
eradicating poverty in South Asia, preferably by the year 2002 and
declared 1995 as the "SAARC Year of Poverty Eradication."
</P>
<P>
SAARC, formed in 1985, embraces Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
But for India, a big country with a population of more than 900
million, poverty alleviation and eradication remain a long-term
and very hard task that calls for political will and perseverance.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, U.S. Scientists Discover Deafness Gene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 4 (Xinhua) -- A joint Israeli-U.S. research
team has identified a gene on the seventh chromosome that causes
the most common type of congenital deafness, The Jerusalem Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The actual identification was carried out over 13 months by
Dr. Eric Green and colleagues at the National Human Genome
Research Institute of Health in Maryland of the United States.
Two years ago, staff at Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem
identified the first family affected by the syndrome and
conducted initial studies.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism knows of 35 to
40 Israelis, all Muslims or Druse, who suffer from Pendred
Syndrome, which causes deafness and thyroid problems.
</P>
<P>
Although the syndrome can affect people from any ethnic group,
it is more common among Arabs, where marriage among cousins
frequently occurs. The fact that they have large clans simplifies
genetic research.
</P>
<P>
One out of 1,000 babies is born with a hearing disorder, half
due to genetic problems. Scientists believe there are hundreds of
defective genes involved in various types of deafness, said
Professor Benjamin Glaser, a Hadassah endocrinologist who was a
member of the team. But this gene, called pendrin after the
disease, causes defective transport of sulphate in the cells.
</P>
<P>
The team said that the findings provide compelling evidence
that defects in pendrin cause Pendred Syndrome, thereby launching
a new area of investigation into thyroid physiology, the
pathogenesis of congenital deafness, and the role of altered
sulphate transport in human disease.
</P>
<P>
Pendred Syndrome is believed to cause 5-10 percent of all
congenital deafness. "It isn't clear how these mutations cause
deafness," Glaser was quoted as saying, "but at least in some of
the patients, the deafness appears in early childhood and not at
birth. Thus, identifying the gene is clearly a breakthrough in the
effort to prevent and treat deafness in these patients."
</P>
<P>
He added that with "gene therapy down the road, it could be
possible to prevent the deafness from appearing, and even to take
action in the fetus."

<HEADLINE> Japan Confident in Beating China at Asian Women's Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Japan, losing finalist to
China two years ago, is expecting a reversed result this time as
the 11th Asian Women's Soccer Championship kicks off here
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Japan has set the qualifying berth to 1999 FIFA's World
Championship for women soccer as a target and the gold medal of
the tournament as a bonus, Head coach Satoshi Miyauchi said.
</P>
<P>
The top three squads of the tournament will qualify to the 3rd
World Women's Championship, which will be held in the United
States in two years' time.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to qualify and to win this Championship," he said.
</P>
<P>
And he thinks the odds that his team will topple the defending
champions China is 50 to 50.
</P>
<P>
His prediction seems well-grounded in that the Chinese girls
went through a bad patch during their visit to Japan this June,
which saw a poor record of one goaless draw and one 0-1 loss in
the two sides' most recent two encounters.
</P>
<P>
The 10-day tournament will feature 11 teams in three groups,
with the group winners and the best runners-up entering the last
four.
</P>
<P>
Japan, based in the Panyu city-- a 30 minutes' bus ride from
here, also have Hong Kong (China), India and Guam in their
group.

<HEADLINE> Anti-kidnap Force Reinforced in Philippine Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- One thousand more policemen have
been ordered to be deployed in the Philippine capital area to
reinforce the anti-kidnapping drive there, a senior police
official said today.
</P>
<P>
Senior Superintendent Nestorio Gualberto, chief of the
country's anti-kidnapping force, said that 1,000 policemen from
Central and Southern Luzon will be sent to Metro Manila to step up
crackdown on rampant kidnapping syndicates.
</P>
<P>
Gualberto said police chief Director General Recaredo Sarmiento
had ordered an all-out campaign against kidnap-for-ransom
syndicates in the wake of a new wave of abductions of wealthy
Filipino-Chinese traders.
</P>
<P>
He said the extra policemen will be assigned to the areas where
kidnappings and probable abduction would likely occur.
</P>
<P>
Gualberto also appealed to the community to help the police in
combating kidnapping syndicates.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, thousands of Chinese-Filipinos took part in a
protest march in downtown Manila and a funeral for a young
Filipino-Chinese businessman killed by his abductors late last
month.
</P>
<P>
Chinese businesses and schools were also closed for one day
Wednesday in Chinatown and other parts of the capital city to
protest the government failure to solve the protracted kidnapping
issue.
</P>
<P>
But as the Chinese community took to the street, kidnappers
struck again in Metro Manila Tuesday, abducting five
Filipino-Chinese businessmen in separate incidents.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Seeks for Assistance in Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has asked the World
Bank for help in fighting against corruption, a senior World
Bank official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a two-day national public procurement forum in Entebbe,
Randolph Harris, the bank's representative to Uganda, said the
battle against corruption is a new mandate to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is one of the six African countries seeking for the
help from the bank. The others are Benin, Ethiopia, Malawi, Mali
and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan leaders including President Yoweri Museveni have
reaffirmed repeatedly their determination against corruption. Ali
Kirunda Kivijinja, then minister without portfolio, resigned in
June this year since Police Criminal Investigation Department has
raised a file of power abuse against him.
</P>
<P>
Harris said the World Bank has amended its procurement
guidelines so that at the request of the borrower, an
understanding to observe the country's law on bribery is
considered as part of the anti corruption
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The forum, organized by the Central Tender Board and Central
Purchasing Corporation among others, has drawn permanent

About 5,000 people from the area have been treated in various

He added that the ongoing nurses' strike which has crippled
most public hospitals in the country since last Friday made the

<HEADLINE> China's Yuan Expected to Remain Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The fundamentals for a stable
exchange rate of the Chinese yuan will not change in the near
future, according to today's "China Securities".
</P>
<P>
The newspaper disputed a recent prediction that the yuan would
decline in value against the U.S. dollar as a result of recent
currency slumps in several Southeast Asia nations.
</P>
<P>
Trends in exchange rates of a currency should be judged by
supply and demand in the foreign exchange markets, or the
condition of a country's balance of international payments, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Huge current-account deficits are a direct and internal cause
of recent financial crises in Southeast Asia nations such as
Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia and the Republic of Korea,
the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
But China, with sound economic growth, has reported a surplus
in both its current and capital accounts for consecutive years,
and its foreign exchange reserves were valued at 134 billion
U.S. dollars at the end of September.
</P>
<P>
Huge hard-currency reserves, which are enough to pay for
imports for more than nine months, guarantee the central bank's
ability to respond to any instability on foreign exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
"All this has formed the foundation for a stable exchange rate
of the Renminbi," according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The makeup of a country's foreign capital also affects the
exchange rate of its currency. China has utilized 320 billion
U.S. dollars in foreign funds, which breaks down to 200 billion
U.S. dollars in direct investment and 120 billion U.S. dollars in
foreign debts. Short-term debts account for less than 12 percent
of all debts.
</P>
<P>
The fact that long-term foreign capital dominates in China is
helpful to the prevention of possible capital flight. And the
inconvertibility of the yuan also makes it hard for speculators to
launch an attack on the currency.
</P>
<P>
Some experts have suggested an artificial devaluation of
China's currency to counter the possible negative effects on
exports arising from the devalued currencies of other Southeast
Asia countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the newspaper reported that a comprehensive analysis
of the political and economic situations in Southeast Asia
indicates that their expected rise in exports will have limited
effects on Chinese exports.
</P>
<P>
"The overall trade balance of China will not be upset," the
paper reported, adding that Chinese enterprises have become more
competitive during the yuan's steady appreciation.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Heilongjiang Province in
northeast China is seeking further cooperation with 36 Russian
science and research institutes.
</P>
<P>
During the last six years, the province and Russian institutes
have collaborated on 48 projects, 16 of which have been listed by
China's State Science and Technology Commission as International
Science and Technology Cooperative Projects, said an official of
Heilongjiang's Science and Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
Bordering Russia and known as northern China's granary, the
province has special interest in Russia's agricultural
techniques. The province's Academy of Agricultural Sciences
initiated cooperation with its Russian counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Techniques of seed coating and crop-growth adjusting provided
by the Russians have helped the province increase its grain output
by 10 percent and vegetable output by more than 30 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The imported sea buckthorn's productivity was 10 times local
varieties, and its resistance to wind and drought proved valuable
in the saline-alkali soil in the province's western portion.
</P>
<P>
An important center of China's heavy industry, the province has
more than 600 large and medium-size state enterprises, some of
which were built with the help of the former Soviet Union.

CHENGDU, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-Japan Dental
Technician Training Center, established to teach lab workers how
to make false teeth, is open now in Chengdu, capital of southwest
China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The center aims to conduct a dental technician training program
and courses as well as establishing a system and curriculum for
the certified academic qualifications for dental technicians in
Sichuan and all other provinces.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, manufacturing false teeth has become an

China has about 100,000 dentists, a small number when compared
to its large population. Eighty percent of false teeth and dental
materials have to be imported, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The center was jointly set up by DIC of the university and
Japanese Shofu Inc. as well as the Shin-Osaka Dental Technician
College, famous for dental education and dental material

concrete measures against corruptive practices among government
officials that use council vehicles and offices for personal
purposes, government-owned Zambia Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The government has with immediate effect banned mayors and
council chairmen countrywide from using council vehicles and
offices for personal purposes.
</P>
<P>
Christmas and new year parties on council acounts are also
banned.

November 30 that those defying the directive will be surcharged
or penalised.
</P>
<P>
"My office has been inundated with numerous queries from rate
payers and residents at large regarding the use of mayoral
vehicle and the office. I wish to further remind you that this
vehicle shall only be used on civic funcitons where the mayor in
his official capacity is required to be present," said Katongo.
</P>
<P>
He cited the examples to be banned such as ferrying children
and other family members for private trips and other private and
personal errands by the civic leader.
</P>

The ban follows growing abuse of council facilities in several
towns by civic leaders.
</P>

<P>
HARARE, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Some 80 percent of people in
developing countries have no access to modern health facilities,
and thus have to rely on traditional medicines, a leading
authority in traditional health care said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nhlavana Maseko, President of the International Traditional
Healers Organisation for Africa, was speaking at a five-day
workshop on indigenous methods of preserving natural resources
held in Masvingo, south Zimbabwe. He saud that traditional forms
of medicine play a key role even in modern times.
</P>
<P>
Justifying the use of traditional forms of healing, Maseko
said the history of traditional curative services is as old as
the history of Africa itself.
</P>
<P>
After all, he said, before the African continent was colonised
people on the continent relied on traditional medicines from its
bushes.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Africa strongly believe in traditional health
care, which is part of their culture. In the old days during the
years of our grandfathers, the modern medicines such as pills and
injections were not known," he added.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, which seeks to persuade people in the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) to attach importance to
indigenous methods of improving their lives, has drawn
traditional healers, spirit mediums and war veterans from eight
SADC countries.

MANILA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Investments registered with the
Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) soared to a record-high
of 4.4 billion U.S. dollars in the first 11 months this year,
local television reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Citing data issued by the PEZA Wednesday, the reports said the

The PEZA, which manages 65 economic zones all over the country,
said substantial investments flew in during the third quarter even
at the height of the region's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
During the third quarter this year, the economic zones drew a
total of 2.3 billion dollars foreign and domestic investments.
</P>
<P>
PEZA Director-General Lilia de Lima was quoted as saying the
investment figure for the third quarter was "really amazing" since
everybody thought investments would slow down due to Asia's
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
De Lima predicted more investments in the economic zones this
year as many foreign firms are awaiting approval of their projects

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Promotes Liquefied Natural Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The southwestern China
municipality of Chongqing is vigorously promoting the use of
liquefied natural gas for motor vehicles, with some 150 vehicles
currently using the fuel.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government plans to promote the use of liquefied
natural gas by encouraging the production of automobiles adapted
to use the fuel, and refitting motor vehicles currently using
gasoline and diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, 500 vehicles will be refitted by the end
of this year, with an additional 10,000 motor vehicles using the
fuel by the end of 1998, and the figure rising even further to
50,000 units by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Environmental experts note that liquefied natural gas creates
much less pollution than gasoline and diesel, with equal distance
operating costs falling by as much as 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing now has four refueling stations for liquefied natural
gas.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that Chongqing is currently faced with serious
pollution partly caused by motor vehicle emissions. They attribute
the high level of pollution to the over 200,000 vehicles operating
in the city and poor road conditions.

<HEADLINE> Technology Breakthrough Made in Corn Yield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, December 4 (Xinhua) -- A 600 sq.m. nonirrigated
experimental plot in northeast China's Jilin Province, one of the
nation's grain production bases, has yielded 1,056 kg. of corn.
</P>
<P>
Li Weiyue, a corn expert who participated in the experiment,
explained the cultivation method during a recent seminar on high
yield corn technology. Li noted that the test plot is located
close to a rice field.
</P>
<P>
He said the technology will make it possible to increase the
per unit corn production in the northeastern plains, which
produces a major portion of China's marketable grain, by between
30-100 percent.
</P>
<P>
Shen Maoxiang, an official with the State Science and
Technology Commission, said the successful experiment will add
impetus to the important role science will play in the region's
grain production.
</P>
<P>
Jilin is home to 10.4 percent of China's corn production area,
and produces 14.8 percent of total output. However, due to the low
productivity on some four million hectares. The province's per
hectare corn yield averages a mere 6,000 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The central government attaches great importance to the
research Jilin has carried out to increase corn production.
Related research has been integrated with the nation's
key technological projects during the Ninth Five-Year Plan Period.
</P>
<P>
Scientific agriculture introduced over the past two years has
increased corn output on 2.6 million ha by 400 million kilograms.
</P>
<P>
China plans to increase grain production by 50 billion kg, with
Jilin expected to produce 10 percent of the total.

BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign trade turnover
for 1998 is expected to rise by 12.5 percent to 365 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Projections call for exports to grow by 10 percent to 196

percent to 169 billion US dollars. Factors which will contribute
to the growth include reductions in import tariffs and increasing
investment demand, according to a report released by an economic

</P>
<P>
However, the foreign trade surplus for 1998 will drop to 27
billion US dollars, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Growth for exports of general items is expected to slow
somewhat on this year's high growth rate, while growth in imports
will rebound due to policy incentives and the rising scale of

<HEADLINE> U.S.: No Judgment Until Duma Ratifies START-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States will not
make final judgments about a Russian proposal for further cuts in
its nuclear arsenal until Moscow ratifies the START-2, State
Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters today.
</P>
<P>
The START-2 arms reduction treaty, which provides for Russia
and the United States to reduce their long-range nuclear forces to
a maximum of 3,500 warheads each, was signed in 1993 but ratified
so far only by the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, during his visit to Sweden,
today announced plans to unilaterally cut Moscow's nuclear
warheads "by a further one-third."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said: "It appears that President Yeltsin was stating
publicly what we have previously been told privately, that is his
willingness to consider reductions in strategic nuclear forces
below the START-3 levels agreed to at Helsinki -- that is, below
the 2,000 to 2,500 strategic nuclear warheads for each of the
parties."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgy Mamedov met
today and expected to discuss the subject.
</P>
<P>
The two, who meet regularly, were also expected to discuss
U.S. concerns about Russian cooperation with Iran on matters such
as missiles.
</P>
<P>
Washington insists formal negotiations cannot start until
Russia's State Duma (parliament) ratifies START-2.

MANAGUA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Nicaraguan Academy of the
Spanish Language has accepted poet Maria Sanson Arguello as its
female member.
</P>
<P>
The admission ceremony was held Tuesday at the Foreign Ministry
building here, with the participation of academy members,
intellectuals and poets.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Tunnerman, member of the prestigious academy, presented
before the audience a lecture on the works of Mariana Sanson, who
has written poetry since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
"Sanson's poetry is charming, because it describes human traits
that all poets bear in their inner world," Tunnerman said, adding
the poetry is also "moving, excellent, joyful."
</P>
<P>
On her part, Sanson thanked the decision of the academy and
said her literary work does not stem from formal studies or
influences but is rather a spontaneous move.
</P>
<P>
"My poetry is magic creation and comes up from my brain at some
moments. Ideas, emotions and personal experiences emerge, whether
they are real or fantastic," said the poet.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, actress Nidia Palacios read some poems of the
book "Fantastic Zoo," written by Sanson in 1994, and of her last
book "Time and its Voices."

YANGON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is trying to raise its
production of value-added finished wood products, official
newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have ceased log exports phase by phase to raise
the production of value-added finished goods with the
participation of the state, cooperative and private sectors and
joint ventures, Forestry Minister U Aung Phone said at a meeting
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He also called for ensuring adequate raw material supply to
private wood-based industries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, The state-run Myanmar Timber Enterprise (MTE) is
cooperating with foreign companies in direct investment or
establishing joint ventures to turn out value-added products,
</P>
<P>
Up to now, seven foreign firms from China, France, South Korea,
Malaysia, Norway and Thailand have signed business agreements with
the MTE to set up plywood, molding and furniture factories in
Myanmar, especially in two newly-established industrial zones in
the capital -- Dagon Myothit and Shwepyithar zones, which are

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Export Earnings Grow in July-October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's earnings from
exports reached 77.55 billion taka (45.45 taka to 1 U.S. dollar)
in the July-October period of the current fiscal year (starting
from July 1), growing by more than 21 percent over the
corresponding period of the previous fiscal year, according to
sources in the Export Promotion Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The receipts surpassed the target of 75 billion taka by about
2.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
The increase of export earnings was attributed to the increase
of Bangladeshi products' prices in the international market by
10.29 percent and to that of the export volume by 10.87 percent
over the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources said that jute goods and finished leather
were behind targets. Jute goods fetched 4.44 billion taka against
the projection of 4.52 billion taka while finished leather earned
2.57 billion taka against the target of 3.02 billion taka.
</P>
<P>
Despite the European Union's fish ban, Bangladesh still fetched
6.51 billion taka against the July-October target of 4.42 billion
taka, increasing by 10.55 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ready-made garment industry, the major foreign exchange earner
of the country, surpassed its target by about 5.85 billion taka or
39.10 percent, to reach 42.32 billion taka.
</P>
<P>
Hosiery products, however, fell short of their targets by 2.4
billion taka.
</P>
<P>
The United States topped the list of importers buying
Bangladesh products worth about 29.53 billion taka, followed by
Germany with 7.61 billion taka and the United Kingdom with 7.16
billion taka, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Legislators Reportedly Claim Big Wealth Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Deputies at Vietnam's National
Assembly have reportedly claimed that the gap is widening between
the country's rich and poor due to inadequate government policies.
</P>
<P>
Deputies told the on-going assembly session that the disparity
was growing in the countryside itself and between rural and urban
areas, the latest issue of Vietnamese Investment Review reported.
</P>
<P>
In the country's rural areas, they were quoted as saying,
farmers were quitting the land for cities because of falling
profits, and more incentives were needed to stop the drain.
</P>
<P>
While agricultural inputs, such as electricity, fertilizer and
irrigation services, are high priced, the output, like rice, is
often sold at low prices, one of the deputies noted.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people don't have jobs at all, simply because they
don't want an agricultural job with humble earnings."
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Cong Tan, who is in charge of
agricultural and rural development, confirmed some of these
complaints in an interview with Vietnamese Investment Review.
</P>
<P>
"Some groups in the countryside are struggling below the
poverty line without basic living conditions," the official said.
</P>
<P>
In response, he said, the government has planned to invest a
considerable amount in rural and agricultural production in a bid
to "make their living easier."

NEW DELHI, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) plans to get directly involved in refinancing the
infrastructure sector in the wake of a tardy flow of bank credit
to the sector, a government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
RBI Governor Bimal Jalan has already discussed the issue with
Finance Minister P. Chidambaram and he has also initiated a
dialogue within the RBI to work out a mechanism to enhance the
comfort levels of involvement by banks and financial institutions
(FIs) in funding commercially viable projects in the power,
telecom, road and ports sectors.
</P>
<P>
One of the problems faced by banks and FIs is the long
repayment period, often extending to 12-15 years, for loans to
infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Despite its best efforts, the government has not succeeded in
persuading banks and FIs to increase their credit flow because of
the risks they may face in the infrastructure sector.
</P>
<P>
The RBI's involvement will help change their perception, the
official said.

<P>
Furthermore, the commission recommended that the officers,
including some senior ones, be deprived of the right to vote for
seven years and imprisoned in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
The police officers were charged with trying to influence
voters, either directly or indirectly, during the elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the commission recommended that tough action be
taken against Risvy Sinna Lebbe and Kathankudi Nallaratnam
Sivaerasa, former organizers of the United National Party (UNP)
for their roles in the election malpractice.
</P>
<P>
High Court Judge G. M. S. Samaraweera said he had strong
evidence that they were involved in malpractice with the help of
police officers on March 1, 1994, the day the local government
elections were held.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports quoted the commission as saying, "Attempts
had been made to win the election through police power rather than
through the power of the ballot."
</P>
<P>
The commission, set up by the People's Alliance government
which won the 1994 general elections, also noted that voters had
no opportunity to exercise their voting rights due to the lack of
a peaceful atmosphere devoid of outside influence in the 1994
elections.
</P>
<P>
It went on to say that even some public servants had no
opportunity to fulfill their duties because of various pressures
exerted on them during the election.

<HEADLINE> San Francisco Hits Red Light Runners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 3 (Xinhua) -- San Francisco has decided
to expand its traffic high-tech surveillance program by installing
more "scofflaw" cameras at intersections.
</P>
<P>
Of the city's estimated 1,000 signalized intersections, five
are now controlled by red-light cameras. The Parking and Traffic
Commission on Tuesday agreed to bring the number of such
intersections to 30.
</P>
<P>
Each of the cameras costs 50,000 U.S. dollars and it is
expected that the expansion cost of one million dollars could be
covered by red-light fines.
</P>
<P>
The cameras will not operate all the time at each
intersection. Instead, 20 will be rotated among the 30 locations,
but drivers will never know which intersections are being watched.
</P>
<P>
Red-light running is an old and serious problem in San
Francisco. During the past five year, nearly 4,000 accidents were
caused by red-light runners, resulting in 21 deaths and 6,620
injuries.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Parking and Traffic estimates more than 3.5
million red-light violations happen each year in the city. In
1996, more than 15,000 tickets were issued for the offense.
</P>
<P>
Department officials said that since the cameras went into
operation, the number of red-light runners at these intersections
has dropped, in some months by about 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Starting from January 1, the fine for going through red lights
will more than double, to 271 dollars, under a new state law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city has begun to crack down on missing
license-plate violations, and is considering fining registered
owners of the vehicles when the drivers cannot be determined.
</P>
<P>
San Francisco, with a population of 730,000, has 428,000
registered cars, trucks and motorcycles. On average one household
has one car, and 60,000 households have two cars apiece.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Private Sector Urged to Develop Maritime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today urged the private sector to look into
technological innovations to make the maritime industry less
labor-intensive in turning the country into a true maritime
nation.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir made the appeal when opening the First International
Maritime Conference in Langkawi, some 500 kilometers north of
here, which is being held in conjunction with the ongoing six-day
Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace (LIMA) '97 Show
which entered its third day today, the Malaysian national news
agency Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that although Malaysia has all the makings of a
maritime nation, being strategically located at the center of
shipping land and with a large sea area rich in fishery, oil and
gas resources, it has yet to optimize all these attributes to
qualify as a maritime nation in the true sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
He said efforts to transform Malaysia into a true maritime
nation began about two decades ago and since then the industry has
been recognized as an increasingly important sector in the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
But the growth in the maritime industry has implied tremendous
pressure on the limited human resources in the industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the private sector to look into the possibility of
incorporating more information technology(IT) and automation in
the industry in line with Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor
project.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir noted that the number and capacity of local shipyards
have also increased manifold to cope with a rising level of
activities.
</P>
<P>
He said it is hoped that the Malaysian Navy would play a more
significant role in initiating warship design, building and
repairs.
</P>
<P>
His government is trying to revive the nation's seafaring
culture by inculcating maritime values among schoolchildren
through extracurricular activities like sea cadet corps.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Enterprises Subscribe to ISO9000 Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of local
enterprises in southwest China's Chongqing Municipality are
working hard to attain the ISO9000 certification to become more
competitive on the international market.
</P>
<P>
So far, nine large enterprises have received ISO9000 quality
certification, said sources from the Chongqing Import and Export
Commodity Inspection Bureau. According to the sources, another
nine enterprises will gain the certification by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
The bureau realized early the importance of carrying out
ISO9000 quality standards, and Chongqing is one of the pioneers in
promoting ISO9000 in southwest China, said Zhong Dechang, director
of the bureau.
</P>
<P>
Since the Southwest China Aluminum Processing Plant in 1993
became the first large enterprise in the country to receive the
ISO9000 certification, its products are traded on the London
market for nonferrous metals.
</P>
<P>
China Jialing Industrial Co., Ltd. (Group), the largest
state-grade enterprise group in the motorcycle trade in China, can
manufacture two million motorcycles each year and 97 percent of
motorcycles are up to standard, an increase of four percentage
points since it received the certification.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the group has established overseas agencies and
the motorcycles are exported to more than 40 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Zhong said the practice of ISO9000 has helped many local
enterprises upgrade product quality, raise their prestige, and
enter the international market.

<HEADLINE> Only 3 Suspended Thai Finance Firms to Reopen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Only three of the 58 finance
companies suspended earlier this year by the Thai government are
likely to pass scrutiny and be allowed to reopen, it was learned
here today.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda will announce on Monday
which of the suspended finance firms can reopen and how the assets
of the closed firms will be managed.
</P>
<P>
The fate of the suspended finance firms has caused much concern
in recent months in the financial sector and has been one of the
factors leading to the continued decline of the Stock Exchange of
Thailand index and the country's currency, the baht.
</P>
<P>
The 58 firms were temporarily closed down by the government in
June and August respectively because of their huge amounts of bad
and non-performing debts and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
The government has asked them to merge, increase capital or be
taken over by other financial firms. Failing to do so will lead to
their close-down.
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the good assets held by the suspended firms run
from 400 billion to 500 billion baht (10 billion to 12.5 billion
U.S. dollars), the size of a medium-sized bank with 1,000
employees.
</P>
<P>
The bad assets of the 55 firms expected to be closed will be
sold to the state-supported Asset Management Corporation.

<HEADLINE> Postal Workers Back to Work in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Postal workers in Canada today
announced their decision to return to workplace Thursday after two
weeks of walkout.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the government passed a tough legislation
through the federal parliament to force the Canadian Union of
Postal Workers (CUPW) back to work.
</P>
<P>
But mail would be processed without stamps and corporate mail
could be sent to wrong addresses, the union warned.
</P>
<P>
Postal workers are to face fines of up to 1,000 Canadian
dollars (730 U.S. dollars) a day, union leaders 50,000 dollars
(36,500 U.S. dollars) and the union 100,000 dollars (73,000
U.S. dollars) if they defy the legislation.
</P>
<P>
However, the workers vowed to continue their fight against
Canada Post, a Crown corporation in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We will return to work by taking our struggle into the
workplace," CUPW President Darrel Tingley said.

PARIS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The world soccer governing body
FIFA on Wednesday told the television rights holders to the 2002
and 2006 World Cups that they are expected to reaffirm their total
acceptance of FIFA's demands for optimum TV coverage in Europe and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
FIFA made this notice at Marseille on the eve of the World Cup
draw ceremony.
</P>
<P>
FIFA has worldwide television deals wrapped up totalling 930
million U.S. dollars in 2002 to rise to 1.15 billion U.S. dollars
in 2006 with the companies Sporis/ISL and the German media giant
Kirch/Taurus.
</P>
<P>
But there are fears that the costly subscription service could
cost the wide fan base a chance to see their teams live.
</P>
<P>
FIFA last year ruled out pay-per-view from any distribution
policy, stressing pay TV options would have to be limited as much
as possible and would be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
Plans were undergoing consideration last month that would
guarantee free live transmission of 2002 World Cup in South Korea
and Japan to only four of the 64 games.
</P>
<P>
Most games during the next year's World Cup in France will
still be broadcast on traditional over-the-air public and

<HEADLINE> FAA Proposes Changes in Boeing 747s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) today proposed changes in Boeing
747s to reduce the possibility of fuel tank explosions, a
suspected reason for the Trans World Airline (TWA) plane crash
last year.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made following recommendations by the National
Transportation Safety Board that new, and possibly older, Boeing
747 aircraft be fitted with nitrogen inert systems in fuel tanks
and that insulation be added between heat-generating equipment and
fuel tanks.
</P>
<P>
Investigators suspected that an electrical surge may have
ignited an explosion in the center fuel tank of the TWA plane.
</P>
<P>
The plane exploded on July 17, 1996, killing all 230 people on
board.
</P>
<P>
The safety board is convening a week-long hearing in Baltimore
next week to further investigate the cause of the accident.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, the FAA urged airlines to install new equipment
over the next 12 months to shield certain wiring in the fuel
monitoring system in some Boeing 747s, and to inspect wiring in
some fuel pumps in older 747s.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Ministries Urged to Cooperate in Drug Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Khin Nyunt has
called for cooperation among government ministries and between
Myanmar and international organizations in fighting against
narcotic drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a special meeting here Wednesday of the Myanmar
Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control, Khin Nyunt, first
secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council, also
urged effective implementation of the country's narcotic drug
control program, the official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1989 when the armed groups began returning to the legal
fold, consultations have been conducted with national race leaders
to achieve understanding on eradicating narcotic drugs and
implement regional development projects, to carry out two programs
in combination," he said.
</P>
<P>
He cited two of the Myanmar government's accomplishments, the
surrender of more than 10,000 members of the Mong Tai Army led by
former drug warlord Khun Sa and the abandonment of its narcotic
drug production and trafficking in January 1996, and the
declaration of the Mongla region in the country's eastern Shan
State as an area totally free from narcotic drugs in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
The meeting discussed cooperation among various ministries for
the cultivation of opium-substitute crops, cooperation with
international organizations and formulation of a program to
mobilize non-governmental organizations to participate in the
project to totally eradicate narcotic drugs in Myanmar, the report
added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Hits New Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah hit a new
record low Wednesday due to regional weaknesses as stocks
continued to fall, dealers and stockbrokers here said today.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah touched a new historical low of 3,980 against the
U.S. dollar in the spot market Wednesday before easing to 3,930/50
at the close in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said the rupiah ended at 3,985 in Singapore
and 3,920/45 in London.
</P>
<P>
The central bank was not seen intervening in the spot market,
but it sold dollars and drained the rupiah from the swap and money
markets, a local bank chief dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the rupiah was under heavy trade Wednesday after
Indonesian Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said joint
intervention with Singapore and Japan to support the rupiah was
temporarily suspended.
</P>
<P>
Some economists said the government should be realistic that
the current crisis is driven by huge private offshore debts which
had reached 65 billion dollars as of September this year and
therefore it should help the private sector settle those debts.
</P>
<P>
They said indebted local corporations have been looking for
dollars in the market, fearing that the rupiah would continue to
drop to an unseen bottom as it is not guarded by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has fallen steadily since July, with a brief spell
of stabilization in early November after the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) provided a financial bailout package to
Indonesia to bring relief to its economy.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the value of the rupiah has
dropped by near 50 percent against the U.S. dollar this year. The
IMF agreed at the end of October to provide 23 billion dollars in
long-term financial aid to Indonesia to help it overcome its
monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Jakarta Stock Exchange composite index was down
1.2 percent or 4.6 points to close at 389.68 Wednesday, with a
total turnover of 77.81 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Brokers blamed the decline in stock prices on the weakening
rupiah, negative corporate earnings and the upcoming year-end
holiday.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Inflation Increases In First 11 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's cumulative
inflation rate from January through November 1997 reached 9.01
percent, higher than a year earlier when it stood at 5.92 percent,
according to data issued by the Central Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate in November was recorded at 1.65 percent, up
by 1.08 percentage points from the 0.57 percent in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative inflation rate for the first eight months of
fiscal year 1997/98 (April 1-March 31) stood at 7.05 percent, also
higher than the 2.66 percent in fiscal 1996/97.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the November inflation rate was the result of a
rise in the index of food, housing and various goods and services,
the statistics bureau said here Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Hits New Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah hit a new
record low Wednesday due to regional weaknesses as stocks
continued to fall, dealers and stockbrokers here said today.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah touched a new historical low of 3,980 against the
U.S. dollar in the spot market Wednesday before easing to 3,930/50
at the close in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said the rupiah ended at 3,985 in Singapore
and 3,920/45 in London.
</P>
<P>
The central bank was not seen intervening in the spot market,
but it sold dollars and drained the rupiah from the swap and money
markets, a local bank chief dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the rupiah was under heavy trade Wednesday after
Indonesian Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said joint
intervention with Singapore and Japan to support the rupiah was
temporarily suspended.
</P>
<P>
Some economists said the government should be realistic that
the current crisis is driven by huge private offshore debts which
had reached 65 billion dollars as of September this year and
therefore it should help the private sector settle those debts.
</P>
<P>
They said indebted local corporations have been looking for
dollars in the market, fearing that the rupiah would continue to
drop to an unseen bottom as it is not guarded by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has fallen steadily since July, with a brief spell
of stabilization in early November after the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) provided a financial bailout package to
Indonesia to bring relief to its economy.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the value of the rupiah has
dropped by near 50 percent against the U.S. dollar this year. The
IMF agreed at the end of October to provide 23 billion dollars in
long-term financial aid to Indonesia to help it overcome its
monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Jakarta Stock Exchange composite index was down
1.2 percent or 4.6 points to close at 389.68 Wednesday, with a
total turnover of 77.81 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Brokers blamed the decline in stock prices on the weakening
rupiah, negative corporate earnings and the upcoming year-end
holiday.

The free aid is designated for projects such as roads,
irrigation, drinking water and telecommunications. The loans are
for growing cash crops, raising profitable animals and poultry,
improving the processing industry and developing natural resources.
</P>
<P>
"About half of the projects with loans can return the loans on
time over the years," Yang said. "The reasons are either the
people in the poor regions are unwilling to pay or the projects
don't generate money.
</P>
<P>
"For those who can't pay back loans, we show generosity and
allow them to postpone the date of repayment."

Poor people don't just reside in rural areas. Statistics from
the labor and civil affairs ministries show that 5.3 million

For people in urban areas, China offers assistance in the form
of money and materials, vocational training and developing the

</P>
<P>
In addition to the official sources, many non-governmental

</P>
<P>
The Foundation for Underdeveloped Regions in China is gathering
funds to tackle water shortages in northwestern China and a

</P>
<P>
The Chinese Communist Youth League's "Hope Project" is aimed at
helping poor young people to obtain a basic education. The
All-China Women's Federation also has projects to help poor
mothers and poor girls.
</P>
<P>
More overseas companies are also joining in the battle against
poverty, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed that solving food and clothing needs
doesn't mean shedding poverty, saying that many people take for
granted that having enough food and clothing means getting rid of
poverty.
</P>
<P>
"After tackling their food and clothing problems, China will
continue to lend them forceful support in education and medical
care," Yang said. "Poverty alleviation is a long-term goal for
China."

<P>
BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- China's 58 million people who
still suffer hunger and inadequate clothing should receive needed
assistance within three years because of government support, said
a senior Chinese official here today.
</P>
<P>
"China is sure to basically solve the food and clothing problem
by the end of the century, provided that the current systematic
policies and measures remain intact in the area of poverty
alleviation," said Yang Yongyi, deputy director of the State
Council Leading Group for Poverty Alleviation and Development, in
an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
China's poverty fight developed quickly after China adopted its
policy of reform and opening to the outside world in 1978, when
the country had 250 million people who "had not enough food in
their stomach and not enough to cover their bodies," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
During 1978-1985, China abolished communes and implemented a
policy to allow individual households to contract out farmland,
which greatly improved grain production. The state raised the
purchase price of grain, which also improved farmers'
income. Later, the State Council started to draft a series of
preferential policies to help the economy of poor regions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the official said, China annually allocates huge
amounts of money to support the poor regions, which are mainly in
northwestern and southwestern China.
</P>
<P>
The State Council's budget on poverty relief for this year was
15.3 billion yuan, with 6.5 billion yuan in free aid. The rest of
the money was offered as loans with an interest rate slightly more
than two percent a year, a rate below the corresponding inflation
rate.

<HEADLINE> Three million American Adults on Probation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- More than half of all adult
offenders serving criminal sentences in the United States were on
probation by the end of 1996, says a Justice Department report
released today.
</P>
<P>
State and local probation agencies were supervising about three
million adults on December 31, 1996, -- about 1.6 percent of the
U.S. adult population, or one in every 62 persons over the age of
18.
</P>
<P>
Probation is a conditional release into the community under
supervision, in lieu of incarceration.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of 1995, more than 453,000 adults were on
probation for violent offenses, 757,000 for a property offenses,
561,000 for a drug offenses and 815,000 for disturbing public
order, such as driving while intoxicated, traffic offenses,
drunkenness or morals offenses, said the survey.
</P>
<P>
The most common offenses among felons given probationary
sentences for misdemeanors were drug trafficking, 15 percent,
possession of drugs, 13 percent, drunken driving, 35 percent, and
assault, 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey results were compiled from a sample of 5,867
administrative records, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
About 30 percent of all probationers had previously been
sentenced to jail for earlier offenses. Forty-two percent had
previously been sentenced to probation.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the survey, about 18 percent of all adult
probationers had attended one or more formal disciplinary hearings
for violating the terms of their release, the study said.
</P>
<P>
The most common violation was failure to maintain contact with
probation officers.
</P>
<P>
Since going on probation, more than 60 percent had participated
in some type of special supervision or treatment program, the
Justice Department said. About 37 percent had been in alcohol or
drug treatment programs, and 12 percent underwent special
counseling, including psychological or family counseling, or
classes in life skills or parenting.

<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region plans to build a green passage in Taklimakan
Desert in five years.
</P>
<P>
The desert, called "sea of death", is the second largest of its
kind in the world with an area of 330,000 sq km and sits in the
Tarim Basin in the southern part of Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, a 522-km-long road was built to cross the desert from
the north to the south, which not only facilitates oil exploration
in the region but shortens the distance from Urumqi, capital of
the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, to cities and towns at the
south edge of the basin.
</P>
<P>
Some parts of the road, however, have been damaged by shifting
sand, the local government has to spend a lot of money on
maintaining it.
</P>
<P>
Some experts concluded through prospecting that there are rich
deposits of underground water in the area. The local government,
therefore, plans to plant grass and trees on the both sides of the
road to make it "green" to ensure its transport capacity.
</P>
<P>
The concrete measures they take include building six windbreaks
by planting diversiform-leaved poplar in the 50-meter area on the
both sides of the road in five years.
</P>
<P>
The green passage, upon completion, is expected to protect the
road in desert against shifting sand in about 100 year.

<TEXT>

MANILA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine economy, as
measured by the gross national product (GNP), will reach the
low-end of this year's growth target range of 5.5 percent, the
local newspaper The Manila Chronicle said today.
</P>
<P>
Originally, the government expected a GNP growth of between 7
and 7.5 percent for 1997. But the target was brought down to
between 6 to 5.5 percent after the de facto devaluation of the
Philippine peso in July.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted sources at the inter-agency Development Budget
Coordination Committee (DBCC) as saying the GNP is expected to
slow down to about 5.5 percent for the whole of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The DBCC, tasked to map out the country's macroeconomic
targets, is composed of the Department of Finance, the Central
Bank, the National Economic and Development Authority and some
other agencies.
</P>
<P>
The DBCC attributed the slowdown in the economy to a slump in
the manufacturing sector in the third quarter of 1997 caused by
rising interest rates and the weakening local currency.
</P>
<P>
But sources at the DBCC said the target of a 6- to 6.5-percent
inflation rate would be attainable in 1997.
</P>
<P>
With the high interest rate regime and the continuing peso
depreciation, DBCC sources also admitted that "it is really
impossible to meet the 13 billion pesos (382 million U.S. dollars)
targeted budget surplus of the government."

De Merode added that the IOC would consider extending the lab's
accreditation for three months if it could made sure the equipment
would be in place soon.

SHANGHAI, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The city of Shanghai has had
success in preventing its environmental conditions from worsening,
according to Shen Yonglin of the Environmental Protection Bureau,
by controlling the discharge of major industrial pollutants and
reducing air pollution during a period of fast economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In the next two years, the city will spend three percent of its
GDP annually on environmental protection, compared with two
percent in the 1993-95 period and 2.34 percent in 1996, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
A sewage diversion project costing six billion yuan (722
million US dollars) and a 2.6-billion-yuan project for improving
the quality of drinking water are being built.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has spent six billion yuan on pollution-reduction
efforts that involved moving 850 factories and workshops causing
serious pollution out of downtown areas in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
However, as an old industrial center, Shanghai has many
pollution problems that have existed since last century, Shen
said, and the situation could get worse if steps are not taken
immediately, because the city is undergoing massive construction
and its economy is growing faster than ever before.

<HEADLINE> IOC Warnes Osaka Officials Against 2008 Lobbying </HEADLINE>

<P>
GENEVA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) on Wednesday warned Osaka, the only declared
candidate so far for the 2008 Summer Olympics, against launching a
publicity campaign during the Winter Games in Nagano.
</P>
<P>
Osaka officials planned an outlay of 500,000 U.S. dollars and
rented three buildings in Nagano to promote their bid during the
February 7-22 games.
</P>
<P>
But the IOC sent a letter to the Japanese Olympic Committee
stressing that Nagano is not the time and place to lobby its bid
for the 2008 games, said IOC director general Francois Carrard.
</P>
<P>
The director general added that although IOC was particularly
intent on keeping Osaka representatives away from IOC meetings and
functions in Nagano, IOC could yet not ban Osaka officials from
going to Nagano or carrying out activities at non-Olymic sites.
</P>
<P>
IOC will decide the final winner of the bid for the 2008 games
in 2001.

The arrangement will further boost economic relations between

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Falls Against Mark But Higher Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar edged higher
against Japanese yen but fell against the mark on strong German
economic data and a warning from a German central bank official
about higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar settled at 1.7720 marks,
down from 1.7782 Tuesday. The dollar also was changing hands at
128.78 yen, up from 128.64.
</P>
<P>
The mark rallied against the dollar and yen after the release of
German industrial output figures that showed a 1.8 percent rise in
October, surpassing analysts' projections for a 1.3 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
Against the yen, the dollar rose to a high of 128.98 yen before
retreating on worries about lifting the dollar too high and
causing Japanese officials to intervene and support the yen.
</P>
<P>
The British pound was quoted at 1.6829 U.S. dollars, up from
1.6807 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday:
1.4301 Swiss francs, down from 1.4335; 5.9315 French francs, down
from 5.9490; 1,736 Italian lire, down from 1,740; and 1.4191

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Faces Tough Test in Bonn: Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu will face a tough test when he comes to Bonn to meet
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Thursday evening, German press
reports quoted diplomatic sources as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had to convince Kohl that he was planning to take
concrete steps towards peace, otherwise he would risk an attitude
change in Germany's Middle East policy, the German news agency DPA
quoted western diplomats as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kohl wanted to give Netanyahu one last chance to prove himself
before deciding whether Germany would drop its traditional support
of Israel's policies and take a more neutral line in the Middle
East conflict, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the talks with Kohl, Netanyahu is also due to meet
U.S. Secretary of State Madeline Albright and French President
Jacques Chirac on Friday and Saturday in a bid to enlist their
support for his plans for a limited withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet agreed in principle on Sunday to partly
withdraw troops from the West Bank, but it set no date and
attached a string of hardline demands on the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media reported today that the Israeli government was
planning a conditional handover of some eight percent of the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have rejected the Israeli proposal as
insufficient, and says that it is ploy to keep the territory under
its control.

NEW YORK, December 3 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks managed to
turn around today after slipping for the second straight session
amid worries about the profits of technology companies.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.18 points to 8,032.01,
after erasing an early 57-point deficit.
</P>
<P>
Advancers outnumbered decliners by a 9-to-7 margin on the New
York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 623.44 million shares,
up from 575.29 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 5.09 to 976.77, less
than 7 points from its October 7 record finish at 983.12.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index rose 2.50 to 510.14, about 4 points
shy of record terrain.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index, which fell as much as 15 points
during the session, rose 8.76 to 1,615.13 at the end.

433.80, and the small-company dominated American Stock Exchange
composite index rose 3.40 to 669.10.

grazed 6 percent for the first time since early 1996. The yield
fell as low as 6.05 percent.
</P>

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
hosted the first public forum on race relations in the country in
Akron, Ohio on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The president moderated a 90-minute discussion on race
relations with about 65 students and community leaders
</P>
<P>
Clinton, linked from the University of Akron via satellite to
nearly 100 sites around the country, said Americans "ought to
struggle constantly to identify what unites us -- that's more
important than what's different about us."
</P>
<P>
He announced a proposal to create educational opportunity zones
to reward school districts in poor urban and rural areas, news
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The year-long race initiative Clinton launched in San Diego,
California, in June was under fire for little progress.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Akron Beacon Journal, Clinton promised
to fight the "chilling" problem of police mistreating minorities.
He also said he is disturbed by racial disparities in the use of
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
In June Clinton announced a goal of reducing tensions among
racial and ethnic groups. The presidential race advisory panel has
drawn criticism for a slow start and little exchange of differing
views.
</P>
<P>
The White House also introduced a new public service ad
campaign aimed at increasing the dialogue.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Urges Iraq to Cooperate with UNSCOM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council today again urged Iraq to cooperate fully with UNSCOM, the
U.N. Special Commission in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Council made the appeal in its presidential statement
endorsing the recommendations of the latest UNSCOM report for full
and expeditious implementation of the relevant U.N. resolutions on
UNSCOM work.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council reiterates its demand that Iraq fulfil
all its obligations as set out in all the relevant resolutions,"
said the statement reached after the Council consultation today.
</P>
<P>
The Council stressed that the effectiveness and speed of UNSCOM
work is "determined by the degree to which the Government of Iraq
cooperates in disclosing the full extent and disposition of its
proscribed programs and in granting UNSCOM unimpeded access to all
sites, documents, records and individuals," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Council also acknowledges the conclusion of the UNSCOM
report that UNSCOM respects the legitimate national security,
sovereignty and dignity concerns of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Council acknowledges that as Iraq complies with its
obligations under the relevant resolutions, UNSCOM and the
International Atomic Energy Agency would make the transition of
their work from investigation to monitoring.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM composition and access to sensitive inspection sites
have been among controversial issues between Iraq and UNSCOM and
tension once intensified between Iraq and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Iraq expelled all Americans in the inspection teams on November
13 and UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler ordered to withdraw all
UNSCOM teams afterwards.
</P>
<P>
As a result of diplomatic efforts, UNSCOM resumed its work on
November 22, but the controversy over the sensitive sites still
remains.
</P>
<P>
Butler is scheduled to visit Baghdad from December 14-15 to
talk with the Iraq Government on the remaining issues, whose
resolution may eventually lead to the lifting of U.N. sanctions on
Iraq.

<HEADLINE> World Bank, IMF, U.S. Support South Korean Reform Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Soon following the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) reached an agreement with South
Korea on economic reform and rescue package, the leaders of the
the World Bank, IMF and the U.S. voiced their support for it.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly welcome the reform program announced by the Korean
Government," the World Bank President, James D. Wolfensohn, said
in a statement issued here today.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Government "has asked the World Bank to resume
lending to Korea in support of its economic reforms. I am pleased
to respond speedyly and substantively to this request for our
involvement," the World Bank chief said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank plans to prepare a program of structural
adjustment loans for a total of up to 10 billion U.S. dollars.
These resources will be utilized to support reforms in the
financial sector, corporate governance, and other areas key to the
resumption of economic growth and poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
The last loan to South Korea before it graduated from the World
Bank borrowing was approved in December 1994, for some 75 million
U.S. dollars. Over the years, the World Bank lent the Korea a
total of 8.6 billion dollars of ordinary funds for 114 projects
and a total of 120 million of concessional funds from the
International Development Association (IDA). Outstanding loans and
credits total 1.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Michel Camdessus, the IMF Managing Director who is on a visit
to Seoul, also issued a statement, expressing his welcome for the
conclusion of talks with Korea on IMF package.
</P>
<P>
"The program comprises strengthened fiscal and monetary
policies, far-reaching financial sector reforms, and further
liberalization of trade and capital flows, as well as improvements
in the structure and governance of Korean corporation," Camdessus
said.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the package, the IMF will provide a
three-year stand-by credit up to some 21 billion dollar.
</P>
<P>
The IMF chief also revealed that some countries such as
Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Britain and the United
State are prepared to back Korea's program with the IMF. This
second line of defense is expected to be in excess of 20 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. Secretary of Treasury Robert E. Rubin also
welcomed the IMF program for South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"The United States, along with a number of other countries from
around the world, is prepared to provide additional, contingent
financing to reinforce the Korean program," Rubin noted. "This
support could be made available for a temporary period, if
necessary, to supplement the resources made available by the
International Financial Institutions and those raised on the
private markets.It would be conditioned on the implementation of
the appropriate macroeconomic and structural policies supported by
the IMF, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said, his country is prepared to provide up to 5 billion
dollars in assistance from the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization
Fund for the program.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Explains Military Operation In Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel today defended his troops' incursion into northern Iraq,
saying Turkey has no intention to damage Iraq's interests.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here today, Demirel said Turkish
military operations inside Iraq aimed at cracking down "terrorist
elements" - the separatist Kurdish Workers' Party, or PKK.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to be explained that Turkey is determined not
to give the terrorist elements any chance to take the area as
their base to commit crimes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's repeated troop incursions into northern Iraq to ferret
out fugitive PKK guerrillas and its closer military cooperation
with Israel have been strongly criticized by Arab neighbors and
regarded as a threat to regional security.
</P>
<P>
Demirel, who is on a two day visit to the United Arab Emirates,
said "we have no problem and dispute with Iraq." He denied reports
that Turkey has rescinded a decision to set up a security zone in
the mountainous northern Iraq, saying Turkey "has never talked
about an area with such a name."
</P>
<P>
Demirel arrived here early Wednesday after a three-day visit to
Oman. His trip is aimed to explain Ankara's stand towards its
military actions into northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, Demirel accused Syria of harboring PKK members, which
he said was "not only a charge, but also a fact." He said the PKK
head is now in Damascus and orders militants to enter Turkey for
sabotage.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Turkey will allow U.S. warplanes to take off from its
air base to strike Baghdad, Demirel said he believed "there is not
any move aiming at the use of force against Iraq."
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq should completely implement the U.N. resolutions
to eliminate weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Demirel is to return to Ankara Thursday.

ANKARA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel said today that the handicapped people in Turkey lead a
normal social life with self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
In his message to celebrate the World Disabled Day, Demirel
said the disabled in Turkey are not "different" from the other
citizens. The president is on a visit to the United Arab Emirates.
</P>

The disabled account for more than 10 percent of Turkey's
population, according to Demirel, who called it as one of the
thorniest social problems of the country.

Turkey's population stood at 61.1 million in 1994. According to
the World Health Organization, Turkey has 7.5 million disabled
people.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Concerned about Police Mistreatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has promised to battle the "chilling" problem of police
mistreating minorities, and said he is disturbed by racial
disparities in the use of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
In a newspaper interview to accompany his daylong forum on race
relations in Akron, Ohio, Clinton said unequal treatment by police
"eats at some communities in America as much as anything...even
though we've made a lot of progress."
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said in the Oval Office interview, published
Wednesday in the Akron Beacon Journal, that he is disturbed that
the death penalty is applied more frequently when a murder victim
is white, United Press International reported.
</P>
<P>
Clinton recalled during the interview Monday that virtually
every black journalist during a meeting with him earlier in the
year told him they had been stopped by a police officer "for no
apparent reason."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that meeting and subsequent discussions with other
blacks and Hispanics reported similar experiences, according to
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The president said he wanted to find a "highly visible public
forum" to air the issue of police discrimination, and suggested a
partial solution be found in the increased use of community-based
policing.
</P>
<P>
The president said, "What you want to do is to create an attitude
on the part of the law-enforcement officer that they don't stop
people just because they're black or brown or whatever."

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The previous two days'
rally on Europe's Leading stock markets ran out of steam
Wednesday and major index ended mixed, with London and Paris
all finishing slightly down while Frankfurt with moderate
gains.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index ended 6.9 points lower at
4,970.7 in thin trading as Britain's monetary policy
committee today started a two-day meeting on base interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a weak performance in New York today and Asian
markets' recent turbulence all hit market sentiment, with
volumes remaining low in both the cash and futures market.
</P>
<P>
"It's very quiet and there's very little business about,"
said one dealer.
</P>
<P>
On the Paris bourse, the CAC-40 index also finished in
the negative ground, down 10.74 points at 2,902.35, just
above the 2,900-point level.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that stocks drifted lower as the dollar
retreated against the franc.
</P>
<P>
However, German shares ended slightly firmer, with the
DAX-30 index 9.93 points higher at 4,082.89 after a see-saw
session.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that the market was quiet due to the absence
of any motivating factors both at home and abroad.

<HEADLINE> Athens Can Meet EU Convergency Criteria in 1998, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Greece could meet the
convergency criteria for European Economic and Monetary Union
(EMU) in 1998, National Economy and Finance Minister Yannos
Papantoniou said today.
</P>
<P>
Papantoniou told a Greek parliamentary committee that although
1998 would be a year of acceleration and structural changes, the
Greek government would win this battle.
</P>
<P>
Greece had changed the status of its economy and emerged from
instability, he said, but added that investments in both private
and public sectors needed a higher rate of growth and structural
changes were slow-moving.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government's budget for 1998, which aims at meeting
convergency criteria for EMU, was tabled last month to the
parliament for a final vote which is to take place on December 21.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry said in a statement today that the
European Union (EU) had endorsed changes proposed by Greece to its
economic alignment plan with the organization's other partners.
</P>
<P>
Under the changes, Greece's average consumer price inflation is
targeted at 5.6 percent in 1997, 3.7 percent in 1998 and 2.5
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is set at 3.5
percent in 1997, 3.7 percent in 1998 and 4.1 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The general government budget deficit is targeted at 4.2
percent of GDP in 1997, 2.4 percent in 1998 and 2.1 percent in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Greece is aiming to join EMU by January 1, 2001. Analysts here
believe that significant progress has for the past three years
been made with the fall in inflation and the budget deficit, but
the country still has a long and tough way to go.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Returns Home, Ends Row With Qatar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
returned home this evening, winding up his reconciliatory summit
with Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani in Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
Mediated by Saudi King Fahd, the president held talks with the
emir to end their deepening grudges that have marred relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued in Riyadh said the
tripartite meeting has led to "restoration of relations between
the two sisterly countries Egypt and Qatar to what they had been
before."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak told the press on his way back that he had spoken very
frankly on all topics of mutual concern with the Qatari emir.
</P>
<P>
He said he told the emir that differences between any two sides
are likely but "name-calling and insults by a minister against a
head of state and a whole people" are improper and unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to an allegation made by Qatari foreign
minister last month that Cairo was behind a failed coup in 1996 to
oust the emir, who himself toppled his father in a bloodless
palace coup in 1995. Egypt denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
"An atmosphere of frankness pervaded the meeting, which
occasioned an open discussion addressing grievances that caused
tension in Qatari-Egyptian relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
But there are still left-overs pertaining the Qatari minister's
remarks, which are "being discussed and on their way to be
solved," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said his lightning visit to Riyadh came in response to
King Fahd's invitation meet with the emir after the latter
expressed regret over what had happened between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has been on good terms with both Egypt and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian-Qatari ties deteriorated in October as Egypt boycotted
the fourth Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference in
Doha for lack of progress in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Qatar responded with a ban on the entry of nationals of Egypt
and other nine countries as a security precaution for the Doha
meeting, infuriating Cairo and other Arab neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Ireland Welcomes Britain Repatriating IRA Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government has
welcomed Britain's action to repatriate three Irish Republican
Army (IRA) prisoners to Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today the three IRA guerillas have been flown by a
British helicopter to a jail in the Irish town of Portlaoise,
according to press reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Irish Justice minister John O'Donoghue was quoted as saying
today that the Dublin government welcomed the British move "in the
context of ongoing developments in the (Northern Ireland) peace
process".
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the British government is likely to
repatriate more IRA prisoners to Ireland in an effort to give an
impetus to the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA, has reportedly
demanded that any deal emerging from Northern Ireland provide for
the release of hundreds of jailed IRA guerrillas.
