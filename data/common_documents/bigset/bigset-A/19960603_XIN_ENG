<HEADLINE> Christopher Insists Bosnia Elections Proceed as Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher today insisted that free and democratic elections
should be held in Bosnia as planned in September despite human
violations and other difficulties in implementing the Bosnian peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with U.S. CBS Television's Face the Nation
program, Christopher said that he had met with all the key figures
at a Balkan summit in Geneva earlier in the day and pressed them
on the election issue.
</P>
<P>
"I want to assure you that...elections will go on scheduled,"
Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
The planned elections are widely believed as a key milestone
for the success or failure of the U.S.-brokered Bosnian peace
agreement signed in last December.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official said that Washington expected that the
Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which
is overseeing the Bosnia elections, would certify at a June 14
conference in Florence, Italy that the polls should go ahead.
</P>
<P>
Christopher met in Geneva with Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio
Cotti, chairman of an international panel responsible for making
decision on the Bosnia elections, U.S. State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns told reporters covering Christopher's trip in
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Burns disclosed that discussions between Christopher and Cotti
focused on "whether or not elections can be held" in the war-torn
former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
"We have been given the not easy task of making a general
judgement about the conditions for organizing these elections,"
Cotti said after meeting with Christopher.
</P>
<P>
"We hope...(at) the end of this month to be able to give an
answer to that question," added Cotti whose commission is part of
the 52-nation OSCE.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Fightings still go on in Chechnya
after the ceasefire deal reached between the Russian authorities
and the Chechen separatists became effective midnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
Four Russian soldiers were killed and five others wounded when
their armored vehicle was blown up by a mine in the Chechen
capital Grozny on Sunday, Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Russian troops in Chechnya were attacked overnight by the

</P>
<P>
Twenty-six Russian soldiers were captured by the separatists
who stormed their post in the southwestern region of Nozhai-Yurt
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian forces accused the separatists of violating the
truce and demand the release of the 26 soldiers.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Government to Help Business Community on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Commerce Minister
Chaudhry Ahmed Mukhtar said today that the government will
formulate a new trade policy to help the business community on a
long-term basis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting held here by the Advisory Council of the
Ministry of Commerce, Mukhtar said Pakistan needs to further
diversify its exports, explore new markets and introduce new
offers.
</P>
<P>
The government will soon announce its trade policy for the
1996-97 fiscal year, he said. The new trade policy aims to
reassure the business community that they can plan their
activities without any fear of interruption and unwanted changes.
</P>
<P>
Mukhtar said the government will also announce policy
parameters, which are to be followed over the next 10 years so
that business activities can be planned on a durable basis.
</P>
<P>
The parameters would be based on the economic sense and
pragmatism and would remain undisturbed unless the future
government could choose to follow the negative course, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government is considering various measures to
increase exports. In a related effort, Pakistan must study the
needs of the markets for its goods and show an edge over the
competitors, he said.
</P>
<P>
The scenario of Pakistan's foreign trade during the first 10
months of the current fiscal year (July 1995-June 1996) is
indicative of a higher trade deficit, currently standing at 2.3
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mukhtar said the government has adopted a number of measures to
reverse the declining trend of exports. These measures are
expected to yield positive results in the years ahead, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
has pledged not to discriminate against mission schools in the
allocation of resources as they are playing an important role in
his country's education.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian News Agency today quoted the president as saying
in Ndola, northern Zambia, on Saturday that the private schools
should have the same access to educational materials and staff
development opportunities as any other educational institutions.
</P>
<P>
At a fund-raising dinner dance organized by St. Andrew's
United Church of Zambian Primary School, he said his government
could not alone provide educational services to the whole
country, therefore the mission schools should be assisted in
their provision of education services.
</P>
<P>
At the same function, Reverend Valerie Ogden of the United
Church of Zambia called on the government to waive customs duty
on donated goods from abroad.
</P>
<P>
She said prohibitive duties are making it difficult for the
church to collect goods donated by charitable organizations
abroad.

<HEADLINE> EU Vice-President Backs UK Stand on Beef Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) Commission
Vice-President Sir Leon Brittan has expressed support to Britain's
non-cooperation policy with the EU, urging the other EU countries
to ease the world-wide ban on British beef products exports.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC television interview this morning, Brittan
said it is not realistic for the British government to abandon its
non-cooperation operation while the ban on British beef exports
remain in force.
</P>
<P>
Brittan, a Conservative who served in the UK cabinet as home
secretary and trade secretary in the 1980s before becoming going
to Brussels, said "Britain can't really be expected" to end its
hard stand on the EU without a framework deal on steps to lift the
two-month-old ban.
</P>
<P>
Brittan, also EU Trade Commissioner, expressed the hope that
British Prime Minister John Major would reconsider the
non-cooperation campaign if the EU agree to lift the ban on
exports of some British beef by-products.
</P>
<P>
"I hope Britain will be able to respond to that success by
ratcheting down the non-cooperation policy. Let's start the
de-escalation process, if the lifting of the by-products ban goes
through," he added.
</P>
<P>
EU Agriculture Ministers are due to hold a special conference
in Luxembourg early next week to discuss lifting the ban on three
British beef by-products gelatine, tallow and semen.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Brittan also warned Major that pandering to "rabid
anti-Europeanism" would do his party, and Britain, no good.
</P>
<P>
"Don't let the Euro-sceptics call the tone. The Conservative
party is not going to win the election by rabid anti-Europeanism.
That will look like panic," he added.

HARARE, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Harare police today rounded up at
least 14 foriegners, mainly Nigerians, Ghanaians and Cameroonians
from Sunningdale and Martins suburbs of Harare in an early
morning swoop for as yet unspecified crimes.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said, withouth elaborating, that the
foreigners were now being detained at Harare remand prison.
</P>
<P>
Although the rumour in Sunningdale centres on deals in hard
drugs, it is likely that some of the foreigners were suspected of
either being illegal immigrants or not having their papers in
order.
</P>
<P>
In the swoop, police had to use teargas to arrest one of the
foreigners lodging at a house in Sunningdale. He had apparently
taken refuge in the ceiling, which soon collapsed and he fell
into the sitting room as the ceiling could not sustain his
weight.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Army Able to Crash Foreign Attack: Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran's armed forces are strong
enough to crush any foreign attack against this country, said
Ahmad Dadbin, commander of the Ground Forces of the Iranian Army,
today's issue of the government-owned Kayhan Havai weekly reported.
</P>
<P>
Dadbin warned that "Americans should think twice before attacking
us. I believe no country in the world would dare to attack us."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Iranian ground forces enjoy the maximum
standard of military preparedness to crush any foreign incursion
into Iran and hip any threat against the country's territorial
integrity in the bud.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian commander said the recent "Velayat" large-scale
military exercise was "a friendly gesture toward our friends and
a warning to our enemies."
</P>
<P>
"Our foes now understand that any threat against Iran will be
dealt with strongly," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "neither the international climate nor
America's situation allows it to seek adventurism against Iran
for the time being."
</P>
<P>
On the disputed islands of Abu Musa, and the Greater and Lesser
Tunbs in the Persian Gulf, which are also claimed by the United
Arab Emirates (UAE), Dadbin said the recent support given by the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) for the UAE is not important enough
to warrant a response.
</P>
<P>
"The islands are ours, and we are entirely prepared to protect
them. I vow that any threat against an inch of Iranian territory
will be met by a response from our strong army," Dadbin said.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the islands which are strategically located at
the mouth of the Hormus Strait, the gate way to the oil-rich Gulf
has existed since early 1970s between Iran and the UAE.
</P>
<P>
On November 30, 1970, one day before the British troops'
withdrawal and two days before the proclamation of founding of the
UAE, Iranian troops occupied the Greater and lesser Tonbs, and
took control of half of the Abu Musa island under an agreement it
reached with the UAE on joint administration of this island.
</P>
<P>
In September 1992, Iran declared it was the sole owner of the
island of Abu Musa and seized full control.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has affirmed its historical rights over the three
islands and called Iran for an unconditional dialogue through
international arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Iran has rejected UAE's call, saying that "there is no doubt
about Iran's sovereignty over the Abu Musa island and the Greater
and Lesser Tunbs.

<HEADLINE> US Accused of Interfering Zambia's Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government today
accused the United States government of gross interference in
Zambia's internal affairs by calling for the repeal of the Zambia
1996 constitution act.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Minister Christon Tembo said here that the
passing of the constitution amendment bill (the new constitution)
does not mean that nobody else can stand in the forthcoming
presidential elections but that only people with Zambian
parentage are eligible to contest.
</P>
<P>
The US government should not gauge Zambian democracy only by
the participation in the elections of former president Kenneth
Kaunda who is also president of the opposition United National
Independence Party (UNIP), Tembo pointed out.
</P>
<P>
His government is studying the statement of the US government
and a formal reaction will be announced later this week, Tembo
added.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here on Saturday, spokesman of the US
Department of State Micholas Burns revealed that the US
government is reviewing its bilateral and multilateral relations
and assistance programs to Zambia following the adoption of the
Zambia's new constitution.
</P>
<P>
Burns also claimed that the constitutional amendments in
Zambia are a serious threat to the integrity and credibility of
the electoral process and significantly undermined Zambia's
democratic development.
</P>
<P>
One clause in the Zambia new constitution stipulates that only
the second generation Zambians are qualified to stand as
presidential candidates in the coming elections, which will bar
Kaunda from contesting the presidency because his parents are
Malawian citizens.

<HEADLINE> World Meteorologists to Focus on Urbanization, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) will focus on climate change and water
thirsty, two critical problems related to urbanization, during the
Second U.N. Conference on Human Settlements (HABITAT II).
</P>
<P>
The HABITAT II, also known as "City Summit," is due to open on
June 3 here to work on solutions to urbanization-related problems
facing humanity.
</P>
<P>
According to a WMO report that reached here today, Prof. Godwin
O.P. Obasi, secretary-general of the WMO, will urge governments
and urban planners during the two-week event to carefully consider
environmental conditions in order to achieve and enhance the
quality of life in cities.
</P>
<P>
"Urban activities are major contributors to the increasing
emissions of greenhouse gases due to their relatively intense use
of energy," says Obasi.
</P>
<P>
He will call on the urban planners to design and build urban
areas in harmony with climates and the environment and will refer
to growing international concern about global warming and its
potential to cause serious disruption to the society.
</P>
<P>
Water is also a major concern not only in terms of the
availability but also the risks of pollution, flooding or
droughts, says the report.
</P>
<P>
The WMO will also participate in other HABITAT II dialogues,
such as "energy for the 21st century," "water, sanitation, waste
and the HABITAT agenda."

<HEADLINE> Five More Suspected CJD Cases Identified in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- British scientists have identified
five more suspected cases of the new strain of Creutzfeldt-Jacob
Disease (CJD), which is considered to have links with the BSE or
mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
All five patients are understood to be young and still alive,
but are suffering symptons typical of the new variant, which was
revealed two months ago by the British government, according to a
Sunday Times report.
</P>
<P>
The latest cases have been discovered by the official team of
scientists who are monitoring CJD. Scientists have categorized
them as probable CJD victims as CJD can only be confirmed only by
analyzing brain tissue after death, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that so far there have been only 12 confirmed
cases of the new CJD variant in the world, 11 in Britain and one
in France.
</P>
<P>
The five new cases were discovered after exhaustive
investigations of dozens of possible victims by the scientists at
the CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh.
</P>
<P>
Professor John Pattison, chairman of the goverment's Spongiform
Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC), gave a warning in March
that the number of new cases emerging over coming months would be
critical because a sudden rise could indicate an eventual epidemic
involving tens of thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
However, Pattison said this weekend that if only five more
cases were confirmed in the next few weeks, this would indicate
that predictions of a widespread epidemic were unfounded.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health was to set up a new system of
announcing each other's confirmed cases, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The first Palestinian airport,
situated near Rafah, south of the Gaza City was inaugurated today.
</P>
<P>
Amid cheers from Palestinians attending the inauguration
ceremony, a jet belonging to Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat was the first aircraft to land at the airport.
</P>
<P>
The 13-seat plane was donated by the Algerian government and
flown from Egypt by a Palestinian pilot. He waved a Palestinian
flag in the window as it touched down on the two-mile-long runway,
which took six months to build at the cost of 18 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Aviation Authority said that the airport will
eventually serve several hundred thousands of passengers annually.
</P>
<P>
Arafat this afternoon flew from the airport to London for a
visit to Britain. He is expected to hold talks with British Prime
Minister John Major Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo agreement, Israel is responsible for the
overall security of the Gaza Strip and Israeli police are
stationed at the airport.

<HEADLINE> GCC FMs Condemn Gaddafi for Anti-Kuwait Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) Foreign Ministers Condemned today the "irresponsible
remarks made by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi" which they
described as infringing on Kuwait's sovereignty and security.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here from the Saudi Arabian
capital of Riyadh, the GCC foreign ministers said in a statement
issued after their 59th meeting of the regional organization that
Gaddafi's remarks violated all norms and protocols observed in
international relations and constituted a violation to Kuwait's
independence and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan leader, who was on a state visit to Egypt from May
24 to 30, claimed at a lecture to Cairo University professors and
students Monday that Kuwait should not be declared as an
independent state as it is unable to defend itself.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were denounced by Kuwaiti senior officials and the
local media, and Kuwait has called back its head diplomatic
representative in Tripoli Khaled al-Dweilah for consultations.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi's remarks were also condemned by Arab League's
Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid, who expressed surprise over
Gaddafi's statements, saying that "the independence and
sovereignty of every member state is observed in the league's
charter."
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the GCC foreign ministers' meeting Omani Minister
of State for Foreign Affairs Yusef Ben-Alawi said the GCC
ministerial council statement "reflected the position of all GCC
member states which categorically reject such comments, especially
they are uttered by an Arab leader."
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait,
Bahrain, Qatar and Oman.
</P>
<P>
But the Omani minister denied the rumors that the GCC ministers
discussed steps aimed at freezing relations with Libya.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh
Sabah al-Ahmed al-Jaber had presented a detailed report to the GCC
foreign ministers' meeting, according to the local media.
</P>
<P>
No details of the report were available, but reports quoting
well-informed sources said it would help shape Kuwait's position
toward Libya in light of the statement by Gaddafi.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait reduced its diplomatic ties with Libya after its
liberation from the seven-month occupation by the Iraqi troops in
1991 because Tripoli stood on the side of Iraq during the Gulf War
which helped drive the Iraqi occupiers out of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Issue New Action Plan on Beef War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Senior British government ministers
are to hold a special meeting at the Downing Street tonight to
discuss Britain's new action plan on the non-cooperation campaign
against the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The meeting comes when the EU Agriculture Ministers are to hold
a conference in Luxembourg on Monday and Tuesday to consider a EU
proposal to lift the ban on exports of three British beef
by-products gelatine, tallow and bull semen.
</P>
<P>
A Sunday Telegraph newspaper report said that the new
government action plan include a 200-page report for eradicating
BSE or mad cow disease in an effort to persuade Britain's EU
partners into dismantling the two-month-old global ban on British
beef products exports.
</P>
<P>
British Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg will present his EU
counterparts with detailed proposals for a strict "passport"
system for all British cattle and also fresh plans for a selective
cull of suspect animals.
</P>
<P>
Under the new proposals, the British government would finance a
system of cattle passports stricter than that already in place in
Northern Ireland and individual animals' health details and
movements would be recorded on a central register.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Britain will push through legislation to
permit additional culling: if a calf develops BSE later in life,
all other animals born in the same season on he same farm will be
traced and destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The likely cost of the additional cull and the new register is
about 100 million pounds (15 million U.S. dollars), the report
said.

<P>
He denied the reports about the plans to force Turkey to

</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali said, "I have not come out with such a
proposal. It is the two communities living on the island who will
decide on this. We are not in a position to impose any
solution. As the U.N, our role is a fair mediation."
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general is expected to meet with Denktash in
Istanbul on June 5 and with Clerides in Geneva on June 11.
</P>

U.N.-sponsored efforts to reunite the Mediterranean island
under a federal system have been deadlocked for several years.

<P>
JERUSALEM, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister elect

with Arab neighbors, while stressing to bring unity, peace and
security to Israel.
</P>

home, and we must also continue peace outside Israel."
</P>
<P>
His 30-minute speech was repeatedly interrupted by the
thunderous cheers and applause from over one thousand joyful
Likud party supporters.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu called on Israel's Arab neighbors to "join us to go
on a way of security for everyone and every nation in the
region."
</P>
<P>
"We will improve our relations with Jordan and Egypt," he
said, adding that he will continue peace negotiations with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the Syrians to join the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>

bilateral relations, and expressed his intention to strengthen
cooperation between the two countries.

domestic issues, promising to bring "real peace with security" to
the Jewish state.

state."
</P>

without exception, stressing that all the non-Jewish people in
Israel is part of the country.
</P>
<P>
He also reaffirmed his commitments to uphold the free market
economy, improve education, and offer opportunity to everyone.
</P>
<P>
During his speech, Netanyahu paid tribute to his predecessor
Prime Minister Shimon Peres for his contribution to the country
in the last 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu became the first directly elected Israeli prime
minister, after defeating Peres with a razor-thin lead of 0.9
percentage points in the May 29 elections.

<HEADLINE> F.A.A Finds It Difficult to Control US Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration is finding more and more difficult to control the
u.s. airlines as they farm out an increasing amount of maintenance
work that stretches around the world.
</P>
<P>
Before deregulation of the aviation industry in 1978, u.s.
airlines did most of their work themselves, making it relatively
simple for regulators to examine records and aircraft to insure
that procedures were being followed properly.
</P>
<P>
But now u.s. airlines are trying to save money by hiring
companies domestically and overseas for major tasks like
overhauling engines, and they are farming out maintenance and
critical safety-related work to various companies at the many
airports they serve, New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
With this practice-- often called outsourcing--safety issues
arise as the potential for misunderstanding grows. Aviation
officials said that such a misunderstanding may have led to the
May 11 crash of a Valujet DC-9 outside Miami, which killed 110
passengers and crew members.
</P>
<P>
Since the deregulation of the industry, the number of new
airlines has grown rapidly, and in recent years the outsourcing
has become a way for both large and small airlines to lower costs
and increase revenue.
</P>
<P>
As a result, aviation experts noted, the web of relationships
between airlines and their contractors is growing exponentially,
outpacing the growth of the F.A.A.'s resources for overseeing the
industry.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that outsourcing maintenance increases
the risk of miscommunication and greatly complicates the F.A.A.'s
inspection task," said an aviation expert who is responsible for
examing the cause of airplane crashes.

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- An economic delegation from Taegu
City of the Republic of Korea (ROK) today concluded a visit to
Shanxi, a leading coal producer in north China.
</P>
<P>
During their visit they signed 12 letters of intent on
economic and trade cooperation with Shanxi.
</P>
<P>
The visit by the 13-member delegation has opened the door of
economic cooperation between the two sides, said Kim Han Kyu, head
of the delegation.
</P>
<P>
While in Shanxi, the ROK guests investigated the investment
environment, and held talks with local electrical and machinery,
building material, textile, catering, real estate and foreign
trade companies.
</P>
<P>
Hu Fuguo, secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the
Chinese Communist Party, said economic cooperation between his
province and ROK will bring out each other's strong points to make
up for their weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi will import technology and equipment from the ROK to
upgrade its textile industry.
</P>
<P>
Heads of a number of firms from ROK showed great interest in
cooperation with Shanxi in the fields of textile, real estate,
auto production and building industry.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi is expected to become "a new economic star" in China's
drive to accelerate development of the country's central and
western parts, Kim said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Construction Minister on Human Settlements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth and poverty
eradication hold the key to solving human settlements issues,
said Hou Jie, Chinese construction minister and head of Chinese
delegation to the Second United Nations Conference on Human
Settlements (HABITAT II).
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at today's opening session when
elaborating the Chinese government's views on how to realize the
two great objectives of "adequate shelter for all" and
"sustainable settlements development in an urbanizing world."
</P>
<P>
"The question of human settlements is, in essence, a question
of development," Hou told the official representatives from
nearly 200 countries.
</P>
<P>
He cited the principal root cause of deteriorating human
settlements in developing countries as "poverty and
underdevelopment."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, "only when sustained and all-around economic
development is attained, can it be possible to end poverty and lay
the foundation for a basic solution to the problems of human
settlements," said Hou.
</P>
<P>
He added that there should be a sustained and harmonious
development among population, environment and human settlements,
and solutions to human settlements issues require extensive
participation of entire society.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese minister pointed out that cities and countryside
should be given equal emphasis.
</P>
<P>
Referring to international cooperation, Hou said effective
cooperation is important in dealing with human settlement issues,
but they should be resolved in light of specificational conditions.
</P>
<P>
Official representatives from the host country Turkey, the
United States, France, the World Bank, European Commission and
other 16 countries or organizations also took the floor during
today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
With also the participation of non-government organizations and
specific forums, the conference will last two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Army Chief Promoted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Chief of Army Staff M.
Mahbubur Rahman was promoted today to the rank of lieutenant
general from major general, said a press release issued by the
Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Mahbubur took the post of Chief of Army Staff on May 20 when
his predecessor A.S.M. Nasim was sacked for alleged involvement in
a foiled mutiny.
</P>
<P>
During a simple ceremony at the presidential palace this
morning, President Abdur Rahman Biswas, who is supreme commander
of the armed forces, and Chief of the Naval Staff Rear Admiral
Muhammad Nurul Islam adorned Mahbubur with badges of the new rank.
</P>
<P>
Congratulating Mahbubur on his promotion, Biswas expressed the
hope for the army to march forward under his leadership and
through the united efforts of all members of the army.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's laws, only the chief of army staff can be
promoted to lieutenant general, which is the highest military rank
in Bangladeshi armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Although Mahbubur's promotion seemed to be a normal practice,
it has drawn wide public attention as the former largest
opposition party, the Awami (people's) League, has blamed
President Biswas for holding the defense and armed forces
portfolios.

<HEADLINE> US Construction Spending Up 1.4 Percent In April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Construction spending in the
U.S. rose 1.4 percent in April, the second straight advance, the
U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that spending on residential,
nonresidential and public projects in April totaled 551.7 billion
dollars at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, up from 544 billion
in March.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Department also revised the March gain in
construction spending down to 2.4 percent, rather than the
original estimate of 3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said that residential spending, 45 percent of the
total, increased 1.4 percent on top of March's 2.4 percent gain.
Spending on single-family homes rose by 0.5 percent to a 155.7
billion dollar rate. It was the fourth consecutive monthly
increase.
</P>
<P>
Government outlays rose 1.4 percent to a record 148.3 billion
dollar rate after advancing 3.8 percent in March. Spending on
sewer systems was up 12.6 percent and on water supply facilities,
up 21.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite higher mortgage rates, sales of new homes totaled
776,000 at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in April, the fourth
straight month that sales have topped the 700,000 mark, the U.S.
Commerce Department reported last week.
</P>
<P>
But analysts maintain that sales are near their peak and will
slow eventually as buyers feel the effects of rising rates.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh failed to achieve its salt
production target for the current season because of bad weather,
informed sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The country produced only 600,000 tons of salt from January to
May, about 200,000 tons short of the target, as bad weather has
been prevailing in the country during the peak season of May, said
the sources.
</P>
<P>
However, the salt supply is still expected to meet the demand
of consumption as there was a bumper harvest last year, the
sources noted.

<HEADLINE> Bahrain Accuses Iran of Coup Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Bahrain today announced
a defeat of coup d'etat plotted by Iran and the arrest of 29
related people, according to reports reaching from Manama.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain Information Minister Mohammed al Muttawa told
correspondents that the 29 people supported by Iran wanted to
replace the ruling family of Bahrain with a Shiite Moslem
government similar to Iran, the Manama-based Gulf News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain was recalling its ambassador from Iran, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Buttawa did not say when the arrests were made, but said that
the detainees had given full confessions last month, detailing
their links to mainly Shiite Iran.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain was also sending special envoys to Gulf and other Arab
states to explain the details.
</P>
<P>
So far, there was no Iranian reaction to Bahrain's latest
accusations.
</P>
<P>
Muttawa said some of the alleged plotters -- all of them
Bahrainis -- were arrested as they tried to return to the
country. Others were rounded up in Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
He said the plotters belonged to a movement calling itself
"the Military Wind of Hezbollah - Bahrain" and that it could still
be active.
</P>
<P>
"The movement's main aim is to stage an armed revolution to
overthrow the Bahrain government by force and replace it with a
pro-Iranian regime," Muttawa said.
</P>
<P>
He said the movement had been founded in the Iranian city of
Qom in 1993, "under the guidance and the full financial and
resource backing of Iranian authorities and the intelligence
department of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards."
</P>
<P>
Violence by activists of a Shiite-led opposition has based
Bahrain since December 1994, and a total of 28 people have been
reported killed in the unrest.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) called on Iran not to engage in "acts of sabotage,"
following a foreign ministers' meeting in Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
The GCC states "demand that Iran does not interfere in the
internal affairs of Bahrain and (other GCC) member states."
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and
the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

<P>
MANILA, June 3 (Xinhua-OANA) -- The Guangdong Hongyuan from
China beat Jordan's Orthodox 93-73 to win its opening group A
match at the Asian Champions' Cup basketball tournament here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Orthodox Club, most of it being national team members, held
off the Chinese assaults in the earlier minutes but saw their
scoring power dwindling later on.
</P>
<P>
The Hongyuan broke away from the tenth minute and led the firt
half by 19 points, mainly on its concerted lane attacks.
</P>
<P>
The winner kept the momentum going in the second half and
enlarged the advantage to the victory.
</P>
<P>
But the Hongyuan's coach Wang Lifa was not satisfied.
</P>
<P>
"My team should score at least 120 points," he said. "Their
performance today was not satisfactory."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese club will face the Hapee Toothpaste of the
Philippines while the Orthodox Club will meet the Indonesia's
ASPAC in group A on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Group B teams include Malaysia's Petronas, South Korea's Tong

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Fifth seed Goran Ivanisevic of
Croatia and Austria's titleholder Thomas Muster were eliminated in
the fourth round of the French Open tennis tournament here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic fell to unseeded German Bernd Karbacher 3-0 while
second seed Muster was knocked out 3-1 by 15th seed Michael Stich
of Germany.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian, apparently hindered by a blister, could not find
his usual big-serving form and failed to slam blistering aces.
</P>
<P>
Unseeded Karbacher, now ranked 55th in the world, needed only
80 minutes to clinch a 6-3, 6-1, 6-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that Karbacher reached the last eight
of a grand slam event since the U.S. Open in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Stich, a semifinalist here in 1991, outpowered Muster 4-6, 6-4,
6-1, 7-6 in two hours and 36 minutes.
</P>
<P>
It was only Muster's second loss on clay this season following
a defeat by Spain's Carlos Moya in Munich, Germany, last month.
</P>
<P>
In the women's fourth round, third-seeded Spaniard Conchita
Martinez beat South African Amanda Coetzer 6-2 6-3 to set up a
quarter-final clash with ninth-seeded American Lindsay Davenport.

<HEADLINE> China To Protect Agricultural Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking official with the
Ministry of Agriculture said here today that China will do more to
avert the agricultural environment from deteriorating in the
coming years.
</P>
<P>
"A deteriorating agricultural environment still poses a
hindering factor for agriculture growth," said Hong Fuzeng,
vice-minister of agriculture, at a press conference marking "world
environment day" which falls on June 5.
</P>
<P>
According to Hong, the country will work out a series of new
laws and regulations and will strengthen law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Calling the ecological farming and comprehensive construction
of rural energy as successful models for sustainable growth of
agriculture, Hong said China will get more counties to try the two
models.
</P>
<P>
China now has 50 counties carrying out ecological farming
trials and another 138 trying out rural energy construction.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it will spare no efforts to bring the pollution of
township enterprises under control, Hong said.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, no new companies and projects with
severe pollution problems will be built or allowed to
operate. Existing polluters will be set a deadline for improvement.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also on a regular basis, release details of
outdated processes and equipment which cause severe pollution and
which should fall into disuse, Hong said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the construction of grasslands and protection for
fishery environments are also given priority in the agricultural
environment protection schedule, Hong said.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Assad Call for United Arab Front </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
his Syrian counterpart Hafez al-Assad today called for a united
Arab front in dealing with the new Israeli government led by Prime
Minister-elect Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference following their three-hour talks,
the two leaders urged Arabs to take time to see what policies
Netanyahu would follow.
</P>
<P>
The summit between Mubarak and al-Assad came amid concerns of
the Arab world that right-wing Likud leader Netanyahu's victory in
last week's Israeli elections would slow down the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Things are not going in a positive way," al-Assad told the
press conference. "We have to be fully alert and on guard."
</P>
<P>
He said that the resumption of Syrian-Israeli talks is "out of
the question now."
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad, who was met by Mubarak at the airport when he arrived
in Cairo earlier today, said he believes the United States is
serious in its efforts to bring about peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said during his election campaigns that he would take
a tougher line in peace negotiations with the Palestinians and
Syria than Shimon Peres, the outgoing prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said he rejected the return of Golan Heights to Syria
and holding talks with the Palestinians on the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the Golan and Arab east Jerusalem in the 1967
Middle East war. Syria demands the return of the strategic plateau
as a prerequisite for making peace with Israel, while the
Palestinians want to establish an independent state with Jerusalem
as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Israel has regarded Jerusalem as its united, eternal capital.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said at the press conference that if the Israelis,
under the leadership of Netanyahu, want a real and comprehensive
peace, the Arabs are ready for peace.
</P>
<P>
His talks with al-Assad dealt with Egyptian-Syrian relations
and the current situation in the region in the wake of the Israeli
elections, Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian president's visit to Egypt came just one day after
his meeting with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi in Latakia, Syria.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad and Hrawi held talks Sunday to coordinate their
stances on the peace process following Netanyahu's upset win over
Peres in the elections, the Cairo press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad and Mubarak would also hold a tripartite summit with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Aqaba, Jordan, Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Japan, U.S. Discuss Semi-conductors, Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto and U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale today
discussed trade issues including disputes over semi-conductors and
insurance, a top Japanese government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
During an 80-minute meeting at the premier's official
residence, Hashimoto and Mondale agreed on the need for Japan and
the United States to continue sincerely their talks on
semi-conductors, insurance and other bilateral economic issues,
Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
But Hashimoto expressed concern over whether bilateral talks
can resolve the semi-conductor trade dispute, noting that Europe
has also shown a desire to join the talks, Kajiyama said.
</P>
<P>
Japan has rejected a U.S. call to renew their bilateral chip
pact beyond its expiration July 31, arguing that government
involvement is no longer necessary given the growing presence of
foreign chips in the Japanese market.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese and U.S. semi-conductor industries are discussing
a private-sector partnership to replace the pact, but there are
differences over whether they need government involvement in one
form or another.
</P>
<P>
Mondale told reporters after the meeting that he and Hashimoto
also discussed the upcoming summit of the Group of Seven (G-7)
industrialized nations in Lyons, France.
</P>
<P>
He declined to comment when asked if he made any new proposals
on the semi-conductor row or if there was discussion on the
so-called "third-sector" insurance market dispute.
</P>
<P>
Japan is planning to deregulate its insurance market and allow
companies to enter the third sector of sickness, accident and
nursing insurance products.
</P>
<P>
The United States wants that area, already dominated by foreign
companies, to remain closed until there is an agreement on opening
up other areas of the Japanese insurance market to foreign
competitors.

<HEADLINE> Millions Of Chinese Give Lifelong "One Child" Vow (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 49 million couples in
China have vowed to have only one child throughout their lives.
</P>
<P>
Support for the family planning policy among the population has
helped to postpone the day the Chinese population hit 1.2 billion
by nine years.
</P>
<P>
"The change of the views among Chinese parents on birth has
indicated the success of the country's family planning work," said
Wang Guoqiang, director of the Department of Policy and Law under
the State Family Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
He said it enhanced the central government's confidence in
controlling the population to within 1.3 billion by the end of this
century.
</P>
<P>
A new survey has shown that China's natural population growth
rate dropped from 25.83 per thousand in 1970 to 10.55 per thousand
last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 the multi-child family rate reduced by 9.8 percentage
points from 19.3 per thousand in 1990 reflecting the continuous
shrinkage of family sizes.
</P>
<P>
Experts in population agreed that publicity and education on
the government's family planning policy over a number of years had
paid off.
</P>
<P>
The traditional idea of "more sons as a sign of good fortune",
and "earlier marriage and birth" are being replaced with a new
drive to improve the quality of life. One child means a better
education for the youngster.
</P>
<P>
China's family planning has concentrated on the vast rural
areas which accounts for 80 percent of the country's total
population. It is in the rural areas where peasants usually felt
the need for more hands to do manual field work because of lower
productivity.
</P>
<P>
In Xifengshan Village on Beijing's outskirts almost all the 300
families have voiced the wish to have only one child per family.
</P>
<P>
"As most field work is done by machine nowadays there is much
surplus labor in the countryside. In addition a family with many
children has to spend more on bringing up and educating them, and it
can hardly lead a better life," said villager Li Fengrong.
</P>
<P>
She disclosed that the government's preferential policy towards
those who have one to two children per family has also greatly
benefited farmers financially.

batch of beneficiaries of its Industrial Competitiveness
Enhancement Teams (ICET), an official said here today.
</P>
<P>

It serves as a counterpart of the Export Development Council

<P>
Santos said the ICET task force would identify the first batch
of 10 products as pilot areas to be presented to the
Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council in September.
</P>

The criteria for the selection of industries are the potentials
of the industry sector, local added value and linkage to other

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Buddhists Joyful about Monkhood of 11th Panchen Lama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIGAZE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The blare of religious horns at the
Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery in Tibet in the morning today started a
celebration to mark the monkhood of the 11th Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
The lamasery basked in sunshine, colorful drapings swung in
a soft wind, and the golden board inscribed by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin glowed.
</P>
<P>
The celebration, attended by some 1,000 officials and Tibetan
Buddhist believers, was sponsored by the lamasery's Democratic
Management Committee.
</P>
<P>
At about 8:30 in the morning, the 11th Panchen Lama came to the
courtyard amid religious music, and ascended the holy throne of
successive Panchen Lamas to the rapturous applause and recitations
of religious scriptures.
</P>
<P>
Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, vice-chairman of the Chinese Buddhist
Association (CBA) and honorary chairman of the CBA's Tibetan
branch, solemnly kowtowed three times toward the 11th Panchen
Lama, and presented a white Hada, a piece of white silk fabrics
for respect, to the latter.
</P>
<P>
Respectively, the young Panchen Lama offered back a Hada and an
auspicious belt.
</P>
<P>
After that, Living Buddhas of various Tibetan Buddhist sects
and representatives from major temples and lamaseries in Tibet
worshiped the Panchen Lama, holding Hadas high in their hand.
</P>
<P>
Living Buddhas from Tibetan-inhabited areas in Qinghai
Province, including Living Buddha Jamyang from the Lapuleng
Monastery, attended today's celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Entrusted by the mass of Buddhist believers, the Living Buddhas
went especially to worship the 11th Panchen Lama Sunday afternoon
and presented gold images of Buddha and brocade.
</P>
<P>
The Panchen Lama touched their heads for blessing, and gave
them gifts and his photograph.
</P>
<P>
Jamyang expressed his heartfelt greetings to the Panchen Lama
on behalf of all monks and other Buddhist believers in the
Lapuleng Monastery, expecting that the Panchen Lama will carry
forward Tibetan Buddhism and the patriotic tradition of successive
Panchen Lamas.
</P>
<P>
Coming from the hometown of the 10th Panchen Lama, Quan Demin,
vice-chairman of the Xunhua County committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, in Qinghai Province,
conveyed the wishes of Yabxi Soinam Zhoima, mother of the 10th
Panchen Lama, to the 11th Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
Yabxi Soinam Zhoima is too old to come to Tibet herself, but
she expected the new Panchen Lama to grow up soundly.
</P>
<P>
Zhubkang, a Living Buddha from northern Tibet grassland, said
that the whole processes from searching and reincarnation of the
10th Panchen Lama to the 11th Panchen Lama's initiation into
monkhood were conducted in strict accordance with historical
conventions and religious procedures in the light of the Communist
Party's religious policy.
</P>
<P>
"It shows that all religious activities which go with the
interests of the state and religious believers and laymen, and in
conformity of the country's laws will be protected and supported
by the Party and government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lama Gyaincain Qoizha said, "The 11th Panchen Lama is our
leader of Tibetan Buddhism, and will be always worshiped and held
in esteem by the masses of Buddhism believers."
</P>
<P>
The State Council Religious Affairs Bureau, the Chinese
Buddhist Association, the Higher Buddhism Academy of the
Tibetan language system, and other Buddhist organizations in
Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, as well as in Tibet
sent telegrams and letters of congratulations.
</P>
<P>
At about 11 o'clock in the morning, the 11th Panchen Lama left
the Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery amid the blare of religious horns, and
Tibetan believers along the way worshiped putting their palms
together before their chests as a Buddhist greeting.

<HEADLINE> Russian Ice Hockey Coach Offers Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Vladimir Vasilyev, coach of the
Russia's national ice hockey team, offered a resignation on Monday
following his players' poor results at last month's world
championship, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Russians, who have won the world championship for a record
22 times, finished a lowly fourth in Austria.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Russian Ice Hockey Federation president Valentin
Sych confirmed Vasilyev's resignation letter and said it would be
considered at an executive meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
Vasilyev, who led the Soviet youth side to the 1986 world
title before coaching club sides in Russia and Germany, took the
job only a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Russia, along with the Soviet Union from which it
disintegrated, never went more than two years with winning a title
since 1963.
</P>
<P>
However, it has been weakened as many of its players go to play
in the American and European leagues.
</P>

Russia last won the world champion in 1993 and failed to win
medals at the last Winter Olympics.

From a long-term point of view, the United States will lose the
most potential market in the world -- China. At the same time the
US will also lose many potential investment opportunities and
interests, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The losses suffered by the United States obviously outweigh
its gains," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Tommy Hui, chairman of Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce in China,
said China has done much, and has also made effective progress in
protecting Intellectual Property Rights, the issue that has
sparked the threat of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
However the United States always regards itself as a superpower
and imposes power on other countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The trade sanctions to be imposed on China by the United States
have gone beyond the normal international economic and trade
activities, he noted, adding that it is unnecessary for the
Chinese government to give in to the threats.
</P>
<P>
In referring to the resumption of the Sino-US negotiation on
IPR, both Ng and Hui hoped the two sides will adopt a practical
attitude to settle the problem on the basis of mutual respect and
equal consultation.
</P>
<P>
This is also what all the people in Hong Kong expect, Ng
added.

in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The celebration was convened today by the lamasery's Democratic
Management Committee.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Puchu, chairman of the Chinese Buddhist Association, sent

"That is great event for the 11th Panchen Lama, and a great and
happy thing for Tibetan Buddhism," he said.

stride with his growth under the care of the Chinese Communist
Party Central Committee and the State Council, as well as the
great support of the Democratic Management Committee of the Zhaxi
Lhunbo Lamasery and other senior monks," he said.

firmly oppose activities in violation of the country's
constitution and other laws," he noted.

<HEADLINE> 1st Doctor of Business Administration Program Offered in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Polytechnic
University (PolyU) will offer the territory's first professional
doctorate program in business administration in the coming fall
semester.
</P>
<P>
The Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) program is designed
 for practitioners wishing to further develop their professional
competence, according to Prof. Rick So, head of PolyU's Department
 of Management.
</P>
<P>
Unlike traditional Ph.D. programs which aim at training
students to become academics and researchers, the DBA is a
professional practice degree at the highest level of business
education, said Prof. So.
</P>
<P>
It takes three to six years to complete the program, which
comprises five compulsory core modules, three selective modules,
two residential workshops, an applied research project and a
thesis. In each academic year at most 15 students will be
enrolled.
</P>
<P>
Applicants are required to have a master degree in management
and at least eight years' managerial experience at a senior
level.

MACAO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Investors from China's mainland,
Macao and Japan will invest a total of 750 million patacas (about
94.9 million US dollars) in six major projects in an industrial
park in Macao.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Issues 1995 Report on Environmental Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- China today issued a report on its
latest environmental situation, giving a detailed account of the
country's problems and the efforts China has made in improving its
environment.
</P>
<P>
The 18-page, 15,000-word report focuses on the environmental
situation of air, water, urban and rural areas, radiation, land,
forest, climate change, natural disaster, industrial pollution,
environmental pollution accidents and the economic losses caused
by the accidents, and the environmental pollution and its impact
on human health.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, director of the State Bureau of Environment
Protection, said today in a speech summarizing the report that
"generally speaking, in 1995, the waste of resources,
environmental pollution and biological degradation was grave."
</P>
<P>
He attributed the issue to the country's large population of
1.2 billion, fast economic growth, low-level technology and
management.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 governments at all levels improved their work in
environmental protection and additional achievements were made
with the environmental situation improved in parts of the country,
the director said.
</P>
<P>
Since the United Nations Environment and Development Summit
held in 1992 in Brazil, he said, China has placed much greater
emphasis on environmental protection, and listed the issue of
environment and ecology as one of its major issues which should be
solved by attaching great importance and making painstaking
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Sustainable development strategy has been listed as the guiding
principal of the country's social and economic development, Xie
added.

<HEADLINE> Millions Of Chinese Give Lifelong "One Child" Vow (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Local officials in charge of family planning agreed that the
government's practice of combining the service of family planning
with women's health care and establishing social security has
freed farmers of the fear of living lonely lives without financial
support during their old age.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials small family sizes has also enabled
family members, the mother-in-law in particular, to realize the
importance of family harmony. Less and less mothers-in-law are
persuading their daughters-in-law to have more children to keep
the family roots.
</P>
<P>
The view of "one child per family" was accepted quickly in
urban areas with its faster living tempo, intense competition and
pursuit of careers.
</P>
<P>
"If I get married and have a child early I will not have enough
energy to work as hard as any man in this competitive age," said a
female graduate student at the Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that Chinese women are marrying six months
later on average in 1994 compared to 1990. The rate of one-child
families in 1994 increased by two times over 1970.
</P>
<P>
A statistical report by the United Nations indicated that
China's natural population growth rate is obviously lower than
other developing countries. This may help the government to
improve the health and education of its people.
</P>
<P>
The lifespan of the Chinese has doubled compared with 40 years
ago, and China has now become one of the countries in the world
with the fastest increase in people's life expectancy.

<HEADLINE> Auto Tech PSE '96 Kicks off in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The changing world of the
automobile hit the road in China today when a major show opened in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Auto Tech PSE '96 (PSE: short for presentation, symposium and
exhibition), displaying internationally recognized new automotive
products and automobile development technologies, opened in the
capital.
</P>
<P>
It is the third such international event held by the Chinese
Ministry of Machine-building Industry (MMI) following Family Car
PSE '94 and Auto Parts PSE '95.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiaoyu, director of the Automotive Industry Department of
the MMI, said that the show aims at promoting links between China
and the rest of the world concerning automobile development
technology, the formation of development capability for the
Chinese automotive industry and the common development of the
world's automotive industry.
</P>
<P>
About 80 auto manufacturers, computer firms and test equipment
companies from other countries and regions, and around 300
domestic automotive administrative departments, research
institutes, institutes of higher learning and automotive companies
are taking part in the event.
</P>
<P>
Zhang told Xinhua that to maintain steady and sustained
development, China's automotive industry must establish an
independent development system. Otherwise, China will never become
a major automotive country in the world.
</P>
<P>
China has set a goal to make its major automotive products
reach the international levels of the 1990s by the year 2000 and
advanced levels by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Zhang disclosed that China encourages the development of large
assembled car projects and the establishment of key spares and
parts enterprises in cooperation with the rest of the

<HEADLINE> NATO Foreign Ministers Approve European-only Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- After more than two years'
wrangling, the foreign ministers of NATO's 16 member states today
ratified a plan to set up European-only military units which will
exclude U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
The decision gives the green light to the creation of Combined
Joint Task Forces (CJTFs) which will be used by European nations
for peacekeeping or relief missions.
</P>
<P>
The CJTFs will not have U.S. participation but will use
American military hardware, such as intelligence, communications
and airlift assets.
</P>
<P>
The plan, adopted at the spring session of the North Atlantic
Council, gives European nations more flexibility and resources to
deal with regional crises in Europe.
</P>
<P>
For example, members of the 10-nation Western European Union
(WEU), Europe's defense organization which complements NATO, could
conduct an operation using American equipment without involving US
ground troops.
</P>
<P>
However, the North Atlantic Council, made up of representatives
of the 16 NATO members, will authorize missions for the new
forces, which will, in effect, give the United States the power of
veto.
</P>
<P>
Although the Europeans could, under the new plan, mount their
own peacekeeping operations, a U.S. senior official told reporters
that he expected such operations to be "smaller scale missions"
and "very few and far between."
</P>
<P>
The principle of the CJTFs was first proposed by the United
States at a NATO summit in January 1994 with the aim of shifting
more of the alliance's security responsibilities to Europe.
</P>
<P>
But the plan stalled due to differences between Washington and
Paris over the U.S. role and influence over the use of NATO staff,
equipment and headquarters.
</P>
<P>
France was initially opposed to parts of the plan because of
its 30-year refusal to place its forces under NATO command.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough has been made possible by the recent
willingness of the French to take part in NATO activities and
institutions, including participation in the Peace Implementation
Force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The ratification of the CJTFs concept also gives non-NATO
nations, especially countries in central and eastern Europe, the
chance to participate in the more flexible and mobile forces.
</P>
<P>
Over the next six months, NATO military leaders will put the
concept into operation, including identifying where the CJTFs
should be headquartered and who should command them.
</P>
<P>
At the one-day meeting, the foreign ministers also approved the
creation of a political-military policy coordination group, made
up of two members per delegation, to smooth decision-making within
the alliance.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Stocks fell sharply in Tokyo today
amid news reports of a virtual bankruptcy of a nonbank
institution, and the U.S. dollar eased against the yen, slipping
to the mid-107 yen level.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed at
21,588.52, down 367.67 points, or 1.67 percent, from Friday's
close.

The Tokyo Stock Price Index, covering all first-section stocks
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, dropped 21.93 points, or 1.30
percent, to 1,658.64.
</P>
<P>
The dollar's decline against the yen on today's Tokyo Foreign
Exchange was due in part to the U.S. currency's weakness against
the German mark and partly to a late afternoon rumor in the market
of a possible default by the Brazilian government.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was quoted at 107.62-65 yen at 5 p.m., down from
108.15-18 yen at 9 a.m.. It moved between 107.50 and 108.29 yen

BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng today called on
academicians from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese

development policies.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of a joint conference for the

</P>
<P>
The key to the realization of China's Ninth Five-Year Plan

the country's economic system must change from the traditional
planned economy to the socialist market economy.

Li Peng said this will be difficult, and requires intensified
development of science and technology. He added that science and
technology are needed to play a bigger role in the country's
economic growth.

The Chinese Academy of Sciences is the country's leading
institution of science and technology and is a center for
comprehensive research in these fields.

The Chinese Academy of Engineering also provides a top-level
arena for agricultural, medical and health care engineering.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Vows to Attract More Foreign Direct Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province, one of the traditional industrial bases in the country,
has vowed to readjust its strategic plan for foreign investment
over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Huang Baoying, deputy director of the provincial planning
commission, said that the province will attract more foreign
direct investment (FDI), in addition to utilizing indirect
investments like low-interest loans provided by foreign
governments or international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Large-scale investments are sought by the area for technical
renovation, but state input is limited, Huang noted.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment provides a crucial financial source, but the
structure of foreign investments requires to be re-worked, Huang
said, because it is difficult for the government to repay too many
outside investments.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, the proportion of FDI among the total
foreign investment is expected to rise to 70 percent, equivalent
to 11 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, Liaoning has utilized over 7.4 billion US dollars
of foreign investments, 60 percent of which were FDI.
</P>
<P>
Large companies or consortia from North America, especially the
United States, are welcome to work with the province toward the
development of the automotive, chemical and electronics
industries, Huang said, adding that the province also will
intensify cooperation with West Europe, especially Germany, in the
areas of machinery, metallurgy and electronics.
</P>
<P>
Huang said Liaoning plans to strengthen ties with the Republic
of Korea, Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and other
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The province will diversify its means of using overseas
investment by establishing joint ventures, creating an enterprise
for technical renovations, setting up a firm exclusively funded by
foreign businessmen, leasing and engaging in compensation trade.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a transfer of share ownership and the formation of a
stock system to develop priority projects in need of funds will be
introduced.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is also expected to explore the possibility of forming
Sino-foreign joint venture banks, trust and investment companies,
financial companies and investment companies.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS) saw the birth of its first five foreign academicians at a
conference at Jingxi Hotel here today.
</P>
<P>
Members include Nobel Prize winner Chen Ning Yang; Chang-lin
Tien, president of California University, Berkeley; Shiing-shen
Chern, a retired professor of math at the California University,
Berkeley; Samuel Ting from west Europe; and Leroy Chang from Hong

</P>
<P>
Prior to the conference's opening ceremony, the foreign
educators met with academicians of the CAS and the Chinese Academy
of Engineering, Premier Li Peng and Vice-chairman of the National
People's Congress Wu Jieping.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese academicians have higher status than their American
counterparts," 85-year-old Shiing-shen Chern said. "New
academicians in the United States only appear in on-the-campus
press."
</P>
<P>
"I visited new China for the first time 25 years ago," Chen
Ning Yang said. "I will come again to attend the academicians'
conference of the Chinese Academy of Sciences 25 years later."
</P>
<P>
Samuel Ting said he is researching the space station in
cooperation with the institutes of high energy and electronics
under CAS. A total of 60 Chinese scientists are assisting him.
</P>
<P>
"I am both an engineer and an academician of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences," Chang-lin Tien said. "I hope that I can
serve as a bridge between the Chinese Academy of Engineering and
the Chinese Academy of Sciences."
</P>
<P>
Leroy Chang puts the title of CAS academician at the top of his
business card, which carries five academic titles, including one
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
"In comparison with other foreign academicians, I am closest to
Beijing," he told fellow academicians.

<HEADLINE> Iran Sticks to Anti-US Line: Religious Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah
Khamenei today vowed to continue the Islamic revolution and hold
high the anti-U.S. banner passed from late spiritual leader
Ruhollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
"Iran will never make any compromise with the enemy," said the
57-year-old Iranian leader while addressing more than 10,000
people in a ceremony to commemorate the 7th anniversary of
Khomeini's death at his mausoleum in southern Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that more people are now turning to Islam and the
Iranian revolution. He called on the people to continue the
Islamic revolution pioneered by Khomeini and protect the
achievements of the revolution.
</P>
<P>
He said the government and the nation should through wise
steps prevent destruction of the accomplishments of the
revolution.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the strongly-worded statement by
Khamenei serves as a message not only to the United States but
also to Iranian liberals backed by moderate President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, who has attempted to resume relations with the U.S..
</P>
<P>
President Rafsanjani, who has been under harsh attack by
hardliners, including Khamenei, for soft stance toward the United
States, did not appear at today's commemorating ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Hardliners such as temporary Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nouri and judicial chief Mohammad Yazdi attended the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,500 foreign guests from Islamic countries such as
Pakistan, Syria, Sudan and Afghanistan were invited to the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said in his speech that the path of Khomeini is not
over, but it is at the beginning of the new phase. His path is not
just for the Iranian nation to follow but for all the oppressed
third world nations to follow.
</P>
<P>
He called on all Islamic countries to resist foreign
influences led by the United States and its allies.
</P>
<P>
Iran has succeeded in its ideological struggle against the
enemies because it was not intimidated and did not have a second
thought about its rightful path, said Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the Arab-Israeli peace process, saying "the
Americans want to pave their way for using force and intimidation
and they want to have Iran to sign the imposed peace."
</P>
<P>
"Under no circumstances can the Iranian nation and government
bypass or ignore the right of the Palestinian people," he
stressed.

WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Shawn Kemp and Gary Payton
combined 48 points to lead the Seattle SuperSonics to a 90-86 win
over the Utah Jazz Sunday, entering the NBA Finals with a 4-3
overall victory in the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
This is the Sonics' first time to advance to the NBA Finals
since 1979 when they beat Washington Bullets for their only title.
</P>
<P>
Seattle will meet the Chicago Bulls in the finals beginning
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Utah was seeking to become the sixth team in NBA history to
come back from a 3-1 deficit, but the Jazz ended up getting beat
at their own game.
</P>
<P>
The Sonics did not score a single fastbreak point, but they
shot 54 percent in the halfcourt offense and got four clutch free
throws from Kemp in the final 77 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Malone, plagued by foul shooting problems throughout the
postseason, missed a pair with 8.2 seconds left that could have
pulled Utah within one. Hersey Hawkins was fouled on the rebound,
made one throw and the outcome was sealed.
</P>
<P>
Kemp had 26 points and 14 rebounds and Payton added 22. The
efforts of those two helped nullify the 22 points scored by both
Stockton and Malone.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Oil Revenues Increase in First Quarter of 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) earned 38.1 billion U.S. dollars in oil
revenues in the first quarter of this year, as compared to 35.6
billion dollars in the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
A report by the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation said
that the 6.9 percent increase in oil revenues was due to the rise
in crude oil prices and oil exports, the Egyptian Middle East News
Agency (MENA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The average price for a barrel of oil exported by the OPEC
increased from 16.52 dollars in the first quarter of 1995 to 17.63
dollars this year, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC exported 23.9 million barrels of crude oil per day in
the first quarter of 1996 as compared to 23.4 million barrels a
day in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
During the January-March period of this year, Saudi Arabia's
oil revenues reached 12.8 billion dollars, up 4 percent over the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Venezuela were the two OPEC member states which
achieved the highest increase rates in their oil revenues in the
first quarter of 1996. Oil revenues of Nigeria rose by 22 percent,
and that of Venezuela, 25 percent, MENA quoted the report as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Soy Milk Nourishes Rural Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Four government departments will
initiate a national program in September to improve nutrition for
rural Chinese children below age 15.
</P>
<P>
The "soybean action" program is to provide soybean milk or
other soybean products every day for children in the countryside as
a replacement for cow milk and other meat protein.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Chinese Consumers' News, quite a few
children in rural areas, especially those in poor districts,
suffer from malnutrition-related health problems, and cannot be
provided with sufficient high-protein foods like cow milk and meat
products.
</P>
<P>
A pilot program will be carried out for three semesters in 24
primary and middle schools in 12 counties and cities.
</P>
<P>
The four State departments, the Ministry of Public Health, the
Ministry of Agriculture, the State Education Commission and
China's National Council of Light Industry will jointly contribute
500,000 yuan (64,240 US dollars) to buy equipment and materials
for the pilot schools.
</P>
<P>
The work will be spread to other rural areas later.
</P>
<P>
The country has experienced greatly increased consumption of
meat, eggs, and fish products in the past decade, and as a result,
the consumption of grain products is decreasing, said Chinese
Consumers' News.
</P>
<P>
Yet, there is still a gap between urban and rural residents in
terms of quality of foods and nutrition conditions -- a gap that
is most obvious among teenagers.
</P>
<P>
The lastest national survey on nutrition showed that in 1992,
the intake of protein for each person in rural areas averaged 64.3
grams, 10.8 grams less than that of an urban residents.
</P>
<P>
In the countryside, only 17.2 percent of protein substances
come from soybean and meat products, 20.1 percent lower than
people in cities.

COLOMBO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Ceylon Electricity
Board (CEB) lost over 27 million US dollars in earnings during an
82-hour strike by CEB workers, which started last Wednesday,
according to the CEB sources today.

The country has been troubled by power blackouts and water
supply cutoffs for four days since a strike staged mid-day
Wednesday by CEB employees, who demanded that the government give

Electricity was resumed in all parts of the country by last
afternoon and water services returned to normal as well, said

<HEADLINE> South Korea Holds 11th Trial of Two Former Presidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The 11th trial session on mutiny and
treason charges involving former presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh
Tae-woo was held at the Seoul District Court here today.
</P>
<P>
Also standing trial at the court were Chun's 11 close aides,
including former first army corps commander Hwang Young-si.
</P>
<P>
Chun Doo-hwan admitted today that he and his close aides
formulated a plan to settle the political tensions in the country
in May 1980, but again rejected the prosecution's charges that the
aim of their move was to usurp the power.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers today completed their cross-examination of the
13 defendants involved in the military revolt on December 12, 1979
and began to question eight defendants involved in the bloody
crackdown of the civil uprising on May 18, 1980, in Kwangju,
capital of South Korea's South Cholla Province.
</P>
<P>
In earlier cross-examination by defense layers, all defendants
alleged that their arrests of the then Army Chief of Staff Chung
Sung-hwa and several other loyal generals on December 12, 1979,
was not a mutiny, but a legitimate and unavoidable action needed
to investigate the assassination of President Park Chung-hee.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16 former South Korean army officers including Chun
and Roh have been indicted for mutiny or treason, or both. The
mutiny and treason charges respectively stem from their roles in
the 1979 military revolt and the 1980 military crackdown of the
Kwangju civil uprising.
</P>
<P>
Chun Doo-hwan, who loomed large as the army strongman after the
1979 military revolt, seized power on August 27, 1980, and ruled
the country until February 1988. He was followed by Roh Tae-woo
who stepped down in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
The two former presidents, who were arrested last year, have
also been indicted for graft charges because they accepted huge
bribes from businessmen while in office.

<HEADLINE> Japan's TV Entering Multichannel Digital Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Japanese television will move into
the era of digital multichannel satellite broadcasting in
September when PerfecTV Corp. launches pay service on about 60
channels, Kyodo News Service reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
PerfecTV Corp. has been jointly established by four major
trading houses -- Itochu Corp., Mitsui and Co., Sumitomo Corp. and
Nissho Iwai Corp. -- and Japan Satellite Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
For a one-time subscription fee of 2,800 yen and a monthly
basic fee of 290 yen, viewers will be able to watch channels
dedicated to programs such as news, children's programs, dramas,
movies, language lessons, sports and hobbies, according to the
company.
</P>
<P>
PerfecTV will be followed by DIRECTV Japan Inc., established by
DIRECTV Inc. of the United States and a group of Japanese
companies, including Tokyo-based rental video chain Culture
Convenience Club Ltd.
</P>
<P>
DIRECTV Japan plans to launch service in the summer of next year
on as many as 100 channels.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong-based satellite broadcasting operator Star TV,
which started Japanese-language cable-TV service in April, is
preparing to increase the number of its channels to six in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
Digital broadcasting uses communication satellites to provide
high-resolution moving images and high-quality sound on four to six
times as many channels as older analog systems.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, consumers must be persuaded to spend 50,000 to 60,000
yen for an antenna and tuner to watch the new services. Despite this
high cost, PerfecTV projects one million subscribers within three
years and five million in five years.
</P>
<P>
Multichannel broadcasting will present strong competition to
conventional satellite stations, rental video shops, movie theaters
and cable services.

Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on nine brands of baby milk
showed that they contain a chemical substance called phthalates
that could destroy some spermatozoon-producing cells.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from the Kuwaiti Health Ministry said in a
statement that the ministry was cooperating with some scientific
and university institutions to conduct the tests and determine
whether the imported British milk products conform to
international specifications.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait imports baby milk products from Britain, Denmark, the
Netherlands, the United States, France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Milk products from these countries besides Britain will also
be tested, the spokesman said, adding that any unhealthy product
will be destroyed and withdrawn from the market.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that tests on baby milk in Britain last week
showed that higher-than-permitted levels of chemicals used to
soften plastics were present in every sample on nine leading
brands in the country.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Asked to Mediate on PNA Jerusalem Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Palestine National Authority
(PNA) Sunday asked Jordan to mediate with Israel to halt a
reported plan by Israeli newly elected Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to shut down the PNA representative office in east
Jerusalem, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Omar Khatib, the Palestinian ambassador to Jordan, Sunday told
Jordan Times in an exclusive interview that the request was made
by Faisal Husseini, who is in charge of the Jerusalem portfolio in
the PNA, during a meeting with Jordan's Prime Minister Abdul Karim
Kabariti.
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to update Kabariti with the latest developments and
keep close coordination with Jordan regarding Jerusalem," Khatib
was quoted as saying by the daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreements with Israel and if the Israelis choose to
dishonor these agreements we will have to ask other parties
concerned in the peace process to intervene," he added.
</P>
<P>
Husseini's visit came one day after Jerusalem's Israeli mayor
announced that Netanyahu would shut down the Orient House, which
officially served as a headquarters for the Palestinian delegation
responsible for holding peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1994 Palestinian-Israeli declaration of
principles, the fate of Jerusalem should be determined in the
final status negotiations which began last month in Taba, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Jerusalem is expected to be high on the agenda of
the tripartite summit of King Hussein of Jordan, Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. The
meeting is scheduled to be held Wednesday in Aqaba, the south Red
Sea port city of Jordan.

<HEADLINE> NATO Foreign Ministers Meet on Alliance's Future Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers of the 16 NATO
countries opened a one-day meeting here this morning to discuss
the future role of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will focus on the Combined Joint Task Forces
(CJTFs) plan which would allow European forces to conduct military
operations without U.S. participation but use American military
assets.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that this plan, which was approved by NATO's
Permanent Council last month, and the creation of a policy
coordination group charged with smoothing the way for
decision-making, will be approved by the 16 foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
The plan is the first major step in the adaptation of NATO, set
up in 1949 during the Cold War, to its new post-Cold War
missions.
</P>
<P>
The other main topic at the meeting is the development of the
European security identity within the alliance.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will give detailed instructions on how the
alliance's internal adaptation should take place to preserve the
transatlantic link while developing the European identity, a
senior NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also touch on such issues as NATO's
Implementation Force operations, France's closer ties with the
Alliance, the individual dialogue on NATO's enlargement, relations
with Russia and Ukraine, the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe
Treaty and the dialogue with the Mediterranean countries.

<HEADLINE> Poll Says Rating of Jordanian Government Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The ratings of Jordanian Prime
Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti and his government in terms of
performance in the first 100 days in office have fallen, an
opinion poll showed.
</P>
<P>
The poll, which was carried out by the Center for Strategic
Studies at the University of Jordan between May 17 and 19, has
found that the rating of the prime minister himself remained
higher than that of the government.
</P>
<P>
The poll groups the respondents into two categories: the
general public, which includes 1,200 people aged over 19 selected
at random throughout the kingdom, and the public opinion leaders,
which involve 678 former and serving members of parliament and
former officials, including ministers, party leaders and union
leaders as well as journalists.
</P>
<P>
Among the general public, 84.4 percent believe that the prime
minister himself was shouldering his responsibilities "to varying
degrees," down from 95.3 percent in the last survey conducted
shortly after Kabariti formed his government early February.
</P>
<P>
Those who show disappointment at the prime minister increased
from 4.6 percent to 7.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, 88.3 percent public opinion leaders, compared with
85.5 percent in last survey, think that the prime minister has
succeeded to "some extent."
</P>
<P>
Eighty-two percent of the public opinion leaders, up from 81.7
percent, believe that the government will succeed to some extent,
while 80.9 percent of general public, down from 92.6 percent,
think so.
</P>
<P>
However, the poll did not show the margin of error.

<P>
The three oxthodox parties now have a combined 23 Knesset
seats. Another extremist oxthodox religious party, the Moledet,
retains two seats.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli secular and non-oxthodox religious circles fear
that the resurgence of oxthodox religious forces in the Knesset
will be translated into legislations curtailing religious freedom
and pluralism.
</P>
<P>
Israeli's Reform Movement held a meeting Sunday to map out a
strategy to respond to the challenge.
</P>
<P>
Zamira Segev, executive director of Hemdat, the Council for
Freedom of Science, Religion and Culture in Israel, said she is
planning to appeal to the Jews of the world to defend the
religious freedom in the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
"We fear the new Knesset will introduce an extremism on
religious issues," she was quoted by the Jerusalem Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, although the religious parties have yet
formulated their demands, they vowed to right what they described
as "wrongs of the past years."
</P>
<P>
UTJ's MK Avraham Ravitz said: `We don't want to change the
status quo. We just want to preserve it." But he added the
religious parties will undoubtedly work to ensure that state
companies do not work on Shabat, the Jewish weekend, and that
other laws regarding Shabat observance are enforced.
</P>
<P>
It means that the religious MKs will try to pass legislation to
enable municipalities to crack down on stores and movie theaters
operating on weekends.
</P>
<P>
Referring to an issue of primary concern to the Reform and
Conservative movements, Ravitz said that the religious parties
would also work to ensure that conversions to Judaism by
non-orthodox rabbis in Israel would not be recognized.
</P>
<P>
Another area of confrontation is the Basic Laws, in particular
the Human Dignity and Freedom. Segev pointed out that there has
been an agreement between Shas and the late Premier Yitzhak Rabin
that the law would be amended so as not to affect matters of
religion.
</P>
<P>
Although the agreement was never carried through, Segev noted
that such an amendment would mean an infringement of the basic
rights of the individual.
</P>
<P>
Yitzhak Rath, spokesman for the National Religious party, said
his party will make demands concerning the Basic Laws and "do
something" about the High Court, a powerful tool for non-oxthodox
religious movements to fight for their rights.
</P>
<P>
Hemat's another concern is the possible reversal of Education
Ministry reforms, such as implementing the recommendations of the
Shenar Committee to promote a pluralistic approach in teaching
Jewish subjects in non-religious schools.
</P>
<P>
Segev also feared that an education minister from the
religious parties might insist that every archeological excavation
be supervised by rabbis to ensure that any Jewish tomb is left
undisturbed.
</P>
<P>
"It's the classic conflict between freedom of science and
religious extremism," she was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> UN Conference on Human Settlements Opens in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Second
Conference on Human Settlements (HABITAT II) opened here today
with the participation of delegates from nearly 200 nations who
will work on global policies concerning urbanization-related
problems facing the human beings.
</P>
<P>
The themes of the two-week conference, also known as "City
Summit," are sustainable human settlements in a rapidly urbanizing
world and adequate shelter for all.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali declared the
summit open in the newly-inaugurated Istanbul Convention and
Congress Center.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Ghali first paid his tribute to the
people of Istanbul and Turkey who have welcomed delegates from
"every continent, representing major capitals, provincial towns,
megalopolis and small urban neighborhoods."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the city summit is the last in a series of
such United Nations meetings which have shaped, during the 1990s,
an agenda for development for the whole world.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the U.N. chief said, HABITAT II is a new
departure for the U.N. to address the mounting challenges
concerning urban environment.
</P>
<P>
"We should all be conscious today that the decisions taken
here in Istanbul will be of relevance not only for the world of
today, but for the world in which our children must live and
prosper," said Ghali.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, who was elected chairman of
today's opening session, extended warm welcome to the delegates
from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Istanbul conference provides "a crucial
opportunity" for world leaders to commit themselves to the urgent
cause of making the world's cities, towns and villages healthy,
secure and sustainable.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative that we seek a global approach, solidarity
and consensus on the ways to bring remedies to the problems that
accompany rapid urbanization the world over," Demirel said.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of non-government organization representatives and
experts have also started their forum activities in accordance
with the "concept of partnership," described as an inclusive
approach by the HABITAT II Secretary General Wally N'Dow.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak held
talks here today with his Syrian counterpart Hafez al-Assad on the
future of the Middle East peace process in light of the election
of Benjamin Netanyahu as Israel's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The talks also dealt with Egyptian-Syrian relations and a
tripartite summit grouping Mubarak, King Hussein of Jordan and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat scheduled for Wednesday in Aqaba,
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Assad's visit to Egypt, which is expected to last just a few
hours, came one day after his meeting with Lebanese President
Elias Hrawi in Latakia, Syria.
</P>
<P>
Assad and Hrawi held talks Sunday to coordinate their stances
on the peace process following Likud leader Netanyahu's victory in
last week's elections, the Cairo press reported today.
</P>
<P>
In his first public speech after winning the election for the
premiership, Netanyahu pledged Sunday to continue peace talks with
the Palestinians and other Arabs.
</P>
<P>
But Israel's Arab neighbors have been apparently worried over
Netanyahu's statements during the election campaign that he would
take a tougher line in peace negotiations with the Palestinians
and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Assad arrived here earlier today and was met by Mubarak at the
airport.

<HEADLINE> Underprivileged College Students Receive Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Wang Chunsheng, a sophomore at the
Chinese University of Science and Technology, won't ever have to
worry about a tuition bill thanks to a scholarship program that
benefits underprivileged students.
</P>
<P>
"Supporting the Poor," a system created in 1995 by the
university, offers full scholarships, student loans and financial
aid, and has helped 300 students continue their education.
</P>
<P>
Wang, an orphan, enrolled in this leading university in east
China's Anhui Province in 1994. Early on, he was distressed about
how to finance his education, but with a scholarship to take on
his tuition costs, he now enjoys school and excels in his studies.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, about one-third of the underprivileged students received
scholarships totalling 45,000 yuan (5,170 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The university also has provided interest-free loans and
part-time employment opportunities for the students.
</P>
<P>
These students can get up to 45,000 yuan from the system per
year, as well as from a number of off-campus foundations.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: GCC Countries Take Wait-and-See </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Gulf Arab countries have taken
a wait-and-see attitude toward Israeli general election results
while expressing the view "that peace has become an essential
matter not only for the Arabs and Israelis but also for the others
in the world."
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
countries ended their 59th meeting in Saudi capital Riyadh Sunday
night, stressing that they still support the Mideast peace process
as long as the new Israeli government led by right-wing Likud
leader Benjamin Netanyahu commits itself to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
But they refused to take a clear-cut stand or make any comment
on the results of the just ended Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu defeated Israeli outgoing Prime Minister Shimon Peres
in the elections by a marginal edge. He has to form a new
government and take over the negotiating process from the
incumbent premier, Shimon Peres, whose left-wing Labor Party had
started and kept going the peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Evidence showed that the GCC countries, which include Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates
(UAE), did not rush into taking a stand on Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem Jaber Al Thani,
who chaired the GCC foreign minister's meeting, said "this issue
is under study and evaluation in Qatar."
</P>
<P>
Echoing his remarks, Qatari newspaper Al-Raya said, "Even if
the policies of the new prime minister give priority to security
over peace, time must be given to the new Israeli government to
demonstrate its intentions and there should be no quick
judgements."
</P>
<P>
The Qatari foreign minister was reported to have said that "we
can not give in to panic, or take action before knowing
(Netanyahu's) true positions."
</P>
<P>
This perhaps reflected a general point of view among the six
GCC countries on the Israeli election results, an official close
to the meeting said Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi newspaper Al-Medina, which reflects the view of the
Saudi government, said that Netanyahu would have no choice but to
abide by the commitments taken by the previous Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
In Kuwait, the independent daily Al-Watan described Peres'
defeat as a "catastrophe," but no official responses to the
election results have been made so far.
</P>
<P>
Qatar, which has moved faster than its Gulf Arab partners to
set up economic ties with Israel, said it was studying the results
of the latest Israeli elections and will deal with the new
government according to its attitude toward the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Qatar's capital Doha were also reported to have
said that they will consider slowing down the pace of normalizing
the ties with the Jewish state, although they will not reverse the
tide following the elections.
</P>
<P>
Media from the GCC states have a general opinion that peace is
a goal that has to be reached to protect the region from violence
and counter-violence.
</P>
<P>
A Kuwaiti newspaper said in a commentary today that peace will
continue, with or without Peres.
</P>
<P>
However, according to various reports available here today,
many Gulf and other Arabs also voiced fear about Netanyahu's
campaign promises to take a tougher stand in the peace talks and
his refusal to accept the creation of a Palestinian state or give
back the Golan Heights to Syria.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
trying to gain more points on peace two weeks before Russia's
election, is to meet the presidents of Armenia, Azerbaijan and
Georgia on Monday on regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Yeltsin, Armenia's Levon Ter-Petrosyan,
Azerbaijan's Heidar Aliyev and Georgia's Eduard Shevardnadze are
to tackle all conflicts in the Caucasus region of the former
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
A major topic at the meeting in the Russian town of Kislovodsk,
200 kilometers north of Chechnya, will be the 18-month conflict
between Russia and rebel Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has said he has no chances of re-election unless he
makes major progress in ending the Chechen conflict.
</P>
<P>
Other conflicts to be discussed at the meeting include the
territorial dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the
enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, and the conflict in Georgia's Black
Sea province of Abkhazia which is seeking breakaway.
</P>
<P>
The four presidents are expected to sign a declaration "For
Inter-Ethnic Accord, Peace, Economic and Cultural Cooperation in
the Caucasus".
</P>

Major battles in Abkhazia and Nagorno-Karabakh effectively

<HEADLINE> State Banks in Capital Surplus in Ho Chi Minh City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- All state banks in Ho Chi Minh city
are now in a state of mobilized capital surplus, the "Vietnam
News" daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The English daily quoted the State Bank of Vietnam as saying
that the total amount of idle mobilized capital at these banks is
estimated at about 14,000 billion Vietnamese dong (about 1.27
billion U.S. dollars), constituting 60 percent of the banks'
mobilized capital in circulation.
</P>
<P>
"The total deposit liabilities at the banks increased 15
percent since the beginning of the year, despite a reduction in
bank interest rats. As a result, the banks' activities in the city
were slowed down," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It added that nine banks, including five commercial banks,
suffered losses in their commercial transactions by April, while
the other banks reported profits which were lower than that in the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the loss, according to the commercial
banks, is that the regulations applied to banks are too severe,
notably the regulation of credit, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, most of the loans granted by the banks are
short-term loans. Medium and long-term loans do not find many
customers because most of the people who seek these types of loans
do not fit the qualifying criteria.
</P>
<P>
To tackle this impasse with the banks, the Finance Ministry has
allowed banks to use their idle mobilized capital to purchase
treasury bills.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Religious Parties Disagree on Portfolios </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The religious parties, which won
a total of 24 seats in the 120-member Knesset (Israel's
parliament) elections last Wednesday, have so far failed to reach
agreement on portfolios to be discussed in the upcoming coalition
talks.
</P>
<P>
Sunday night, representatives of Shas, the National Religious
Party (NRP) and the United Torah Judaism (UTJ) held a
meeting in Jerusalem in an attempt to prevent a situation in
which they enter conflicting claims for the same portfolio,
such as the Religious Affairs portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Although the parties were reported to be trying to
formulate an agreement to share the Religious Affairs Ministry,
this did not get off the ground because both the NRP and
Shas wanted to take hold of the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
However, the religious parties were united in calling on the
Likud not to set up different ratios between portfolios and the
number of members of the Knesset for its self and its partners,
the Tzomet and Gesher parties.
</P>
<P>
NRP leader Zevulun Hammer said that his party would not
threaten the Likud over the issue, but stressed that without
the NRP, which will have 9 seats in the new Knesset, there
would be no coalition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister-elect Benjamin Netanyahu, who was
reported to try to form his new cabinet in 10 days, has
order Likud director-general Avigdor Lieberman to start conducting
coalition negotiations today.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu defeated Prime Minister Shimon Peres with a narrow
lead of less than one percentage point in the May 29 prime
ministerial election, and will become the first directly elected
Israeli premier.
</P>
<P>
He will have no trouble forming a coalition with the
religious bloc, Yisrael Ba'aliya, the new immigrants party which
won a projected 7 seats, and the Third Way, a new group
initiated by hawkish Laborites, with 4 mandates.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Likud chairman has not ruled out the
possibility of forming a national unity government with Peres
and his Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
However, he made it clear in a phone conversation with Hammer
Thursday that he would not make any move without the agreement of
his "natural coalition parties," and that he would approach
them.

<HEADLINE> Mkapa Calls Off Bodies Retrieval from Sunken Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 3 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa has
called off the operation to recover bodies still trapped in the
sunken mv Bukoba and declared today a public holiday to end
mourning of the death of hundreds of passengers.
</P>
<P>
The president made this announcement in Mwanza on Sunday after
consultations with the international team of divers and regional
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said funeral prayers would be said at the site of the
accident today, effectively making the mv Bukoba wreckage the
mass grave for the remaining bodies.
</P>
<P>
Flags will fly at half mast, the president ordered. So far 392
bodies have been recovered and more than 200 others will still be
trapped in the wreckage, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
Only 114 people survived the country's worst tragedy. the
heavily overloaded ship had upwards of 700 passengers when it
capsized and sank near Jumaa island, eight nautical miles from
Mwanza port.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa said he had accepted the advice of the divers
from Tanzania, South Africa and Kenya, that the extraction of
bodies should be abandoned because the remains were so decomposed
they were disintegrating.
</P>
<P>
Only pieces of limbs could be pulled out, not whole bodies and
the exercise was becoming increasingly unbearable to the divers'
health and psychologically.
</P>
<P>
The divers also told the president that the operation had
become risky because the ship had now sank four meters in mud and
visibility in the third class compartment holding the remaining
bodies was extremely limited.
</P>
<P>
After laying a wreath, Mkapa said that the government would
fence off the site and erect a monument as a memory for the
national disaster.

<HEADLINE> IMF Goes on Backing Zimbabwe's Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) will continue to financially assist Zimbabwe's economic
structural adjustment program despite its poor fiscal
performance, an IMF official has said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe will have to wait until after the July national
budget to find out what the new form of assistance will be like,
IMF's director for the African department Evangelos Calamitsis
said in Harare over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations for the disbursement of the outstanding 100
million U.S. Dollars have been closed, he said, adding that
''there is no need to talk about old money; we are going to talk
about new arrangements and new money.''
</P>
<P>
The director, who is in charge of 44 Sub-Saharan countries,
pointed out, ''there has been no such thing as suspension of the
IMF assistance to Zimbabwe.''
</P>
<P>
Calamitsis said Zimbabwe, like other members, entered into
financial arrangements for periods of time. It entered into one
such arrangement which expired last year in September and since
then there has been no new arrangement.
</P>
<P>
''It is true that Zimbabwe's performance during that period of
the arrangement was not fully satisfactory... having said that
there have been continuous dialogue between the two parties to
work on a new one.
</P>
<P>
''Over the last three years, the IMF had disbursed to Zimbabwe
465 million U.S. Dollars by the time the arrangements had
lapsed,'' said the director.
</P>
<P>
He added the IMF is now waiting for this year's budget to see
how Zimbabwe would tackle areas that it had not done well in the
three-year period that expired last September.

<HEADLINE> GCC Revenue up in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The combined revenue of the six
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members stood at 82.16 billion
U.S. dollars in 1995, 4.26 billion dollars more than that in 1994.
</P>
<P>
A study published by the latest issue of the local monthly "Oil
and Industry News" attributed the revenue increase of the GCC
countries to the rise of world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and
the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
Among them, Saudi Arabia's revenue was 47.88 billion dollars in
1995 compared with 46.5 billion dollars in 1994. Kuwait's income
climbed to 11.77 billion dollars in 1995 from 11.3 billion dollars
in 1994, and the UAE's revenue rose to 13.9 billion dollars from
12.6 billion dollars during the same period, the study said.
</P>
<P>
The income of Oman, Qatar and Bahrain, which produce less oil,
also increased slightly, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
The GCC countries produce 13 million barrels of oil per day,
accounting one fifth of the world's total oil production. Their
oil reserves, which are estimated at 465 billion barrels, account
for 45 percent of the global oil resources.
</P>
<P>
The increase of oil income led to the growth of the gross
national product (GNP) of the GCC members. The combined GNP of the
GCC surged to 234 billion dollars in 1995 from 225.7 billion
dollars in 1994, the study said.

<HEADLINE> Rwandese Refugees in Tanzania Urged to Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Rwandese refugees in
Tanzania have been urged to return home to develop the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
Rwandese Foreign Minister Anastace Gasana made the urge here
over the weekend, saying that the Kigali authorities have already
prepared an appropriate environment for the insertion into the
society of all refugees returning home.
</P>
<P>
"We are appealing to all those who fled the county to come
back and their assets will be refunded, as we have done to 15,000
other refugees expelled from Zaire," the minister said in an
interview at the Kilimanjaro Hotel here.
</P>
<P>
"Presently, the situation for our people is safe. Businessmen
and employees are conducting their daily activities without
having to worry about security," he said. "Even those going to
nightclubs and discotheques do not have to worry", the minister
emphasised.
</P>
<P>
Fears of retaliation on the mainly hutu refugees who go back
home should not be entertained because the government "will
continue to take appropriate measures to control such situation",
he said.
</P>
<P>
Rwandese refugees should take into account the fact that the
refugee population was burdensome for the host country to keep
them, he stressed. enditem

<HEADLINE> 3,000-year Human Remains Found in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Researchers recently have found
nearly 3,000-year-old human remains in northern Nepal, according
to official daily the Rising Nepal today.
</P>
<P>
In a recent excavation project in a burial cave with an
elevation of 3,600 meters in northern Nepal's Mustang district,
the researchers found a mummified leg of a woman and a fetus.
</P>
<P>
According to the archeologists, the mummy, believed to be the
oldest found in the Himalayan region, might hint that the human
settlement in the area could be dated back to about 3,000 years
ago and could help trace out the development of early human
civilization in the area.
</P>
<P>
The exact date of the findings was yet to be known before
laboratory results come back from Germany, but it could be dated
back to as early as the 8th century B.C., the newspaper quoted a
senior Nepali archeologist as saying.
</P>
<P>
The new findings in Mustang valley, not far from Nepal's
northern border with China's Tibet autonomous region, would help
study the history of Nepal up to 2,900 years ago, the expert
believed. At present, Nepal has a written history of 1,700 years.
</P>
<P>
The findings also showed that Mustang valley in ancient times
used to be a flourishing trade center between Nepal and
neighboring Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The excavation also found ancient household items including a
leather bag and some artifacts in the burial cave.
</P>
<P>
The excavation work in the valley began in 1991 with the
cooperation of a foreign institute and the first phase of the work
concluded recently found more than 3,000 man-made burial and
dwelling caves in the valley, according to the experts.

<HEADLINE> India's CPI Decides to Join New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of India
(CPI) Sunday decided to join the newly-formed United Front
government, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
At a marathon two-day session, the CPI National Council voted
overwhelmingly for joining the government.
</P>
<P>
CPI Deputy General Secretary A.B. Bardhan said the decision was
taken to strengthen the United Front government and to give it
greater credibility and stability.
</P>
<P>
Asked who were being considered as ministerial candidates from
the party, he said "we are in no hurry. ... the issue was being
discussed in the party."
</P>
<P>
However, sources within the party indicated that CPI General
Secretary Indrajit Gupta and Central Secretariat member Chaturanan
Mishra were likely ministerial candidates.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) continues to
stick to their previous stand of not joining the United Front
government.
</P>
<P>
The 13-party United Front government was sworn in on June 1
after the resignation of the Bharatiya Janata party-led coalition
government. But only five of the 13 parties in the front have so
far participated in the new government.

<HEADLINE> Australian Jobs Market Foresees Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Australian jobs market is
expected to rebound in the latter half of the year as key job
indicators picked up recently.
</P>
<P>
The ANZ job advertisement series released today showed an
increase of 3.6 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
The ANZ job ads series is composed by calculating the number of
job advertisements on major newspapers in all big cities in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
The indicator is believed to lead the official employment
figures by six months. That means an increase in the ANZ series
in May foreshadowed a rally of the Australian jobs market in the
latter half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate surged to 8.9 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
An ANZ bank economist said that despite the recent increase in
job ads, the unemployment rate was to grow further to around 9
percent later this year before falling back.

<HEADLINE> New Israeli Gov't May Halt Peace Process: Malaysia PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia holds that the new
Israeli government may disrupt the peace process in West Asia,
Malaysia's English newspaper New Straits Times quoted Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad as saying today.
</P>
<P>
According to New Straits Times, Mahathir said in Langkawi
Sunday that Malaysia would wait and see the developments following
the election of Likud party chief Benjamin Netanyahu as the new
prime minister of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the change in Israeli leadership and the fears
expressed by Arab leaders including Yasser Arafat, Mahathir said:
"I am of the opinion that Netanyahu's victory is also a victory
for the Hamas in disrupting the peace process."
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia will watch the developments in the region," Mahathir
said, adding if the sides concerned remained unreasonable, there
would never be peace in West Asia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi
said Sunday in Kepala Batas that he hoped Netanyahu would continue
with the task of pursuing peace with the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
"It is our wish that whatever decisions made by Israel and the
Palestinians when Peres was in power will be implemented," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian foreign minister said: "It is difficult for
Malaysia to have any diplomatic relations with Israel if they are
not going to achieve something worthwhile."

DHAKA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Awami (people's) League (AL), the
former largest opposition party in Bangladesh, has decided to
observe a nation-wide "anti-terrorism day" Wednesday 5 to protest
against the recent killing of a party leader by its rival, the
ex-ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
</P>
<P>
According to an AL announcement Sunday, on the day
"anti-terrorism" rallies will be held in Dhaka and other parts of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Memorandums will also be given to the Election Commission in
Dhaka and the administration at the local level in other parts of
the country, AL officials said, expressing concern at the
terrorism which "is a conspiracy by the BNP to foil the coming
(June 12 parliamentary) election."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that an AL leader, ward commissioner in Dhaka
S.M. Shahabuddin, was shot dead last Friday in broad daylight.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Air France will set up its
Asia-Pacific regional center in Hong Kong to expand its business,
local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The center will be Air France's only regional headquarters
outside Paris and the move is viewed as a departure from the
airlines' policy of running its international operations from the
head office.
</P>
<P>
Arthur Bullard who will head the airlines' Asia-Pacific
operations said the establishment of the regional headquarters was
the first step in a significant, long-term push into China and
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Asia-Pacific region was "very high" on Air
France's international agenda.
</P>
<P>
He said that top priority in the region was China, with plans
for the group to establish services direct to Shanghai from Paris
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Air France's only operations in China consist of a four-flights
a week service from Paris to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He said that the airlines is looking to increase this service,
including setting up a shop in Shanghai, and possibly in
Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
He said that the move was a "vote of confidence in China".

<HEADLINE> Australian Foreign Debt Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Australia's foreign debt fell in
the first quarter of this year, according to a survey released by
the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) today.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that the country's net foreign debt fell by
161 million Australian dollars (127.2 million US dollars), or 0.1
percent, in the March quarter to 184.7 billion Australian dollars
(145.9 billion US dollars) over the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Net foreign debt also fell in terms of ratio to the gross
domestic product (GDP). It accounted for 38.6 percent of GDP in
the March quarter, a decrease of 0.7 percent from that of the last
quarter of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of the country's external deficit was mainly
due to higher prices for its prime commodity exports, such as
grain, coal and other minerals. A strengthening Australian dollar
also helped to reduce the value of foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
However, Australia is still sucking in huge amounts of foreign
capital to fund its economic expansion due to the poor record of
national savings.
</P>
<P>
The ABS figures showed that foreign investment in Australia
rose by 2.7 billion Australian dollars (2.1 billion US dollars) in
the quarter, exceeding Australian investment overseas by 1.64
billion Australian dollars (1.30 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Though Australia has one of the largest foreign debt among the
developed countries, its economy is unlikely to see the
Mexican-style crisis, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The ABS figures showed the major part of the foreign debt was
borrowed by private companies, which heavily rely on the overseas
financial market to fund their expansions. The government now
accounted for only 37.8 percent of the total foreign debt, down
from the 38.6 percent by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Australia has to pay 18.35 billion Australian
dollars (14.50 billion US dollars) net in interest, dividends and
other payments to foreign investors every year.

<HEADLINE> Czech's Ruling Coalition Loses Majority in Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic's ruling
center-right coalition led by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus led all
parties in the weekend elections, but lost its parliamentary
majority as the left-leaning Social Democrats made surprising
gains.
</P>
<P>
Klaus's Civic Democratic Party won 29.6 percent of the vote,
and his two smaller coalition partners - the Christian Democrats
and the Civic Democratic Alliance - received a total of 15 percent
of the vote, according to preliminary electoral results announced
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But that's unlikely to be enough to retain the coalition's 12
seat majority in the 200-member parliament. The figures show the
three-party coalition with 99 seats, two short of a majority.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing Social Democrats made a surprisingly strong
showing in the elections, winning 26.4 percent of the vote, nearly
four times the vote it received in the 1992 elections, the first
elections following the Czech Republic's split from Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
The gains will boost the Social Democrats from 24 to 61 seats
in parliament, making it the second largest political party.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia, winning 10.3
percent of the vote, could get 22 seats in parliament, while the
right-wing Republican Party, with eight percent of the vote, could
take 18 seats, according to Czech public TV projections.
</P>
<P>
Klaus met with President Vaclav Havel for an hour on Sunday
afternoon. A presidential spokesman said Havel would also hold
separate talks with Social Democrat chairman Milos Zeman and the
leaders of the Christian Democrats and the Civic Democratic
Alliance on Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Five primary school and pre-school
pupils were killed sometime between May 29 and 31 in a sandstorm
in Dunhuang city, in northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
The sandstorm, with heavy winds and rain, occurred in Dunhuang,
causing 50 million yuan (about six million US dollars) in economic
losses. Dunhuang is famous for its Buddhist scriptures in
1,600-year-old caves.
</P>
<P>
What began as a sunny day on May 29 soon turned ominous when
the dust began swirling in the sky around 19:37 p.m.
</P>
<P>
By May 31, eight people were lost in the sandstorm. Three were
later rescued and the other five -- primary school and pre-school
pupils -- were killed.
</P>
<P>
And 798 mu (about 53 hectares) of greenhouses were destroyed,
10,200 meters of electricity lines were downed and over 30
kilometers of a canal buried.
</P>
<P>
Local government officials and residents have pledged to
recover from their losses.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the sandstorm was caused by a strong cold wind and
high wind pressure. The fastest wind speed reached 24 to 27 meters
per second, eliminating visibility for 100 meters.

<HEADLINE> Modernized Library Enchants Children Readers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,000 middle and primary
school students in Beijing have become the first group of readers
to join China's biggest municipal public library, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The new Dongcheng Public Library building in Beijing's
Dongcheng District, renovation of which was completed in April of
this year, covers 6,400 square meters. It is ten times bigger
than the old building, and is the biggest public library of its
kind across the nation.
</P>
<P>
It is also a multi-functional public library, with reading and
lending and information consulting offered.
</P>
<P>
Bao Jinguo, an official from the library, said that its once
outdated equipment and limited space, which made over two-thirds
of its 300,000 volumes inaccessible to readers contributed to the
declining membership over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to revitalize libraries, he said, municipal and
district governments have injected about 5.6 million yuan (660,000
US dollars) into library renovation since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Library-goers can now enjoy a more pleasant environment in the
40-year-old public library, with open-shelf reading and lending
provided and computerized management in editing, reading and
lending.
</P>
<P>
Bao also said that inviting children to be the first group of
readers highlights the goal of "making the public library a major
venue for youngsters to study in their spare time."
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 new books are displayed at the colorful children's
reading room, which is designed to cater to children's reading
habits and is equipped with different kinds of bookshelves and
desks.
</P>
<P>
More advanced equipment can be found at the electronic reading
room, where some 30 multi-media computers are provided for reading
or teaching.
</P>
<P>
Consulting service on the usage of computers were also
offered to students.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Brazil defeated Argentina
with straight sets 15-7, 15-11, 15-1 at the 1996 Volleyball World
League in Sao Paulo on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Starting with a different line-up from its opener, Brazil had
no difficult to beat a weak and pathetic Argentina in one hour and
14 minutes to secure the top spot in Pool A.
</P>
<P>
During all the game, the Brazilian men spikers were ahead in
the scoreboard helped by a good blocking and defense system,
together with a high percentage of counter-attacks.
</P>
<P>
In the other side, Argentina played worst than Saturday when
they lost to the same squad 1-3, and their lack of concentration
was one of the main reasons for the bad performance.
</P>
<P>
Argentina's head coach Daniel Castellani made a lot of changes,
but failed to stop Brazilian's more equlibrate team.
</P>
<P>
"Our team played much better tonight specialy in blocking and
defense system," said Brazilian coach Jose Guimaraes.
</P>
<P>
"But we are far from what we can be, and I am sure by the end
of the World League, we will be ready for the Olympics with our
best shape," he added.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Castellani lamented that "instead of playing
better than the first match, we played worst. The main problem is
the lack of concentration of many of the players, even the more
experienced ones."

CANBERRA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Following are major news items in
leading Australian newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- Premier of Western Australia Court has embarrassed Prime
Minister Howard by rejecting one of his key arguments against the
extinguishment of Aboriginal native title over pastoral leases.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- The prime minister has pledged to stop the gun lobby gaining
political power and has urged the states to ignore the growing
protests and rush through gun control legislation.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- Almost 10,000 commonwealth public servants -- 6.5 percent of
the federal bureaucracy -- have been sacked or told their
contracts will not be renewed, in the first stage of the federal
government's strategy to slash costs.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- Australia's leading retailers have written off 1996, some
claiming these are the tightest trading conditions since the
recession five years ago. Leading industry figures blame the
retail slump on consumer concerns about falling levels of savings
and on a shift in buying patterns, with shoppers reducing outlays
or waiting for sales.

<HEADLINE> Balkan Leaders Agree No Delay for Bosnia Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher said here on Sunday that president of Bosnia, Croatia
and Serbia have agreed in their meetings here Sunday that
elections in Bosnia should go ahead by September 14 as planned in
the Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Christopher told reporters after his separate meetings with the
three Balkan leaders on Sunday that the three presidents had also
agreed that an exact date for the elections should be decided as
soon as possible to enable them to focus on the preparations of
the elections.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said the election date could by announced this
month, preferably by the Florence Mid-Term Review Conference of
the Dayton agreement slated for June 14.
</P>
<P>
According to Christopher, the three Balkan leaders had agreed
that delay in the elections risks widening the divisions which
continue to exist in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"If we give in to the call to delay the elections, it could
only entrench the status quo in Bosnia. It would reduce the
pressure on the parities to meet their commitments," Christopher
said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the elections "will give another effective
way to eliminate indicted war criminals from governments for they
will not be permitted to run for office".
</P>
<P>
Christopher said he had reinterated to Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic that the two top Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan
Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, both have been indicted by the Hague UN
war crimes Tribunal, should be removed from offices and turned
over to the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
However he did not rule out the possibility that the two men
could still be in liberty when the elections are held. He said
that he did not set a deadline for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
During the Sunday meetings, the three Balkan leaders had also
recommitted themselves to the task of establishing the necessary
conditions for the election under the supervision of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Some
concrete steps agreed upon are as followings:
</P>
<P>
-- For the first time each sides agreed to recognize validity
of identity documents and press credentials issued by other
entities to ensure a free and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
-- They also agreed that any municipalities that fail to
constitute local election committees will risk losing the right to
participate in the elections.
</P>
<P>
-- The President of Serbia and Croatia agreed that refugees who
wish to vote in person will be allowed unimpeded transit between
the two territories. They also agreed to work closely with the
OSCE and other international organizations to facilitate voting by
refugees present in their territory.
</P>
<P>
-- The presidents also pledged to instruct their negotiators to
conclude arms control talks this week in advance of the June 11
deadline set out by the Dayton agreement.
