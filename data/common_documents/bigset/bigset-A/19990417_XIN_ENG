<HEADLINE> Britain Sees Boom in Computer Courses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The latest British university
admissions figures published Friday showed that the number of
applications for computer courses is continously rising.
</P>
<P>
The number of people applying this year to study computer
science has risen by 19.7 percent, the biggest increase in any
single subject, according to the Universities and Colleges
Admissions Service (UCAS).
</P>
<P>
And software engineering has also seen a jump of 18.1 percent
of the applicants, the UCAS said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics revealed that computer science has overtaken law to
become the second most popular university subject after business
and management studies in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The figures suggest prospective university students are
increasingly opting for practical courses that are likely to lead
to good jobs, the UCAS said.
</P>
<P>
"The huge interest in computing reflects the growing number of
jobs, often well-paid, in the IT industry," said Tony Higgins,
chief executive of UCAS.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by UCAS also showed that a record number of
British young people has applied for a university place in spite
of the abolition of student grants and the introduction of tuition
fees by the British government.

<HEADLINE> Russia Proposes to Lift All Economic Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Friday proposed
the lifting of all economic sanctions against Iraq to counter a
draft resolution proposed by Britain and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which was co-sponsored by China, calls for the
strengthened Ongoing Monitoring and Verification mechanism in Iraq
under which the remaining unresolved disarmament issues would be
addressed.
</P>
<P>
The proposal seeks to unfreeze the Iraqi assets.
</P>
<P>
It also supports the U.N. Secretary-General to continue to
play a role in the resumption of a normal relationship between
the United Nations and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
According to diplomats, most of the members of the Security
Council welcomed Russia's proposal.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council this morning held
informal consultations on the recommendations of the three U.N. panels
on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the Netherlands distributed a draft resolution at
the Council meeting that would abolish the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) with an enlarged body to carry out more intrusive
inspections of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Netherlands also put forward some proposals to
ease the sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM has not gone back to Iraq to resume its regular work
since the U.S.-led military strikes against Iraq. There has been
a strong call in the Security Council for its removal.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Boycotts Lusaka Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda will not attend the peace
talks on the crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo underway
in the Zambian capital Lusaka, Rwandan Minister in the President's
Office Patrick Mazimhaka said.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting in Lusaka is about the implementation of the
cease-fire agreement. This is a mere waste of time as long as
that agreement does not exist," Mazimhaka pointed out, the
official Rwanda News Agency (RNA) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The senior Rwandan government official further stated that
Rwanda walked out of the last round of peace talks in Lusaka
because it insisted that the main rebel group, the Congolese
Coalition for Democracy, be directly involved in the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
"We will not send a delegation to Lusaka before we notice
seriousness in the peace proceedings, and once all the countries
involved in the war in Congo will have their role cut out,"
Mazimhaka underscored.
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, the Rwandans have been dismayed by
the declaration made two days ago by Namibian President Sam
Nujoma in Lusaka about his country's involvement in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
He had said that their presence in Congo (K) helped to lessen a
refugee problem caused by "Tutsis," and to protect the
"democratically-elected government of President Laurent Kabila."
</P>
<P>
Nujoma had defended the presence of his troops in the DRC
during a news conference after a meeting with Zambian President
Frederic Chiluba.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Telecom Workers Still on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Striking Zimbabwean Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) workers Friday again rejected
a management proposal which was presented to their union officials
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the workers union appealed to its members to resume
work Saturday while it negotiated their demands with management.
</P>
<P>
The appeal came amid threats by management to fire workers who
did not report for duty by Saturday, local news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a letter, signed by the PTC board chairman Moses Mashumga,
the management said it was committed to paying the workers the
full 30 percent increment, of which 15 percent will be paid in May
and the other 15 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
However, when General-Secretary of the union Gift Chimanikire
presented the contents of the letter to workers, they rejected the
whole idea, saying they wanted the full amount in May.
</P>
<P>
Workers were not prepared to gamble on the issue as management
could fail to fulfil its promise.
</P>
<P>
PTC workers gathered Friday at the main post office, vowing to
continue the strike until they received the 30 percent increment.
</P>
<P>
The 10,000 workers Monday started the national strike, leaving
many clients throughout the country out of touch as postal and
telecommunication services were severely disrupted.

<HEADLINE> Albania Says Serbian Soldiers Fire at Its Border Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Serbian soldiers in Kosovo Friday
opened fire at an Albanian border post in the northern Albanian
district of Tropoje, an Albanian Public Order Ministry spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that two companies of Serbian troops fired
at the Zherke border post at 10:40 a.m. local time (0940 GMT) and
the shooting out lasted more than one hour.
</P>
<P>
Albanian border troops fired back at the Serbian soldiers when
some of them tried to cross the border, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Serbian troops also bombarded the two Albanian
villages of Padesh and Rrapaj in the district with mortar fire.
</P>
<P>
During the past few days, Albania repeatedly claimed that
Serbian soldiers crossed the border into the Albanian side to
fight the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and exchanged fire with
Albanian border forces.
</P>
<P>
But Yugoslavia denied all the allegations.

<HEADLINE> Jailed Rebel Leader Freed in S. Leone Temporarily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Court of Appeal in Sierra Leone
has agreed to release jailed rebel leader Foday Sankoh for the
time being, a report reaching here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The legal decision to set free the rebel leader was confirmed
by Sierra Leone's attorney-general, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh is scheduled to consult field commanders of the rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in neighboring Togo in three
days' time and the consultation is to be followed by peace talks
between President Tejan Kabbah government and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The rebel RUF has consistently demanded the release of Sankoh,
who was sentenced to death last October for treason, before they
can attend peace talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
Observers see the decision of the Sierra Leone government to
release Sankoh as the most important step toward peace in the
war-ravaged west African country for past several years.
</P>
<P>
The conflict between the government supported by the west
African peace- keeping force of ECOMOG and the rebels is still
going on, but both sides seem now to have realized that a military
solution is not possible.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Meets Russian, Yugoslav, Chinese Envoys on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Friday held separate talks with ambassadors from
Russia, Yugoslavia and China in succession, which U.N. officials
said will mainly focus on the current situation in Kosovo, a
Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
Annan has met with Russian Permanent Representative to the
United Nations Sergey Lavrov, but details remain unknown at the
moment.
</P>
<P>
Annan "will have an additional meeting on the schedule" with
Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission to
the United Nations, at 4:50 p.m. EST, the U.N. Spokesman's Office
announced.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief is expected to meet with Qin Huasun, Chinese
permanent representative to the United Nations, at 6:00 p.m. EST,
diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came as Annan is poised to play a bigger role in
the Kosovo crisis which has worsened since the NATO bombing of
Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia are both firmly against the NATO attacks on
Yugoslavia, a sovereign and independent member of the U.N. family,
saying that the NATO military action is illegal because it went
ahead with the bombing without the authorization of the U.N.
Security Council, which, under the Charter, has primary
responsibility for maintaining the world peace and security.

<HEADLINE> Less Salt Need Not Impair Taste: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The levels of salt in food can be
cut without sacrificing taste, an international group of
researchers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Consuming high levels of salt is known to cause high blood
pressure, which in turn can cause heart disease and stroke.
</P>
<P>
Reducing the intake of dietary salt has been shown to lower
blood pressure, but many people are reluctant to change their salt
intake because of fears that the taste of food will be impaired.
</P>
<P>
Now researchers from New Zealand and Australia showed that
reducing the salt content of bread, the single largest source of
dietary salt in developed countries, does not alter the taste.
</P>
<P>
Anthony Rodgers and Bruce Neal gave three types of wholemeal
bread, identical except for their salt content, to 60 colleagues
who were unaware of which loaf they were eating.
</P>
<P>
One 750g loaf contained the standard amount of salt, 3.1g, one
had a salt content of 2.8g, and the third loaf had a salt content
of 2.5g.
</P>
<P>
The participants were given one piece of each type of bread and
asked to rate its taste and to guess whether the bread had the
normal or reduced salt content.
</P>
<P>
Their study, published in the Lancet medical journal, found
that participants could not tell the difference between the taste
of the three types of bread, and also were not able to tell which
loaf had the normal or reduced salt content.
</P>
<P>
"If these findings were to be replicated for different foods,
recommendations could be made to food manufacturers that small
reductions in salt content would not reduce sales," the
researchers suggested.
</P>
<P>
They added that small reductions in the salt content of
processed foods would lead to lowering of the blood pressure in
the population at large, "with considerable health benefits".

<HEADLINE> Congo Rebels Allowed to Attend Peace Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A delegation led by Kalenga Kyalumba, director of foreign
affairs of the rebels, was allowed to attend for the first time a
consultative meeting started here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting attended by defense and security chiefs of the
concerned countries was held to seek a peaceful solution to the
eight-month war in DRC.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Minister of State House Eric Silwamba presided over
today's meeting, which was closed to reporters.
</P>
<P>
Sources of the meeting said a press release on the meeting may
be available Saturday morning after the meeting is over.
</P>
<P>
Zambian president Frederick Chiluba, who has been mandated by
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to mediate a
peaceful solution to the conflict in DRC, said earlier this week
that if the first step is successful, a regional summit meeting
will follow in the wake of the consultative meeting.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Friday quoted Kalenga as saying here Thursday
that they want to be recognized as one of the political parties in
the war before holding democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
He said the rebels are looking forward to fruitful discussions
in Lusaka and hoped all belligerents to the conflict will see
sense in finding a permanent solution to the impasse.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited Lusaka summit to seek the peaceful solution to
the crisis have been postponed several times from the originally
planned date of December 8 of last year because of largely the
disagreement on the presence of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Kabila refused to have direct talks with the rebels of the
Congolese Coalition for Democracy (RCD) led by Ernest Wamba Dia
Wamba but Rwanda and Uganda backing the rebels demand the
involvement of the rebels in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Last month Kabila changed his mind and agreed to allow the
rebels to be involved in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad have sent troops there to
back Kabila while Rwanda and Uganda have been accused of backing
the rebels although they said they have deployed their troops in
DRC for their own security interests and accused Kabila of backing
their anti-government forces.

<HEADLINE> NATO Still Asked to Clarify Bombing Incidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) was still asked by many journalists here on
Friday about "mistakenly" bombing of Albanian ethnic refugees on
Wednesday in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
At midafternoon daily news briefing here in Brussels based-NATO
headquarters, two NATO spokesmen were forced to answer questions
by 14 journalists about the killing of more than 70 civilians in
roads between Prizren and Djakovica in Kosovo. A day earlier, NATO
civilian spokesman Jamie Shea expressed regret for a "tragic
accident" to a group of journalists here.
</P>
<P>
When asked if the spokesmen could clear confusions about how
many convoy incidents happened on Wednesday, Shea said "We have
confirmed the incident took place at north of Djakovica, We have
no information whatever on the extensive civilian casualties as
very difficult to do that when you are trying to find out what is
going on in a very unfree place without international observers on
the scene."
</P>
<P>
NATO military spokesman general Giyseppe Marani also said "what
we know about our air attack we told you yesterday, for the rest
we know nothing more we told you yesterday."
</P>
<P>
Shea also said that NATO had conducted investigation in one
incident. "we hit one civilian vehicle, that dose not mean that
you should presuppose that every other incident of civilian
vehicles is automatically to be laid at NATO's door," Shea told
the journalists.
</P>
<P>
A BBC correspondent asked why NATO did not provide detailed
information such as video about the convoy incident since the
alliance had two days to look at it. But both spokesmen insisted
related probe is under way and there was no more information than
a day before.
</P>
<P>
Asked what type of vehicle NATO had hit, Marani said it was
probably a tractor. It was the first time a NATO spokesman almost
confirmed the hitted vehicle was a tractor, which had been
identified by both Serbian television and western media.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, NATO's efficiency on this case has angered
journalists from all over the world who need latest information
and clarified details for their readers.

<HEADLINE> Simitis Announces Proposal for Peaceful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis Friday announced Greece's proposal for the peaceful
settlement of the crisis in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a cabinet meeting later Friday, Simitis said
that a political solution to the Kosovo crisis must be found as
quickly as possible because the crisis posed a threat for the
entire region.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Rambouillet agreement could serve as the
framework for talks aimed at resolving the Kosovo crisis
peacefully, with respect for existing borders, human rights,
acceptance of the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes
and cooperation to secure democracy and development and formulate
social policy.
</P>
<P>
The mission of an international peacekeeping force should be
legalized on the basis of a wide-ranging U.N. Security Council
act, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Simitis said that Greece's proposal would be put to the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU) so
as to take the shape of an initiative which would unfold on three
levels.
</P>
<P>
At the first level, he said, the Greek proposal concerns the
countries in the immediate region of the crisis. He added that
Greece would host an inter-Balkan conference which would formulate
specific proposals for a settlement of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
On the second level, he continued, the proposal had to do with
development and stability in the Balkans, the focus being on
economic development and the deindustrialization of the countries
in the region. This level would entail the creation of some
mechanism for resolving conflict, while all countries would be
selectable for gradual accession to the EU.
</P>
<P>
The third level pertains to humanitarian aid, the premier said,
stressing that Greece was second only to Germany in the provision
of aid. In this respect, he added, another conference would be
held in Athens.

<HEADLINE> Britain, Netherlands Propose to Replace UNSCOM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under the proposal, UNSCOM would be replaced by an expanded and
more generously financed body called the United Nations Commission
for Investigation, Inspection and Monitoring.
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls on Iraq to give the new commission
"unrestricted access and provision of information" and to allow
its inspection teams "immediate, unconditional and unrestricted
access to any and all areas, facilities, equipment, records and
means of transportation when they may wish to inspect."
</P>
<P>
The proposal also seeks to improve the humanitarian crisis
Iraqi people are facing by abolishing the current 5.2 billion U.S.
dollars limit on the amount of oil Iraq is allowing to export to
buy food and medicine in every six months.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the Netherlands asked the U.N. Secretary-General to
create an expert committee to recommend ways of increasing Iraq's
oil production and streamline procedures for approving essential
imports.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM, in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, has not resumed its work in Iraq since the U.S.-led
military strikes against Iraq last December. China, Russia and
France, three of the five permanent members of the Untied Nations
Security Council, have called for its removal. Iraq has pledged
not to cooperate with it any longer.
</P>
<P>
According to Council sources, the proposals by Britain and the
Netherlands have come under attack by some members of the Council
for not taking into account the recommendations by U.N. panels on
Iraq which was established in January, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Nile Countries to Cooperate in Using River Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Public Works and
Water Resources Mahmoud Abu Zeid said on Friday that the Nile
countries are conducting full coordination and cooperation for the
optimum use of the Nile River water.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation is manifest" through Egypt's joint projects with
Uganda, Sudan, Ethiopia, Zambia and Kenya, Abu Zeid told reporters
before a meeting among the Nile countries, also including Rwanda,
Tanzania, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is helping Kenya dig 100 wells for drinking water and has
signed with Uganda an agreement on clearing away weeds in the Nile.
</P>
<P>
The Nile has an annual water capacity of 1,600 billion cubic meters,
of which only 8 percent is utilized, the Egyptian minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Nile is the main source of water of Egypt, which holds a quota of
55 billion cubic meters a year.
</P>
<P>
The minister is going to lead an Egyptian delegation to the water
resources ministerial council of the Nile countries, to be held in the
Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa early next month.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will discuss the technical rules to provide the basis
for setting up projects on the Nile and its tributaries in a bid to
pave the way for carrying out detailed studies for the projects, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial council will tackle a new mechanism for cooperation
and coordination among the Nile countries in utilizing the water of
the longest river in the world, he added.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Says He Would Ask for Reserves for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said on Friday that he would ask President Bill Clinton
early next week to activate reserve forces in support of NATO's
airstrikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that as many as 33,000 reserve forces, including
up to 25,000 Air National Guard members in units that fly aerial
refueling missions both from the United States and from Europe,
will be requested.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who gave a joint press conference with visiting Italian
Defense Minister Carlo Scognamiglio at the Pentagon, said he still
did not know the exact number. But Cohen added,"I think it'll be
a significant number."
</P>
<P>
Cohen and Scognamiglio agreed it's too soon to consider using
ground troops in Yugoslavia even if the NATO air campaign doesn't
stop Serb assaults on Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. secretary again expressed regrets over the
death of civilians in an attack on a convoy of ethnic Albanian
refugees in Kosovo but said it would not affect NATO plans.
</P>
<P>
Cohen conceded there had been confusion about the alliance's
reporting on Thursday's incident, but promised full disclosure
after an investigation.

JOHANNESBURG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The South African
authorities began to register prisoners throughout the country for
this June's general election, but the turn-out is poor, reports
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Less than a quarter of the 147,000 prisoners were expected to
register on Friday, their only chance to do so, according to South
African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
Correctional Services Department officials attributed the low
turn-out to widespread apathy, but prisoners complained they were
given insufficient time to get bar-coded ID books and did not have
the money to pay for photographs necessary to secure temporary
registration certificates.
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Court ruled at the beginning of the month
that prisoners should be allowed to vote. However, earlier this
week, it rejected applications by the opposition New National
Party (NNP) and the Democratic Party to extend franchise to people
who do not have bar-coded IDs.
</P>
<P>
The Pretoria High Court is now dealing with the NNP's challenge
to allow all South Africans living abroad to be able to vote.
</P>
<P>
The Independent Electoral Commission Wednesday announced that
voters travelling abroad on June 2 will be able to vote provided
that they have already registered. However, the majority of
South Africans who live abroad had not been able to register
during the registration period between November last year and
March this year.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Offer Ghana $1.7m as Food Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NAIROBI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Japan has granted Ghana 200
million Japanese yen (1.7 million U.S. dollars) for food aid
under an agreement signed in Accra Friday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement initialled by Foreign Minister James Victor
Gbeho and Shosuke Ito, Japanese Ambassador to Ghana, is the third
in one month, according to the Ghana News Agency (GNA).
</P>
<P>
Gbeho said it is the determination of Ghana to leave problems
like malnutrition, water borne diseases, and poverty behind in
the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
 "The attainment of food security in Ghana remains a cherished
dream of our government and the pillar of our future development
as we strive to become a middle income country by the year 2000."
</P>
<P>
 He said the three agreements, therefore, demonstrate the
commitment of Japan to the elimination of one of the most
fundamental problems facing Ghana's economy.
</P>
<P>
Ito said Japan is currently undergoing a hard time as
unemployment rate is now at its highest since the second world
war.
</P>
<P>
 "Every effort is being made to revive the national economy.
Nevertheless, Japan appreciates the determination and endeavors by
 Ghanaians toward their country's sustainable development and
betterment of life."
</P>
<P>
 He noted that in spite of these efforts there is still some
way to go to achieve this objective.
</P>
<P>
Ito attributed this to the importation of food, saying this
eats into the foreign reserves that should have been spent on
importation of capital equipment for development.
</P>
<P>
 "Japan recognizes the importance of food supply and the
importation of capital goods for development. That is why she
recently extended comprehensive assistance to support Ghana in
her self-help effort toward development and democratization."

<HEADLINE> Britain's CJD Death Toll Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The number of people in Britain
known to have died of new-variant CJD, the human form of "mad cow"
disease, has risen to 40, The Times newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Since the new-variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) was
identified in 1995, when there were three deaths, the number of
cases had risen to ten in 1996 and 1997, and 16 last year.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures show that one case was notified in the first
two months of this year, The Times said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, a group of British scientists reported in the
British Medical Journal their more optimistic findings that the
incidence of CJD was no higher than to be expected in people who
work with animals or carcass.
</P>
<P>
However, in an accompanying commentary published in the same
journal, Dr Annick Alperovitch, a French scientist, said the new
results by British scientists should be interpreted with caution
when using them to predict future death from CJD.
</P>
<P>
The incubation period of CJD is unknown and could be anything
from two to more than 30 years, Dr Alperovitch said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the findings by the researchers from the Imperial
College of Medicine in London, this uncertainty re-emphasizes the
need to continue epidemiological surveillance of CJD in Europe,
she concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's President-Elect,
General Olusegun Obasanjo, will pay a one-day visit to Ghana
Saturday as part of his global tour which has taken him to many
countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas.
</P>
<P>
 Briefing reporters on the visit, Foreign Minister James
Victor Gbeho, disclosed that Gen. Obasanjo would hold talks with
President Jerry Rawlings and Ghanaian officials on bilateral as
well as international issues, with particular reference to the
west Africa sub-region, the Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
 Ghana and Nigeria have, for the past eight years, been
working closely to ensure peace and stability to foster the goals
of sub-regional integration and sustainable economic development.
</P>
<P>
 "The special character of relations between the two countries
need not be overemphasized. Ghana and Nigeria share common views
on a wide-range of African and world events," Gbeho said.
</P>
<P>
He added that these relations are not limited to any
particular circumstance and they have always been cordial.
</P>
<P>
 The foreign minister said it is the government's expectation
that the consultations would serve to emphasize mutual relations
and enable the two countries to recommit themselves to work
closely together when Gen. Obasanjo assumes office in May.
</P>
<P>
 "This will enhance the continuing search for the broadening
of these relations as well as deepening of interactions between
the private sectors of both countries in ways that will bring
beneficial results to our two countries."
</P>
<P>
Gbeho said President Rawlings is looking forward to the visit
and the meeting although this is not the first contact between
them.
</P>
<P>
 He said the election of Gen. Obasanjo and the peaceful way in
which the democratic transitional process in Nigeria has been
executed are developments that Ghana applauds.
</P>
<P>
 "They are developments which will enable Nigeria to return to
the international field and play the kind of dynamic and
progressive role for which that country is destined."

<HEADLINE> Ghanaian President Alive: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 NAIROBI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's Foreign minister James
Victor Gbeho Friday described the rumor that President Jerry
Rawlings had died as "false and ridiculous," saying he is alive
and well and going about his duties.
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to journalists in his office, Gbeho described the

 Gbeho, his deputy Mr Joseph Laryea and senior officials of
the ministry told reporters that they had been inundated with
telephone calls, particularly from Ghanaians abroad seeking
comments on the rumor which claimed that the President was dead.

<P>
The foreign ministry said it could not explain what might have
sparked the rumor or what was the motive, according to a Ghana
News Agency (GNA) story reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
 The minister said he had to travel to some of the country's
missions abroad to reassure them that President Rawlings was not
only alive but healthy and active.
</P>
<P>
 "We have told them to watch the television news and other
news files on the internet to verify the rumor themselves," Gbeho
said.
</P>
<P>
 He appealed to the media to complement his ministry's efforts
to dispel the rumor.
</P>
<P>
 Gbeho said President Rawlings will meet Nigeria's
President-elect, General Olusegun Obasanjo Saturday in Accra "for
all to see".
</P>
<P>
 President Rawlings who returned recently from France had been
going about his normal duties and is winding up a three-day visit
to the Brong Ahafo region Friday.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is
providing an environmental input to the upcoming discussions on
sustainable tourism and related issues, it was learned here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
With more than 260 million employees, the tourism industry
accounts for 10.7 percent of the world gross domestic product
(GDP), according to U.N. data.
</P>
<P>
However, tourism can also have serious negative environmental
impact resulting from resource consumption, pollution and wastes
generation, thus destroying the sound environment on which the
industry depends, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is working to ensure that environmental considerations
are fully integrated into the wider economic and social aspects of
tourism development.
</P>
<P>
A two-week session of the U.N. Commission on Sustainable
Development is scheduled to begin on April 19 to focus on the
issue, the U.N. Economic and Social Council announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On the agenda are also new ways to deal with overfishing,
land-based pollution and the destruction of coral reefs.
</P>
<P>
At least 60 percent of the world's fisheries are either fully
exploited or overfished, and an estimated 58 percent of the world's
coral reefs are threatened by human activity.
</P>
<P>
U.N. data also show that nearly 80 percent of marine pollution
is caused by agricultural run-off, sewage or industrial waste.

<HEADLINE> France Concerned About Algeria's Presidential Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- France on Friday expressed its
concern about the circumstances of the presidential election in
Algeria, after the single remaining candidate Abdelaziz Bouteflika
was proclaimed the winner of the election.
</P>
<P>
The French authorities have noticed the decision made on
Wednesday by six candidates out of seven to withdraw collectively
from the competition, said French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
France has also noted the result announced by the Interior
Ministry of Algeria, she added, without mentioning the name of
Bouteflika.
</P>
<P>
"Concerned about the situation thus created, France will
continue to hope that the aspirations for democracy by the
Algerian people could express itself in a pluralistic framework.
France reaffirms its attachment to a deepening of the relations of
friendship, dialogue and cooperation between the French and
Algerian people," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Algerian government has for several times
expressed its intention to guarantee the holding of a free,
transparent and pluralistic election.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian government announced Friday morning that
Bouteflika won the presidential election with 73.79 percent of the
votes cast.
</P>
<P>
The participation rate by the Algerians stood at 60 percent,
said the government.

<HEADLINE> China, Thailand Agree to Step up Inter-Parliamentary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China and Thailand agreed here on
Friday to increase the exchanges and cooperation between the
National People's Congress (NPC) of China, the country's
legislative body, and the National Assembly of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The two countries reached the agreement during the talks here
Friday afternoon between China's top legislator Li Peng and Wan
Muhammad Nor Matha, president of the Thai National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Wan said that since the establishment of
diplomatic ties between Thailand and China some 20 years ago,
great progress had been made in the relations between the two
countries on the basis of the common interests of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, said the continuous
development of the Sino-Thai friendly cooperation is not only in
the common interests of the two peoples, but will also contribute
to the efforts of maintaining peace and stability of the region.
</P>
<P>
Describing the friendly cooperation between the NPC and the
Thai National Assembly as an important component of the overall
cooperation between the two countries, Li said the NPC is willing
to work together with its Thai counterpart to make greater
contribution to the development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said the NPC and the Thai National Assembly, through
their close contacts and friendly cooperation, have made great
contributions to the mutual understanding of the two peoples and
promotion of friendship and cooperation in various fields on the
basis of mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Such friendly contacts through multi channels and various forms
have helped deepen the Sino-Thai relations as a whole, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the NPC and the National Assembly will
further strengthen exchanges and cooperation in the field of
legislation.
</P>
<P>
While reviewing the political and economic achievements China
has made in 1998, Li outlined the policies China will carry out
this year, including the pursuit of its reform and opening-up
policy, stimulation of domestic demand, economic construction
through science and technology and restructuring of state-own
enterprises, with a view to ensuring a healthy economic
development and safeguard social stability.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived in Bangkok from the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai
on Friday morning to continue his visit to Thailand, which is the
last leg of his six-nation tour.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrial Output Rises Slightly in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve said
Friday that industrial output was up 0.1 percent in March with the
strength coming from a big jump in energy production at utility
plants.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said the advance was far below a 0.3 percent advance in
February and reflected declines in production of autos and
appliances.
</P>
<P>
Overall, manufacturing output was unchanged from the February
level while production in the mining sector, which includes oil
production, was down 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists are looking for growth to slow as the year
progresses. If economic activity does not slow on its own, the
Federal Reserve is expected to help the process along by raising
interest rates at the first hint that tight labor markets and
rising demand are triggering inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
So far on that score, heavy spending by manufacturers on new
plants and equipment has kept production bottlenecks from
occurring. The Fed reported Friday that factories operated at 80.1
percent of capacity in March, the lowest operating rate in nearly
seven years.
</P>
<P>
The production of consumer goods was flat in March as a rebound
in energy production by utilities was offset by declines in other
areas. Production of autos and appliances fell from elevated
levels reached in February. Output of consumer chemicals was up
for the second straight month, following a long period of decline
since last spring.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that overall industrial production will
continue to be under pressure this year as U.S. manufacturers
struggle to recover from a world economic crisis that has cut
sharply into exports.
</P>
<P>
However, weakness overseas has been offset by strong domestic
demand as consumers spend with abandon, reflecting high consumer
confidence and the lowest unemployment rates in nearly three
decades.

<HEADLINE> Personal Bests Recorded at Chinese Swimming Champions Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAQING, northeast China, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A young
generation swimmers made a great splash on the first day of the
Chinese national swimming championships meet here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Han Xue, a Beijing native competing here for Wuhan, who holds
the short-course world record in women's 50 meters breaststroke,
snatched the 100m freestyle title with a personal best time of 56.
11 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Shan Ying from the Chinese army's Guangzhou Units, who was
ranked third at the end of last year, failed to qualify for the
finals due to an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
Yang Lina of Guangxi finished second in 56.91, edging Hebei's
Li Jin by 0.04 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Han, who will compete in the 50m freestyle, 100
m breaststroke and 200m individual medley at the four-day meet,
said: "I wish to be a swimmer of variety and this is a good chance
to test my strength before the Sydney Olympics."
</P>
<P>
Liu Yin made a happy debut as she won the women's 400m
individual medley in four minutes and 47.14 seconds while Chen Yan,
the world record holder, did not participate in her specialty
event.
</P>
<P>
Liu, 15, said ecstatically after the match: "I did not expect
to win the gold medal at my first national competitions. I am
happy with the result."
</P>
<P>
Ruan Yi from East China's Zhejiang Province led all the way to
take the women's 200m butterfly final in 2:11.40. Li Na from

<HEADLINE> Most UK Economists Say "Yes" To Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Almost two-thirds of British
economists think it is in the country's interest to join the
European single currency, the euro, within the next five years,
according to a poll in the Economist Friday.
</P>
<P>
The economists who are in favor of adoption of the euro believe
that Britain would be able to enjoy a more stable exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
They also believe it would have the effect of exposing price
differences across Europe, improving competition in the single
market.
</P>
<P>
The Labor government is committed in principle to joining
sometime in the next parliament, which starts at the latest in May
2002.
</P>
<P>
However, the adoption of the euro and the end of the pound, is
proving to be highly controversial and emotive topic of debate in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Polls still suggest that a majority of population are still
against its adoption, although support of the euro has increased
since it was introduced in January.
</P>
<P>
The issue has also split the business community with some
leading entrepreneurs warning that joining the single market would
lead to more red tape and rising taxes.
</P>
<P>
So the Labor government has made its decision subject to some
economic tests and, crucially, a referendum. With public and
business opinion divided, both sides in the battle know everything
is still to play for.

ISLAMABAD, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations said on
Friday that security for its international staff in Afghanistan
who returned recently to the war-torn country has been fine but
the world body is closely watching it.
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Bunker, spokesperson for the U.N. Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan (UNOCHA),
said here at the U.N. Information Center that the "security has
been fine but we are watching it closely."
</P>
<P>
Bunker also told journalists that the Security Agreement
between the U.N. and the Taliban has been well implemented by the
Taliban authorities.
</P>
<P>
Some 45 U.N. international staff had all pulled out of
Afghanistan last August following the killing of an Italian U.N.
military advisor.
</P>
<P>
They began to return to the war-torn country on a tentative
basis late March after the Taliban promised to guarantee security
for the international workers.
</P>
<P>
The spokesperson said at present there are six U.N.
international workers in Kabul and that the international staff
will be in various parts of the country on rotation basis.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. staffers who were in Herat are on their way back to
Islamabad while another group of staffers will reach Kandahar on
April 18.

JOHANNESBURG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki's office Friday denied claims by the
Association for the Restoration of Capital Punishment (ARCAP) that
Mbeki may signal a change in policy with regard to capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
ARCAP founder Simon Grindrod said early this week that he
thought that because Mbeki had not been as vociferous as President
Nelson Mandela on death penalty issue, he may be more amendable.
</P>
<P>
However, a statement from Mbeki's office said: "The deputy
president respects and abides by the letter and spirit of the
constitution affirming the right to life and decisions of the
Constitutional Court in this regard."
</P>
<P>
South Africa abolished death penalty after abolition of
apartheid in 1994, which witnessed the first all-race elections in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has been defending the abolition of death penalty,
which he described as the most cruel way against the black people
in apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, chairman of the ruling African National Congress, is
expected to be successor of Mandela after the June 2 general
election.

<HEADLINE> Euro-Med Conference Ends With Regional Security Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The two-day conference between
foreign ministers of 15 European Union (EU) members and 12
Mediterranean states ended Friday in Stuttgart, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Ministers hailed the meeting as "a great success" after passing
guidelines for a crisis management charter and stressed an
ambitious goal to create a free trade zone covering the two
regions.
</P>
<P>
The "Euro-Med Charter for Peace and Stability ", loosely
modelled on the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE), will boost dialogue through regular ministerial
meetings, aiming to prevent tensions and maintain peace and
stability in the Mediterranean region.
</P>
<P>
The charter should win preliminary approval by ministers at the
next Euro-Med meeting in 2001 at the earliest, and will be
formally accepted as soon as political conditions allow, German
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Charter will only be politically, not legally binding. Any
joint actions, measures and mechanisms will have to be approved by
all members under the rule of consensus.
</P>
<P>
At its regular meetings the Charter will seek to raise
political cooperation and establish cross-border projects. In
later stages it will try to launch confidence and security
building measures such as areas free of weapons of mass
destruction, disarmament and arms control commitments, the
guidelines said.
</P>
<P>
The Euro-Mediterranean conference was held under the auspices
of the EU's Barcelona process. Foreign ministers from both regions
have been meeting every two years since the process was launched
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Ministers reaffirmed in Stuttgart the aim of creating a free
trade area between the EU and the Mediterranean by 2010, German
Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The free trade zone, which will ultimately include 30 states
and 700 million people, is only for manufactured goods but not
agricultural products, Erdmann said.
</P>
<P>
EU aid to the Mediterranean was a further major issue at the
talks. The EU provided 4.7 billion euro (5 billion U.S.dollars) in
aid to the region for the period 1995 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
Aid levels for the period 2000 to 2006 will be set later this
year, Erdmann said, adding that the funding will continue at a
high level.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean FM Reveals More Lockerbie Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) Committee on Libya, Zimbabwe's Foreign
Minister Stan Mudenge has revealed more evidence that could
exonerate the two Libyans accused of bombing a Pan Am plane over
Lockerbie, Scotland on December 20, 1988.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Zimbabwe News Agency here Friday,
Mudenge agreed with his predecessor Nathan Shamuyarira who is now
Minister for Industry and Commerce that if tried fairly, Abdel
Basset al-Megrahi and Al- Amin khalifa Fahima would walk free.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said the single piece of evidence Britain and the
United States of America used to link the Libyans to the bombing
that killed 270 people had serious loop-holes and the two
countries' star witness had been found to be unreliable.
</P>
<P>
"There are documents to this effect and they will be produced
during the trial in the Netherlands," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British investigators found the device that detonated
the bomb in the collar of a shirt worn by one of the victims.
</P>
<P>
The origins of the device were traced to Switzerland and the
Czech Republic where the two Libyans, both pilots, happened to
have flown to in the days just prior to the incident.
</P>
<P>
"In Switzerland the owner of the shop where the device was
bought told investigators that it was the only one he ever sold
and he sold it to two Libyans," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The investigators showed him the pictures of al-Megrahi and
Fahima only, and he identified them as the ones who had bought the
device," said Mudenge.
</P>
<P>
However, it had since been discovered that when the bombing
occurred, the shop-owner was an agent of the now defunct East
German Intelligence Agency and that he, in fact, had sold similar
devices to several other customers during the same period.
</P>
<P>
"This and other more damaging information I cannot reveal now
discredited the Americans' witness," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, the British and the Americans have never offered
concrete evidence to link the Libyans to the bombing except that
the two visited Switzerland and the Czech Republic a few days
before the bombing," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the OAU, which became very active through a
special committee of foreign ministers to ensure the Libyans were
given a fair trial, was concerned that initially the American
investigators had accused other nationals but only centered on the
Libyans on the basis of evidence of an unreliable witness.
</P>
<P>
"It is also true that former South African Foreign Affairs
Minister Pik Botha and other people were tipped to avoid the
plane," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So, the question really is who tipped them and why?" asked
Mudenge, echoing Shamuyarira, who has been credited as the first
person to initiate talks on the possibility of having the Libyans
tried in a neutral country.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said when they were finally handed over for trial in
the Netherlands, al-Megrahi and Fahima were "very happy" that the
chance to prove their innocence had come.
</P>
<P>
He said the entire African continent, through the OAU, believed
their innocence and would stand by them throughout the trial.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Friday dismissed the Russia's proposal to lift all economic
sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Peter Burleigh, U.S. Ambassador to the
United Nations, said "the Russian one I do not think is a serious
proposal. We are not going to treat it as such."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council this morning held informal
consultations on Iraq, during which Russia proposed a new plan in
a bid to break the Council's impasse on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Russia recommended to lift all the economic sanctions against
Iraq except an arms embargo in stages.
</P>
<P>
Russia also proposed the enhanced ongoing Monitoring and
Verification mechanism in Iraq under which remaining unresolved
disarmament issues of the Iraqi military programs would be
addressed.

<HEADLINE> British Doctor Admits Killing Hundreds to Relieve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A British general practitioner
(GP) admitted killing up to 300 patients to relieve their
suffering over the past 30 years at a murder trial Friday.
</P>
<P>
But GP Dr David Moor, 52, of Stamfordham, Northumberland in
England, denied the murder of retired ambulanceman George Liddell,
who he was treating at the home of Liddell's daughter in
Newcastle.
</P>
<P>
Moor was arrested by police after speaking out on euthanasia
and publicly claiming to have helped end patient's lives. His
comments followed a controversial article on euthanasia written in
The Sunday Times by another doctor.
</P>
<P>
Rachel Chapman, head of communications for the NHS Executive's
Northern and Yorkshire region, told the jury that she spoke to Dr
Moor by telephone on the day an article on euthanasia appeared in
The Sunday Times.
</P>
<P>
She said Moor had told her: "I probably dealt with about 10 a
year and have been doing so for the last 30 years. In terms of
last week I have had two patients."
</P>
<P>
The prosecution alleges that Moor deliberately injected
Liddell, who was suffering from cancer, with a massive amount of
diamorphine.
</P>
<P>
But defending lawyer Anthony Arlidge told the jury: "Mr Liddell
appeared to Dr Moor to be terminally ill. He was a very sick man."
</P>
<P>
"Dr Moor did not set out deliberately to kill Mr Liddell, he
was at all times trying to do the best for his patient as he saw
it," he said.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Dismissing Russia's new
proposal on Iraq, the United States said on Friday that it also
had problems with the proposal on Iraq by Britain and Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the British-Dutch proposal, Peter Burleigh, U.S.
Ambassador to the United Nations said "We think it is a good
pointing for discussion, but we have some problems with it."
</P>
<P>
Burleigh did not give details of the problem.
</P>
<P>
It was widely seen here that the U.S. was not pleased to have
the Untied Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) replaced with a new
mechanism, and it was opposed to let Iraq temporarily lower its
contribution to a compensation fund for war victims in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Netherlands this morning proposed to abolish UNSCOM
in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction with
an enlarged body to carry out more intrusive inspections of Iraq's
weapons.
</P>
<P>
They also proposed to ease sanctions against Iraq, including
lifting the ceiling on how much oil Iraq could sell to buy food,
medicines and other necessities for its people.

<HEADLINE> UK Gov't to Reopen Trawler Sinking Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The British government announced
Friday it will reopen the investigation into the sinking of the
trawler Gaul following new evidence in a report by the Marine
Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB).
</P>
<P>
The trawler sank in Arctic waters off Norway in 1974 and all 36
crew members died.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said there would also be an
official investigation into why no search was made for the Gaul.
No distress message was received from the vessel and the only
wreckage recovered was a small buoy.
</P>
<P>
"The loss of the Gaul has been a matter of huge controversy
ever since she sank," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I sincerely hope that the reopened investigation will be able
to address any outstanding questions on the circumstances of her
loss and close the chapter on this very tragic event," he added.
</P>
<P>
The original inquiry into the incident concluded that the
vessel capsized in heavy seas, but relatives of the men who died
have long suspected other causes.
</P>
<P>
There have been suggestions that the Gaul was sunk by the
Soviet navy, who suspected the trawler was spying, or that she was
hit by a NATO vessel on a secret exercise.
</P>
<P>
However, the MAIB, which carried out underwater surveys last
summer, said no evidence had been found to support such
allegations.
</P>
<P>
It also established that some weather-tight hatches were open
and found evidence of pressure damage at the bows.
</P>
<P>
It concluded that the vessel sank after being pounded by
several large breaking waves pouring water through the open
hatches and doors.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Members Urged to Back S. Leone's Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a communique issued here Friday, defense chiefs from Ghana,
Guinea, Nigeria and Mali said that assistance from member
countries should include the provision of helicopter training
instructors and manuals, training opportunities in their military
training institutions.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces of Sierra Leone was disbanded by President
Tejan Kabbah for collaborating with the military junta during its
11-month rule before the reinstatement of President Kabbah by
Nigerian-led ECOMOG troops in March last year.
</P>
<P>
After a one-day extraordinary meeting ended here Thursday, the
defense chiefs called on international community to provide
"lethal weapons" to enable the west African peace-keeping force of
ECOMOG to flush out the rebels of the Revolutionary United Front
from the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of the meeting, Nigerian Chief of
Defense Staff Air Marshal Al-Amin Daggash announced that the
phased withdrawal of the , 15,000-strong ECOMOG troops in that
country would begin later this year.
</P>
<P>
He noted that troop contributing countries must build on
planning, training and development of the Sierra leone armed
forces to enable them to replace ECOMOG troops.
</P>
<P>
Daggash pointed out that Nigeria, which provides 12,000 of the
ECOMOG troops in Sierra Leone, was involved in the training of
that country's military personnel at its defense academy.

<HEADLINE> Gulf TV Journalist Wounded by Israeli Rubber Bullet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese journalist was injured
Friday when Israeli troops opened fire at journalists covering its
re-occupation of a village in south Lebanon, the official National
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kassem Dergham, a Lebanese cameraman for the Gulf TV in the United
Arab Emirates, was shot in the back by rubber bullets when he and
nine other Lebanese journalists tried to approach Arnoun, a village
which was re-occupied by Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
About 25 Israeli soldiers accompanied by two armored vehicles, a
truck, a jeep and a civilian Mercedes Thursday night entered the
western edge of Arnoun and set up a checkpoint at the entrance of the
village.
</P>
<P>
The village, on the edge of the Israeli occupied zone, was first
occupied and blockaded with a three-kilometer barbed wire on
February 17 by Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed that the village was repeatedly used by Lebanese
guerrillas to stage bombing attacks on Israeli troops manning the
neighboring Beaufort castle.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of unarmed Beirut university students liberated the
village nine days later by tearing down the fence with their bare
hands.
</P>
<P>
It was still unclear whether the Israeli fresh incursion was a
limited action in retaliation for the roadside bomb attacks on
Monday which killed an Israeli soldier, or a full-fledged bid to
re-incorporate the village into the occupation zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to oust
Israeli forces and their militia ally South Lebanon Army out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss has charged the Lebanese
delegation at the United Nations in New York to lobby U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan for intervention.
</P>
<P>
He said Lebanon would use any possible means to press Israeli
troops out of the village.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hezbollah vowed to continue its attacks on Israeli
forces until all occupied land is liberated.

<HEADLINE> Increased Intra-COMESA Trade Called for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A ranking Tanzanian trade
official Friday called on the Common Market of Southern and
Eastern Africa (COMESA) countries to promote intra-COMESA trade.
</P>
<P>
"Intra-COMESA trade is only four billion U.S. dollars while
COMESA trade with the rest of the world is over 40 billion U.S.
dollars," the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Industry and
Commerce, Prof. Joshua Doriye said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made at the end of the third Automated System
for Customs Data and Management (ASYCUDA) User Group Meeting in
Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
He said it was sad to note that the COMESA member states are
entering the next millenium with such a small amount of trade
among themselves.
</P>
<P>
Doriye's speech, read on his behalf by the ministry's
Commissioner for Trade Bernard Kapya, attributed the low trade
volume to low level of industrialization with low investment in
production.
</P>
<P>
He said that the COMESA programs to establish a common
investment zone is a very vital goal.
</P>
<P>
Doriye said that COMESA states are going through a difficult
economic situation and need assistance from cooperation partners
like the European Union (EU), the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) to succeed in this phase of economic adjustment and
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the ASYCUDA, which aims at a complete
reform and modernization of customs systems and operations, is
critical to the creation of a large single market in eastern and
southern Africa and the realization of the objectives of the Free
Trade Area which is to be established in October of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by delegates from some 20 African
countries and representatives of the EU, UNDP and UNCTAD.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Breakthrough Termed as Joint OAU Triumph </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The breakthrough in the Lockerbie
stand off is in fact a triumph of the entire African leadership
over British and American bullying, Zimbabwe's Foreign Minister
Stan Mudenge said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge, who is Chairman of the OAU ministers committee on
Libya, chronicled a five-year diplomatic strategy by the OAU that
eventually forced Britain and the U.S. on one side and Libya that
Abdel Basset al- Megrahi and al-Amin khalifa Fahima be tried in
neutral Holland.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana, the
minister said in 1991, Britain and the U.S. demanded that they be
tried in either of the two countries but Libya refused, arguing
that the evidence against them was circumstantial and
inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
This resulted in Britain and the U.S. successfully lobbying the
United Nations to impose economic and air sanctions on Libya.
</P>
<P>
However, as the world searched for a way to break the impasse,
a British barrister suggested, for the first time in 1994, that
the two be tried in a neutral country.
</P>
<P>
This idea was perfected by a Scottish legal expert of the
University of Edinburgh, who devised the concept of the Libyans
being tried in the Netherlands, under Scottish law, monitored by
the U.N.
</P>
<P>
"This proposal was brought to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi,
who agreed and so did the Arab League and the OAU," Mudenge said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said South African President Nelson Mandela and
King Fahd Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia joined the negotiations
recently to help iron out a few political problems the American
government faced among its own people.
</P>
<P>
He added that a book would soon be written chronicling this
triumph.

TIRANA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Serbian soldiers in Kosovo Friday
opened fire at an Albanian border post in the northern Albanian
district of Tropoje, an Albanian Public Order Ministry spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that two companies of Serbian troops fired
at the Zherke border post at 10:40 a.m. local time (0940 GMT) and
the shooting out lasted more than one hour.
</P>
<P>
Albanian border troops fired back at the Serbian soldiers when
some of them tried to cross the border, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Serbian troops also bombarded the two Albanian
villages of Padesh and Rrapaj in the district with mortar fire.
</P>
<P>
During the past few days, Albania repeatedly claimed that
Serbian soldiers crossed the border into the Albanian side to
fight the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and exchanged fire with
Albanian border forces.
</P>
<P>
But Yugoslavia denied all the allegations.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Albanian Information Minister Musa Ulgini
said that a new influx of Kosovar refugees occurred Friday with
12,000 ethnic Albanian refugees having entered Albania from the
Morina border post by 02:00 p.m. local time (0100 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The number was expected to rise to 50,000 by midnight Friday,
the information minister said.
</P>
<P>
An Albanian government commission for the emergency situation
held a meeting Friday to review the situation arising from the new
influx of Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli Majko, who presided over
Friday's meeting, ordered to mobilize all military vehicles to the
Morina area to transport the refugees to refugee centers.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the concerned government departments were asked
to provide food and health service to the refugees.
</P>
<P>
Since the NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia began more than
three weeks ago, as many as 320,000 Kosovo refugees have fled the
southern Serbian province of Yugoslavia to Albania.
</P>
<P>
The rising number of refugees has become a serious problem for
Albania, which has called for international assistance to help it
tide over the problem.
</P>
<P>
The Rinas Airport in the Albanian capital of Tirana have been
busy over the past few days with about 40 planes carrying
humanitarian aid landing and taking off each day.
</P>
<P>
In the period from March 25 to April 15, 21,000 tons of
international aid for the refugees have arrived in Albania,
according to official figures.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Economy to Be Recovered This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
Friday said that the country's economic growth would start to
recover in the second half of this year as the government
persists in implementing the macro-economic policies.
</P>
<P>
In its April monthly report, the bank said the gross domestic
product increased by 1.7 percent in the 12 months to January,
just a bit higher than the 1.6 percent growth registered in the
year up to December.
</P>
<P>
The recovery in economic growth is mainly attributed to the
improved weather conditions earlier this year which boosted the
agricultural sector, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank noted that apart from agriculture, production in other
economic sectors is still in a weak position and far below the
potential level.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank pointed out that the country's economy would
be no much improvement in the first half of this year as problems
still exist in the key sectors such as agriculture, tourism and
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
The bank predicted Kenya's economy would be picked up in the
second half of this year and the gross domestic product would be
2.5 percent in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Canadian Premiers Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATTAWA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien Friday held constructive and
productive talks and reached consensus in various areas concerning
bilateral relations and international and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
The two premiers set a high value on the achievements gained
through cooperation over the past nearly 30 years since the
establishment of diplomatic relations and, in particular, in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu said Chinese Chairman Jiang Zeming and Chretien set
the guidance for the long-term development of Sino-Canadian
relations two years ago when Chairman Jiang made an official visit
to Canada. Since then mutually beneficial cooperation between the
two countries has made unprecedented progress in the areas of
political affairs, economy and trade, science and technology, and
culture, etc., he added.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Premier Zhu's evaluation of the development of
relations, Prime Minister Chretien said both had good-hearted
desire for the strengthening of bilateral relations and would do
their best to accelerate the pace on the direction of creating a
comprehensive and cooperative partnership through to the next
century.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that cooperation on economy and trade has
assumed increasing importance in the Sino-Canadian relations and
had great potentiality for mutual benefit.
</P>

productive talks and reached consensus in various areas concerning
bilateral relations and international and regional issues.

recent years.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu said Chinese Chairman Jiang Zeming and Chretien set
the guidance for the long-term development of Sino-Canadian
relations two years ago when Chairman Jiang made an official visit

Both sides agreed that cooperation on economy and trade has
assumed increasing importance in the Sino-Canadian relations and

<HEADLINE> Gulf TV Journalist Wounded by Israeli Rubber Bullet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese journalist was injured
Friday when Israeli troops opened fire at journalists covering its
re-occupation of a village in south Lebanon, the official National
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kassem Dergham, a Lebanese cameraman for the Gulf TV in the United
Arab Emirates, was shot in the back by rubber bullets when he and
nine other Lebanese journalists tried to approach Arnoun, a village
which was re-occupied by Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
About 25 Israeli soldiers accompanied by two armored vehicles, a
truck, a jeep and a civilian Mercedes Thursday night entered the
western edge of Arnoun and set up a checkpoint at the entrance of the
village.
</P>
<P>
The village, on the edge of the Israeli occupied zone, was first
occupied and blockaded with a three-kilometer barbed wire on
February 17 by Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed that the village was repeatedly used by Lebanese
guerrillas to stage bombing attacks on Israeli troops manning the
neighboring Beaufort castle.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of unarmed Beirut university students liberated the
village nine days later by tearing down the fence with their bare
hands.
</P>
<P>
It was still unclear whether the Israeli fresh incursion was a
limited action in retaliation for the roadside bomb attacks on
Monday which killed an Israeli soldier, or a full-fledged bid to
re-incorporate the village into the occupation zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to oust
Israeli forces and their militia ally South Lebanon Army out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss has charged the Lebanese
delegation at the United Nations in New York to lobby U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan for intervention.
</P>
<P>
He said Lebanon would use any possible means to press Israeli
troops out of the village.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hezbollah vowed to continue its attacks on Israeli
forces until all occupied land is liberated.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Criticizes Rising Protectionism in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan on Friday lashed out against a rising tide of
protectionism in the United States, warning that the protectionist
propensity is "unwise and surely self-defeating."
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned about the recent evident weakening of support
for free trade in this country," Greenspan said at the Dallas
Ambassadors Forum held in Dallas, Texas.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said the massive rise in world competition that
growing international trade had caused over the past half century
had resulted in "markedly higher standards of living" for
participating countries -- particularly the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has been in the forefront of the postwar
opening up of international markets, much to our, and the rest of
the world's, benefit," he said. "It would be a great tragedy were
that process reversed."
</P>
<P>
The central banker harshly accused industrial countries of
abusing antidumping suits and countervailing duties to protect
their domestic industries.
</P>
<P>
"While these forms of protection have often been imposed under
the label of promoting 'fair trade,' oftentimes they are just
simple guises for inhibiting competition," he said.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan did not link his comments to any particular reason to
worry about increasing protectionism. But the Clinton
administration is currently reviewing a number of cases brought by
the U.S. steel industry charging loss of thousands of American
jobs because of a flood of cheap foreign steel into the country.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department has ruled that Japan and several other
countries dumped steel products in the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan also criticized the Clinton administration's trade
policies for being too adversarial, based on the belief that trade
is a zero-sum game in which a gain by one player is always to the
detriment of the other.
</P>
<P>
"If trade barriers are lowered by both parties, each clearly
benefits. But if one lowers barriers and the other does not, the
country that lowered barriers unilaterally would still be better
off having done so," he said.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan also cautioned against promoting trade policies
solely in terms of how many jobs they might help to create, as the
Clinton administration has done in trying to drum up support for
the North American Free Trade Association (NAFTA) between the
United States, Canada and Mexico that came into effect in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"We try to promote free trade on the mistaken ground that it
will create jobs. The reason should be that it enhances standards
of living through the effects of competition on productivity," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Although most economists call NAFTA a success, the trade
agreement has been criticized by the country's labour groups,
which say it has cost America manufacturing jobs and depressed
U.S. wages.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said the campaign to expand free trade is never won.
"It is a continuing battle," he added.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Fish Processors Urged to Comply With EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan fish processors should
fully comply with the European Union (EU) health requirements in
a bid to secure the EU market share, Kenyan Health Minister
Jackson Kalweo said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on the sustainability of the fish
industry, he asked industry stake-holders to observe the EU
standards and Kenya's food safety laws to guarantee the health of
consumers.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Industrial Development Minister Chris Obure said at the
same seminar that the recent ban on Victoria Lake fish by the
Kenyan government adversely affected the 4 billion shilling
(about 62.5 million U.S. dollars) industry.
</P>
<P>
He urged the stake-holders to open other export markets instead
of totally depending on the European Union, which currently
accounts for 70 percent of Kenya's fish exports.
</P>
<P>
Obure said the government had acquired boats and vehicles to
patrol Lake Victoria to guard against dumping of contaminated fish
from neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya government Wednesday lift its two-week fish ban,
declaring that the fish from the lake was safe to eat again.
</P>
<P>
On March 30, the EU imposed a total ban on fresh and frozen
fish imports from Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, following reports
claiming that fishermen had used pesticides to harvest fish.

<P>
TIRANA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The NATO supreme commander, Wesley
Clark, began his talks with Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli Majko
immediately upon the U.S. general's arrival here Saturday
afternoon from Skopje, capital of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Majko was joined by his defense minister, Luan Hajdaraga, in a
closed-door meeting with Clark, the Albanian news agency ATA said.
</P>
<P>
Clark arrived here after a short visit to Macedonia where he
discussed the Kosovo crisis and issues related to the 12,000-
strong NATO troops stationed in the country.
</P>
<P>
Both NATO and Macedonia have not announced the outcome of the
talks between Clark and Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov and
Prime Minister Ljusko Georgievski.
</P>
<P>
During Clark's few-hour visit to Albania, he was also scheduled
to visit the NATO office in Tirana and inspect the NATO troops
deployed in the military airport in Rinas.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Majko met a delegation of U.S. congressmen

Albania arising from the arrival of more than 320,000 ethnic
Albanian refugees from Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Black Box Of Downed ROK Plane Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The flight recorder of the
Korean Air cargo plane that went down into a construction site in
Shanghai on Thursday was recovered by local police today.
</P>
<P>
The remains of two of the crew members have also been found,
but the remains of the third crew member are yet to be found.
</P>
<P>
Rains made the search for the black box very difficult because
the wreckage was scattered around muddy ground and ponds in a
large area. Over 2,000 police officers worked hard to dig and sort
through the various sites, including 3 nearby buildings that
sustained some damage.
</P>
<P>
A Shanghai Red-Cross Society team has been talking with
relatives of the victims and a U.S. team of investigators is
expected to arrive here this evening.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of Korea sent a 40-member team led by Lee Tae Won,
the vice-president of Korean Air, immediately after the accident
took place and ROK correspondents have come with the investigators.
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses, the MD-11 fell from an altitude of 1,
000 meters minutes after taking off from Shanghai's Hongqiao
Airport Thursday afternoon at 16:04 (Beijing time) on a flight
bound for Seoul.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft slammed into a construction site in the city's
Minhang District creating a large crater and scattering cargo and
wreckage over a 1,000-sq.m. area, killing four construction
workers instantly and injuring 35 people.
</P>
<P>
One construction worker who was seriously injured died at
around 11:00 Thursday night following a six hour effort to save
his life.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- World economy passes from crisis to caution. Practically
every day, it seems, many of the world's most economically
troubled countries exhibit new signs of health. And the global
financial crisis, which once threatened to engulf the entire world
in recession, looks a lot less scary as a result.
</P>
<P>
-- Russia's lower house of parliament, the State Duma, voted
Friday to include Yugoslavia in the still-unrealized union of
Russia and Belarus, a move that supporters said would force the
West to be more careful in the attacks on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO described Thursday as one of its most successful nights
in the air campaign against Yugoslavia, with pilots destroying
tanks, artillery sites and an oil refinery. The pilots also
gathered new photographic evidence to back up reports of mass
killings, officials said.
</P>
<P>
-- The leader of President Jacwues Chirac's Gaullist party
resigned unexpectedly, indirectly accusing Mr. Chirac of
undermining his position and throwing France's conservative
opposition into fresh disarray.
</P>
<P>
-- The Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, denounced growing
protectionist pressures and argued that pockets of workers
sometimes had to suffer in order for the nation to prosper. His
comments were seen as helpful to Administration efforts to
complete a deal with China and win Congressional approval for the
pact.

TIRANA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- NATO Supreme Commander Wesley

<HEADLINE> France Obtains Right of Veto in NATO Military Actions: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- France has obtained a right of veto
within NATO over the choice of targets to be struck in Yugoslavia,
according to a report of the daily Liberation on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted sources at the Elysee presidential palace as
saying that France has recently vetoed a NATO plan to escalate
airstrikes to Phase 3, in fear of irritating the Russians.
</P>
<P>
"By doing too much, one takes the risk of making war with
Russia," said the sources close to French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
"All that is provocative to the Russia would be an extremely
grave error," Chirac was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
NATO would bomb all the power centers of Yugoslavia and all
symbols of resistance in an all-out war if it entered the Phase 3.
</P>
<P>
"On this position (opposing Phase 3), France is rather isolated
within the alliance," said the sources.
</P>
<P>
France has demanded to be associated with the decision-making
process over targets to be struck and the American commander of
NATO in Europe Wesley Clark has given France the right of veto,
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
France has also vetoed a NATO plan to bomb an electricity
center providing power to Macedonia, and a television station in
Belgrade situated "two meters" from a news center where many
journalists were working, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also opposed the bombings in Montenegro on Thursday by
NATO, but the French veto was not "understood" by the allies, said
the sources.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Set Up Livelihood Programs for Poorest Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has ordered the National Anti-Poverty Commission (NAPC) to
put in place within two months its livelihood programs for the
majority of the 100 poorest families in each province and cities
of the country.
</P>
<P>
In his message at the NAPC meeting held at the Presidential
Palace late Friday afternoon, the president said his program
targets the 100 poorest families in all provinces and cities, with
government agencies as well as the private sector working
hand-in-hand in identifying their needs and problems.
</P>
<P>
"Within two months, I would like to see the enterprises and the
livelihood programs that the NAPC has said it will set up in these
identified areas," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
He said the 100 poorest families identified by the NAPC in each
city and province, along with their neighbors, and the people
residing in the towns, cities and provinces near them, would
translate to not less than nine million Filipinos freed from
poverty by the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
"If we accomplish this, that's the time we can say that our
program is successful," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the difference of his pro-poor program to the
Social Reform Agenda of the past administration, saying his
program is aimed at eradicating, not just alleviating, poverty in
the country.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the various concerns of his program, such
as food security, agricultural modernization towards sustainable
development, low-cost housing and the people's protection against
crime and violence "will give the poor the opportunity to improve
their lives."

<HEADLINE> Stolen Heads returned To Chinese Buddhas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen clay heads of Buddhas
that were cut off and smuggled out of China 6 years ago were
restored to their original place in north China's Shanxi Province
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The restoration, which is being done with the help of scholars,
is expected to take four months. A consecration ceremony will be
held during an annual cultural and tourism festival that begins on
August 18, according to Abbot Gen Tong, vice-president of the
Shanxi Provincial Buddhist Association.
</P>
<P>
The 18 Buddhas belong to the Zishou Temple in Lingshi County in
Shanxi. Smugglers cut off the 18 heads of the temple's Buddhas on
the night of December 25, 1993, and sold them abroad.
</P>
<P>
A Taiwan collector, Chen Yongtai, bought the 18 heads for a
high price from Japan and Taiwan in 1995, but when he heard that
they had been smuggled out of Shanxi he offered to return them,
and they were shipped to Shanghai on March 29.
</P>
<P>
Lingshi County officials say that they will use the renovation
period for a massive campaign on preserving cultural relics.

<HEADLINE> London Gallery to Stay Open Overnight for Monet Viewers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Academy of Arts in
London is set to stay open for an unprecedented 34-hour non-stop
viewing of Monet's paintings from Saturday morning till Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The "Monet in the 20th Century" show, opened on January 23,
will close on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time a major art exhibition in Britain
will have remained open overnight.
</P>
<P>
An Academy spokeswoman said, "We are expecting it to be very
busy throughout the whole night. Tickets are selling well. The
hours between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. seem to be slightly less popular
at the moment, but we are sure they will be filled."
</P>
<P>
To reduce overcrowding, the academy has admitted only a limited
number of people in each hour, with a record 8,200 visitors each
day paying nine pounds (15 U.S. dollars) each to see about 80 of
the impressionist's later works.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition has already attracted a record 750,000 visitors
and wiped out the academy's 500,000 pound (805,000 U.S. dollar)
debt.
</P>
<P>
The Monet exhibition brings together the later works of the
founder of impressionism, with about 80 paintings from private and
public collections around the world. They include views of his
garden at Giverny, atmospheric paintings of London and Venice and
some of his giant water lily panels.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Charges Tanzanian Visitors Higher Visa Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian visitors to the
United States have found that their visa application fees have
raised a lot.
</P>
<P>
A three-month visa for single entry remains free while the fee
for a multiple entry visa for three months has risen to 100 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The fee for multiple entry visa for six months is 200 dollars
and that of nine months stands at 300 dollars. Multiple entry
visa for 12 months is charged at 400 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper Saturday quoted a U.S. information
official as saying that the charges have been hiked in response to
Tanzania's decision to increase its visa application fees for the
U.S. citizens last year.
</P>
<P>
But the report did not say why the Tanzanian government decided
to raise visa fees for American visitors.
</P>
<P>
The Director of the United States Information Services (USIS)
in Tanzania, Dudley Sims, said in Dar es Salaam Thursday that the
U.S. government felt the rise was pretty high and had negotiated
with the Tanzanian government to reduce the fees, without bearing
any fruits.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government then adjusted its visa fees in February
this year, he was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Romania Seeking Foreign Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Central Bank has
mounted a campaign to negotiate with the world's major commercial
banks for short-term loans, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Romania is expected to be able to get about 550 million to 600
million U.S. dollars in foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
Romania's foreign debt amounted to 8.9 billion dollars at the
end of January, the Central Bank said. Some 3.6 billion dollars,
or 41 percent of the debt, was loans from international financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Public debt stands at more than 4.7 billion dollars, or about
54 percent of the total debt, while loans from foreign private
banks are 1.5 billion dollars, or 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
Romania will have to pay 2.21 billion dollars in foreign debt
services in 1999, according to Governor of the Central Bank, Mugur
Isarescu.
</P>
<P>
In May and June, peak months of repayment, 546.8 million
dollars and 390.5 million dollars will be paid out respectively.
</P>
<P>
The foreign debt services for 1999 will be the highest during
the 1994-2003 period, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Romania's hard currency and gold reserves could cover this
year's external debt, Isarescu said, but "a drop in the reserves
would imply risk of losing the country's external credibility."
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that foreign reserves of the Central Bank stand
at 1.5 billion dollars, with another 920 million dollars in gold
reserves. The foreign reserves of commercial banks are 1.2 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Has More Tigers Than Originally Estimated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A survey of Cambodia's wild
tiger population shows that the number of the wild cats in the
Kingdom is more than triple the number originally estimated, the
latest issue of Phnom Penh Post reported.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary report provided by the Cat Action Treasury (CAT),
an American NGO which promotes wild cat conservation projects in
developing countries, sets Cambodia's tiger population at "about
700 adult tigers", far higher than previous estimates of 100-200
tigers.
</P>
<P>
The new CAT estimate places Cambodia's tiger population on a
par with that of Malaysia, and second only to India's estimated
4000 tigers.
</P>
<P>
The CAT report based on the a survey of 13 provinces between
January and March of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Hunter Weiler, the coordinator of CAT's Cambodian Tiger
Preservation Project, said in spite of the threat posed by ongoing
illegal hunting and logging, he is optimistic that Cambodia's
geographical and human settlement patterns give the Kingdom a
unique advantage in preserving its tigers from extinction.
</P>
<P>
But some experts warned that if the tough measures were not
taken to stop the illegal hunting or to crack down the trafficking
in endangered wildlife parts, the days of the wildlife would be
numbered.
</P>
<P>
According to the Post, some military and economic police had
been hired by wildlife traders to provide safe escort for the
skins and bones of tigers. In Cambodia, it was said, per kilogram
of the bones of the tiger could be sold for 185 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A government official said "Cambodians need to be taught about
wildlife conservation" to enhance the whole nation's awareness of
environmental protection.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Log Exports up Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's earnings from its log
exports last year have increased to 11.19 million U.S. dollars
from only 41,000 U.S. dollars in 1997, following the lifting of
the ban on the export of the commodity.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) bulletin
published here Saturday, timber topped the list of agricultural
exports in terms of value last year.
</P>
<P>
Under the decrees of the Industry and Trade Ministry issued on
April 20 and October 8 last year, log could be exported provided
its export does not threaten the country's forest conservation
efforts.
</P>
<P>
The forestry and plantations minister has thus been authorized
to set the quantity of log exports every year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the export of agricultural produce last year was
valued at 3.65 billion U.S. dollars, up 11.65 percent from a year
earlier when the figure stood at 3.27 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Over the period, the export of coffee climbed 14.98 percent to
578.94 million U.S. dollars, tea 28.34 percent to 108.36 million
U.S. dollars, black pepper 110.44 percent to 86.7 million U.S.
dollars, and nutmeg 74.09 percent to 30.08 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Industry and Trade Ministry attributed the increase in the
export value of agricultural produce to the improving world market
prices of the commodities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the export of natural rubber last year dropped 40.46
percent to 18.83 million U.S. dollars, fresh/frozen shrimp 0.07
percent to 1,007.97 million U.S. dollars, and tuna 6.89 percent to
110.97 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Trims Import Bill by 1.16 billion Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has trimmed its import
bill by 1.16 billion U.S. dollars in the first nine months of
1998-99 fiscal year due to curbs on imports of some goods, an
official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The country might witness a relief of over 1.5 billion dollars
in the import bill at the conclusion of the current fiscal year
ending this June, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Updates statistics released by the Federal Bureau of Statistics
revealed that except two or three items the import of almost all
the major sectors has undergone decline in 1998-99 because of the
government's curbs on imports since international sanctions was
imposed on the country.
</P>
<P>
Particularly, a handsome relief of 1.03 billion dollars has
been recorded in the imports of wheat, machinery and petroleum
products.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan imported 4.05 million tons of wheat worth 703 million
dollars from July to March of 1997-98 while this year only 2.16
million tons of wheat has been imported at a cost of 269 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The country luckily had a good wheat crop of 19 million tons in
1997-98 in comparison with 16.54 million tons in the preceding
year, which has led to a drastic decline in import bill in
1998-99.
</P>
<P>
Some 316 million dollars was saved in machinery imports in the
first three seasons this year with imports in value fell to 1.498
billion dollars from 1.814 billion dollars in the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, oil glut in the international market depreciated its
value substantially in 1998-99 and the country has saved 286
million dollars form the petroleum imports this year.
</P>
<P>
In 1997-98, Pakistan paid 1.259 billion dollars to import
petroleum products, but in the same period this year, petroleum
products imports claimed only 973 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> UK Students Accuse Government Over Tuition Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- British student union leaders on
Saturday accused the government of imposing tuition fees which
were deterring mature students from attending universities.
</P>
<P>
The 11 percent fall in applications from over 21-year-olds in
the last year "blows a hole in the government's argument that
tuition fees have not put people off entering higher education,"
National Union of Students President Andrew Pakes said.
</P>
<P>
The students' union says that mature students with families
are the most likely to be sensitive to the extra burden of the 1,
000-pound-a-year (1,600 U.S. dollars) tuition fees, introduced by
the government last year.
</P>
<P>
The government's claim that university applications were
increasing among school-leavers was also disputed. The NUS says
that the 0.1 percent increase in applications from those under-21
simply reflected the overall increase in numbers in that age group.
</P>
<P>
"The meaning of these figures is clear. Fees are not working.
They are putting people off applying and the eventual publication
of the drop out rate will show that they are causing people to
leave," BBC quoted Pakes as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Fees have put students off going into higher education and
the main people suffering are the lifelong learners which the
government claims to be keen on enticing," he added.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Listeners of Chinese Radio Meet in Kathmandu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 17 (Xinhua) -- About 150 Nepalese listeners of
China Radio International (CRI) assembled here Saturday to elect a
new leading body for the national council of the listeners clubs
and explore ways to mark the 24th anniversary of the radio's
Nepali service.
</P>
<P>
National Council President Prakash Babu Poudel said the two-day
national convention of CRI listeners clubs will also discuss on
how to make the CRI programs more popular.
</P>
<P>
"We highly appreciate the efforts made by CRI to promote
friendship between Nepal and China," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there are 450 CRI listeners clubs in the kingdom
with an estimated 50,000 listeners.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the convention, Man Mohan Adhikari, former prime
minister and chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML), said that in rural and remote areas of
Nepal, CRI can be easily heard; the programs are educative and
informative.
</P>
<P>
"The programs of CRI help us to learn much of China's
advancement and achievement. China has been helping us in every
sector including education," he remarked. "We're good neighbors,
we're the best friends. Our friendship is as high as the Himalayas
and as deep as the Pacific Ocean."
</P>
<P>
He said "Chinese president regards me as an old friend. I often
visit China."
</P>
<P>
In the Himalayan kingdom, radio is the most important means for
information due to high incidence of poverty and illiteracy.

NEW DELHI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Correct figures eluded the
electronic voting machine in the Lower House of Parliament here
Saturday as it showed a total of 520 when 539 members were present
in the House during the voting on the confidence motion on the
Vajpayee government, Press Trust of India (PTI) said here.
</P>
<P>
The calculations were done manually after the machine recorded
256 ayes, 263 noes and one abstention.
</P>
<P>
The final figures arrived at after an hour of manual

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Indian Vajpayee Government Voted Out in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The 13-month-old Vajpayee
coalition government was defeated in the vote of confidence in the
Lower House of Parliament here Saturday with 269 support and 270
against.
</P>
<P>
The vote took place after two-day long debates and over a hour
long reply by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee here Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Correction figures of the votes in the House were delayed
nearly an hour as the electronic voting machine went out of order.
The machine showed a total of 520 when 539 MPs were present in the
House during the voting on the confidence motion moved by Vajpayee
Thursday. The machine gave wrong figures of 256 ayes, 263 noes and
one abstention.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the voting, Vajpayee conceded his defeat and
convened an emergency meeting of the Union cabinet. He is expected
to call on President K. R. Narayanan to tender his resignation to
him.
</P>
<P>
This is the seventh confidence vote in eight years. Senior
leader of the Congress party, the biggest opposition party in
Parliament, Sharad Pawar told newsmen soon after the voting in
Parliament that the Congress would work towards providing a viable
alternative under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
"We will discuss with other opposition parties and work for a
viable alternative to provide a stable government," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Vajpayee government was a "non-performing government which
had totally demoralized the armed forces and was responsible for
communal hatred and a feeling of insecurity among minorities", he
said, adding that the Vajpayee government had neglected the
economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that all secular forces would come together
to form the government and we will be able to take everyone with
us," he further said.
</P>
<P>
Another senior Congress leader Arjun Singh Saturday said that a
meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the highest
policy-making body of the party, is likely to be held later in the
day to finalize party's future strategy.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee moved a motion seeking vote of confidence for his
government to the House Thursday as directed by the president
following the withdrawal of support to the government by its one
of major allies All-India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK)
due to sharp disputes between them on Wednesday. AIADMK chief Ms
Jayalalitha handed over a letter of withdrawal of support to the
Vajpayee government to the president here Wednesday when she
called on him.
</P>
<P>
Since the AIADMK withdrawal of support to the government, all
opposition parties in India have time and again urged Vajpayee to
resign immediately as his government has reduced to minority.
</P>
<P>
"The government has no moral, constitutional and political
right to continue in office," Arjun Singh said on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Agree to Vote for Selection of WTO Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will agree to a vote to
decide the new head of the World Trade Organization if it is the
only way to ensure a transparent and fair decision, Thai Foreign
Minister Surin Pitsuwan has said.
</P>
<P>
"If ultimately there is no other way but to vote, we will have
to vote," he said in remarks published by Saturday's Bangkok Post.
</P>
<P>
Surin noted that a vote could help ensure "transparency,
openness and justice."
</P>
<P>
The selection of a new WTO director-general has become a
two-man race between Thai deputy prime minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi's and former New Zealand Prime Minister Michael
Moore, both facing opposition from hostile camps.
</P>
<P>
Washington earlier secretly vetoed against Supachai, therefore
delaying the selection process which has missed several deadlines.
</P>
<P>
The WTO has been sticking to the tradition of consensus as the
means for selecting the new director-general to replace Italian
Renato Ruggiero, who has confirmed his resignation on April 30.
</P>
<P>
But WTO members failed again to agree on a choice at
Wednesday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
Moore is expected to lobby intensively for the job over the
next two weeks, up to the new April 30 deadline set by the WTO
General Council.
</P>
<P>
To counteract this, Thailand and other countries supporting
Supachai should address U.S. concerns that are central to the
race, said Kobsak Chutikul, director-general of the Foreign
Ministry's Economic Affairs Department.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and the "Friends of Supachai" were confident they
could meet U.S. concerns "in the wider interests of the
international trading system and the efficacy of the WTO," Kobsak
said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand also should work on building up European support for
Supachai to ensure that he retains the widespread support across
geographical regions that he had enjoyed all along, he added.
</P>
<P>
About 40 countries -- Asian, Arab, African and Latin American
-- were working to build up a consensus of support for Supachai.

<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- While 100,000 more Kosovo Albanians are expected to arrive
in Albania and Macedonia in the coming days, French President
Jacques Chirac Friday asked French troops to air drop food and
medicines to the people remaining in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
-- France has vetoed a NATO plan to escalate the air campaign

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Unemployment Rises by 3% Yearly: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment, one of the
most serious problems in South Africa, is climbing at about three
percent a year, figures released by the Statistics South Africa
showed.
</P>
<P>
About 180,000 jobs were lost nationally through retrenchments
and closures last year, the statistics showed. Almost 500,000
jobs have been lost since 1994, which witnessed the abolition of
apartheid and the first all-race elections.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1998, 4.9 million people were employed in the
non- agricultural business sector. This was a drop of 186,522 on
the pervious year, an annual decrease of around 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Saturday Star newspaper reported that the major sectors to
shed jobs in the first quarter of 1999 were mining and
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Analyst Ray Brand predicted that unionization and the
introduction of a minimum wage will continue to have a negative
effect on the job market.
</P>
<P>
In the short term, unionized workers will benefit the most.
But in the longer term, companies have to make profits to stay in
business and more jobs will be shed, he said. The biggest
losers are the unemployed because wages are too high to allow them
to break into the job market, he added.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Restrict Employment of Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The National Assembly of
Tanzania has passed a bill to restrict the employment of
foreigners in a move to solve the country's unemployment problem.
</P>
<P>
The bill was passed at parliament Friday in the central city
Dodoma, local media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under the new bill, offenders shall be liable to a fine of no
less than one million Tanzanian shillings (about 1,420 U.S.
dollars) or an imprisonment term of no less than six months, or
both penalties.
</P>
<P>
Winding up debate on the National Employment Promotion Service
Bill 1999, Tanzanian Minister of Labor and Youth Development Paul
Kimiti said the east African country wants to make sure that
foreigners are not employed at the expense of available qualified
local citizens.
</P>
<P>
However, Kimiti said that foreigners would be allowed to do
jobs which no locals are qualified for.
</P>
<P>
The reports did not mention what kind of jobs local people are
not qualified for, but said the government may from time to time
gazette the list of jobs that can only be done by Tanzanian
citizens.
</P>
<P>
Kimiti said his ministry will work closely with the Ministry of
Home Affairs and the Tanzania Investment Center to ensure smooth
implementation of the bill.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said the government will tighten
conditionalities to ensure that companies coming to invest in the
country are not involved in petty businesses.
</P>
<P>
Kimiti, however, acknowledged that it is not easy to control
foreigners working in aid projects as they are governed by special
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the government announced a policy to limit
foreigners' business scope, claiming that it aims at combating
poverty and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The policy will bar foreigners from doing business in more than
20 fields, such as sub-whole sales, running small hotels (up to 20
rooms) and restaurants.

<HEADLINE> China, Canada Sign Cooperation Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China and Canada signed a number
of agreements here Friday on environmental and bio-industry
cooperation during Premier Zhu Rongji's on-going visit.
</P>
<P>
The two governments signed the environmental cooperation action
plan, three protocols on quarantine and health requirements for
swine semen, swine embryos and bovine embryos which are to be
exported from Canada to China.
</P>
<P>
The China National Petroleum Corp. and the government of
Alberta State of Canada will later sign the agreement on
management and operation of China-Canada Petroleum Center, which
is designated for the exchange of technology and staff training in
petroleum and environmental protection sectors.
</P>
<P>
A top Chinese trade official said Zhu's on-going visit will
surely boost the development of bilateral economic and trade
cooperation, adding the total value of commercial contracts and
agreements signed during Zhu's visit will surpass 400 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Major contracts include the import of Canadian potash
fertilizer by the China National Chemical Import and Export Corp,
the import of 500,000 tons of Canadian wheat by the China National
Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corp., the
purchases of three Dash-400 passenger planes by the China Changan
Airlines, the import of telecommunication equipment by the China
Unicom from the Ottawa-based Nortel Company and the cooperation
agreement between Guangdong Provincial Telecommunication Bureau
and Nortel Company.
</P>
<P>
There has been an expanded cooperation in recent years in such
areas as agriculture, energy, transportation, telecommunication,
machinery, electronics, environmental protection and high-tech
industry, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Relevant government department has authorized the Sun Life
Assurance Corp. of Canada to open its business offices in China,
said the official.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has also decided to develop the CDMA-
based mobile telecommunication, which creates more favorable
conditions for telecommunication companies from both Canada and
other countries to enter the huge Chinese telecommunication
equipment market.
</P>
<P>
"Economic cooperation between China and Canada are strongly
complementary and mutually beneficial," the official said,
pointing out that China can get advanced technology, equipment and
management expertise from Canada, while Canada will be rewarded
with great economic results in the huge Chinese market.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, Ningxia, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China will turn all
their resources to the 18th Asian Women's Basketball
Championships, which will open on May 1 in Japan, to earn the only
ticket to the Sydney Olympic Games next year for the continent.
</P>
<P>
The path, however, will not be easy for China who have to clear
the obstacles set by Japan and South Korea, the other two powers
in Asia, before they finally secure the only berth at stake for
the 2000 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Though the recent history is not on the side of China, who was
unseated from the champions by Japan at the Bangkok Asian Games,
they have committed themsleves to restore their reputation as the
Asian champion.
</P>
<P>
Following two-month winter training early this year, China has
trained for one month in the United States where they were advised
by NBA coaches and experts on rebounds and defense, which were
often caught out in international events.
</P>
<P>
Li Jinsheng, leader of the national women's basketball team,
was satisfactory with the form of the squad, which he said was an
"all-round team".
</P>
<P>
But he was circumspect about the prospect of the team, which
has just been injected new blood after the Asiad last year.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem is the lack in experience of major events.
" he added.

<P>
MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Three people died while 33 others
were injured in a road mishap in Del Rosarioa village of the
Philippines' central Sorsogon province on Friday late afternoon,
Philippines News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of the Macao SAR Basic Law (35) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Following is part 35 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Will the MSAR Legislative Council have the power to impeach the
Chief Executive? What rights will council members enjoy?
</P>
<P>
The Basic law stipulates the MSAR Legislative Council will have
the power to pass an impeachment motion against the Chief
Executive.
</P>
<P>
This power provides the Legislative Council with an effective
method for supervising the Chief Executive. The power is also an
expression of the checks-and-balances relationship between the
Chief Executive and the Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
However, the Legislative Council must follow certain procedures
when exercising its power of impeachment. The Legislative Council
will be empowered to pass a resolution mandating the President of
the Court of Final Appeals to form an independent investigation
committee to look into allegations if two-thirds of the members of
the Legislative Council believe that the Chief Executive has
committed a serious breach of law or dereliction of duty and
refuses to resign.
</P>
<P>
The Council will be empowered to pass a motion of impeachment
requiring a two-thirds majority if the committee finds sufficient
evidence to substantiate the charges. The Chief Executive is
appointed by the Central People's Government which will render a
final decision.
</P>
<P>
Provisions in Articles 75, 76, 79 and 80 of the Basic Law
stipulate that members of the MSAR Legislative Council will enjoy
the following rights related to their duties and responsibilities
apart the rights and freedom enjoyed by ordinary residents in the
region:
</P>
<P>
The right to introduce bills. The Basic Law stipulates that
members of the Legislative Council can independently or jointly
introduce bills unrelated to public expenditures, political
structures or government operations. Nevertheless, the
introduction of bills related to government policies requires
prior written consent from the Chief Executive.
</P>
<P>
The right to Question. The government must respond to questions
from Council members within a specified time period.
</P>
<P>
The right to immunity. Members of the Legislative Council will
enjoy two forms of immunity -- immunity from legal action in
respect to statements and votes cat during Council meetings and
immunity from arrest without the permission of the Council, with
the exception of arrest for criminal activities.

<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Following is part 36 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR)
</P>
<P>
What transpires if the Chief Executive refuses to sign the
bills passed by the Legislative Council? What transpires if the
Legislative Council refuses to pass the bills introduced by the
Government?
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law stipulates that all bills passed by the
Legislative Council must be signed and promulgated by the Chief
Executive prior to entering effect. What if the Chief Executive
cites certain consideration as grounds for refusing to sign bills
passed by the Legislative Council?
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive will have following two choices if the
Legislative Council passes an original bill by a two-thirds
majority of members -- either sign and promulgate the bill within
30 days or dissolve the Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chief Executive must consult the Executive Council
and provide a full explanation to the general public prior to
dissolving the Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive will be empowered to dissolve the
Legislative Council only once during each term of office. The
Chief Executive must sign and promulgate any original bill the new
Legislative Council passes by a two-thirds majority within 30 days.
The Chief Executive will be required to resign for any failure to
do so.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Council must consult with the Government prior
to refusing to pass a budget introduced by the latter body or any
bills the Chief Executive deems to directly concern the overall
interests of the region.
</P>
<P>
The failure of consultations to produce an agreement empowers
the Chief Executive with right to dissolve the Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive must resign if the Legislative Council is
dissolved and the new council still refuses to pass the original
bill.

MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Subic Bay Metropolitan
Authority (SBMA) has approved new and renewed contracts worth 22.2
billion pesos (555 million U.S. dollars), further spurring
economic growth not only at the freeport but also in Central Luzon

He added that after President Joseph Estrada took office last
year, the SBMA has generated 4,126 jobs from the contracts it
approved which include giant manufacturers such as Mitsumi
Corporation and Sankyo Seiki of Japan.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Resume Peace Talks with Rebels Within a Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Saturday that formal peace negotiations with National
Democratic Front (NDF) rebels may resume in a month's time,
following the release by the later of two military officers they
have earlier kept hostage.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio-TV program aired Saturday morning, the
president also set the end of this year as deadline for the
government and the NDF panels to forge a formal peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he gave the yearend deadline to the government
peace panel negotiating with the NDF headed by Ambassador Howard
Dee.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, we will convene our peace panel immediately so that
we can finally put an end to the conflict between the rebels and
the government," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So I think we should now forge an agreement. The talks should
end this year. I gave our peace panel up to December to finish the
talks," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the President said the government is willing to resume
peace talks with the NDF following the release of Brig. Gen.
Victor Obillo and Capt. Eduardo Montealto Friday.

Davao City on February 17.
</P>
<P>
The release of Obillo and Montealto followed the release last
week of Chief Inspector Roberto Bernal and Sgt. Alipio Lozada, two
other officers abducted by NPA.

NAIROBI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenya exported fish and fish
products worth four billion shillings (about 62.5 million U.S.
dollars) in 1998, Chief Executive Peter Muthoka of the Export
Promotion Council said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on the sustainability of the fishery
industry, Muthoka said the fishery sector was among the country's
fastest growing non- traditional export products, the East African
Standard newspaper Saturday quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
He noted that European Union was the largest market for Kenya's
fish products, and any ban on exports had social and economic
effects like lost export earnings.
</P>
<P>
Muthoka urged that Kenya should endeavor to export quality
products and services in compliance with international standards
and sanitary requirements.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the country's export base was small and
must be expanded, adding value of traditional exports and
increasing non- traditional product exports.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Economic Integration of Southern Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States has urged
southern African countries to form a free-trade zone before U.S.
capital could flow into the region, South African media reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The best way to attract U.S. investment to the region is to
step up measures toward integration and the creation of a southern
African free- trade zone, U.S. Undersecretary of State for
economic affairs, Stuart Eizenstat, reportedly told a
U.S.-Southern African Development Community (SADC) forum in
Botswana.
</P>
<P>
The two-day forum ended in Gaborone Friday.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat said that U.S. investment would be unlikely to target
the individual economies in the region.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. investors are only going to be here if they think there
is an integrated region into which they can sell without (tariff)
barriers," said Eizenstat.
</P>
<P>
The thrust of the forum, characterized by blunt talks from
Eizenstat and his team, has been on the need for peace and
political stability, the rule of law and transparency in the
governance of the 14 SADC members before the initiative can get
off the ground.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat said there had to be political stability in Africa if
U.S. trade and investment links were to be sustained.
</P>
<P>
"All advances we might make in terms of trade and investment
can be negated in an instant by political instability," he said.
</P>
<P>
Trade and political relations with southern Africa has been
given a high priority by Washington, Eizenstat said.
</P>
<P>
Washington is working hard to promote the passage of the
African Growth and Opportunity Bill, which proposes easier access
to U.S. markets for African countries which are seen by the U.S.
to be making progress both economically and politically.
</P>
<P>
A free trade zone between the U.S. and sub-Sahara Africa was
envisaged at the forum.

<HEADLINE> Zhu: China-Canada Talks on China's Entry Into WTO Almost Complete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TORONTO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji said here Friday night China and Canada have almost
completed their negotiations on the former's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"Some people said that 95 percent of the work for China's WTO
membership has been concluded between China and the United States
through negotiations. If this is true, then I think 99 percent of
the work has been done as to our negotiations with Canada on WTO-
related issues thanks to the friendly and close relations between
the two countries," Zhu said when delivering a speech at a dinner
held by the Canada-China Business Council.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that he and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien
shared the view that the two countries can step up their work so
that the remaining one percent of the work will be completed as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion of the negotiations on China's WTO membership
will not only make the world trading block more representative,
but also provide an impetus to the further development of economic
and trade relations between China and Canada, and to the expansion
of the Canadian business community's access to the Chinese market
more quickly, he told an audience of 1,200.
</P>
<P>
"That will also help reduce Canada's trade deficits with China,
" the Chinese premier said.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States will hold further talks on WTO-
related issues in Beijing by the end of April, with a final
agreement hopeful then, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
It has been 13 years since the negotiations began on China's
resumption of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
membership and later its access to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said Canada's trade deficit with China is no serious
problem. However, he said he will do his best to improve the trade
imbalance between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
China is now working vigorously to develop infrastructure
projects in the country in areas including energy, environment
protection and telecommunication.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Canadian business community will take part in
China's construction and the Canadian government ease restrictions
on export of high-tech products to China," he said. By doing so,
he noted, it will not take long before Canada's trade deficit is
improved.
</P>
<P>
Zhu arrived here from Ottawa Friday afternoon to continue his
seven-day official visit to Canada.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Dissociates Itself From Uganda Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has expressed serious
concern and dissociated itself from a spate of bombings that
rocked Ugandan capital Kampala last weekend.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe does not train terrorists and has no program for
terrorizing anyone or any country," Zimbabwean Minister of Home
Affairs Dumiso Dabengwa said in a statement issued here Friday.
</P>
<P>
This comes in the wake of a story published on the internet
claiming that a Zimbabwean national was being held by Ugandan
security agents for questioning in relation with the recent spate
of bombings in Kampala, the Herald newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe will be interested in the identity of this
'Zimbabwean terrorist' and hopes that the Ugandan police through
their normal interpol channels will contact with the Zimbabwe
Republic Police on this matter," said Dabengwa.
</P>
<P>
The man, whose identity has been withheld for security reasons,
was arrested in Kampala Monday as he tried to transact business at
a forex bureau.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan security sources said they believe the money was
allegedly meant to finance the activities of the bomber.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed senior security official was quoted as saying that
preliminary inquiries had indicated that the man was a Zimbabwean
but carried a Ugandan passport.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Set to Curb Illegal Fishing in Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will take measures
to attack illegal fishing activities in Lake Victoria to save the
fishing industry and preserve bio-diversity.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister of Natural Resources and Tourism, Zakia
Meghji, said Friday that patrols will be stepped up in the
Africa's largest lake to fight illegal practices of fishing with
explosives or chemical substances.
</P>
<P>
Another step is the formation of a regional body that will
advise the governments of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda on
sustainable fishing practices in the lake. The body is known as
Lake Victoria Fisheries Organization, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Mail newspaper reported Saturday that the governments
of the three east African states are working together on a World
Bank-financed scheme, the Lake Victoria Environment Management
Project, which is to look for scientific ways of curbing the
depletion of fish stocks in the lake and protecting bio-diversity.
</P>
<P>
Meghji said that a workshop bringing together representatives
from the three countries had been held in Kenya to harmonize
efforts to solve problems in the lake.
</P>
<P>
On March 30, the European Union announced a total ban on fresh
and frozen fish imports from Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda, following
reports that unscrupulous fishermen have been using insecticides
to poison fish, posing threats to food safety.
</P>
<P>
The ban deals a heavy blow to the three countries as Tanzania
earns 85.6 million U.S. dollars annually from the fish industry
along the lake, providing 4,000 jobs, while Uganda earns some 70
million dollars and Kenya garners some 91 million dollars from the
sector.
</P>
<P>
A Tanzanian delegation is in Brussels, Belgium, holding
discussions with the EU on current situation in Lake Victoria, and
dwelling on details of the guarantees that Tanzania can give the
European countries regarding the safety of its products.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that the government is determined to
stamp out drag-net fishing which is environmentally improper.

<HEADLINE> Manila Acts to Win Public Trust in Justice System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government is adopting
a set of measures to win back public trust and confidence in the
country's justice system, a report of the Presidential Management
Staff (PMS) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Philippine President Joseph Estrada
has thus far appointed 81 judges to fill up vacant posts to declog
the courts of unresolved cases.
</P>
<P>
To hasten the delivery of justice, the government has
front-loaded at least seven more measures to improve the
administration of justice in the country, particularly in the five
pillars of the criminal justice system -- law enforcement,
prosecution, courts, corrections, and community.
</P>
<P>
Aside from appointing the 81 judges, the president also mounted
"efficient coordination and collaboration" between and among the
Department of Justice and law enforcement agencies in the
investigation and prosecution of law violators, the report bared.
</P>
<P>
Estrada likewise fired or suspended 11 prosecutors for serious
misconduct, negligence of duty or conduct prejudicial to the best
interest of the service, it added.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of the criminal justice system was an integral
component of the anti-crime campaign plank of President Estrada in
the May 1998 presidential elections.

DHAKA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi delegation led by
Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria will have a hard time at the
Bangladesh aid club meeting to be held in Paris, France, on April
19-20, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Every year, Bangladesh presents its economic progress and seeks
funds for its development activities from the donor countries and
agencies at the Bangladesh Development Forum, previously known as
the Paris Aid Consortium meeting, and each time Dhaka receives aid
commitments amounting to about 2 billion U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous years, the donors have decided that they would
not declare any aid pledge this year, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's representative in Dhaka also told reporters
recently that the donor representatives would only listen to the
achievements and problems of Bangladesh at the meeting, and
commitments would be made later through bilateral initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Kibria, who is leading a nine-member delegation and left here
on Friday, will also participate in the meeting of the Bangladesh
Investment Forum on April 21, jointly sponsored by the World Bank
and the International Finance Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The investment forum will also be attended by a group of local
investors, led by Adbul Awal Mintoo, president of the Federation
of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce Industry. But many local
industrialists, who have been invited, have declined to attend,
sources said.

SOFIA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian President Peter Stoyanov
on Friday reiterated Bulgaria's desire to join NATO as soon as
possible, noting NATO represents not only security and shared
responsibility but also a safety guarantee for economic
investments.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov said this in a national address Friday, one day before
he starts a visit to the United States, where he will attend the
NATO summit.
</P>
<P>
This desire cannot be achieved at the summit since Bulgaria is
staying way behind, but, the president said, it can be achieved
with faith, hard working and persistence, as Poland, Hungary and
the Czech Republic did.
</P>
<P>
He said that today as never before Bulgaria's interests
coincide with those of the free Western world.
</P>
<P>
The president called on his country to act as a belt of
stability around its troubled neighbor, Yugoslavia, and gain
economic and political advantages from this.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria will feel safe only after it becomes an EU and NATO
member, that is, a part of the community whose interests and rules
suggest high efficiency and living standards, he said.

<HEADLINE> Italy Confirms Talks of Telecom Merger With Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government confirmed on
Friday night that Italy's biggest telecommunications company
Telecom Italia has a provisional plan to merge with its German
counterpart Deutsche Telekom to form the world's second largest
telecommunications group.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Vicenzo Visco said that he had not discussed
the matter with his German counterpart Hans Eichel, but noted the
merger, posing considerable "technical problems," could not take
place until Deutsche Telekom is fully privatized.
</P>
<P>
The German government is Deutsche Telekom's biggest shareholder
with a 74-percent stake while the Italian government has a 3.4-
percent stake in the privatized Telecom Italia.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government has several times said it is neutral on
most matters of the group, but as the largest single shareholder,
it could probably block the move.
</P>
<P>
Further problems could come from antitrust authorities, both in
Rome and Brussels. The creation of a 215-billion-U.S. dollar
telecommunications colossus would likely be seen as a threat to
continued plurality in the industry.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Telekom has already been allied with France Telecom in
Wind, the third telecommunications group to be given a license in
Italy's liberalized and expanding market.
</P>
<P>
On international markets, the German group is part of the
Global One consortium with France Telecom and Sprint of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
According to 1997 figures, Telecom Italia's turnover amounted
to 30.721 billion dollars, and Deutsche Telekom's, 38.957 billion
dollars.

BUCHAREST, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Foreign Minister
Andrei Plesu said Friday that Romania and Slovenia are opposed to
possible NATO ground military action against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The two nations shared "very similar" stand on the issue and
agreed that such action would bring serious negative consequences
to the whole Balkan region, said Plesu after a one-day visit to
Slovenia on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Plesu stressed that this is not only the view of Romania and
Slovenia, but also that of central and eastern European countries,
urging the conflicting parties to return to negotiations as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
He further pointed out that it is neither rational nor
realistic to talk about Kosovo independence in the future
negotiations, noting that to give Kosovo autonomy is the best way
to solve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Plesu also stressed that Romania firmly supports the UN and UN
Secretary General Kofi Annan to actively participate in the

<HEADLINE> Mexican Crude Oil Price Up 57 Percent in Two Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Mexican oil price had a
surprising recovery in the last two months, going up from 8.25 U.S.
dollars to 13 dollars per barrel, up 57 percent, the Petroleos
Mexicanos (Pemex) said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"This 4.75-dollar increase is highly significant and represents
an important relief for public finances and for Petroleos
Mexicanos," Pemex director Adrian Lajous said in a communique.
</P>
<P>
Although there are better conditions in the international
markets, "internal discipline must not be relaxed nor induce us to
lower our guard," Lajous said.
</P>
<P>
He added the prices of the international benchmark crude's on
Thursday registered important advances. The Brent crude closed at
15.18 dollars per barrel, and the West Texas Intermediate at 16.85
dollars, while the Mexican mix was 13.32 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
He said Pemex must make a serious and successful effort to
control and adjust its operation costs to be competitive in the
international markets and try to reduce its costs and spending in
all its activities.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Algeria, and Venezuela agreed last
March in The Hague to cut their crude supply by 2.1 million
barrels a day, which was ratified by the OPEC countries last March
23. An improvement was observed in the international prices since
the implementation of this measure.
</P>
<P>
Lajous said prices are expected to continue rising and the
Brent is expected to be at levels of 18 dollars per barrel.

<HEADLINE> Rewi Alley Archives Given to N.Zealand National Library </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A delegation from the Chinese
People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries left
here Saturday for South Island's Christchurch, where Rewi Alley,
who was a great son of New Zealand and a friend of the Chinese
people, spent his teenage years.
</P>
<P>
After Rewi Alley went to China in 1927, he spent about 60 years
in China, making a remarkable contribution to the revolution and
construction of China and to the promotion of friendship between
the peoples of New Zealand and China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation, led by Qi Huaiyuan, president of the
association, began its visit to New Zealand on April 12 as guest
of the New Zealand-China Friendship Society. During its stay in
Wellington, the delegation donated to the National Library of New
Zealand a huge and comprehensive collection of historical material
relating to the life and work of Rewi Alley.
</P>
<P>
The collection includes a range of material previously unseen
such as correspondence, diaries, photos, and manuscripts of
unpublished works.
</P>
<P>
Stored in the National Library's Alexander Turnbull Library,
the new material completes and complements the Library's current
holdings on Rewi Alley.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the formal presentation ceremony held at the
National Library, Margaret Calder, chief librarian of the Turnbull
Library, said the gift "completes our portrait of the man and his
times" and makes the Turnbull Library "the main holding library of
Rewi Alley material in the world."
</P>
<P>
Qi said he hoped the Chinese and New Zealand peoples will
deepen their mutual understanding and promote their friendship
through the study of the Rewi Alley material.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to New Zealand Chen Wenzhao and Deputy
Secretary Chris Elder of the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and Trade attended the ceremony.

ROME, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema on Friday night stressed the importance of the restoration
of a central role to the United Nations in the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Seeing some of his ruling Left Democrat party members very

progress in ending the Kosovo crisis, D'Alema said there was a
need to restore the centrality of the UN.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Italy's UN ambassador Francesco Paolo Fulci has said
that the UN must resume its role, hoping that a major peace
operation authorized by the UN such as the one led by Italy in
Albania in 1997 might be repeated in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> IMF Agrees to Philippines' Deficit Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has agreed to maintain the Philippines' budget deficit of
1999 at 68.4 billion pesos (1.71 billion U.S. dollars) but only
until the first half of the year, the Philippine Post reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's accession came after repeated refusals by Philippine
government economic managers to its proposals for raising fiscal
spending beyond the agreed level.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted National Treasurer Leonor Briones as
saying Friday that the existing fiscal program, together with the
other macroeconomic assumptions, will be kept.
</P>
<P>
"It is too early to revise the forecasts. We are still waiting
for the figures for the first half and after that, we will
decide," she said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a visiting IMF mission had reportedly urged the
government to expand its expenditures even to the point of
incurring a bigger deficit, to ensure a positive growth in 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu, one of the main
negotiators of the Philippine side, and the other economic
managers turned down such prescription.
</P>
<P>
Under its two-year, 1.4-billion U.S. dollar standby program
with the IMF, the Philippines should at least post a 2.5 percent
GNP growth and 2 percent GDP growth by the end of the year.

STUTTGART, Germany, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A two-day Euro-
Mediterranean conference ended here Friday with participants
agreeing to set up a regular political dialogue system to avoid
regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers or officials from the 15 EU countries and 12

diplomacy" -- establishing partnership and confidence as well as
stepping up mediation in disputes and fight against terrorist
actions and organized crimes.
</P>
<P>
With peace and stability being the key theme, the conference
was attended by the Palestinian authority, Israel, Egypt, Turkey,
Cyprus, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria. For the first time, Libya
showed up in an observer status.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said the
conference agreed to draft a Euro-Mediterranean Charter on

Participants also committed to close cooperation on water
resources, industry, environment protection, energy and
information between the regions.

<HEADLINE> Britain Welcomes Funds From China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain's national inward
investment agency is drawing investment from China's businesses.
</P>
<P>
The Invest in Britain Bureau (IBB) held a seminar yesterday in
Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, to answer
Chinese investors' inquiries about investment in Britain and to
stimulate investors' interest in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Today's "China Daily" quoted Chief Executive Andrew Fraseras
saying that IBB is particularly interested in projects which will
create long-term employment, projects using new and high
technologies or management techniques, .
</P>
<P>
Such projects are expected to sharpen the competitive edge of
Britain's manufacturing sector and to take advantage of the
sizable market in Britain as well as in the whole European Union,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain holds advantages for potential investors. IBB is
looking forward to more exchanges with investors from China, and
particularly from Guangdong Province, one of China's most powerful
economic powerhouses, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, investment in Britain will reduce the operation risks
of China's overseas investment, the chief executive said,
referring to the fact that China's overseas investment has been
too concentrated.
</P>
<P>
"China's rapidly growing economy has provided British investors
with excellent business opportunities and we believe a base in
Britain will provide the same for Chinese enterprises in Europe,"
Fraser told the paper.
</P>
<P>
IBB's latest statistics indicate that China's investment in
Britain makes up a mere three percent of its overseas investment
worldwide.

table tennis championships which has been left in limbo for the
unfolding Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
These candidates include the Netherlands, a joint bid by
Austria and Hungary, India and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) said the final
decision would be made by the executive committee on April 22.
</P>
<P>
But before the ITTF decide the final host, a decision should be
made on whether the championships, originally to be held in
Belgrade from April 26 to May 9, should be split into individual
and team events.
</P>
<P>
The current offers compounded the ITTF decision on the
championships which will serve as the Olympic qualifier.
</P>
<P>
Only India and Malaysia agreed to hold all the events at one
time, but both on dates close to the 2000 summer Olympics in
September. India offered February 2000 and Malaysia said May/June
2000.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands put in a bid for August and Austria and Hungary
pledged October, but only for the individual events.

<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Travelers exclaimed with
admiration yesterday as they rode China's first luxurious,
electric-powered passenger train, on its maiden trip from Kunming
to the famous tourist site, Stone Forest, "China Daily" reported

<HEADLINE> Caribbean Leaders Meet to Discuss Controversial Banana Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTO DOMINGO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Caribbean leaders gathered
here Friday to discuss the controversial banana trade issue,
Dominican Foreign Minister Eduardo Latorre said.
</P>
<P>
The banana dispute is a very sensitive matter for the
Association of Caribbean States, because while the Caribbean
island countries benefit from the European Union (EU) commercial
preferences, the Central American countries, the world's biggest
producers of bananas, consider themselves hurt.
</P>
<P>
Latorre did not say whether there will be a final decision on
the matter, but local observers held that it will be very
difficult to conciliate the positions of the two subregions of the
ACS.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister noted that the leaders will take advantage
of the summit to agree on positions related to the upcoming
European Union-Latin America summit, which is scheduled for June
in Brazil.

<HEADLINE> A Beautiful Place for Worshipping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Located in downtown Kunming, the
Yuantong Temple is the biggest temple in the city, where crowds of
local Buddhists worship during the traditional festivals.
</P>
<P>
The temple was built at the foot of Luofeng Hill in late 8th
century and first named Butuoluo Temple, according to today's
China Daily. But years of war greatly devastated the temple during
the 12th century.
</P>
<P>
In 1301, a new one, named Yuantong Temple, was built at the
original site. Later it was extended several times during the
following dynasties.
</P>
<P>
Famed for its grand architecture and design, the temple was
built on a hill slope.
</P>
<P>
Standing at the huge archway, inscribed with the characters of
Yuantong shengjing (Yuantong landscape) near the gate. From there,
visitors can get a bird's view of the temple as it expands down
the slope.
</P>
<P>
A wide path runs along the archway and leads to a huge pool.
The surroundings look more like a garden than a temple.
</P>
<P>
In the middle of the pool is an octagonal two-storey pavilion
built in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
A winding corridor along the bank of the pool leads up to the
major structure of the temple - Yuantong Hall. A huge statue of
Sanshi Buddha and the two dragons sculpted around the pillars are
both vivid and stunning.
</P>
<P>
Along the steps leading up to the summit of the hill there is a
wealth of stone inscriptions that still remain clear after
hundreds of years with wind and rain.
</P>
<P>
Behind the hall are two ancient caves - Yougu Cave and Chaoyin
Cave.
</P>
<P>
It was said that a monster lived in the caves and killed many
local people. A stage was build by a monk beside the caves to tame
the monster. There many outcasts set up their cottages.

<HEADLINE> Italy Confirms Talks of Telecom Merger With Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government confirmed on
Friday night that Italy's biggest telecommunications company
Telecom Italia has a provisional plan to merge with its German
counterpart Deutsche Telekom to form the world's second largest
telecommunications group.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Vicenzo Visco said that he had not discussed
the matter with his German counterpart Hans Eichel, but noted the
merger, posing considerable "technical problems," could not take
place until Deutsche Telekom is fully privatized.
</P>
<P>
The German government is Deutsche Telekom's biggest shareholder
with a 74-percent stake while the Italian government has a 3.4-
percent stake in the privatized Telecom Italia.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government has several times said it is neutral on
most matters of the group, but as the largest single shareholder,
it could probably block the move.
</P>
<P>
Further problems could come from antitrust authorities, both in
Rome and Brussels. The creation of a 215-billion-U.S. dollar
telecommunications colossus would likely be seen as a threat to
continued plurality in the industry.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Telekom has already been allied with France Telecom in
Wind, the third telecommunications group to be given a license in
Italy's liberalized and expanding market.
</P>
<P>
On international markets, the German group is part of the
Global One consortium with France Telecom and Sprint of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
According to 1997 figures, Telecom Italia's turnover amounted
to 30.721 billion dollars, and Deutsche Telekom's, 38.957 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Rejects Deployment of Foreign Troops in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior Yugoslav diplomat
Friday said Belgrade did not accept the deployment of any foreign
troops in Kosovo, a Serbian province, because the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia (FRY) is a sovereign and independent country.
</P>
<P>
Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission
to the United Nations, told reporters that "even before" the March
talks in France, the FRY government "refused to accept the
unacceptable conditions" the deployment of any foreign military
forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic, former Yugoslav foreign minister, made the statement
after his meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"We have more reasons to refuse to accept it now," he said. "We
are a sovereign country, we are absolutely able to govern our
country by our own means, we are not at all open to the idea of
accepting any foreign military presence."
</P>
<P>
"Civilian presence is something which can be negotiated, but
the military presence -- absolutely no," he said.
</P>
<P>
In answering to a question about 30,000 more troops and 300
more aircraft to join the NATO air strikes, Jovanovic said, "You
should ask (U.S.) President (Bill) Clinton and others who decided
to expand the aggression and made the war more dangerous for
Yugoslavia, the region and the United States as well."
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing which can shake our resolve to defend our
country despite any additional NATO military forces engaged (in
the air strikes)," he added.
</P>
<P>
Annan has put forward a five-point proposal, which includes the
withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo, the return of refugees
in safety and the deployment of international peacekeeping forces.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Annan's proposal largely overlap that
of NATO, which began air strikes on Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jovanovic said that "the NATO aggression should be
condemned and stopped. Otherwise, not only the whole Yugoslavia
and our region, but the world community as a whole is... in a very
dangerous and uncertain future."
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations and the Security Council should discharge
their responsibility under the Charter of (the) U.N. to condemn
the aggression," he said. "Otherwise, it will be the legal
aggressions."
</P>
<P>
The NATO attack, which is being intensified at present, has
killed 600 civilians and injured 5,000, some of them seriously
wounded, he said.
</P>
<P>
Civilian structures, such as factories and hospitals, have been
destroyed in the wake of the ongoing NATO attacks, he said. "We
are a victim country."
</P>
<P>
Besides, the NATO military act also created a large exodus of
refugees, described as "a great humanitarian catastrophe."
</P>
<P>
NATO, without the authorization of the Security Council, went
ahead with the bombing of Yugoslavia, a sovereign and independent
country, thus violating the U.N. Charter and international law.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Patriarch Calls For Help For Yugoslav Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Patriarch of the Romanian
Orthodox Church Teoctist Friday called on the clergy nationwide to
collect relief for the people suffering from the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
The aid will be donated to both the Patriarch of Serbia, who
will distribute it to the hit people in Serbia and the Yugoslav
refugees on the Romanian territory, Patriarch Teoctist said.
</P>
<P>
He urges all the Romanians to stay by the side of the large
number of people suffering in the neighboring country, the Kosovo
refugees, both Albanian and Serbian, as well as all the victims of
the bombing in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Early in the month, Patriarch Teoctist addressed an appeal for
putting an end to the war in Yugoslavia, stressing that "dialogue
is the only form by which the Kosovo residents can come to coexist
peacefully."
</P>
<P>
"In the sacred name of life and peace, respect for man and the
nations' sovereignty, we insistently ask the parties involved to
stop the war in Yugoslavia. This appeal of our Church will join
the cries of pain expressed the world over for ending the war and
returning to the table of dialogue in order to solve the Kosovo
crisis," Patriarch Teoctist said in the appeal.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian Orthodox Church enjoys the allegiance of more than
80 percent of Romania's population.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets lost ground
Friday pressured by an early downturn on the Dow and a skid in
telecom and drug stocks.
</P>
<P>
Just two days after peaking at a record intraday high of
6,539.9, the FTSE 100 index ended 45.5 points, or 0.7 percent,
lower at 6,420.6 on a day dominated by talk about a possible
blockbuster tie-up between Deutsche Telekom and Telecom Italia.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said they believe the market is ripe for
profit-taking. "It's looking a little tired at the moment," an
analyst said, adding that he's expecting the index to ease a bit
until lower prices can entice new buyers.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo was also seen as a wild card that could upset gains next
week, according to Jeremy Batstone, equity economist at NatWest
Stockbrokers.
</P>
<P>
"The error bombing on Wednesday could see a watershed in the
NATO resolve with some countries withdrawing support if another
error occurs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Xetra Dax share index wallowed in negative ground
after Wall Street's record-breaking run was dented by initial
losses. It closed 0.9 percent lower at 5,143.02 points.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, share prices closed slightly lower as profit taking
continued on the eve of French school holidays. The CAC 40 index
closed 9.73 points lower at 4,300.91.

But Fowler will now begin his ban after Saturday's match at
home to Aston Villa, thus missing the remaining six matches of the
season.
</P>
<P>
"I think that it would be good if Robbie could start next
season with a virtually clean slate. He is not of a mind now to
lodge an appeal," said manager Gerard Houllier.
</P>
<P>
Fowler received his ban for his part in two separate incidents.
He received two matches suspension for provocative behavior
towards Graeme Le Saux during a Premiership clash with Chelsea in
February, and the remaining four matches were added on as a result
of his pretending to snort cocaine during the Merseyside derby
match in April.
</P>
<P>
There remains a feeling that Fowler is not happy about his
sentence being longer than Le Saux, who received a one-match ban
for elbowing the Liverpool player in the face.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Urges U.N. to Act on NATO Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia Friday called
upon U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan once again to "condemn
without delay the aggression of NATO, halt NATO crimes agains
peace and humanity and protect the rights and the Charter of the
United Nations."
</P>
<P>
This was contained in a letter to Annan from Yugoslav Foreign
Minister Zivadin Jovanovic, who has sent a similar letter to the
U.N. chief on March 31.
</P>
<P>
"I call on you once again to condemn without delay the
aggression of NATO, halt NATO crimes against peace and humanity
and protect the rights and the Charter of the United Nations," the
foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"It is your bounden duty in view of the dramatic daily rise of
mass civilian casualties and the destruction of the aggressors
throughout Yugoslavia," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The failure of the Security Council to act and the blockade of
its work only encourage the proponents of aggression and
contribute to the further perilous endangering of international
peace and security, bringing into question the international legal
order and the very existence of the United Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia continues its efforts
towards finding a peaceful, political solution through direct
dialogue with the legitimate representatives of the national
communities of Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The State is guaranteeing security to all its citizens and is
also able to guarantee the implementation of a ratified peace
agreement," he said. "International military or police forces are
not necessary and are unacceptable on the Yugoslav territory."
</P>
<P>
In a quick response, a statement, issued here Friday evening by
a U.N. spokesman, said Annan "was not surprised by Yugoslavia's
response to his proposal on Kosovo. He feels that we are involved
in a difficult, dangerous and intractable situation."
</P>
<P>
"As he said in Brussels this week, do not expect quick results.
We are only at the beginning stage of our search for a diplomatic
solution," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
NATO, without the authorization of the 15-nation Security
Council, launched air strikes on Yugoslavia, violating the U.N.
Charter and international law.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Dennis Rodman said the Los
Angeles Lakers took him as a scapegoat for the team's problems,
and claimed he still would like to play for a team this season.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers kicked Rodman off last night saying they were
finished with Rodman in the wake of another in a lone glist of
incidents involving the eccentric forward earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
However, Rodamn said the Lakers were "cowards not to take the
fall for some of the things that have happend this year."
</P>
<P>
Rodman said the Lakers "have to have a fall guy, and I'm
basically the fall guy. A lot of people will criticize my attitude
and my dedication to the game of basketball, but, you know, it
doesn't surprise me."
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old also added "I didn't really miss practices.
Today, I didn't miss practice. Today, Rambis asked me, 'Do you
need treatment?' I was there 10 minutes early before practice, and
he told me to take the day off and all of a sudden I'm like, great,
you know?
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to come here and win and play here. It didn't turn
out that way. I don't know what I'm going to do right know. It's
one of those deals. If they want to make me the fall guy, I will
be the fall guy. I don't expect anything else."
</P>
<P>
Rodman did say he wanted to apologize to fans in Los Angeles,
adding, "I hope that they don't look at me as a bad individual. I
hope I'm still loved by people here in the state of California."
</P>
<P>
Rodman said he would consider playing for another team this
season. "I depends on if somebody wants to take a chance on having
a guy like me on a team that can win a championship, I will go and
play with them," he said.

LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The 12th edition of the Belgrade
marathon race is scheduled to go ahead on Saturday despite the
NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Friday the International Amateur Athletic

<HEADLINE> China Anticipates Increased Fertilizer Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Agriculture
reports that China will witness an increased demand for fertilizer
this year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also reported that the annual growth rate for
fertilizer demand has hovered between 3-5 percent in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Total 1999 demand for fertilizer will hit 33.5 million tons,
including 21 million tons of nitrogenous fertilizer, eight million
tons of phosphates and 4.5 million tons of potash.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the ministry's information center note that
domestic manufacturers will fulfill about 90 percent of total
demand.
</P>
<P>
They anticipate an adequate supply of nitrogenous fertilizer,
but note that imports will help fulfill total demand for phosphate,
potash and compound fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
Extension of the land contract system and reform of the grain
circulation system have encouraged farmers to increase inputs to
cultivation.
</P>
<P>
In addition, serious flooding in last summer and fall reduced
the fertility rate for arable land along major rivers and is
expected to increase the demand for chemical fertilizers by as
much as 5.8 million tons.
</P>
<P>
However, actual demand will quite likely drop due to the
limited purchasing power of flood victims.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will also strengthen the drive against
smuggled chemical fertilizer and will improve the distribution of
fertilizers by granting manufacturers greater autonomy in terms of
sales.

<HEADLINE> Young Tibetans Eager to Learn Foreign Languages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Local youngsters in this plateau
town, which has a population of 130,000, are eager to learn
foreign languages because of the increasing number of foreign
visitors to Tibet and their interest in finding out about the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
Such is the demand that when young student Cering Wangdoi came
to apply for a seat in a English course sponsored by the Tibet
Academy of Social Sciences the young man was sad to discover that
all the places were taken and many people had been turned down.
</P>
<P>
According to an official from the academy, their English
teachers are all from the United States coming to teach in China
through official channels.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1987, the number of applicants for our English courses
has kept increasing," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In Norbu Lingka, where the Dalai Lama used to spend his winter
days before he fled for India in 1959, 27-year-old Geli Lama has
been seen reading an English conversation textbook. He began to
study English by himself and is now able to hold a daily dialogue
with foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, while continuing his English course, Geli also
began learning the Japanese language.
</P>
<P>
"I'm still young and should do something useful," says Geli, "
and foreigners are often surprised when I start to talk in English.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief, EC Leader Meet on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Friday afternoon met with Leon Brittan, vice-president
of the European Commission (EC), with both sides agreeing that
diplomatic efforts should be intensified and ways should be found
for the refugees to return in safety and security.
</P>
<P>
"They agreed that the current situation in Kosovo was very
dangerous, diplomatic efforts needed to be intensified and ways
had to be found for the refugees to return under conditions of
safety and security," a U.N. official told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Besides, their "discussions focused on WTO (the World Trade
Organization), its interrelation with Bretton Woods institutions
and the role of the developing countries in the on-going trade and
finance discussions," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, Annan has four separate meetings with the U.N.
permanent representatives of China, France, Russia, the United
Kingdom and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Annan "believes that only when there is unity of purpose and
effective coordination, can progress be made," said a U.N.
spokesman after the four meetings. Annan met with the British and
U.S. ambassadors at the same time.
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon, Annan also met with Vladislav Jovanovic,
charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations,
who told reporters afterwards that the United Nations should take
actions to "condemn and stop" the NATO aggression, which has
killed 600 civilians and wounded 5,000 others in Yugoslavia since
it began on March 24.

<HEADLINE> Kodak 1st Quarter Profit Rises 9.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Eastman Kodak's first quarter
profit rose 9.3 percent as its sales grew for the first time in
nine quarters due to cost cuts, according to Bloomberg Friday.
</P>
<P>
The biggest U.S. film maker earned 259 million U.S. dollars
from operations, up from 237 million dollars in the first quarter
1998. Sales rose 6.5 percent to 3.1 billion dollars from 2.91
billion dollars a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Sales in the domestic market rose 13 percent while they also
jumped in emerging markets such as China, where sales grew 45
percent by beating its rival Fuji Photo Film, Kodak said.
</P>
<P>
The Rochester-based company reduced some 80 million dollars
from operating costs this year through improved manufacturing
productivity and spending cuts in research and administration.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Wants Explanations on NATO's Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Party of Social Democracy
of Romania, the largest in opposition, Friday urged the Ministry
of Defense to provide explanations on the two extra fuel tanks
dropped from a NATO F-15 aircraft in Timis county on the Yugoslav
border.
</P>
<P>
"These explanations are all the more necessary as rumor has it
that NATO air planes have flown over the Romanian territory at
least twice so far, and NATO officers would allegedly conduct air
traffic surveillance and control operations in Timisoara, the
capital city of Timis county, said a communique released by the
party.
</P>
<P>
"If official confirmation is produced in this respect," the
communique stressed, "it will mean that these actions have
by-passed the Romanian Parliament's approval, which states that
the Romanian air space can only be used in emergency cases, not
for military actions."
</P>
<P>
The Party of Social Democracy called Minister of Defense Victor
Babiuc to put forth a thorough report before the two chambers of
parliament in connection with the incident.
</P>
<P>
As reported earlier, two fuel tanks identified as belonging to
a F-15 aircraft of the U.S. Air Force were found Thursday on a
field some 1.5 km from the border with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The tanks "were released over the Yugoslav territory, but were
drawn to our country's territory due to inertia," according to the
Romanian interior minister.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Reconfirms Year 2000 Safety of Flight Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Boeing said Friday that it
has successfully completed Year 2000 (Y2K) flight demonstrations
of its commercial airplanes.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations have reconfirmed earlier laboratory and
simulation studies that showed there are no safety of flight
issues related to the Y2K date rollover, the Seattle-based
aircraft manufacturer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Friday, president of Boeing's commercial airplanes group Alan
Mulally was on board a one-hour demonstration flight of a Boeing
Next-Generation 737-600, completing the nine-airplane-model test
program.
</P>
<P>
Prior to departure from Seattle's Boeing Field, the flight crew
set the captain's clock forward to December 31, 1999; then during
the hour-long flight, let it roll over to January 1, 2000. The
statement said that there were no effect to the flight deck and
nothing out of the ordinary occurred. Seattle's Air Traffic
Control Center reported solid airplane-radar surveillance and
communications throughout the event.
</P>
<P>
While in flight, the company also tested a wide range of
possible computer-data anomalies such as February 29, 2000, which
is a leap year. None were experienced, the company said.
</P>
<P>
In its demonstration of current production models, Boeing
conducted flight tests on the 717, Next-Generation 737, 737
Classic, 747, 757, 767, 777, MD-11 and MD-80/90 airplanes.
Avionics and other systems tested on board included management
computers made by its suppliers, the company said.
</P>
<P>
An earlier Boeing supplier assessment showed that only three
equipment items were sensitive to the Y2K date on some Boeing
airplanes, but none affected safety of flight or operation of the
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The 737-600 in Friday's demonstration is scheduled to be
delivered to Scandinavian Airlines System before the end of April,
Boeing said.

UNITED NATIONS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior Yugoslav diplomat
Friday said that Belgrade did not accept the deployment of any
foreign troops in Kosovo, a Serbian province, because the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) is a sovereign and independent
country.
</P>
<P>
Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission

aggression, the FRY Government rejected the deployment of any

<HEADLINE> Oceans, Seas on Agenda of U.N. Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming session of
the U.N. Commission on Sustainable Development will focus on
oceans and seas, and problems facing small island states in
addition to sustainable tourism, U.N. sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations sees urgent action needed to address the
unsustainable exploitation of marine life, the protection of
fragile marine and coastal ecosystems, and the devastating effects
of land-based pollution.
</P>
<P>
In the past 14 months, over 40 percent of the globe's coral
reefs have been hit by severe to catastrophic bleaching, which
weakens corals, said the U.N. Economic and Social Council which
announced Friday the issues to be discussed at the April 19-30
session.
</P>
<P>
It is not yet clear whether the high temperatures responsible
for this alarming trend are caused by the El Nino phenomenon or by
man-made global warming.
</P>
<P>
During the session, the Commission will act as the preparatory
body for the General Asembly's two-day special session to be held
from 27-28 September to undertake a comprehensive review of a
program of action for small island developing states.
</P>
<P>
The program of action was adopted in Barbados in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The countries are facing the impact of climate change and
sea-level rise, marine pollution from sewage, spills and ship
wastes, and shortages of fresh water as demands grow, especially
from tourism.
</P>
<P>
On sustainable tourism, delegates will take Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's report as reference in which he calls for tourism
benefits to be shared by communities and local governments instead
of "a very few, large corporations" as witnessed currently,
according to a U.N. background release.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Two Credits for Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Friday announced the approval of two credits totaling
220 million U.S. dollars for Jordan in support of the country's
economic adjustment and structural reform program for 1999-2001.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, about 174 million dollars is available under a
three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) credit and about 46
million dollars is being provided under the IMF's Compensatory and
Contingency Financing Facility (CCFF), the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan will have immediate access to credits amounting to 61
million dollars, including the 46 million dollars from the CCFF,
it added.
</P>
<P>
The growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) in Jordan
slowed to an annual average of about 1 percent in 1996-98, partly
because of constraints on exports to neighboring countries and the
end of the post-Gulf war construction boom.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the fiscal deficit had widened to about 10 percent
of GDP by 1998, instead of being reduced as envisaged in Jordan's
previous EFF-supported program, partly reflecting the slowdown in
economic activity.
</P>
<P>
The current three-year EFF-supported program is designed to
promote a gradual recovery in the growth rate of real GDP to 3-4
percent, the maintenance of Jordan's low inflation rate, and a
substantial strengthening in official foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
The overall fiscal deficit will be reduced to 4 percent of GDP
by 2001, which will lead to a significant reduction in the ratio
of public debt to GDP, the IMF said.

<HEADLINE> River Fleet Hardly Hit By Danube Traffic Blockage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian river fleet
operations have been brought to a sad state after the bombing and
dropping of three bridges in Yugoslavia, which blocked the traffic
upstream and downstream of Yugoslavia, River Danube port official
Ilie Stan said.
</P>
<P>
Ilie Stan said that 106 barges of 1,100-2,000 ton capacity and
13 tugboats have been blocked in the upstream Danube sector of
Hungary, Austria and Germany. In the downstream of Yugoslavia, as
many as 60 vessels loaded with merchandise bound for Hungary,
Austria and Germany have been stuck.
</P>
<P>
Romanian naval companies register huge losses from the traffic
blockage, with the prospect of a complete standstill in the
international sector and an impending bust looming large at the
horizon, Stan said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, "the catastrophic effects also touch on the
Romanian ports by the Danube and the Constanta port by the Black
Sea, where approximately 3.6 million tons of goods from and to
Central Europe can no longer be shipped."
</P>
<P>
The Romanian foreign trade is in terrible pain, as more than
800 million tons of goods can no longer be routed by the Danube,
which carries the cheapest traffic, according to Stan.
</P>
<P>
Stan said that main naval companies in the Danube ports of
Galati, Giurgiu, Braila and Calarasi reported losses of 24.6
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Romania has the largest river fleet in Europe, with 1,100
non-propelled vessels of 1,000-3,000 tons and over 180 tugboats of
500-4,600 hp. International river traffic contributes 75 percent
of the Romanian river fleet capacity.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- About 200 demonstrators Friday
rallied in the rain in Dearborn, Michigan, demanding that NATO
stop its bombing in Yugoslavia as President Bill Clinton called
for support for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Outside the Fairlane Club in the town, demonstrators blew
whistles and chanted against NATO while standing in the rain with
signs demanding a halt to the bombing when Clinton's motorcade
rolled by.
</P>
<P>
"Serbia today, who next?" one sign read. "America wake up, stop
bombing," said another, according to an Associated Press report.
</P>
<P>
Across the street, Clinton was addressing a fund-raising event,
which would contribute half a million U.S. dollars to the
Democrats. Clinton urged the Americans to stand united.
</P>
<P>
The event marks a return to the campaign trail and normal
business in the White House. He canceled a fund-raising swing
through Western states at the outset of the conflict in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The White House had struggled to return to normal business
after the bombing began.
