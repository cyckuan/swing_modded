Agassi upsets Sampras

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Andre Agassi kept his impressive run going while
keeping Pete Sampras from staying No. 1.
	   The eighth-seeded Agassi beat the top-seeded Sampras 6-7 (7-5),
6-1, 6-2 Friday night in the quarterfinals of the dlrs 2.45 million
du Maurier tennis tournament.
	   Agassi, a three-time champion in this event, has won four
tournaments this season, including both he has entered the last two
weeks, improving his ranking more than 100 spots to No. 11.
	   His latest win will prevent Sampras from staying on top of the
ATP world rankings. Sampras needed to win this event for the first
time to maintain his No. 1 ranking. That spot will now be taken by
Chile's Marcelo Rios, who briefly held the No. 1 spot earlier this
year when Sampras was struggling to find his game.
	   In Saturday's semifinals, Agassi will face the winner of the
quarterfinal match between fourth-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov of
Russia and No. 6 Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands, while
third-seeded Patrick Rafter of Australia will meet No. 7 Tim Henman
of England.
	   Each of the players had to play two matches Friday because of
rain on Thursday.
	   Agassi advanced with a 2-6, 7-5, 6-3 victory over No. 10 Goran
Ivanisevic of Croatia, who lost the match when he double-faulted on
match point.
	   Sampras, after a three-hour rain delay, appeared sluggish, tired
and frustrated in a 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 victory over Tommy Haas of
Germany.
	   In the quarterfinals, Rafter defeated No. 5 Jonas Bjorkman of
Sweden 6-3, 6-2, while Henman beat unseeded Daniel Vacek of the
Czech Republic 6-3, 5-7, 6-2.
	   Earlier Friday, Rafter beat fellow Australian Mark
Philippoussis, the 14th seed, 6-3, 6-3.
	   After committing numerous unforced errors in the first set
against Haas, Sampras took control of the match with an early break
in the second set.
	   ``It's just a few points that cost me the first set,'' Haas
said. ``In the second he had the momentum going, and it's tough to
come back against an opponent like Pete.''
	   Haas, ranked 41st in the world, attacked Sampras with passing
shots that left the American standing at the net.
	   Sampras came up with big shots at the right time. He served 11
aces and had 34 winners to 18 for Haas, but made 21 unforced error
to the German's 19.

Annan doubtful about Angolan peace prospects

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Discouraged by the refusal of former
Angolan rebels to disarm, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has
expressed doubt about the prospects for peace in Angola.
	   ``The country continues to drift towards full-fledged
hostilities, despite the renewed efforts of the international
community to avoid a precipitous turn of events,'' he said.
	   Annan's comments, which came in a report released Friday in New
York, seemed to represent an abrupt shift in his views.
	   Earlier Friday, he said he was optimistic that his special envoy
to Angola could rescue the country's fragile peace process.
	   ``The talks have gone well,'' Annan said then, referring to the
meetings held earlier this week by his special envoy, Lakhdar
Brahimi, with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas
Savimbi, leader of the former rebel group UNITA. Annan spoke after
arriving at Porto airport, 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of
Lisbon, for a five-day visit to Portugal.
	   But he later expressed frustration that UNITA had yet to fulfill
its commitment to demobilize and to stop its attacks on
government-controlled areas.
	   Annan also called on the Angolan police to ``refrain from
practices inconsistent with its status.''
	   He warned that failure to comply would lead the United Nations
to consider withdrawing the U.N. Observer Mission in Angola.
	   The United Nations sent Brahimi to Angola last Friday on an
emergency mission triggered by fears of an imminent return to civil
war, four years after a U.N.-brokered deal sealed a tenuous peace.
	   Annan said the U.N. Security Council would be discussing
Brahimi's report on his Angolan mission on Monday. He said he hoped
the council would extend the mandate of the U.N. mission monitoring
the peace process, which is due to run out Aug. 15.
	   Annan arrived in Portugal to attend a U.N-sponsored
international conference on youth policy. He was also to meet
officials close to peace efforts in Algeria and the former
Portuguese colonies of Angola, Guinea-Bissau and East Timor.
	   Annan's arrival had been postponed for 24 hours due to
Thursday's emergency Security Council meeting in New York to
discuss Iraq's new restrictions on U.N. weapons inspectors. Annan
did not comment on Iraq.
	   Annan's first engagement in Portugal on Friday took him to the
closing ceremony of a U.N.-organized World Youth Forum in the
northern city of Braga.
	   The Forum's recommendations to a ministerial conference on youth
policy beginning Saturday in Lisbon are expected to include
creation of a special rapporteur for youth at the U.N. and a
commitment from all states to elaborate a national youth strategy.
	   Annan's Saturday agenda included a meeting with former
Portuguese president Mario Soares to discuss the findings of the
recent high-level mission to Algeria investigating the roots of the
political violence rocking that country.
	   The mission has yet to release its findings.

Kabila seeks support from African leaders as rebellion spreads

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ With a Tutsi rebellion apparently
sweeping into Congo's dense jungle interior, President Laurent
Kabila traveled outside the country in search of support from
African leaders to keep his 14-month-old regime from unraveling.
	   Within hours of his departure Friday, Kabila's troops rampaged
through parts of Kinshasa, looting shops and harassing ethnic
Tutsis _ an act of retaliation tied to widespread beliefs that
Tutsis are leading the fight to topple Kabila.
	   ``In the army the soldiers are very unhappy,'' said a senior
police commander with the city's intelligence branch. The officer,
who patrolled the streets to stop the looting, spoke on condition
of anonymity.
	   Troops who weren't stealing from stores or pestering civilians
roamed the streets questioning pedestrians and manned checkpoints
at intersections.
	   Kabila's decision to travel to Victoria Fall, Zimbabwe _ for a
hastily called meeting of seven regional heads of state to discuss
the crisis in Congo _ came just days after renegade troops waged
gun battles in two army barracks on Kinshasa's west side.
	   But the Congolese president was served a warning by one of his
neighbors, Rwanda, which Congo has accused of inciting the emerging
civil war and has threatened with attack: Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu declared Friday that his country will ``hit back'' if
Congo strikes its forces.
	   Rwanda on Friday denied involvement in the uprising, saying
Kabila's accusations were simply an effort to find a scapegoat for
disenchantment with his government.
	   Rwanda and Congolese Tutsi fighters, called Banyamulenge, backed
Kabila last year in his eight-month march across the country and
ouster of the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, but they have since
grown disaffected. Among other things, they accuse him of failing
to contain Rwandan Hutu rebels launching attacks from inside Congo.
	   The rebellion against Kabila took a violent turn this week. In
the eastern region of Kivu, the rebels have been pushing into the
interior from the Rwandan border, capturing several key towns. On
the other side of the country, rebels appear to be marching inland
toward Kinshasa from Kitona, a small village and military camp near
the Atlantic coast.
	   In Geneva, the United Nations human rights agency condemned the
attacks on Tutsi neighborhoods in Congo and urged Kabila to provide
better security in Kinshasa, the capital.
	   The U.S. State Department expressed similar concern. Speaking in
Washington, spokesman James Foley said the reports from Congo
suggest that Tutsis and possibly civilians of other ethnicities in
Kinshasa ``are being rounded up, detained, beaten, tortured and
killed because of their ethnicity.''
	   The apparent revenge attacks on Tutsis reflect a growing
instability in Kinshasa and elsewhere in Congo amid displeasure
with Kabila's short rule, which critics say is marked by corruption
and mismanagement. The United States and several European countries
have told their citizens to avoid traveling to the central African
country.
	   The disintegrating situation in Congo is a dramatic turn for
Kabila, who was hailed as a hero when he took over the country 14
months ago. His presidency and government faltering, Kabila earlier
Friday traveled to his former rebel base of Lubumbashi where he
hoped to recapture some of that past glory and sorely needed
backing.
	   There, the Congolese president met South African diplomats,
according to South Africa's public SABC television, although Congo
officials would not allow foreign journalists to witness the talks.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Terrorist bombings at U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania blew apart buildings and buses, trapping people
under slabs of concrete and twisted steel that rescuers cleared
with cranes, blow torches and bare hands.
	   At least 82 were killed and more than 1,700 injured, officials
said as dawn broke Saturday. Dozens of people were still missing,
however, and the death toll was expected to rise, they said.
	   The suspected car bombings occurred 700 kilometers (450 miles)
from each other but just minutes apart on Friday, turning busy
streets in two African capitals into bloody piles of concrete and
knots of steel.
	   ``This appears to have been a very well-coordinated, very
well-planned attack _ clearly not the work of amateurs,'' U.S.
National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley said in
Washington. No one has claimed responsibility.
	   The blast in Nairobi occurred at about 10:35 a.m. (0735 GMT)
Friday, toppling a crowded building toward the embassy and a street
packed with cars, trucks and buses. At least 75 people were killed
and 1,643 wounded there, Red Cross and ambulance officials said.

China anxiously waits for possible flood diversion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Flood workers struggled Saturday to plug a major
breach along China's raging Yangtze River, while officials upstream
waited anxiously to see whether they would be ordered to inundate
the lands and homes of hundreds of thousands of people to safeguard
cities.
	   Some 330,000 people had been evacuated from an area in central
Hubei province that would be flooded if the government gave the
last-ditch order to divert water away from the Yangtze to protect
its weakened embankments.
	   Those embankments protect rich farmland and cities, including
Wuhan with 7 million people. But they threaten to give way after
weeks of torrential rain and record-high waters.
	   Officials fear that a flood crest surging down the river could
cause them to collapse.
	   One such levee partially collapsed Friday in the southeastern
city of Jiujiang, releasing a torrent of water that flooded parts
of the city of 500,000 people to a depth of two meters (nearly 7
feet).
	   Disaster workers sank eight boats to try to plug the 40-meter-
(132-foot-) wide breach, but water still gushed through and the
``situation has not yet been brought under control,'' said the
state-run Xinhua news agency.
	   Tens of thousands of people were drafted into efforts to plug
the gap with bags filled with coal, rice, soybeans or stones, the
report said.
	   To take the pressure off the Yangtze embankments, officials said
preparations were in place Saturday to open floodgates, or even
dynamite a dike, to divert waters into Hubei's Jingjiang flood
plain, from where 330,000 people had been evacuated. The move would
require the approval of China's State Council, or Cabinet.
	   ``We're prepared,'' said Chen Zhichao, director of the Jingjiang
Flood Diversion Management Bureau. ``When the order comes, we are
ready to carry it out.''
	   For the order to be given, water levels on the Yangtze would
have to reach the record high of 45 meters (148 1/2 feet) at the
city of Shashi, just north of the area that would be flooded,
Xinhua reported.
	   On Saturday morning, the river was just six centimeters (2.4
inches) below that mark, and was ``doomed'' to exceed it, Xinhua
reported.
	   The Jingjiang flood diversion area has not been used since 1954,
when floods killed more than 30,000 people.
	   So far this year, more than 2,000 people have died in summer
floods that began in June. The death toll continues to rise as
reports are received from flooded areas. The floods have affected
240 million people, a fifth of the population, to varying degrees,
the government says.

Landslides, floods kill at least two in Korea

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ New rainfall caused landslides and
floods that killed at least two and forced tens of thousands to
flee their homes around Seoul Saturday, just two days after massive
floods near the capital left 140 people dead.
	   Shin Yong-bal, 58, and his 20-year-old daughter were killed when
a landslide buried their home, said police in Songnam, a city just
south of Seoul.
	   A U.S. soldier was missing Saturday after a mudslide hit a
training ground south of Seoul, Col. Carl Kropf, a spokesman for
the U.S. military command in South Korea. Kropf refused to identify
the soldier.
	   Flood waters briefly submerged 3,000 homes in and around Seoul,
prompting city officials to close riverside roads and instruct
residents in low-lying districts to evacuate. Lightening knocked
out electricity in many villages.
	   With heavy rains causing dams upstream to discharge water from
swollen reservoirs, the Han River, which bisects the capital, rose
dangerously high, city officials said. Some tributaries overflowed.
	   Soldiers and rescue workers picking through flood debris for
missing people were ordered to retreat.
	   ``We are fighting with guerrilla rain showers. They come and
dump and go away. We can not predict where they will appear again.
It's impossible to predict how much more damage we have to
sustain,'' said Won Yoo-jin, a government relief official.
	   The deluge was brought by the same storm system that a week
earlier sent flash floods raging down mountain valleys in the
southern tip of the Korean peninsula, killing 67 campers and
leaving 29 missing and feared dead.
	   Sixty-four are still missing from the second wave of flooding
that struck the Seoul metropolitan area Thursday, which was the
worst flooding to hit South Korea in years.
	   The combined death toll from the flooding has reached 207,
including Saturday's deaths, and 90 are still missing in the worst
natural disaster to strike South Korea since a typhoon claimed
nearly 350 lives in 1987. Property damage estimates ranged from
dlrs 200 million to dlrs 2 billion.
	   About 1,000 U.S. soldiers were evacuated from several small
camps near the border with communist North Korea, said Sgt. Major
Billy Foster of the 2nd Infantry Division. Foster called flood
damage to the camps the worst ``I've seen in one place in my
30-year Army career.''
	   Tens of thousands of people returned to their sodden, mud-caked
homes around Seoul on Friday after being driven out by floods the
day before. But overnight, up to 20 centimeters (8 inches) of rain
fell, driving them again to higher ground.
	   The deluge wrecked entire villages. Streams were clotted with
overturned cars. Alleys were piled with sodden furniture pulled
from homes knee deep in water.
	   An estimated 20,000 people were left homeless, their dwellings
either completely submerged or swept away. Some 22,300 hectares
(55,000 acres) of farm land were covered by dark brown flood water.
	   About 10 tons of mortar rounds, antipersonnel land mines and
other ammunition were missing after flood waters swept through an
army depot near the border with North Korea, Defense Ministry
officials said.
	   U.S. military camps also lost an unspecified amount of small
arms ammunition to floods, the U.S. military command said.
	   Soldiers with mine detectors were combing the area, but
officials feared many small land mines may have been swept
downstream.

Low-key security in Myanmar; Suu Kyi party refuses meeting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The military regime placed a low-keyed
security clamp on Myanmar's capital Saturday as opposition groups
marked the 10th anniversary of a pro-democracy uprising that was
crushed by bullets and bayonets.
	   An increase in security checkpoints was visible in Yangon and
police armored cars _ which were not mounted with their guns _ were
stationed on one major road, witnesses said. But overall, Yangon
was calm. Schools and businesses were open, and there was no
panic-buying.
	   Anticipation that momentum may be building for change was seized
upon by opposition groups outside Myanmar, also known as Burma.
Hundreds of exiled students staged a protest outside the Myanmar
Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand.
	   Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel
Peace Prize, urged her countrymen in a videotaped message seen in
Bangkok on Friday to not give up hope that the military, which has
ruled since 1962, would relinquish power.
	   ``We will win,'' said Suu Kyi, who has spent most of the past
decade under house arrest or restricted to her home. ``Do not lose
heart. We will never give up, so don't give up.''
	   In a speech reported in official newspapers, Lt. Gen. Khin
Nyunt, a member of the ruling State Peace and Development Council,
accused internal traitors _ meaning Suu Kyi and her followers _ of
trying to break the country apart ``under the pretext of democracy
and human rights.''
	   The anniversary marks Aug. 8, 1988, the day that months of
simmering discontent in the capital exploded into nationwide
protest against military rule. The dictatorship changed leaders,
but the demonstrations were crushed. An estimated 3,000 people
died.
	   The anniversary of 8-8-88 is redolent with revolutionary
symbolism for Myanmar, where belief in numerology runs strong. In
the Myanmar calendar year 888 (1526 A.D.), a kingdom fell and two
kings died.
	   The anniversary comes two weeks ahead of the Aug. 21 deadline
that Suu Kyi has set for the army to finally turn over power to a
parliament elected in 1990. The military refused to hand over power
when the opposition captured 80 percent of the seats.
	   On Friday, Suu Kyi exercised one of the few powers left to her _
refusal _ when her National League for Democracy rejected an offer
by the government for NLD Chairman Aung Shwe to meet Deputy Home
Affairs Minister Brig. Gen. Myint Maung.
	   The invitation said Aung Shwe could bring any NLD officials he
liked _ except Suu Kyi and party vice chairman Tin Oo and Kyi
Maung. The party said it refused the talks because of the
restrictions and the unclear agenda.
	   Aung Shwe met government officials last year, but authorities
have steadfastly refused to meet Suu Kyi, whom they view as a tool
of foreign powers bent on colonizing Myanmar. The party accuses the
government of trying to divide its leadership.
	   The government issued a statement expressing ``regret'' and said
Aung Shwe had been ``invited to engage in frank and cordial talks
to develop a better understanding as well as confidence-building
between the two sides.''
	   Suu Kyi has also demanded the withdrawal of the government
security detail from her home. The government Friday that it was
prepared to comply and that talks were under way.
	   The personnel have been posted at her home at her request,
making the government responsible for her safety, but have also
been said by diplomats to monitor her movements and visitors.
	   Suu Kyi raised the profile of what has become a stagnant
conflict _ she demands dialogue, the government refuses _ by
engaging in a six-day standoff against authorities on a road
outside the capital.
	   Her car was eventually seized and she was driven home.
Recovering from dehydration, she has vowed to continue to press her
demands that the government open a dialogue with her.

Devaluation is latest move for antsy government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL ALEXANDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam's fast-growing economy is slowing
fast. Foreign investors are looking elsewhere amid fierce
competition for a shrinking pool of money. Unemployment is rising
and exports falling. Hoarding of dollars continues unabated.
	   And an increasingly nervous government that depends on
tight-fisted control is finding that while it can regulate its
exchange rate, it doesn't have much power to improve the economy
any time soon.
	   The state bank allowed the dong to depreciate by about 7 percent
Friday, its third decrease since the Asian economic crisis began 13
months ago.
	   The gradual cuts have been aimed at avoiding the sharp plunges
in currency values that hit neighboring countries like Indonesia
and Thailand so hard.
	   But just as with each previous devaluation, the latest one
failed to generate much excitement: Although the government insists
that each devaluation will be the last, few people believe it.
	   Every official effort to coax or force people to convert their
dollars into dong has failed to free up the billions of dollars in
cash that analysts estimate businesses and individuals have stashed
away. Vietnamese have long used dollars as a hedge against
inflation, and the greenback still serves as a parallel currency.
	   People don't have much faith that the dong has bottomed out.
With the supply of dollars drying up for foreigners _ they're still
available for local enterprises _ businessmen often bypass banks
and arrange their own informal currency exchanges over the phone.
	   Western bankers and some economists have been calling for a
sharp devaluation of the dong for months, noting that the regional
crisis provides the perfect face-saving excuse for Vietnam's
central bank, which also can blame a string of natural calamities.
	   The government has insisted that no major devaluation is pending
because it worries about higher inflation and the increased costs
of needed imports and payments on its dollar-denominated foreign
debt.
	   Although Vietnam says it hasn't been hit as hard as other Asian
countries, it's hard to tell for sure because many economic
figures, including the national budget, are state secrets, with
leaks punishable by jail.
	   A Labor Ministry official briefed reporters Thursday on the
unemployment situation but had no estimates of the current jobless
rate or how many people have been laid off this year. He said the
ministry relies on an annual survey of businesses that is under way
now.
	   The inability to deal with the currency problem and the rest of
the fallout from the regional problems has top officials trying to
reassure potential investors that they are undertaking real change
to jump-start stagnating reforms that started a decade ago.
	   But even local businessmen are getting tired of hearing mere
promises.
	   Some are so battered and frustrated that they talk about
increasing protectionism, which would directly clash with the
country's goal of joining the World Trade Organization as soon as
possible.
	   Realizing that things are likely to get worse before they get
better may make the government pragmatic enough to really start
slashing through the red tape that bedevils every businessman.
	   But Vietnam's troika leadership system of prime minister,
president and Communist Party leader relies on consensus, making
quick, decisive action difficult. And with no good blueprint for a
communist country switching to capitalism without also changing its
leadership, cautious steps are likely to continue.
	   In addition, the National Assembly, which is supposed to be
writing clear, concise revisions of often-contradictory laws, won't
meet again until October.
	   One sign of whether Vietnam is serious about opening up more to
the world will come next month when officials hold a sixth round of
talks with the United States on a bilateral trade pact. Such a deal
is considered a stepping stone to WTO membership.
	   In the meantime, there are ominous hints of some anti-foreigner
backlash as the government tries to find someone to blame.
	   A government newspaper recently issued a commentary on foreign
operations that criticized everything from the relatively high
salaries paid to foreign staff to the large advertising budgets
that foreign companies use to develop product loyalty.
	   Such complaints have been leveled against Procter and Gamble,
Coca-Cola and others _ which are portrayed as brutally forcing out
their local joint-venture partners _ because the costs eat into the
immediate profits that the Vietnamese investors expect.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Chanting slogans and waving posters of
Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, more than 300 exiled students from
Myanmar protested Saturday in front of the country's embassy for an
end to military rule.
	   The protest _ which was expected to be mirrored in other
countries hosting Myanmar exiles _ marked the 10th anniversary of a
nationwide anti-government uprising. The army eventually crushed
the unrest and thousands are believed to have died.
	   The anniversary comes as Suu Kyi and her National League for
Democracy are building pressure on the government ahead of an Aug.
21 deadline demanding they finally allow an opposition-dominated
parliament elected in 1990 to meet for the first time.
	   ``We see now that our leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, is moving more
strongly than ever before,'' said Gaw Minth, a coordinator of the
Bangkok protest. ``We believe that she will do something if the
request is ignored by the military.''
	   The protesters, mostly students who fled their homeland, also
known as Burma, after the crackdown 10 years ago, held up placards
reading: ``We want democracy.''
	   Gaw Minth said that 70 people will remain at the sit-in until
Aug. 21. If parliament is not convened, a hunger strike will
follow.
	   Gaw Minth is among thousands exiled students who left home to
seek refuge in Thailand when he was 17. He wept as he recalled the
killings he said he saw in the capital, Yangon.
	   ``I saw two men in their early 40s got shot in their chests,''
Gaw Minth said. ``I could hear the guns shooting from every
direction, but I don't know until now if any of the people I know
was killed.''
	   Ko Pauk, a spokesman for the All Burma Students Democratic
Front, a group of exiles that took up arms after the 1988 uprising,
said that he had been able to contact his family only three times
in the past 10 years.
	   ``It is just painful, but we realize that staying somewhere else
out of the country, we can work better and safer,'' Ko Pauk said.
	   Ko Pauk said he has been arrested and detained several times by
Thai police, and was once arrested, stripped and had 1,000 baht
(dlrs 25) confiscated while traveling on a train.

entertainment complex and a park, will be dlrs 110 million, the
Thanh Nien newspaper reported.
	   The second stage, forecast to start in 2001, would include a
21-story deluxe hotel and an office building.

Jinwen and three local companies.

Forest fires spread in Russian Far East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Another 10,00 hectares (25,000 acres) of taiga
have caught fire in Russia's Far East, bringing the total area on
fire to 172,000 hectares (425,000 acres), a news agency reported
Saturday.
	   Cedar, ash and other trees are being burned, ITAR-Tass said,
quoting Far East forest protection officials.
	   The Ministry for Emergency Situations in sending 50 brigades of
firefighters into the Komsomolsky region, brining to 1,500 the
number of people trying to put out the fires there.
	   An unusually dry winter and spring made the Far East more
vulnerable this year to the forest fires. Lack of funds has also
worsened the situation, and specialists say that without
significant rain, the fires may continue until winter.

Landslides, floods kill at least two in Korea

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ New rainfall caused landslides and
floods that killed at least two and forced tens of thousands to
flee their homes around Seoul Saturday, just two days after massive
floods near the capital left 140 people dead.
	   Shin Yong-bal, 58, and his 20-year-old daughter were killed when
a landslide buried their home, said police in Songnam, a city just
south of Seoul.
	   A U.S. soldier was missing Saturday after a mudslide hit a
training ground south of Seoul, Col. Carl Kropf, a spokesman for
the U.S. military command in South Korea. Kropf refused to identify
the soldier.
	   Flood waters briefly submerged 3,000 homes in and around Seoul,
prompting city officials to close riverside roads and instruct
residents in low-lying districts to evacuate. Lightening knocked
out electricity in many villages.
	   With heavy rains causing dams upstream to discharge water from
swollen reservoirs, the Han River, which bisects the capital, rose
dangerously high, city officials said. Some tributaries overflowed.
	   Soldiers and rescue workers picking through flood debris for
missing people were ordered to retreat.
	   ``We are fighting with guerrilla rain showers. They come and
dump and go away. We can not predict where they will appear again.
It's impossible to predict how much more damage we have to
sustain,'' said Won Yoo-jin, a government relief official.
	   The deluge was brought by the same storm system that a week
earlier sent flash floods raging down mountain valleys in the
southern tip of the Korean peninsula, killing 67 campers and
leaving 29 missing and feared dead.
	   Sixty-four are still missing from the second wave of flooding
that struck the Seoul metropolitan area Thursday, which was the
worst flooding to hit South Korea in years.
	   The combined death toll from the flooding has reached 207,
including Saturday's deaths, and 90 are still missing in the worst
natural disaster to strike South Korea since a typhoon claimed
nearly 350 lives in 1987. Property damage estimates ranged from
dlrs 200 million to dlrs 2 billion.
	   About 1,000 U.S. soldiers were evacuated from several small
camps near the border with communist North Korea, said Sgt. Major
Billy Foster of the 2nd Infantry Division. Foster called flood
damage to the camps the worst ``I've seen in one place in my
30-year Army career.''
	   Tens of thousands of people returned to their sodden, mud-caked
homes around Seoul on Friday after being driven out by floods the
day before. But overnight, up to 20 centimeters (8 inches) of rain
fell, driving them again to higher ground.
	   The deluge wrecked entire villages. Streams were clotted with
overturned cars. Alleys were piled with sodden furniture pulled
from homes knee deep in water.
	   An estimated 20,000 people were left homeless, their dwellings
either completely submerged or swept away. Some 22,300 hectares
(55,000 acres) of farm land were covered by dark brown flood water.
	   About 10 tons of mortar rounds, antipersonnel land mines and
other ammunition were missing after flood waters swept through an
army depot near the border with North Korea, Defense Ministry
officials said.
	   U.S. military camps also lost an unspecified amount of small
arms ammunition to floods, the U.S. military command said.
	   Soldiers with mine detectors were combing the area, but
officials feared many small land mines may have been swept
downstream.

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ An American daredevil soared over
the Argentine pampas in a balloon, streaking toward the South
Atlantic on the first leg of a hazardous quest to circle the world.
	   Hoping to become the first balloonist to round the globe,
Chicago stockbroker Steve Fossett lifted off late Friday from
Mendoza in western Argentina, starting an attempted 20,000-mile
(32,185-kilometer) odyssey.
	   With propane burners roaring, Fossett rode the 150-foot
(46-meter) balloon Solo Spirit into a moonlit sky as hundreds of
people cheered him on from a soccer stadium 600 miles (970
kilometers) west of Buenos Aires.
	   Circumnavigating the Earth in a balloon is one of aviation's
last unachieved feats. Fossett has charted a 14- to 18-day course
that would take him from west to east around the Southern
Hemisphere, mostly over oceans.
	   Fossett admitted before takeoff that this was his riskiest of
four attempts to circle the world, nine-tenths of the course being
over water.
	   ``You have to believe that you are going to succeed with this
flight because a water landing would be very dangerous,'' Fossett
said. ``I'm using the same capsule I've used for seven balloon
flights, and it's seaworthy.''
	   Andres Tricaza, 12, was in the crowd bidding farewell to the
helium and hot air balloon. ``It's the biggest thing I've seen in
my life! One day I would like to do something like this.''
	   Fossett's command center at Washington University in St. Louis
said the balloon was at 23,620 feet (7,200 meters) early Saturday,
cruising at 71 mph (114 kph), and would cross out onto the Atlantic
after daylight.
	   If all goes according to plan, the 54-year-old Fossett will
hazard a four-day crossing of the windswept South Atlantic toward
South Africa before flying onward to Australia and then east over
the Pacific back to South America.
	   A bone-chilling temperature of minus 50 degrees (minus 46
Celsius) was registered outside the balloon's capsule. But Fossett
was in a fleece-lined jacket within a closed, heated cabin.
	   Nonetheless, conditions were rugged in the 4 foot (1.22 meter)
by 7 foot (2.13 meter) capsule, which was crammed with
communications gear, batteries, water and enough military-style
rations to last days adrift should Fossett ditch at sea.
	   Two American flags fluttered from the capsule.
	   Competition is intense to achieve RTW _ ballooning parlance for
``Round the World'' _ and most attempts have been made in the
Northern Hemisphere.
	   Fossett's first attempt to circle Earth lasted just 36 hours,
cut short in January 1996 by winter storms. A year later, he set
the distance record: a 10,361-mile (16,674-kilometer), six-day
journey from St. Louis to Sultanpar, India. He landed after running
short of fuel while awaiting Libyan clearance.
	   On Jan. 5, 1998, Fossett ended another attempt, landed 5,802
miles (9,337 kilometers) away from his starting point of St. Louis
in a wheat field near Krasnodar, southern Russia.

Cambodian opposition leader uninterested in working with Hun Sen

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Opposition leader Prince Norodom
Ranariddh said Saturday that he cannot work with strongman Hun Sen,
winner of recent parliamentary elections, when a new government is
formed next month.
	   But Ranariddh left open the door to a coalition between his
royalist FUNCINPEC and Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party,
saying he would not stand in the way if his party votes for a
partnership.
	   Ranariddh, speaking to 500 supporters at FUNCINPEC headquarters,
said he did not trust the man who ousted him as co-premier in a
bloody coup a year ago and was declared victor in July 26 elections
the opposition said were marred by fraud.
	   ``In my heart, I do not want FUNCINPEC to join a coalition with
Hun Sen,'' Ranariddh said. ``I cannot work with Hun Sen. But it is
up to FUNCINPEC to decide.''
	   Ranariddh and Hun Sen became a co-prime ministers after
U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993, but the arrangement shattered
when Hun Sen seized power in fighting in the capital last year.
Both men have said they do not want another joint premiership.
	   The Cambodian People's Party on Wednesday was declared the
winner of the recent elections Hun Sen called to legitimize his
power, but lacks the two-thirds majority needed to form a
government on its own.
	   The opposition has alleged hundreds of irregularities and
refuses to recognize the election results pending investigations
and recounts. The official tally gives the CPP 64 of 122 National
Assembly seats, FUNCINPEC 43 and its opposition ally, the Sam
Rainsy Party, 15.
	   Hun Sen has invited both parties to join a coalition, but the
opposition has indicated it wants to have more than the token role
now being offered. Ranariddh said Saturday he will demand, at a
bare minimum, that the assembly chairmanship go to FUNCINPEC.
	   Ranariddh said he has not visited his father, King Norodom
Sihanouk, since election day because he fears the monarch will urge
him to join Hun Sen in the name of national reconciliation.
	   Relations between father and son have never been close, though
Sihanouk's popularity in the countryside has been a major factor in
FUNCINPEC's support in the past two elections.
	   Forming a coalition with the CPP will only serve to strengthen
Hun Sen's ruling party, which the prince predicted would come apart
within five years if left on its own.
	   The prince also warned that Hun Sen is trying to entice
opposition members to shift loyalties and join his party so that a
formal coalition will not be necessary.
	   ``I know you have financial difficulties, but please wait,''
Ranariddh said. ``Any member of parliament that sells out, I will
ask for the right to expel him from the party.''

Saddam says U.S. will reap nothing, urges Iran to normalize ties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein said Saturday the
United States will reap nothing but a ``harvest ... full of
thorns'' from its campaign against Iraq.
	   Addressing the nation on television to mark the anniversary of
the end of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, Saddam also urged Iran to
normalize relations with Iraq.
	   Saddam did not refer to his decision Wednesday to freeze
cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors, but he said the United
States and its allies would be misled if they thought they could
bring Iraq to its knees.
	   This is exactly what the Iranian government under the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini thought it could do in the war, but it
failed, Saddam said.
	   ``Those imposing aggression on Iraq ... and the unfair embargo
neglect this fact today,'' Saddam said, referring to the sweeping
sanctions imposed by the United Nations after Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
	   ``They are making the same mistake. Their harvest will be full
of thorns and the outcome will be a taste of bitterness.''
	   Saddam spoke two days after the U.N. Security Council declared
his freeze ``totally unacceptable'' and President Clinton said his
government would ``stop any and all efforts'' to ease sanctions on
Iraq unless it cooperates with U.N. arms inspectors.
	   The inspectors must declare Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction before the sanctions _ which include a ban on
export of most oil _ can be lifted.
	   Saddam said Iraq has the ``ability'' to stand up to the United
States in the same way that it withstood eight years of war against
Iran.
	   ``The Americans and their supporters have failed to grasp the
vitality of Iraq's ability to confront their tyrannical power,'' he
said.
	   Turning to Iran, Saddam said he hoped the country's present
leaders were not under the illusions of the war years.
	   ``We hope misconception will be dispelled ... so that hatred,
rancor and bigotry will be replaced by elements of love,'' he said.
``This is what we wish for Iran and we call on the Almighty to help
in this direction.''
	   Saddam said ``a known group'' in Iran was ``hesitant'' to
normalize ties with Iraq, despite his repeated pleas.
	   The same group was trying to deter Iranians from visiting Shiite
Muslim shrines in Iraq, he said.
	   Saddam did not identify the group, but was certainly alluding to
hard-liners in the Iranian hierarchy who oppose attempts by
reformist President Mohammad Khatami to improve Tehran's ties with
the world.
	   Saddam said any step by Iran to upgrade relations would met by
``all cooperation ... from the Arabs, with Iraq in front.''
	   Iran and Iraq maintain embassies in each other's capitals, but
they have not exchanged ambassadors since the envoys were recalled
during the war.
	   About one million Iranians and Iraqis were killed or wounded in
the war. Iran insists that Iraq is continuing to hold Iranian
prisoners of war, but Baghdad denies this.

Yankees sweep Royals in doubleheader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with night games. &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Despite resting several regulars, the New York
Yankees (82-29) pushed their record to 53 games over .500, sweeping
the Kansas City Royals 8-2 and 14-2 Friday in a day-night
doubleheader.
	   In the opener, David Cone (16-4) became the majors' first
16-game winner and Darryl Strawberry homered.
	   In the night game, rookie Shane Spencer went 5-for-5 with his
first two major league homers and David Wells (14-2) ran his home
record to 9-0 as the Yankees won their eight straight against
Kansas City. Bernie Williams and Chuck Knoblauch homered, and Luis
Sojo drove in three runs
	   Pat Rapp (9-11) was tagged for eight runs and 10 hits in 5 1-3
innings in the opener. Chris Haney (4-5) lost the second game.
 &UR; Mariners 6, Tigers 3 , 1st game
 &UR; Mariners 7, Tigers 1, 2nd game
	   In Detroit, Alex Rodriguez was 3-for-5 with his 34th homer as
the Seattle Mariners beat the Detroit Tigers 7-1 Friday night to
complete a doubleheader sweep.
	   In the first game, Raul Ibanez, recalled from the minors earlier
in the day, hit a tie-breaking two-run double in the eighth inning
in Seattle's 6-3 victory. The Mariners have won four of their last
five.
	   Ken Griffey Jr. was 1-for-5 with two RBIs in the second game
after going 1-for-3 in the opener. The Seattle star, the AL homer
leader with 41, hasn't homered in seven games.
	   Heathcliff Slocumb (2-4) pitched 1 2-3 shutout innings, and Mike
Timlin got three outs for his eighth save. Dean Crow (1-1) was the
loser.
	   In the second game, Brian Moehler (12-8) lost at home for the
first time in 10 decisions this season. Jamie Moyer (9-8) won for
the fourth time in five starts, allowing one run on eight hits in 6
2-3 innings.
 &UR; Indians 5, Devil Rays 1 &QC; 
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Dwight Gooden (4-6) won as he
pitched a regular season game in his hometown for the first time,
but Cleveland lost Jim Thome to an injury.
	   Thome, the AL's starting first baseman in the All-Star game,
broke a bone in his right hand when Wilson Alvarez (5-10) hit him
with a pitch in the seventh. Cleveland said Thome will be sidelined
4-to-6 weeks.
	   Gooden (4-6) allowed five hits and struck out a season-high six
in 6 1-3 innings. Jeff Manto called up from the minors earlier
Friday, had a homer and three RBIs.
 &UR; Athletics 7, Blue Jays 6
	   In Toronto, Ed Sprague, traded from the Blue Jays to the A's on
July 31, doubled to break a 2-all tie in the sixth in his return to
Toronto and Rickey Henderson homered for the second straight game.
	   Jimmy Haynes (8-4) started in place of Blake Stein, pushed back
a day to rest a tender shoulder. Haynes allowed two runs _ one
earned _ and five hits in 6 1-3 innings. Woody Williams (9-7) was
the loser.
	   Billy Taylor took over with a 7-3 lead in the ninth and nearly
blew it, walking Carlos Delgado with the bases loaded and allowing
a two-run single to Carlos Delgado. Mike Fetters then retired
pinch-hitter Felipe Crespo on a grounder for his fifth save.
 &UR; Red Sox 4, Rangers 3
	   In Arlington, Texas _ Juan Gonzalez hit a go-ahead sacrifice fly
in the fifth and Rick Helling outdueled Pedro Martinez for his 15th
victory in Texas' sixth straight win.
	   Martinez (15-4) struck out a season-high 13, but allowed four
runs, six hits and two walks in 6 2-3 innings.
	   Helling (15-6) allowed three runs and seven hits over six
innings, and struck out three and walked two to extend his
career-high for victories.
	   Gonzalez's sacrifice fly drove in Tom Goodwin for his major
league-leading 119th RBI.
 &UR; Orioles 16, Twins 9
	   In Minneapolis, Harold Baines had a go-ahead three-run homer and
a season-high five RBIs, and Brady Anderson had a career-high five
hits, including two homers, in Baltimore's victory at Minnesota.
	   Baines had a two-run single in the first and added his sixth
homer in the sixth, raising his AL-best average with runners on
base to .367.
	   Anderson, 5-for-6, had a two-run homer, a solo shot, two doubles
and four RBIs, which tied a season high. Baltimore won its fourth
straight and moved four games over .500 (59-55) for the first time
since April 25.
	   Jimmy Key (5-3) worked two-thirds of an inning in his first
regular-season relief appearance in 12 years. Key, on the DL from
May 24 to July 28 with left shoulder stiffness, had made 351
consecutive starts since May 8, 1986, when he was with Toronto.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Spurred by cries for help, rescue workers
used backhoes and bare hands Saturday to free people trapped under
mangled steel and concrete shattered by two terrorist bombings at
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The death toll rose to 82
before dawn.
	   ``Help me, help me. I have gone now,'' gasped the latest victim,
a Kenyan man buried in rubble, just before he died.
	   Just a few minutes apart, the suspected car bombings 700
kilometers (450 miles) from each other Friday turned busy streets
in two African capitals into bloody piles of concrete and knots of
steel.
	   The number of injured topped 1,700.
	   More than two dozen FBI agents and bomb examiners boarded U.S.
military flights for Africa within hours of the bombings to
investigate.
	   ``Our top priority at the scene is to determine the kind of
explosive device that was used and the kind of vehicle that carried
it there,'' FBI spokesman Frank Scafidi said in Washington.
``Knowing the kind of explosive and vehicle can be like a
fingerprint of who did it.''
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks.
	   ``This appears to have been a very well-coordinated, very
well-planned attack _ clearly not the work of amateurs,'' U.S.
National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley said in
Washington.
	   As dawn broke in Nairobi Saturday, rescuers could hear at least
three people calling out from inside a debris-choked elevator
shaft, plus a fourth person trapped nearby.
	   ``It is horrific to hear moaning, sighs and whimpers from under
the rubble when we can do so little to reach victims quickly,'' Red
Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe said.
	   The blast in Nairobi sent a crowded building toppling toward the
embassy and a street packed with cars, trucks and buses. At least
75 people were killed and 1,643 wounded there, Red Cross and
ambulance officials said.
	   At least eight Americans died in Kenya, U.S. Embassy spokesman
Chris Scharf said. The U.S. State Department said a child was among
those killed and five other Americans were missing.
	   More dead were expected to be found as debris is cleared.
	   Almost simultaneously, the U.S. Embassy in the Tanzanian
capital, Dar es Salaam, was shattered by an explosion in an
adjacent parking lot. At least seven people were killed and 72
hurt, officials said. It was not clear which bombing occurred
first.
	   No Americans were believed killed in Dar es Salaam.
	   Car bombs were believed to have caused both blasts, Kenyan and
Tanzanian officials said.
	   Working through the night beneath floodlights, rescuers in both
capitals used pick axes, shovels and ropes to clear rubble.
	   After an hour-long effort in Nairobi, one person was pulled
alive from the wreckage to cheers from the gathered crowd.
	   But another rescue attempt ended tragically.
	   Kenyan Sgt. David Kambi, an army engineer, said he struggled for
four hours to free a 40-year-old man named Gitau whose chest was
weighed down by a slab of concrete.
	   ``I told him, `Gitau we're going to help you,''' Kambi said. He
pleaded for help twice, then died, the officer said.
	   In Washington, President Bill Clinton said the United States
would bring the terrorists to justice ``no matter what or how long
it takes.''
	   The United States rushed medical supplies and investigators to
both countries as governments throughout the world condemned the
bombings and offered help. The Kenyan government declared five days
of mourning and cancelled all social activities such as music
festivals and school dramas.
	   The bombings were the first major international terror attacks
against the United States since a June 25, 1996, truck bomb outside
a housing complex in Saudi Arabia killed 19 Americans. More than
500 people were injured in that explosion.
	   Friday's blast in Kenya damaged at least 53 buildings, severed
phone and power lines, shattered windows as far as 10 blocks away,
and sent black smoke into the sky. Several people aboard two
passing buses were killed by shrapnel, witnesses said. Bloodied
clothing and papers lay scattered around.
	   Bodies dangled out of windows in a charred bus as crumpled cars
smoldered nearby. Police helicopters hovered, some evacuating the
seriously injured.
	   In Dar es Salaam, cranes gingerly peeled away layers of wreckage
searching for survivors.
	   Officials in the United States, Kenya and Tanzania refused to
speculate on who was responsible.
	   The Islamic Jihad vowed last week to strike American interests
because some of its members had been arrested in Albania, according
to a report Thursday in Al-Hayat, a daily Arabic language newspaper
published in London.
	   Several groups use the name Islamic Jihad. This one is
considered the successor to groups that assassinated Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
	   One suspected terrorist being considered is exiled Saudi
dissident Osama bin Laden, U.S. officials said. Bin Laden has
threatened a holy war against U.S. troops and Americans.
	   He also is suspected of backing other terrorist acts including
the 1996 attack in Saudi Arabia.
	   A man was seen being taken into custody at the Nairobi bombing
scene. Witnesses said he spoke Arabic, but police would not
comment. His connection, if any, to the bombings was not known.
	   Security was tightened at other U.S. embassies worldwide.
	   The U.S. ambassador to Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, was cut on the
lip. The newly confirmed ambassador to Tanzania, Charles Stith, had
not yet arrived in the country.
	   Neither country has a history of international terrorist
attacks. Both embassies were considered low risk, perhaps making
them attractive targets.
	   Compared with other African countries, foreigners can enter and
leave Kenya and Tanzania with relative ease, possibly making it
easier for terrorists to attack.

U.S., Russia conclude naval exercises marked by protests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ Russian and American sailors on
Saturday wrapped up two days of joint military exercises, saying
they were a success despite protests by communists and nationalist
groups.
	   More than 1,200 participants from the U.S. 7th Fleet and
Russia's Pacific Fleet took part in the ``Cooperation at Sea''
exercises designed to practice responses to a natural disaster.
	   U.S. Rear Adm. Harry Highfill called the exercises ``very
successful.''
	   Russian Rear Adm. Nikolai Temerev said at a joint news
conference they ``achieved all goals we had planned for and we are
quite satisfied.''
	   The exercises were originally scheduled to be held on the
outskirts of Vladivostok, a port city in Russia's Far East. But
after four days of protests prior to the arrival of the USS
Germantown, organizers moved them to Cape Klyerka, 100 kilometers
(60 miles) southwest of Vladivostok.
	   The protesters accused the United States of practicing an
invasion of Russia. Some opponents threatened to continue their
protest by blocking the maneuvers with small fishing vessels.
	   ``It is the right of a free nation to protest and this doesn't
concern us,'' Highfill said. ``When we come out of other ports, we
see similar protests occasionally.''
	   This was the third time since 1994 that the U.S. 7th Fleet and
Russia's Pacific Fleet have held joint exercises.
	   Temerev said that barring any financing problems, Russian forces
will participate in similar exercises in American waters in 1999.
	   The USS Germantown is scheduled to leave Vladivostok on Monday.

Thai mother with HIV becomes drug dealer after losing factory job
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Police have arrested an HIV-positive
woman who turned to amphetamine-trafficking for money to feed her
three children after she was shunned at her former workplace.
	   Police said Saturday that Ratchada Chenchom had lost her factory
job in Lamphun in northern Thailand after her employers and
co-workers discovered she had the AIDS virus.
	   Ratchada, who said she had contracted the disease from a husband
who died three years ago, told police she had no choice but to sell
amphetamines to support her children.
	   Ratchada was arrested in possession of 279 amphetamine tablets,
police said.
	   Amphetamine use is a mushrooming social problem in Thailand. The
government recently stiffened the penalties to be as severe as
those for heroin trafficking, which can bring the death penalty.

Hong Kong officials confident they can defend currency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong officials said Saturday they cannot
prevent speculative attacks on the territory's currency, but vowed
to make sure any such efforts do not force a devaluation of the
Hong Kong dollar.
	   Speculators were reported to be active in the currency market
this week, betting against the Chinese territory's ability to
maintain a long-standing peg of 7.80 Hong Kong dollars to the
United States dollar.
	   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang told reporters Saturday that
more speculative currency moves were likely. He insisted they would
fail, however.
	   ``If we have a government position, especially on maintaining
the confidence in _ and the ability of defending _ the Hong Kong
dollar, we will overcome every time,'' he said.
	   The comments followed a week of nearly continuous bad economic
news out of Asia.
	   Fears of a vicious circle of currency devaluations sent stock
markets lower throughout the region. Hong Kong was at the center of
the volatile trading, with its benchmark Hang Seng stock index
falling 12 percent.
	   This speculation against the Hong Kong dollar appeared to be
based on an assumption that the Japanese yen would continue to fall
vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar, forcing China to devalue its currency to
boost the competitiveness of exports.
	   The dollar extended its recent rally against the yen on Friday
after Japan's new prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, failed to announce
any bold new economic initiatives in a key policy address.
	   Regional currency markets quivered earlier in the week after a
plunge on Wall Street Tuesday, which heightened concerns about the
impact of the Asian crisis on the U.S. economy _ a major market for
Asian-made goods.
	   Joseph Yam, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,
which serves as the quasi-central bank, described the speculation
against the Hong Kong dollar as a ``severe conspiracy.''
	   In comments quoted by the South China Morning Post newspaper, he
charged that speculators were coordinating their actions.
	   The Post said traders blamed most of the worldwide selling of
Hong Kong dollars, estimated at about dlrs 8 billion, on several
U.S. banks, which it did not identify.
	   Despite the flurry of activity, bankers and economists said
little about the fundamentals of Asian economies really had changed
during the week, and many argued that they Chinese and Hong Kong
currencies would hold.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Spurred by cries for help, rescue workers
used backhoes and bare hands Saturday to free people trapped under
tons of steel and concrete shattered by two terrorist bombings at
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   More than 100 had been found dead in the 24 hours after the
blasts, the Red Cross said.
	   ``Help me, help me. I have gone now,'' gasped one of the latest
victims, a Kenyan man buried in rubble, just before he died.
	   Just a few minutes apart, the suspected car bombings 700
kilometers (450 miles) from each other Friday turned busy streets
in two African capitals into bloody piles of concrete and knots of
steel.
	   It was not immediately known who was responsible.
	   The number of injured topped 1,700. At least eight Americans
died in Kenya, U.S. Embassy spokesman Chris Scharf said. The State
Department said a child was among those killed and five other
Americans were missing.
	   More than two dozen FBI agents and bomb examiners, plus 43 U.S.
Air Force troops arrived in Kenya aboard U.S. military flights to
investigate and help with rescue efforts.
	   ``Our top priority at the scene is to determine the kind of
explosive device that was used and the kind of vehicle that carried
it there,'' FBI spokesman Frank Scafidi said in Washington.
``Knowing the kind of explosive and vehicle can be like a
fingerprint of who did it.''
	   National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley said, ``This
appears to have been a very well-coordinated, very well-planned
attack _ clearly not the work of amateurs.''
	   A full day after the bombings at 10:35 a.m. (0735 GMT) Friday,
rescuers in Nairobi could hear two people calling out from inside a
debris-choked elevator shaft.
	   ``It is horrific to hear moaning, sighs and whimpers from under
the rubble when we can do so little to reach victims quickly,'' Red
Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe said.
	   The number of deaths in Kenya had reached ``more than 100 that's
for sure,'' she said.
	   The blast in Nairobi sent a crowded building toppling toward the
embassy and a street packed with cars, trucks and buses. At least
1,643 wounded there, Red Cross and ambulance officials said.
	   Almost simultaneously, the U.S. Embassy in the Tanzanian
capital, Dar es Salaam, was shattered by an explosion in an
adjacent parking lot. At least seven people were killed and 72
hurt, officials said. It was not clear which bombing occurred
first.
	   No Americans were killed in Dar es Salaam, hospital officials
said.
	   Car bombs were believed to have caused both blasts, Kenyan and
Tanzanian officials said.
	   Working through the night beneath floodlights, rescuers in both
capitals used pick axes, shovels and ropes to clear rubble.
	   After an hourlong effort in Nairobi, one person was pulled alive
from the wreckage to cheers from the gathered crowd.
	   But another rescue attempt ended tragically.
	   Kenyan Sgt. David Kambi, an army engineer, said he struggled for
four hours to free a 40-year-old man named Gitau whose chest was
weighed down by a slab of concrete.
	   ``I told him, `Gitau we're going to help you,''' Kambi said. He
pleaded for help twice, then died, the officer said.
	   In Washington, President Clinton said the United States would
bring the terrorists to justice ``no matter what or how long it
takes.''
	   Governments throughout the world condemned the bombings and
offered help. Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi declared five days
of national mourning, canceling all social activities including a
state-sponsored music festival.
	   The bombings were the first major international terror attacks
against the United States since a June 25, 1996, truck bomb outside
a housing complex in Saudi Arabia killed 19 Americans. More than
500 people were injured.
	   Friday's blast in Kenya damaged at least 53 buildings, severed
phone and power lines, shattered windows as far as 10 blocks away,
and sent black smoke into the sky. Several people aboard two
passing buses were killed by shrapnel, witnesses said. Bloodied
clothing and papers lay scattered around.
	   Bodies dangled out of windows in a charred bus as crumpled cars
smoldered nearby. Police helicopters hovered, some evacuating the
seriously injured.
	   In Dar es Salaam, cranes gingerly peeled away layers of wreckage
searching for survivors.
	   Officials in the United States, Kenya and Tanzania refused to
speculate on who was responsible.
	   A group calling itself the Islamic Jihad vowed last week to
strike American interests because some of its members were arrested
in Albania, according to a report Thursday in Al-Hayat, a daily
Arabic language newspaper published in London.
	   Several groups use the name Islamic Jihad. This one is
considered the successor to groups that assassinated Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
	   One suspected terrorist being examined in the wake of the
explosions is exiled Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, U.S.
officials said. Bin Laden has threatened a holy war against U.S.
troops and Americans.
	   He also is suspected of backing other terrorist acts including
the 1996 attack in Saudi Arabia.
	   A man was seen being taken into custody at the Nairobi bombing
scene. Witnesses said he spoke Arabic, but police would not
comment. His connection, if any, to the bombings was not known.
	   Security was tightened at other U.S. embassies worldwide.
	   The U.S. ambassador to Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, was cut on the
lip. The newly confirmed ambassador to Tanzania, Charles Stith, had
not yet arrived in the country.
	   Neither country has a history of international terrorist
attacks. Both embassies were considered low risk, perhaps making
them attractive targets.
	   Compared with other African countries, foreigners can enter and
leave Kenya and Tanzania with relative ease, possibly making it
easier for terrorists to attack.

Saddam says U.S. will reap nothing, urges Iran to normalize ties
</HEADLINE>
with Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein said Saturday the
United States will reap nothing but a ``harvest ... full of
thorns'' from its campaign against Iraq.
	   Addressing the nation on television to mark the anniversary of
the end of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, Saddam also urged Iran to
normalize relations with Iraq.
	   Saddam did not refer to his decision Wednesday to freeze
cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors, but he said the United
States and its allies would be misled if they thought they could
bring Iraq to its knees.
	   This is exactly what the Iranian government under the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini thought it could do in the war, but it
failed, Saddam said.
	   ``Those imposing aggression on Iraq ... and the unfair embargo
neglect this fact today,'' Saddam said, referring to sweeping
sanctions the United Nations imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   ``They are making the same mistake. Their harvest will be full
of thorns and the outcome will be a taste of bitterness.''
	   Saddam spoke two days after the U.N. Security Council declared
his freeze ``totally unacceptable'' and U.S. President Bill Clinton
said his government would ``stop any and all efforts'' to ease
sanctions on Iraq unless it cooperates with U.N. arms inspectors.
	   The inspectors must declare Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction before the sanctions _ which include a ban on
exports of most oil _ can be lifted.
	   Saddam said Iraq has the ``ability'' to stand up to the United
States in the same way that it withstood eight years of war against
Iran.
	   ``The Americans and their supporters have failed to grasp the
vitality of Iraq's ability to confront their tyrannical power,'' he
said.
	   Turning to Iran, Saddam said he hoped the neighboring country's
present leaders were not under the illusions of the war years.
	   ``We hope misconception will be dispelled ... so that hatred,
rancor and bigotry will be replaced by elements of love,'' he said.
	   Saddam said ``a known group'' in Iran was ``hesitant'' to
normalize ties with Iraq, despite his repeated pleas.
	   The same group was trying to deter Iranians from visiting Shiite
Muslim shrines in Iraq, he said.
	   Saddam did not identify the group, but was certainly alluding to
hard-liners in the Iranian hierarchy who oppose attempts by
reformist President Mohammad Khatami to improve Tehran's ties with
the world.
	   Saddam said any step by Iran to upgrade relations would met by
``all cooperation ... from the Arabs, with Iraq in front.''
	   Iran and Iraq maintain embassies in each other's capitals, but
they have not exchanged ambassadors since the envoys were recalled
during the war.
	   About one million Iranians and Iraqis were killed or wounded in
the war. Iran insists that Iraq is continuing to hold Iranian
prisoners of war, but Baghdad denies this.

Indonesia pulls more troops out of East Timor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia pulled out 600 combat troops
from East Timor on Saturday, bringing the number of soldiers
withdrawn from the disputed territory since last month to 1,300.
	   The withdrawal comes amid renewed diplomatic efforts to reach a
peaceful solution to a long-standing conflict in the former
Portuguese territory, which was invaded by Indonesia in 1975.
	   The pullout was ordered by Indonesian President B.J. Habibie as
part of an offer to grant limited autonomy to East Timor, which
Indonesian maintains is the country's 27th province.
	   The foreign ministers of Indonesia and Portugal held talks on
the initiative at the United Nations in New York this week.
	   All sides say they are optimistic that a solution can be
reached.
	   About 10,700 combat troops remain stationed in East Timor and
Col. Tono Suratman, Indonesian regimental military commander in the
territory's capital of Dili, said more might be withdrawn in the
future.
	   He said 300 marines and 300 elite army strategic troops left the
provincial capital on several navy ships on Saturday.
	   About 400 troops were withdrawn on July 28 and another 300 left
last Monday.
	   East Timor has endured decades of guerrilla warfare since
Indonesian took control of the territory, 2,000 kilometers (1,200
miles) east of Jakarta.
	   A small band of rebel fights regularly attack Indonesian troops,
who have been accused of widespread human rights violations.
	   On Friday armed forces commander Gen. Wiranto said Indonesian
troops would also be pulled out of another troubled corner of
Indonesia, the province of Aceh.
	   Islamic separatists have been fighting for independence there
and the army has also been accused of human rights abuses there,
including torture and arbitrary killings.

	   The U.S. ambassador to Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, was cut on the
lip. The newly confirmed ambassador to Tanzania, Charles Stith, had
not yet arrived in the country.
	   Neither country has a history of international terrorist
attacks. Both embassies were considered low risk, perhaps making
them attractive targets.
	   Compared with other African countries, foreigners can enter and
leave Kenya and Tanzania with relative ease, possibly making it
easier for terrorists to attack.

Top nuclear scientist shrugs off Indian antinuclear protests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's top nuclear expert shrugged off
antinuclear protests by Indians on Hiroshima Day, saying the
activists should instead shout slogans in Washington and Moscow, a
newspaper reported Saturday.
	   ``What I would like to tell our so-called intellectuals is that
they should worry about the 10,000 nuclear warheads manufactured by
the U.S. and the same number manufactured by the former Soviet
Union and put pressure on these governments to reduce them to the
zero-level,'' A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was quoted as saying by The Times
of India.
	   ``Then they should worry about creating a zero-level for
India,'' said Kalam, scientific adviser to the government.
	   An estimated 250,000 people including celebrities, writers,
factory workers and students held a three-mile (five-kilometer)
march in Calcutta on Friday, jamming the streets 53 years to the
day after the United States dropped an atom bomb on Hiroshima,
Japan. The protest was the largest in the world to mark the
occasion.
	   Indians also marched in several other cities to protest India's
nuclear weapons tests.
	   The May tests, together with tit-for-tat blasts by neighboring
Pakistan, raised fears of a nuclear conflict in South Asia. But
antinuclear protesters were thought to be in the minority in India,
where the tests were initially seen as a show of defiance against
regional rivals and Western powers.
	   The protests indicated that Indians' initial euphoria over the
testing has been tempered by the impact of heightened tensions with
Pakistan and economic sanctions imposed by the United States and
other countries. Spiraling food prices and electricity shortages
have dampened enthusiasm in the Indian capital.
	   But Kalam said he was unfazed by the economic sanctions and the
decision by several nations to suspend economic aid to New Delhi.
	   ``In retrospect, I would like to thank these nations for
imposing sanctions on us,'' Kalam was quoted as saying. ``It helped
us become self-reliant.''

China anxiously waits for possible flood diversion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds; UPDATES with details on plugging efforts in 5th-6th grafs,
police combing flood area in 10th graf, water level dropping in
10th-12th grafs, rain deaths in last graf; CLARIFIES dikes to be
blown in 2nd and 7th grafs.
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Flood workers struggled Saturday to plug a major
breach along China's raging Yangtze River, while officials upstream
anxiously awaited a possible order to deliberately inundate the
rural lands and homes of hundreds of thousands of people in order
to safeguard cities.
	   Some 330,000 people have been evacuated from an area in central
Hubei province that would be flooded if the government gives a
last-ditch order to dynamite dikes and divert water away from the
Yangtze to protect its weakened embankments downstream, officials
said.
	   Those embankments protect rich farmland and cities, including
Wuhan's 7 million people, but threaten to give way after weeks of
torrential rain and record-high waters. Officials fear a flood
crest surging down the river could cause them to collapse.
	   One such levee partially collapsed Friday in the southeastern
city of Jiujiang, releasing a deluge of water that flooded parts of
the city of 500,000 people to a depth of two meters (nearly 7 feet)
and prompted officials to urge residents to evacuate.
	   Disaster workers sank eight boats to try to plug the
40-meter-wide (132-foot) breach, the Xinhua state-run news agency
said. If shortages of stone and other filing materials can be
overcome, officials expected to stop the leak within 24 hours,
Xinhua said.
	   Among the materials used to soak up and stop the water were
coal, rice, sand and soybeans. More than 30,000 soldiers and
civilians were working to build dams to hold back the water, it
said.
	   To take pressure off the Yangtze embankments, officials said
preparations were in place Saturday to dynamite dikes and open
floodgates to divert waters into Hubei's Jingjiang flood plain,
from where 330,000 people had been evacuated. The move would
require the approval of China's State Council, or Cabinet.
	   ``We're prepared,'' said Chen Zhichao, director of the Jingjiang
Flood Diversion Management Bureau. ``When the order comes, we are
ready to carry it out.''
	   The Jingjiang flood diversion area has not been used since 1954,
when floods killed more than 30,000 people.
	   Military police and soldiers were combing the area Saturday to
ensure it was empty of people and to move out those who were
reluctant to leave, said a local flood official, who gave only his
surname, Tian. The area was placed under curfew Friday and only
military personnel were permitted to enter.
	   For the order for deliberate flooding to be given, water levels
on the Yangtze would have to reach the record high of 45 meters
(148.5 feet) at Shashi city, just north of the area that would be
flooded, Xinhua reported.
	   As the flood crest passed the city early Saturday morning, the
river peaked at a record 44.95 meters (148.3 feet) _ just five
centimeters (two inches) below the mark that could trigger the
order to blow dikes _ and then began to drop, Xinhua said.
	   ``However,'' Xinhua added, ``the flooding situation remained
severe.''
	   The Yangtze had not reached the 45-meter-mark as expected
because two smaller, secondary dikes downstream burst unexpectedly
Saturday, lowering the river's water level, it said.
	   So far this year, more than 2,000 people have died in summer
floods that began in June and have so far affected 240 million
people, a fifth of the population, to varying degrees.
	   The death toll continues to rise as the latest reports are
received from flood-ravaged areas.
	   At least 41 people were killed and 156 injured in rainstorms
which battered Chongqing city in southwest China on Thursday and
Friday, Xinhua said. It said 41 others were missing.

Ambulances stationed around Cairo to treat heat stroke victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ With temperatures hovering around 100
degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius), officials have ordered ambulances
stationed at key points around Cairo to aid heat stroke victims,
Al-Akhbar Al-Youm said Saturday.
	   About 100 ambulances will be kept at main intersections, gardens
and tourist sites, the paper reported, quoting health officials.
	   Cairo has suffered temperatures at or near 100 Fahrenheit for
more than three weeks, and scores of people have been hospitalized
for heat-related illnesses. Such temperatures are not unusual in
summer, but not for such an extended period.
	   Health Ministry officials have issued warnings against prolonged
exposure to the sun. In southern Egypt, where temperatures have
topped 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), at least one person has died of
heat stroke and dozens of others have been hospitalized.

Australia's Soviet spies endangered Americans in Pacific, authors
</HEADLINE>
say
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Intelligence gathered by Australians
serving as Soviet spies during World War II put the lives of
American military personnel at risk and jeopardized key U.S.
operations in the Pacific, according to the authors of a
newly-published book.
	   The authors, Australian academics Des Ball and David Horner,
based their conclusion on a detailed study of once highly-secret
material gathered from signals intercepted by American and British
intelligence services.
	   Details of the intercepted signals were released in the United
States in the early 1990s.
	   The new book, ``Australia's KGB Network, Breaking the Codes,''
will go on sale from Monday in Australia.
	   The authors say there were about 10 Australian members of a
Soviet spy ring which operated in Canberra during the war years.
Its key member was allegedly an Australian the Soviets code named
Klod, the Russian version of Claude.
	   His Soviet contacts reportedly included Semyen Makarov, a member
of the Russian intelligence service NKGB, a predecessor of the KGB,
who was then stationed at the Soviet Embassy in Canberra.
	   ``The information leaked through the the Soviet Embassy (in
Canberra) dealt with American operations in the Philippines and had
the potential to make the American task more difficult,'' Horner
told The Associated Press on Saturday.
	   ``This information was being used _ whether deliberately or
inadvertently _ contrary to Australian national interests, possibly
to the extent of putting the lives of Australian and American
servicemen at risk.''
	   The Australian spy network allegedly included a typist in the
office of Australia's external affairs minister, H.V. (Doc) Evatt;
a member of Australia's secret service and at least two well-placed
members of Australia's diplomatic service.
	   The information Klod gathered was passed to Moscow and reached
the Japanese in the Manchurian city of Harbin, where both the
Soviets and the Japanese had consulates during the war.
	   Horner said that he and Ball believe, but cannot prove, that
Stalin deliberately leaked the material gathered in Australia to
the Japanese.
	   ``It was in the Soviet's interest to prolong the fighting in the
southwest Pacific so as to enable them to enter the war after the
defeat of Germany,'' Horner said.
	   ``Such an action by the Soviet authorities would not have been
unusual.''
	   The authors said information passed along to the Japanese via
the Soviet-Australian spy connection included a decision by the
U.S. Pacific Fleet to delay a landing on the eastern tip of the
Bicol Peninsula on Luzon in the Philippines.
	   Also relayed was an American decision to invade the Camotes Sea,
northwest of the island of Leyte in the Philippines, and the
completion of an American torpedo boat base on Mindoro Island in
the Philippines, they said.

Indonesian government abandons lottery plan after Muslim protests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Pressure from Muslim groups has forced
the government to quash a plan to use a lottery for funding
Indonesia's National Sports Council, the Jakarta Post reported
Saturday.
	   Muslim clerics said the proposed lottery would have been a form
of gambling, which is forbidden under Islamic and Indonesian law.
	   Several years ago, the government abandoned a similar lottery
scheme after protests from Muslim groups.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim,
making it the world's most populous Islamic nation.
	   The latest lottery plan would have raised an estimated dlrs 8
million a year. Half would have been used to provide prizes and the
remainder was to have been spent of sports development and
administration.
	   Indonesian Social Services Minister Justika Baharsyrah ordered
the plan be dropped.
	   The Post said she announced her decision only a day after the an
influential group of Muslim clergy attacked the lottery plan.

Iranian agency says northern Afghan stronghold in Taliban hands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Taliban troops on Saturday captured the
northern stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif, the last major city not held
by the hard-line Islamic movement, the official Iranian news agency
reported.
	   ``Continuous explosions are being heard in the city and there
are sporadic acts of resistance in the streets,'' the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported from Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   ``Various districts are burning and a large number of houses
have been destroyed,'' the agency said.
	   The report could not be immediately confirmed from other
sources.
	   Mazar-e-Sharif was the capital of an anti-Taliban coalition that
included the administration of ousted President Burhanuddin
Rabbani.
	   It was the only major city outside the control of the Taliban,
who already rule more than two-thirds of Afghanistan.

	   The reports could not immediately be confirmed.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance has been under heavy pressure since
the Taliban captured its stronghold of Shebergan, about 100
kilometers (60 miles) west of Mazar-e-Sharif, last week.
	   Taliban forces, which appeared poised to take over the entire
country, have imposed a strict version of Islamic law in territory
they control. Since capturing Kabul in 1996, Taliban officials have
barred girls from school, confined most women to their homes,
forbade all music except religious songs and banned anything
published outside Afghanistan.
	   The anti-Taliban coalition is mostly made up of Afghanistan's
minority ethnic and religious groups, factions that sometimes fight
each other as well as the Taliban army.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Tutsi fighters ignored diplomatic efforts
to end their rebellion in eastern Congo on Saturday and vowed to
push forward to Kinshasa in their war against President Laurent
Kabila.
	   Having already captured several key cities in the Kivu region
near the border with Rwanda, the rebels announced a new set of
targets in western Congo, which would position them within 250
kilometers (150 miles) of the capital.
	   ``We want to remove President Kabila from power for the interest
of the people because he failed to rule them,'' rebel Radio Bukavu
said.
	   Kabila was meeting with regional heads of state in nearby
Zimbabwe on Saturday to seek out support for his troubled
14-month-old regime.
	   The rebels already control the cities of Goma and Bukavu and the
town of Kindu in eastern Congo, the radio said. Now their focus had
turned to extending their foothold along the western Atlantic
coastline.
	   The said they will push inland toward the town of Boma, on the
Angolan border. Earlier, the rebels seized the coastal town of
Muanda and it appears as though they were also in the nearby
village of Kitona.
	   In Kinshasa, Kabila's troops began reprisal attacks against
Congolese Tutsis. Banyamulenge Tutsis from the east along with
Rwanda soldiers are leading the rebellion.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia
on Saturday attacked Mazar-e-Sharif, the last major prize in its
war against a fractious northern alliance.
	   A Taliban spokesman reached at the government's military
headquarters in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar said the
attack on Mazar-e-Sharif had begun Saturday morning with jet
fighters bombing the area, but he said at midday that the city had
not yet fallen.
	   The capture of Mazar-e-Sharif would be a major blow to an
opposition pushed to a dwindling corner of northern Afghanistan and
would give the Taliban control of virtually all of Afghanistan.
	   `We are close to now conquering Mazar-e-Sharif,'' Taliban
spokesman Abdul Ahad Ghangeir said even as others were already
claiming a Taliban victory.
	   Ghangeir said the Taliban faced little opposition and that the
militia's enemies were retreating to the south.
	   The Iranian news agency IRNA reported the Taliban had captured
the city.
	   ``Continuous explosions are being heard in the city and there
are sporadic acts of resistance in the streets,'' the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
	   ``Mazar-e-Sharif is now under our control,'' said Maulvi Saeedur
Haqami, charge d'affaires at the Afghan embassy in Islamabad,
capital of neighboring Pakistan.
	   The reports could not immediately be confirmed.
	   Abdul Jabbar Naeemi, leader of an anti-Taliban group based in
neighboring Pakistan, said he had reports the Taliban had entered
the city and that troops were fighting in its streets.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance has been under heavy pressure since
the Taliban captured its stronghold of Shebergan, about 100
kilometers (60 miles) west of Mazar-e-Sharif, nearly a week ago.
	   The Taliban have imposed a strict version of Islamic law in
territory they control. Since capturing Kabul in 1996, Taliban
officials have barred girls from school, confined most women to
their homes, forbade all music except religious songs and banned
anything published outside Afghanistan.
	   The anti-Taliban coalition is mostly made up of Afghanistan's
minority ethnic and religious groups, factions that sometimes fight
each other as well as the Taliban army.

Landslides, floods kill at least five in Korea

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ After a brief reprieve mud slides and
floods in South Korea triggered by fresh rains killed at least five
people and forced tens of thousands to flee their homes Saturday,
just two days after massive floods near the capital left 140 people
dead.
	   Two U.S. Army soldiers were killed and 12 others were injured
when a mud slide engulfed their camp south of Seoul early Saturday,
Col. Carl Kropf, a spokesman for the U.S. military command in South
Korea, said.
	   Ten of those injured, all with the 304th Signal Battalion of the
U.S. 8th Army's 1st Signal Brigade, were hospitalized in stable
condition, Kropf said. He declined to give further details pending
investigation and notification of family members.
	   Tens of thousands of people returned to their sodden, mud-caked
homes around Seoul on Friday after being driven out by floods the
day before. But up to 40 centimeters (16 inches) of rain fell
Saturday, forcing them to flee again.
	   The combined death toll from the flooding has reached 210,
including Saturday's deaths, and 94 are still missing in the worst
natural disaster to strike South Korea since a typhoon claimed 350
lives in 1987. Property damage estimates ranged from dlrs 200
million to dlrs 2 billion.
	   Shin Yong-bal, 58, and his 20-year-old daughter were killed when
a landslide buried their home, said police in Songnam, a city just
south of Seoul. Another man was killed after falling into flood
water in Seoul, police said.
	   With more rain pounding the metropolitan area, 30,000 homes
remained submerged, the Home Ministry's Disaster Relief
Headquarters said.
	   At least two tributaries of the Han River, which bisects Seoul,
overflowed. Officials using loudspeakers were urging residents in
low-lying districts to evacuate. Lightening crisscrossed the Seoul
sky, disrupting electricity and telephone service and making the
evacuation more difficult.
	   With heavy rains causing dams upstream to discharge water from
swollen reservoirs, the Han River rose dangerously high, city
officials said. Riverside roads were closed.
	   Soldiers and rescue workers picking through flood debris people
still missing from Thursday's flooding were ordered to retreat to
higher ground.
	   ``We are fighting with guerrilla rain showers. They come and
dump and go away. We can not predict where they will appear again.
It's impossible to predict how much more damage we have to
sustain,'' said Won Yoo-jin, a government relief official.
	   The deluge was brought by the same storm system that a week
earlier sent flash floods raging down mountain valleys in the
southern tip of the Korean peninsula, killing 67 campers and
leaving 29 missing and feared dead.
	   About 1,000 U.S. soldiers were evacuated from several small
camps near the border with communist North Korea, said Sgt. Major
Billy Foster of the 2nd Infantry Division. Foster called flood
damage to the camps the worst ``I've seen in one place in my
30-year Army career.''
	   The deluge wrecked entire villages. Streams were clotted with
overturned cars. Alleys were piled with sodden furniture pulled
from homes knee deep in water.
	   Some 22,300 hectares (55,000 acres) of farm land were covered by
dark brown flood water.
	   About 10 tons of mortar rounds, antipersonnel land mines and
other ammunition were missing after flood waters swept through an
army depot near the border with North Korea, Defense Ministry
officials said.
	   U.S. military camps also lost an unspecified amount of small
arms ammunition to floods, the U.S. military command said.
	   Soldiers with mine detectors were combing the area, but
officials feared many small land mines may have been swept
downstream.

Singapore leaders begin to address row with Malaysia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore leaders have begun to openly address
the latest row with neighboring Malaysia after initially having
kept silent or directing responses through government ministries.
	   As Singapore prepares to marks 33 years of independence from
Malaysia on Sunday, leaders of the country have called on people to
stand firm against what is seen as unfair criticism from across the
border.
	   Manpower Minister Lee Boon Yang said Saturday that Singapore has
been subjected to many unkind and unsubstantiated allegations, and
urged citizens to defend their country's sovereignty, state-run
television reported.
	   His colleague Abdullah Tarmugi, Minister of Community
Development, added that the city-state was ``grappling with a
relationship turned sour with our nearest neighbor,'' and warned
that the row was a large and daunting challenge, The Straits Times
newspaper said Saturday.
	   Tarmugi, a prominent leader of Singapore's ethnic Malay
community, which comprises about 15 percent of the country's 3.1
million, predominantly Chinese populace, said relations with
Malaysia ``are now back to square one again.''
	   The two Southeast Asian neighbors have bickered for weeks over a
number of issues, each accusing the other of bad faith and reneging
on various deals. The most recent tiff involves the relocation of a
border immigration checkpoint for rail passengers.
	   Malaysia condemned the shift north to Woodlands Checkpoint, even
though it is much closer to Malaysia. It has kept its immigration
officers at the old railway station in the south, a move Singapore
has deemed unlawful.
	   Malaysia argues it should be allowed to keep its immigration
control at the original site because it owns the land under an old
treaty, and a flurry of accusations and harsh words from
Singapore's northern neighbor followed the move on August 1.
	   Singapore's Minister without Portfolio, Lee Boon Heng, was
quoted by The Straights Times as saying ``we find ourselves the
targets of attacks over the way we do things in our own country.''
	   Member of Parliament Lim Swee Say joined in the chorus defending
the tiny city-state, promising that Singapore ``will continue to
extend a helping hand to our neighbors because we care for them.''
	   ``Yet, at the same time, no one should try to push us around
just because we are small,'' he continued.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has said his nation
will hold its ground at the old railway checkpoint, adding he has
no plans to contact his Singapore counterpart, Goh Chok Tong, to
discuss the dispute anytime soon.
	   Analysts on both sides of the border say the squabble is
underscored by problems related to the region's economic turmoil,
which has hurt Malaysia much more than Singapore.

Williams retires with leg injury at Toshiba Classic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARLSBAD, California (AP) _ Venus Williams was close to victory
before the injury bug bit again.
	   Williams was one game away from advancing to today's semifinals
of the dlrs 450,000 Toshiba Classic when a knee injury Friday
eventually forced her to retire in the third set against Mary
Pierce.
	   The third-seeded Williams had to pull out of her quarterfinal
match with what she said was patella tendinitis in her left knee.
	   Williams also suffered two leg injuries Sunday when she lost to
Lindsay Davenport in the final of the Bank of the West Classic at
Stanford, California.
	   Pierce led 4-0 in the third set when Williams decided to quit.
Williams, ranked fifth in the world, said the knee flared up at 4-4
in the second set.
	   Williams, 18, won the first set 6-2. Pierce won the second 7-6
(7-3).
	   Williams held serve to go ahead 6-5 in the second set. She then
limped noticeably to her courtside chair and requested an injury
timeout. After receiving treatment from a WTA trainer, Williams
returned with a bandage on her left knee.
	   The injury clearly hampered Williams for the remainder of the
match before she retired.
	   ``I thought maybe I could still win the match,'' she said. ``I
found that I was living in a false reality. When I realized that, I
quit.''
	   Williams was one of three quarterfinalists to experience injury
problems.
	   Fourth-seeded Monica Seles continued to feel the effects of a
back injury that has bothered her since last month. Seles, a 6-4,
6-3 winner over Japan's Ai Sugiyama, said her back continues to
``spasm after every match.''
	   Seles wasn't sure if she could finish the tournament, and said
she might pull out of next week's Acura Classic at Los Angeles.
	   ``I don't know what to expect,'' she said.
	   Ironically, Pierce nearly retired against Williams with a right
wrist injury late in the first set.
	   ``I came close to quitting myself because I was having trouble
gripping (the racket),'' Pierce said.
	   In the other quarterfinal match, the second-seeded Davenport
fought back for a 6-4, 6-4 win over No. 8 seed Nathalie Tauziat of
France.
	   Davenport, ranked second in the world behind Switzerland's
Martina Hingis, trailed 3-0 in both sets before rallying.
	   Williams said she wasn't worried the injury might keep her out
of next month's U.S. Open.
	   ``I don't feel that it's going to be something that's going to
hold me back,'' she said. ``It's something that's temporary right
now.''
	   Williams was evasive in discussing her injury. She refused to be
specific about her injuries from either last week or Friday.
	   ``If I felt that I wanted everyone to know about my knee,'' she
said, ``then I would start talking about it right off the bat.''
	   Seles got a huge break in the first set when Sugiyama
double-faulted three consecutive times in the 10th game with Seles
leading 5-4. Sugiyama then netted a forehand on set point.
	   ``When I was serving, the sun was right there,'' Sugiyama said.
``The sun came into the toss point. It didn't work very well.''

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Spurred by cries for help, rescue workers
used backhoes and bare hands Saturday to free people trapped under
tons of steel and concrete shattered by two terrorist bombings at
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   The death toll rose to at least 107 in the 24 hours after the
blasts, the Red Cross said.
	   ``Help me, help me. I have gone now,'' gasped one of the latest
victims, a Kenyan man buried in rubble, just before he died.
	   Just a few minutes apart, the suspected car bombings 700
kilometers (450 miles) from each other Friday turned busy streets
in two African capitals into bloody piles of concrete and knots of
steel.
	   It was not immediately known who was responsible.
	   The number of injured topped 2,212. At least eight Americans
died in Kenya, U.S. Embassy spokesman Chris Scharf said. The State
Department said a child was among those killed and five other
Americans were missing.
	   More than two dozen FBI agents and bomb examiners, plus 43 U.S.
Air Force troops arrived in Kenya aboard U.S. military flights to
investigate and help with rescue efforts.
	   ``Our top priority at the scene is to determine the kind of
explosive device that was used and the kind of vehicle that carried
it there,'' FBI spokesman Frank Scafidi said in Washington.
``Knowing the kind of explosive and vehicle can be like a
fingerprint of who did it.''
	   National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley said, ``This
appears to have been a very well-coordinated, very well-planned
attack _ clearly not the work of amateurs.''
	   As dawn broke under a drizzle in Nairobi Saturday, rescuers
could hear two people calling out from inside a debris-choked
elevator shaft.
	   ``It is horrific to hear moaning, sighs and whimpers from under
the rubble when we can do so little to reach victims quickly,'' Red
Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe said.
	   The number of deaths in Kenya had reached ``more than 100 that's
for sure,'' she said.
	   The Kenyan government declared five days of mourning Saturday.
	   The blast in Nairobi sent a crowded building toppling toward the
embassy and a street packed with cars, trucks and buses. At least
100 were killed and 2,140 were wounded here, Red Cross and
government officials said.
	   Almost simultaneously, the U.S. Embassy in the Tanzanian
capital, Dar es Salaam, was shattered by an explosion in an
adjacent parking lot. At least seven people were killed and 72
hurt, officials said. It was not clear which bombing occurred
first.
	   No Americans were killed in Dar es Salaam, hospital officials
said.
	   Car bombs were believed to have caused both blasts, Kenyan and
Tanzanian officials said.
	   Working through the night beneath floodlights, rescuers in both
capitals used pick axes, shovels and ropes to clear rubble.
	   After an hour-long effort in Nairobi, one person was pulled
alive from the wreckage to cheers from the gathered crowd.
	   But another rescue attempt ended tragically.
	   Kenyan Sgt. David Kambi, an army engineer, said he struggled for
four hours to free a 40-year-old man named Gitau whose chest was
weighed down by a slab of concrete.
	   ``I told him, `Gitau we're going to help you,''' Kambi said. He
pleaded for help twice, then died, the officer said.
	   In Washington, President Clinton said the United States would
bring the terrorists to justice ``no matter what or how long it
takes.''
	   Governments throughout the world condemned the bombings and
offered help.
	   The bombings were the first major international terror attacks
against the United States since a June 25, 1996, truck bomb outside
a housing complex in Saudi Arabia killed 19 Americans. More than
500 people were injured.
	   Friday's blast in Kenya damaged at least 53 buildings, severed
phone and power lines, shattered windows as far as 10 blocks away,
and sent black smoke into the sky. Several people aboard two
passing buses were killed by shrapnel, witnesses said. Bloodied
clothing and papers lay scattered around.
	   Bodies dangled out of windows in a charred bus as crumpled cars
smoldered nearby. Police helicopters hovered, some evacuating the
seriously injured.
	   In Dar es Salaam, cranes gingerly peeled away layers of wreckage
searching for survivors.
	   Officials in the United States, Kenya and Tanzania refused to
speculate on who was responsible.
	   A previously unknown group calling itself the ``Army for the
Liberation of Islamic Shrines'' claimed responsibility in phone
call to the Cairo, Egypt office of Al-Hayat, a daily Arabic
language newspaper published in London. The caller gave no clues
about the group's makeup.
	   Often after terrorist attacks, multiple claims of responsibility
are made. But most cases involve previously unknown groups, and
authorities usually cannot even confirm such groups exist.
	   A group known as the Islamic Jihad vowed last week to strike
American interests because some of its members were arrested in
Albania, according to a report in Thursday's Al-Hayat.
	   Several groups use the name Islamic Jihad. This one is
considered the successor to groups that assassinated Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
	   One suspected terrorist being examined in the wake of the
explosions is exiled Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, U.S.
officials said. Bin Laden has threatened a holy war against U.S.
troops and Americans.
	   He also is suspected of backing other terrorist acts including
the 1996 attack in Saudi Arabia.
	   A man was seen being taken into custody at the Nairobi bombing
scene. Witnesses said he spoke Arabic, but police would not
comment. His connection, if any, to the bombings was not known.
	   Security was tightened at other U.S. embassies worldwide.
	   The U.S. ambassador to Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, was cut on the
lip. The newly confirmed ambassador to Tanzania, Charles Stith, had
not yet arrived in the country.
	   Neither country has a history of international terrorist
attacks. Both embassies were considered low risk, perhaps making
them attractive targets.
	   Compared with other African countries, foreigners can enter and
leave Kenya and Tanzania with relative ease, possibly making it
easier for terrorists to attack.

Saddam says U.S. will reap nothing, urges Iran to normalize ties

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein said Saturday the
United States will reap nothing but a ``harvest ... full of
thorns'' from its campaign against Iraq.
	   Addressing the nation on television to mark the anniversary of
the end of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, Saddam also urged Iran to
normalize relations with Iraq.
	   Saddam did not refer to his decision Wednesday to freeze
cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors, but he said the United
States and its allies would be misled if they thought they could
bring Iraq to its knees.
	   This is exactly what the Iranian government under the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini thought it could do in the war, but it
failed, Saddam said.
	   ``Those imposing aggression on Iraq ... and the unfair embargo
neglect this fact today,'' Saddam said, referring to the sweeping
sanctions imposed by the United Nations after Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
	   ``They are making the same mistake. Their harvest will be full
of thorns and the outcome will be a taste of bitterness.''
	   The president delivered his speech in a black suit. He had
decreed that Saturday be celebrated as a day of victory over Iran,
and an artillery salute of 101 guns boomed over Baghdad in the
early morning. National radio and television played patriotic songs
for the occasion.
	   Saddam spoke two days after the U.N. Security Council declared
his freeze ``totally unacceptable'' and President Clinton said his
government would ``stop any and all efforts'' to ease sanctions on
Iraq unless it cooperates with U.N. arms inspectors.
	   The inspectors must declare Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction before the sanctions _ which include a ban on
export of most oil _ can be lifted.
	   Saddam said Iraq has the ``ability'' to stand up to the United
States in the same way that it withstood eight years of war against
Iran.
	   ``The Americans and their supporters have failed to grasp the
vitality of Iraq's ability to confront their tyrannical power,'' he
said.
	   Turning to Iran, Saddam said he hoped the country's present
leaders were not under the illusions of the war years.
	   ``We hope misconception will be dispelled ... so that hatred,
rancor and bigotry will be replaced by elements of love,'' he said.
``This is what we wish for Iran and we call on the Almighty to help
in this direction.''
	   Saddam said ``a known group'' in Iran was ``hesitant'' to
normalize ties with Iraq, despite his repeated pleas.
	   The same group was trying to deter Iranians from visiting Shiite
Muslim shrines in Iraq, he said.
	   Saddam did not identify the group, but was certainly alluding to
hard-liners in the Iranian hierarchy who oppose attempts by
reformist President Mohammad Khatami to improve Tehran's ties with
the world.
	   Saddam said any step by Iran to upgrade relations would met by
``all cooperation ... from the Arabs, with Iraq in front.''
	   Iran and Iraq maintain embassies in each other's capitals, but
they have not exchanged ambassadors since the envoys were recalled
during the war.
	   About one million Iranians and Iraqis were killed or wounded in
the war. Iran insists that Iraq is continuing to hold Iranian
prisoners of war, but Baghdad denies this.

Director of Russia's biggest tire company killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An executive at Russia's leading tire manufacturer
has been shot and killed in central Russia, a news agency said
Saturday.
	   Marina Antonova, finance and economics director of the Voltyre
company, was shot in the yard of her home in the town of Volzksky,
900 kilometers (550 miles) southeast of Moscow, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Police said her body was found late Friday night. Three
cartridges and two 9mm bullets were also found and neighbors
reported hearing five shots, they said.
	   Police refused to comment on a possible motive. ITAR-Tass quoted
neighbors as saying there had been an attempt on the 39-year-old
woman's life in May when an unidentified device exploded in her
car.
	   Many prominent business people are killed in Russia every year,
mostly as a result of organized crime battles for profitable
businesses. Only a small number of such killings are ever solved.
	   Voltyre is Russia's leading producer of tires for cars and
trucks.

	   Taliban spokesman Abdul Ramana Hutaki said the militia's
opponents retreated south of Mazar-e-Sharif to Bamyan Province. He
said the entire city was under Taliban control. He had no details
on casualties or the number of prisoners taken.
	   The Taliban attacked from the west early Saturday morning.
	   The fall of Mazar-e-Sharif would be a major blow to an
opposition pushed into a dwindling corner of northern Afghanistan,
and would give the Taliban control of virtually all of Afghanistan.
	   Abdullah, a spokesman for the anti-Taliban alliance reached in
Paris, said he had reports of major fighting around Mazar-e-Sharif
but said his forces repulsed the Taliban attack. The spokesman uses
one name only.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance has been under heavy pressure since
the Taliban captured its stronghold of Shebergan, about 100
kilometers (60 miles) west of Mazar-e-Sharif, nearly a week ago.
	   Taliban forces have imposed a strict version of Islamic law in
territory they control. Since capturing Kabul in 1996, Taliban
officials have barred girls from school, confined most women to
their homes, forbade all music except religious songs and banned
anything published outside Afghanistan.
	   The anti-Taliban coalition is mostly made up of Afghanistan's
minority ethnic and religious groups, factions that sometimes fight
each other as well as the Taliban army.

Rumors of ethnic violence sweep through Malaysia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A rumor of ethnic violence in
Malaysia's capital has spread like wildfire throughout the
Southeast Asian nation, prompting workers to scurry home early and
bolt their doors.
	   In nearby suburbs of the capital city, some grocery stores ran
out of milk, instant noodles and other essentials as skittish
neighbors mobilized themselves to defend against rumored gangs of
marauders.
	   But the rioters never materialized.
	   ``There are no riots,'' an exasperated Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad told reporters late Friday night. ``All the rumors are only
lies. Some people deliberately made up the story to create chaos in
our country.''
	   ``These people are traitors of the country. If possible, I want
to catch these people, drag them to the street and beat them up,''
fumed the 72-year old premier.
	   The rumor of riots -- as well as murmurings of ethnic and
religious groups fighting one another -- were so widespread that
police set up a hotline to deal with them, running the phone number
on the front pages of Saturday newspapers.
	   Thousands of Malaysians working in downtown Kuala Lumpur warned
one another Friday to avoid a seedy, red-light area of the city
where hundreds of illegal Indonesian aliens were rumored to have
attacked police using machetes.
	   Other rumors spread that supposed rioting was flaring across
several city blocks and that police had closed several roads and
imposed a curfew.
	   ``My daughter in Shah Alam called my daughter in Ampang, warning
her that the Chinese and Indonesians were getting ready for a big
fight,'' said domestic worker T. Jaya. ``She said they had all
sorts of weapons.''
	   Newsrooms were inundated with phone calls. Mobile phones beeped
throughout the night.
	   Even the diplomatic community took notice. The U.S. embassy
issued a statement Saturday saying there were no truth to the
rumors, but advised Americans to ``avoid large unknown public
gatherings, and to be as inconspicuous as possible.''
	   Malaysia's indigenous Malays and ethnic Chinese and Indians have
existed peacefully, though somewhat uneasily, since race riots in
the capital in 1969 left dozens dead.
	   Malaysia's top police chief, Abdul Rahim Noor, also dismissed
the scuttlebutt that many Indonesian laborers, whose annual work
permits will expire August 15, had been amassing a stockpile of
machetes and knives to resist deportation.
	   Kuala Lumpur residents with access to the Internet said this
rumor had been circulating for weeks in the form of a terse e-mail.
	   The widely-distributed electronic message alleged that owners of
several hardware stores have reported a marked increase in the
numbers of machetes purchased by Indonesians.
	   ``We are not sure of their motive,'' said the unidentified
authors of the e-mail. ``Please make sure that your house, family
and others are well protected.''
	   ``The crime rate has gone up in every part of town,'' it
continued. ``Be careful and pass this message around.''
	   Mahathir said his administration was pursuing the authors of the
anonymous message.
	   ``At the moment, we cannot trace them,'' he said. ``They had
written (the e-mail) as if there is going to be a war.''

representative and broad-based government of national unity,'' he
said.

Hot weather blamed for deaths among elderly in southern Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An extended hot spell was blamed Saturday for a 15
percent increase in deaths among older people in the southern
Russian region of Krasnodar.
	   More heart attacks and strokes have been reported among people
aged 65-80 since the heat wave began in mid-July, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said.
	   It quoted the Krasnodar ambulance service as saying it was
fielding 70 to 100 more calls than usual every day.
	   ITAR-Tass gave no other details.
	   Temperatures in the high 30s Celsius (90s F) have also been
blamed for damaging crops in Krasnodar, a major agriculture area
about 1,200 kms (750 miles) south of Moscow.

Thai deputy premier seeks top world trade job
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A deputy prime minister of Thailand
confirmed Saturday that he wants to compete for the job of director
general of the World Trade Organization.
	   Supachai Panichpakdi said he would represent Asian interests as
head of the world's supreme trade body and has written to Thai
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai seeking permission to become a
candidate for the post.
	   Thailand was the first of Asia's former miracle economies to
plunge into crisis last year. Supachai wrote in his letter to Chuan
that resolving the economic problems needed a global approach.
	   ``A remedy to the nation's economic problems cannot be found
only at home,'' said Supachai, who is also commerce minister.
``International trade and investment rules also play an important
part.''
	   Supachai said he had received preliminary support during an
economic cooperation meeting Friday with ministers representing
India, Bangladesh and Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   Supachai, one of Chuan's main economic advisers in attempting to
cope with the crisis, indicated that the Cabinet would decide in a
week whether he would get the government's blessing.
	   The WTO director general's post is currently held by Renato
Ruggiero, a former Italian trade minister, who has said he intends
to leave by April 1, 1999.

	   The Islamic Republic News Agency in Iran, which had reported a

the battle for the city.
	   ``Continuous explosions are being heard in the city and there
are sporadic acts of resistance in the streets,'' the Iranian news
agency reported from Mazar-e-Sharif. ``Various districts are
burning and a large number of houses have been destroyed.''
	   In Iran, which has backed the anti-Taliban coalition, Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi called on the Taliban to protect the
well-being of staff at the Iranian consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   ``We have conveyed this wish also to the Pakistani government,
which has close ties with the Taliban,'' Kharrazi said.
	   Sources in Mazar-e-Sharif, who refused to be named, said the
city had been heavily bombed, and a heavy exchange of rocket- and
shell-fire could be heard. Residents took shelter in basements.

	   This is exactly what the Iranian government under the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini thought it could do in the war, but it
failed, Saddam said.
	   ``Those imposing aggression on Iraq ... and the unfair embargo
neglect this fact today,'' Saddam said, referring to sweeping
sanctions the United Nations imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   ``They are making the same mistake. Their harvest will be full
of thorns and the outcome will be a taste of bitterness.''
	   The president delivered his speech in a black suit. He had
decreed that Saturday be celebrated as a day of victory over Iran,
and an artillery salute of 101 guns boomed over Baghdad in the
early morning. National radio and television played patriotic songs
for the occasion.

Malaysian leader asks Malaysians to pawn jewelry abroad: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP)_ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
told Malaysians to pawn their jewelry abroad and use the money to
help increase the amount of foreign capital reserves available
domestically, a news report said Saturday.
	   ``I believe that there is hidden wealth worth billions of
dollars in the country,'' national news agency Bernama quoted
Mahathir as saying at the opening the Malaysian Indian Congress
52nd general assembly Saturday.
	   The Congress is one of the 14 components of the National Front
which rules the country.
	   By pawning their jewelry and other valuables overseas,
Malaysians would display high patriotism and help to overcome the
country's economic problems, he said.
	   Mahathir stressed that he was asking his countrymen to simply
convert valuables into cash to be deposited at local banks _ not to
actually donate the proceeds to the government.
	   ``I am not going to force anybody, I am just appealing,'' he
said.
	   Mahathir praised Malaysian workers for being more disciplined
than their counterparts in other countries which have also been
affected by a regional economic crisis.
	   But he advised workers not to emulate western counterparts by
resorting to labor strikes.
	   The Malaysian leader also reiterated that his nation would not
seek financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund.

Police arrest French arson suspect as fire fighters battle blazes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Police have arrested a French national on
suspicion of trying to start a forest fire in western Greece, as
fire fighters Saturday struggled to control blazes in the southern
part of the country.
	   According to police, a man identified as Alain de Fermont, 49,
was arrested late Friday in the Thesprotia region on the western
coast as he allegedly tried to light a forest fire with gasoline
near the village of Sivota.
	   De Fermont was remanded in custody and is scheduled to appear
before a prosecutor on Monday. No further details were available.
	   Police on Friday also arrested an Albanian man, 18-year-old
Gerim Alsrui, on suspicion of arson after he was allegedly seen
attempting to light a fire by the side of a road in the southern
town of Aegio.
	   Although forest and brush fires are common during Greece's hot
and dry summers, this season has been declared the worst ever.
	   In July alone, more than 3,000 wildfires were reported compared
with 2,800 for the entire summer season last year, the government
said.
	   Officials suspect arson in many of the fires. In the past, fires
have been set by people hoping to dodge legislation that forbids
building in forest areas. But authorities have also raised
speculation that organized eco-terrorists could have contributed to
the rash of fires.
	   A fire near Ancient Olympia, where the ancient Olympic games
originated, reportedly rekindled Saturday after being brought under
partial control. The ancient site was not threatened by the blaze.
	   Following a fire that raged on the edge of the capital for four
days, the greater Athens area remained under a state of emergency
that allowed officials to close roads and ban public access to
forests. A 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew has been imposed in the
remaining wooded areas of Mount Pendeli, where the fire was
extinguished.
	   The interior minister has also announced an increase in army and
police patrols in high-risk areas throughout the country.
	   Firefighting crews around Europe have mobilized additional help
for Greeks exhausted and overwhelmed by the nation's worst season
of forest and brush fires.
	   Two Russian firefighting planes reportedly joined five French
and Italian aircraft assisting in battling blazes around the
country. The Russian aircraft will remain in the country until
early September, media reports said. Four helicopters fitted with
5,000-liter water tanks and 35 soldiers were also expected to
arrive from Germany and go into operation Sunday.
	   The Greek interior ministry has said it is also discussing
firefighting aid with Spain.

Singapore Airlines employees forgo annual pay rise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Employees of Singapore's flagship air carrier
decided Saturday to forgo an annual pay rise, joining top
executives and managers in the company who have already sacrificed
their raises this year.
	   As the regional economic slowdown and growing competition takes
a bite out of previously robust revenues for Asian carriers,
Singapore Airlines Staff Union chose to turn down a usual 6 percent
salary increase for its 9,000 members, who include all cabin crews.
	   The union volunteered the cost-cutting move to help the national
airline cope with fewer passengers and shrinking revenue, according
to state-run television.
	   Normally one of the most profitable operators in the region, the
airline has warned that income for 1998 is likely to fall below
last year's healthy 1.04 billion Singapore dollar (dlrs 594
million) net earnings.
	   Since the start of the economic downturn, Singapore Airlines has
reduced its services within Asia in favor of increased flights to
destinations outside the region, where passenger demand remains
more robust.
	   Top executives gave up their 3.5 percent service increments in
July, a move that will save the company more than 200,000 Singapore
dollars (dlrs 114,000) per month, according to news reports.
	   All 316 managers followed their bosses' examples shortly
thereafter, eschewing their 4 percent raise in a move that could
save the airline 2 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 1.14 million)
each month, The Straits Times newspaper reported.
	   Singapore Airlines and its subsidiaries employ a total of about
28,000 people, according to the paper.

Serb war crimes suspect fatally shot in a drunken brawl
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MISA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A war crimes suspect wanted by the
U.N. tribunal for atrocities allegedly committed during the Bosnian
war died in a bar brawl in Serbia, where he remained at large,
sources said Saturday.
	   Slobodan Miljkovic, also known by his nom de guerre, Lugar, died
in a drunken brawl late Friday in his hometown of Kragujevac, 100
kilometers (60 miles) southeast of Belgrade, a police source
confirmed Saturday.
	   Miljkovic was indicted by the U.N. War Crimes tribunal at The
Hague, Netherlands for participating in mass killings in the
northeastern Bosnian town of Bosanski Samac in 1992. He was also
wanted on three counts of individual murder and numerous beatings.
	   Known as pre-war thug and shady underworld figure, Miljkovic
returned to Serbia after the war because authorities in Belgrade
were not willing to extradite him to The Hague.
	   According to local radio reports, Miljkovic and a friend
reportedly started a violent brawl in a late-night bar when the bar
owner, an ex-policeman, tried to stop them from molesting a
waitress. Miljkovic, his friend and the bar owner were all fatally
shot in the fight and several others were wounded, the report said.
	   In March, Miljkovic gave an interview to a Belgrade paper,
claiming his innocence and blaming it all on politicians.
	   ``The war is over and we are declared war criminals. What about
those who sent me there?'' Miljkovic was quoted by Demokratija
daily as saying. ``They pushed us into war, they explained to us
the goals and aims. And now we are war criminals and they are still
in their positions.''
	   In the past six weeks two other Serb suspects, both already at
The Hague, have died. One committed suicide, the other died of
ruptured aorta.

Water supply cut in southern Russia

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Authorities cut water supplies to all residences
and businesses in the southern Russian city of Stavropol for two
days while a new purification system was installed, a news agency
reported Saturday.
	   Water was delivered by trucks to hospitals, bakeries and other
businesses that needed large amounts of water and did not have
large storage facilities, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Stavropol's existing water purification system had worn out,
ITAR-Tass said, quoting the mayor's office.

Agassi upsets Sampras
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with quotes, details and last quarterfinal; CORRECTS
tiebreaker score. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Andre Agassi kept his impressive run going while
keeping Pete Sampras from staying No. 1.
	   The eighth-seeded Agassi beat the top-seeded Sampras 6-7 (7-5),
6-1, 6-2 Friday night in the quarterfinals of the dlrs 2.45 million
du Maurier tennis tournament.
	   Agassi, a three-time champion in this event, has won four
tournaments this season, including both he has entered the last two
weeks, improving his ranking more than 100 spots to No. 11.
	   His latest win will prevent Sampras from staying on top of the
ATP world rankings. Sampras needed to win this event for the first
time to maintain his No. 1 ranking. That spot will now be taken by
Chile's Marcelo Rios, who briefly held the No. 1 spot earlier this
year when Sampras was struggling to find his game.
	   Sampras won the first set in just over an hour, but the
Wimbledon champion was nowhere to be found after that as Agassi won
the second set in 28 minutes and the third in 30 minutes.
	   ``Once his legs start going he becomes a different player,''
Agassi said of Sampras.
	   After the first set it was clear Agassi was the fresher of the
two. Both had to play two matches Friday because of a rain delay
Thursday, but Agassi was the one with eagerness in his game.
Sampras seemed more pre-occupied will line judges and close shaves.
	   ``As the match went on I felt myself getting slower and
slower,'' Sampras said. ``He didn't have to do much in the second
and the third sets.''
	   In Saturday's semifinals, Agassi will face No. 6 Richard
Krajicek of the Netherlands, while third-seeded Patrick Rafter of
Australia will meet No. 7 Tim Henman of England.
	   In the other quarterfinals, Rafter defeated No. 5 Jonas Bjorkman
of Sweden 6-3, 6-2; Henman beat unseeded Daniel Vacek of the Czech
Republic 6-3, 5-7, 6-2; and Krajicek beat No. 4 Yevgeny Kafelnikov
of Russia 6-4, 6-4.
	   Agassi advanced to the quarterfinals with a 2-6, 7-5, 6-3
victory over No. 10 Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia, who lost the match
when he double-faulted on match point.
	   Sampras, after a three-hour rain delay, appeared sluggish, tired
and frustrated in a 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 victory over Tommy Haas of
Germany.
	   Against Agassi, Sampras' serve won him the first set _ when he
had 11 of his 22 aces. With declining speed and much less accuracy,
Sampras uncharacteristically double-faulted 12 times in the match,
nine times more than Agassi. Sampras capped it by making 50
unforced errors.
	   ``He tapered off quite a bit,'' Agassi said. ``He definitely got
tired. It's been a long day of tennis, but I just kept telling
myself to work and execute.''
	   Sampras hadn't played in any tournaments since winning Wimbledon
35 days ago.
	   ``I need more matches,'' Sampras said. ``I didn't have any
spring in my legs.''
	   That wasn't a problem for Agassi.
	   ``It's very motivating,'' he said. ``It's been a lot of hard
work and it's nice to see, but I'm not overlooking one step of it.
	   ``Playing this way favors me a little bit more ... it gives me a
chance to throw some body blows.''

Rescuers looks for victims after embassy bombings

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Working without trained dogs or
heat-sensing cameras, rescuers sorted desperately through tangled
rubble in a race through the night to find survivors of blasts at
U.S. embassies in two African nations.
	   Rescue experts and sophisticated equipment were being rushed in
by air, but the first efforts at lifesaving depended on cranes to
lift concrete, blow torches to cut twisted steel rods and
searchers' own ears to hear cries for help in the wreckage.
	   Tall cranes wrestled with massive chunks of concrete, their
delicate work lit by powerful search lights. Sparks flew from blow
torches cutting twisted steel rods.
	   Knowing at least some people were still alive gave a real
urgency to rescue efforts at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, where a
terrorist bomb exploded Friday.
	   ``It is really a dicey operation trying to make sure nothing
collapses on these people,'' said Surinder Bharaj, 40, an airport
worker who volunteered in the rescue.
	   After an hourlong effort, one person was pulled alive from the
wreckage. Rescuers could hear at least three other people calling
out from inside a debris-choked elevator shaft.
	   ``We are constantly in touch with them, they are not
panicking,'' Bharaj said.
	   Within minutes of the Kenyan blast, a car bomb in the U.S.
Embassy's parking lot in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, produced similar
scenes.
	   Two-thirds of the embassy building was destroyed in the
explosion. The blast also started several fires that sent black
smoke into the sky where police helicopters patrolled.
	   ``The Fire Brigade arrived a half hour after the explosion. Some
people (from the embassy) were screaming. Some cried and most hid
behind the building in shock,'' said Abdalla Riyami, a Tanzanian
journalist.
	   In Dar es Salaam, seven people were killed, including five
Tanzanians who worked at the embassy, and 72 people were injured.
In Nairobi, more than 100 people, including eight Americans, were
killed and 2,140 injured.
	   After the Nairobi explosion, survivors wandered amid burning
cars and broken concrete.
	   ``People were running everywhere,'' said Paul Muhoho, a
journalist who had just left one of the stricken buildings.
	   Cheers greeted survivors, and rescuers cried out loudly when a
dead body was uncovered.
	   The streets were littered with paper, shoes and clothing, and
the glass of shattered windows. The blast could be heard four miles
away and blew out windows within 10 blocks of the explosion.
	   Nearby vehicles, including a passing public bus, caught fire. A
Kenya Red Cross worker said at least eight bus passengers died in
the inferno.
	   Police helicopters flew overhead as shouting rescue workers did
what they could in the confusion immediately after the blast.
Thousands of spectators often blocked ambulances.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Chanting slogans and waving posters of
Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, more than 300 exiled students from
Myanmar protested Saturday in front of the country's embassy in
Thailand, calling for an end to military rule.
	   The protest _ mirrored in Malaysia and other countries hosting
Myanmar exiles _ marked the 10th anniversary of a mass uprising in
Myanmar. The army eventually crushed the unrest and thousands are
believed to have died.
	   The anniversary comes as Suu Kyi and her National League for
Democracy have steeped up pressure on the military government in
Myanmar, which is also known as Burma. The opposition has set an
Aug. 21 deadline for the government to permit a freely-elected
parliament to convene.
	   ``We see now that our leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, is moving more
strongly than ever before,'' said Gaw Minth, a coordinator of the
Bangkok protest. ``We believe that she will do something if the
request is ignored by the military.''
	   The demonstrators, mostly students who fled their homeland after
the crackdown a decade ago, held up protest placards.
	   ``We want democracy,'' was written on one of the posters.
	   Gaw Minth said that 70 people will remain at the sit-in until
Aug. 21. If a session of parliament _ which was elected in 1990 but
never allowed to convene _ is not opened by then, a hunger strike
will follow, he said.
	   The protest leader was among thousands exiled students who left
home to seek refuge in Thailand when he was 17. Gaw Minth wept as
he recalled the killings he said he saw in the capital.
	   ``I saw two men in their early 40s got shot in their chests,''
he said.
	   Ko Pauk, a spokesman for the All Burma Students Democratic
Front, a group of exiles that took up arms after the 1988 uprising,
said that he had been able to contact his family only three times
in the past 10 years.
	   ``It is just painful, but we realize that staying somewhere else
out of the country, we can work better and safer,'' Ko Pauk said.
	   Ko Pauk said he has been arrested and detained several times by
Thai police, and was once arrested, stripped and had 1,000 baht
(dlrs 25) confiscated while traveling on a train.
	   Meanwhile, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, protesters planned a
candlelight vigil outside the Myanmar Embassy and urged the
government to release an estimated 1,200 political prisoners.
	   ``What we want is to let ordinary Burmese know that we will
continue, in our small way, to champion their plight,'' said one
protester, Lee Kwan Por. ``The Burmese people must not lose hope.''

Serb war crimes suspect fatally shot in drunken brawl
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MISA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A war crimes suspect wanted by the
U.N. tribunal for atrocities committed during the Bosnian war has
died in a bar brawl in Serbia, sources said Saturday.
	   Slobodan Miljkovic, known also by his nom de guerre, Lugar, died
in a drunken brawl late Friday in his hometown of Kragujevac, 100
kilometers (60 miles) southeast of Belgrade, a police source
confirmed Saturday.
	   Miljkovic had been indicted by the U.N. War Crimes tribunal at
The Hague, Netherlands, for allegedly participating in mass
killings in the northeastern Bosnian town of Bosanski Samac in
1992. He was also wanted on three counts of individual murder and
numerous beatings, but he remained at large in Serbia.
	   Two other Serb war crimes suspects, both already at The Hague,
have died in the past six weeks. One committed suicide, while the
other died of a ruptured aorta.
	   Known as pre-war thug and shady underworld figure, Miljkovic
returned to Serbia after the war because authorities in Belgrade
would not extradite him to The Hague.
	   According to local radio reports, Miljkovic and a friend started
a violent brawl in a bar when the bar owner, an ex-policeman, tried
to stop them from molesting a waitress. Miljkovic, his friend and
the bar owner were all fatally shot in the fight and several others
were wounded, the report said.
	   In March, Miljkovic gave an interview to a Belgrade paper in
which he claimed innocence and blamed any atrocities on
politicians.
	   ``The war is over and we are declared war criminals. What about
those who sent me there?'' Miljkovic was quoted by Demokratija
daily as saying. ``They pushed us into war, they explained to us
the goals and aims. And now we are war criminals, and they are
still in their positions.''

a penalty kick in the 57th minute Friday night to lead D.C. United
to its seventh straight victory, 1-0 over the Dallas Burn.
	   Lassiter was given the penalty kick after being tripped in the
box by goaltender Mark Dodd.
	   The goal was Lassiter's 16th of the season and tied him with New
England forward Raul Diaz Acre for the league's career lead at 53.
	   Dodd finished with 10 saves for Dallas (11-12), while Scott
Garlick of United (20-5) had six.

U.S. and Costa Rica win big victories toward junior world

	   PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ With impressive victories Friday,
the United States and Costa Rica pushed to within one point of
places in next year's FIFA junior world soccer championships.
	   The Americans dominated neighbors Canada 5-1 to shoot to the top
of the standings on four points, the same as Costa Rica, who like
the Americans manhandled host nation Trinidad and Tobago in
qualifying matches in Port of Spain, the Trinidadian capital.
	   Both winners are now just a point away from securing their
places in the finals in Nigeria next year.
	   The United States got double strikes from Christopher John
Albright who scored in the 20th and 55th minutes, and Rustin
Pierce's goals in the 40th and 49th. Thomas Beasley provided the
goal that consolidated the win.
	   It was the Americans first victory following a surprise 1-1 tie
against Costa Rica on the opening night of the preliminary
tournament Thursday.
	   For Canada, Keven Serpa scored the consolation goal in the 46th
minute.
	   But Canadian joy was short-lived as Alfredo Valente was sent off
soon after.
	   Later, Trinidad and Tobago, who were in a must win situation
after losing 3-1 to Canada on Thursday, soon lost their way against
Costa Rica and lost 4-0.
	   First half strikes by Mario Visquez and Jose Urgarte in the 27th
and 35th minutes gave the winners a 2-0 half-time cushion which
they never relinquished.
	   In the second half, they consolidated and notched another two
goals through substitute Eric Lopez in the 60th minute. Estaban
Santana followed 11 minutes later.
	   Trinidadian defender Derek King picked up his second yellow card
in the match and was sent off, leaving the dejected home side to
fend with 10 men for the last 12 minutes.
	   The third and final round of matches Sunday will feature the
United states and Trinidad and Tobago, while Canada and Costa Rica
play in the key match of the day.
	   The victor in the Caribbean tournament and the runners-up both
qualify for the World Youth Championship scheduled in Nigeria April
3-4 and organized by FIFA, the governing world federation for
soccer.

Leconte successful in Nuveen Tour debut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLESLEY, Massachusetts (AP) _ Henri Leconte won his Nuveen
Tour debut Friday, beating John Lloyd 6-3, 5-7, 12-10 in the
quarterfinals of the Sprint PCS Champions tennis tournament at
Babson College.
	   The Nuveen Tour is the domestic leg of the new 21-event
worldwide senior circuit.
	   Leconte, who began playing senior events in Europe last year, is
ranked fourth behind Jimmy Connors, Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe in
the circuit's point standings after winning a tournament in
Finland.
	   In the Champions Tiebreaker, a 10-point tiebreaker that decides
all senior circuit matches, Lloyd had a match point with Leconte
serving at 8-9, but couldn't convert. Leconte lost a match point of
his own at 10-9 before gaining the victory with a service winner.
	   The victory puts Leconte into Saturday's semifinals against John
Kriek, a 6-4, 7-6 (8-6) winner over third-seeded Mansour Bahrami.
The other semifinal pits Andres Gomez, a 6-4, 6-1 winner over Eddie
Dibbs, against the top-seeded Connors.

Broncos start the exhibition season minus Elway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Call the Denver Broncos' opening exhibition in St.
Louis Saturday night a rehearsal for the future.
	   While the defending Super Bowl champions meet the St. Louis
Rams, John Elway, who is expected to retire after the season, will
be in Rochester, Minnesota.
	   His wife Janet underwent surgery Thursday for what is believed
to be Crohn's Disease, a chronic disease of the intestinal tract.
	   So Bubby Brister will start at quarterback for the Broncos, with
Brian Griese, who may be Elway's eventual replacement, ready to get
his first action as a pro.
	   It's been a strange camp for the Broncos. Last week, on the way
back from visiting his wife, Elway stopped at a motorcycle rally in
Sturgis, South Dakota, in an attempt to coax left tackle Gary
Zimmerman out of retirement for the second straight year. Chances
are Zimmerman will be back, although coach Mike Shanahan isn't sure
yet.
	   ``There are a lot of details,'' Shanahan said. ``There isn't
even a contract yet.''
	   This is the first full weekend of NFL exhibitions _ the start of
the season is only four weeks away.
	   On Thursday night, the New York Jets beat Philadelphia 29-15.
	   On Friday night, Detroit beat Arizona 13-10 on Jason Hanson's
38-yard field goal 2:50 into overtime. Hanson's 34-yarder with one
second left in regulation forced overtime.
	   Also, Tennessee defeated Atlanta 31-16. George McCullough
returned an interception for a touchdown, and James Ritchey and Ron
Powlus, battling for a backup spot at quarterback, each threw a
touchdown pass for the Oilers.
	   On Saturday, the Baltimore Ravens open their new stadium against
the Chicago Bears.
	   In other Saturday games, Buffalo is at Pittsburgh, Jacksonville
at Carolina, Miami at Washington, Kansas City vs. Tampa Bay at
Norman, Okla., Cincinnati at the New York Giants, New Orleans at
Green Bay, Oakland at Dallas, Indianapolis at Seattle, and San
Francisco at San Diego.
	   Minnesota is at New England Sunday.
	   Griese isn't the only rookie quarterback in the spotlight.
	   Peyton Manning, the No. 1 overall pick in the draft, will start
for the Colts at Seattle, and Ryan Leaf, the No. 2 overall pick,
will start for the Chargers at San Francisco.
	   ``I didn't leave college early so I could sit on the bench for a
year,'' Leaf said after his first practice as a starter. ``This is
what I wanted to do.''
	   Manning stepped right in after a five-day holdout and shined in
workouts against the Rams.
	   He said he's been told he will play the first half Saturday
night.
	   ``I don't know whether that will alter during the three games
after that,'' he said. ``Whatever time I'm in there, I'm going to
try to make the best out of it.''
	   Manning, whose only competitors are two inexperienced
journeymen, Kelly Holcomb and Bill Musgrave, was chosen the
starting quarterback for the Colts shortly after being drafted.
	   He'll be going against Tony Banks, a third-year starter whom
coach Dick Vermeil hopes will become a solid NFL quarterback this
year.
	   ``I'd just like to see him show good command, good rhythm in the
offense, good leadership and good percentage,'' Vermeil said. ``I'd
like to see him throw 60 percent or better complete and I'd like to
see him throw about 70 percent complete on first downs.''
	   Two years after leaving Cleveland for Baltimore, the Ravens open
their new dlrs 220 million stadium. A sellout crowd of 69,000, a
rarity for an exhibition, is expected.
	   ``We want to show the fans what we have. We want to play well
right from the beginning and continue to do that,'' Ravens coach
Ted Marchibroda said.
	   The Bengals-Giants game will be the first played on grass at
Giants Stadium.
	   The grass, put over the artificial turf for the Major League
Soccer season, will be removed for the regular season, when the
Jets and Giants both use the facility. It could be used permanently
if a way is found to keep it fresh with two pro teams, several
college games and a number of rock concerts at the stadium.

Kido leads by three strokes in Mizuno Ladies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATO, Japan (AP) _ Fuki Kido fired a 3-under-par 69 Saturday to
stay on top with a three-stroke margin after three rounds in the 60
million yen (dlrs 414,000) Mizuno Ladies.
	   Kido, seeking her first victory in three years and fourth
overall, sank three birdies in a bogey-free trek over the
6,480-yard (5,897-meter), par-72 Asahi Kokusai Tojo Country Club
course.
	   It left Kido at a 5-under 211 total, three shots ahead of Yuka
Irie and Akira Nakano, another co-leader overnight. Irie shot a 71
and Nakano a 72.
	   ``I wasn't thinking about a bogey-free round during the play,''
said Kido. ``And I didn't notice that I had no bogeys until after
the final hole.''
	   Kozue Azuma shot a 72 for 215, followed by South Korean Lee
Young-me, winner of the Toto Motor Ladies in May, and three others
tied for fifth at 216.

Son of jailed mob boss arrested in Sicily raid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CATANIA, Sicily (AP) _ Police early Saturday arrested five
suspects, including the son of an imprisoned Mafia boss, in a raid
aimed at breaking up clan wars in eastern Sicily.
	   A Sicilian appeals court last month acquitted Vincenzo
Santapaola, 29, of Mafia association, extortion and drug
trafficking. But police arrested him again on charges of Mafia
association.
	   Santapaola is the son of Benedetto ``Nitto'' Santapaola, a
convicted mob boss captured a few years ago after several years as
a fugitive. Investigators contend the elder Santapaola was the top
Mafia boss in eastern Sicily for years.

 &UR; Three U.S. victims of bomb blast arrive in South Africa &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Three Americans injured in the
bomb blast at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi arrived here for
treatment aboard a South African military plane.
	   A woman and two men, who were not identified, were taken by
ambulance from Waterkloof Air Force Base to One Military Hospital
near Pretoria.
	   The woman was taken by stretcher. She suffered cuts and bruises
to her face and had a broken left hand, and was in stable
condition, military surgeon Dawie Roux said.
	   The two men walked to ambulances. Both sustained head injuries
and appeared dazed.
	   ``They are all extremely shocked, not just physically but
mentally,'' Roux told reporters.
	   There was room for more than 60 blast victims on the Boeing 707,
but Kenyan authorities on Friday night were still trying to decide
where patients should be taken, he said.
	   ``It was chaos when we arrived (in Nairobi). People were still
trying to sort out which patients should be taken where,'' Roux
said.
	   The military hospital near Pretoria had extra doctors and nurses
on standby in case more patients arrive on other flights. South
Africa has made its facilities available.

<TEXT>
	   Profiles of Kenya and Tanzania, the neighboring African
countries where bombs damaged U.S. embassies Friday:
	    &UR; ___
	   KENYA
	   A political debate is mounting in Kenya, an East African nation
known for its varied wildlife and long-distance runners, on
introducing multiparty democracy and giving Kenyans more personal
liberties.
	   Kenya covers about 220,000 square miles (569,800 square
kilometers) of tropical beaches and forests, savannahs, deserts and
is about the size of Italy.
	   After gaining independence from Britain in 1963, Kenya adopted
capitalist economic policies and maintained good relations with
Western nations, especially Britain and the United States.
	   The country's economy grew rapidly but began to falter in the
early 1980s partly because of declining prices of main exports __
tea and coffee _ but also because of increasing mismanagement of
public funds and corruption.
	   Last year the International Monetary Fund froze a dlrs 220
million loan because of the government's failure to enact economic
reforms and curb corruption.
	   This June, Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae publicly confessed
the government had no money.
	   Kenya's population of 28 million includes descendants of people
from Europe, the Indian subcontinent, the Arabian peninsula and 42
odd tribes. More than half of the country is Christian, but several
other religions are practiced.
	    &UR; ___
	   TANZANIA
	   Tanzania, one of the poorest countries in the world, is the only
country in Africa to be created by uniting two independent nations.
	   Now the largest nation in East Africa, Tanzania was created in
1964 after mainland Tanganyika united with the Indian Ocean island
nation of Pemba and Zanzibar.
	   Like neighboring Kenya, Tanzania has had good relations with the
United States.
	   Tanzania is also a land of contrasts. It covers 364,000 square
miles (942,760 square kilometers) of mangrove swamps, tropical
forests, savannah and the perpetually snow-covered Mount
Kilimanjaro, the highest point in Africa at 19,300 feet (5,880
meters).
	   A majority of its 29 million people are Christians.
	   Tanzania's economy is heavily dependent on agriculture and main
exports are coffee and cotton. The country also exploits small
quantities of diamonds, gold and various gemstones.

Chinese dissident charged with subversion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese police told a dissident's wife Saturday
that they have formally arrested him on subversion charges, a
signal that authorities plan to punish him for trying to found an
opposition party, a human rights group said.
	   Wang Youcai, the dissident, was picked up July 10 in a round up
of people associated with the China Democracy Party, an opposition
group which has yet to be formally founded. Of the one dozen
dissidents arrested, only Wang has not been released.
	   Police in Hangzhou, eastern China, told his wife, Hu Jiangxia,
by telephone Saturday that they have formally arrested Wang for
``inciting the subversion of state power,'' the Information Center
of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   Penalties for the crime range from a maximum of life
imprisonment to prison sentences of less than five years, the Hong
Kong-based group said.
	   The decision to formally arrest Wang was a sure sign that he
``will definitely be sentenced,'' it said.
	   Wang, 32, was a leader of pro-democracy protests centered on
Tiananmen Square in 1989 that the Chinese government crushed.
	   He and two other dissidents announced the formation of the China
Democracy Party on June 25, the day U.S. President Clinton arrived
on a visit, to challenge the ruling Communist Party's monopoly on
power.
	   But authorities refused to register the party and began the
roundup of the group's founders and their associates a week after
Clinton left.

Philippine leader says Chinese pledge no currency devaluation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada,
trying to calm fears in regional currency markets about a possible
devaluation of the Chinese yuan, said Saturday he has been assured
by Beijing officials that they will not devalue their currency.
	   Many Asian currencies sank on Friday amid growing concern China
will devalue the yuan to boost the competitiveness of its exports.
The Philippine peso sank to a seven-month low against the U.S.
dollar, triggering a sharp plunge in the local stock market.
	   ``The Chinese foreign minister said they will not devalue. I
talked to him personally and he assured me they will not devalue
their currency,'' Estrada said during a visit to southern Davao
city.
	   ``But if they devalue, we will surely be affected and it would
be difficult for us,'' he added.
	   Estrada did not say when he spoke with Chinese Foreign Minister
Tang Jiaxuan, who was in Manila in late July to attend a meeting
between foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations and other Asian and Western countries, including China, the
United States and Japan.
	   Dealers said fears of a devaluation of the Chinese yuan and Hong
Kong dollar exerted heavy pressure Friday on the peso.
	   The dollar averaged 42.916 pesos, up from 42.343 pesos the
previous day. It reached a day-high of 43.490 pesos, which was also
its closing level and highest level since Jan. 13.
	   The peso's losses jolted the Philippine stock market, where the
main index fell 2.2 percent to a fresh five-year low.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Spurred by cries for help, rescue workers
used backhoes and bare hands Saturday to free people trapped under
tons of steel and concrete shattered by two terrorist bombings at
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The death toll had risen to
at least 107, the Red Cross said. ``Help me, help me. I have gone
now,'' gasped one of the latest victims, a Kenyan man buried in
rubble, just before he died. Just a few minutes apart, the
suspected car bombings 700 kilometers (450 miles) from each other
Friday turned busy streets in two African capitals into bloody
piles of concrete and knots of steel. The number of injured topped
2,212. It was not immediately known who was responsible.
(KENYA-EMBASSY BOMBINGS)
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban militia on
Saturday claimed to have entered Mazar-e-Sharif following an
onslaught of rockets and bombs, capturing the last major prize in
its four-year war against a fractious northern alliance. A
spokesman for the anti-Taliban alliance confirmed Taliban fighters
were in Mazar-e-Sharif, but said they did not have complete
control. The spokesman for Hezb-e-Wahadat, a partner in the
alliance who refused to be named, reported fierce street fighting
in the city. The fall of Mazar-e-Sharif would be a major blow to an
opposition pushed to a dwindling corner of northern Afghanistan,
and would give the Taliban control of virtually all of Afghanistan.
(AFGHANISTAN)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Flood workers struggled Saturday to plug a major
breach along China's raging Yangtze River, while officials upstream
anxiously awaited a possible order to deliberately inundate the
rural lands and homes of hundreds of thousands of people in order
to safeguard cities. Some 330,000 people have been evacuated from
an area in central Hubei province that would be flooded if the
government gives a last-ditch order to dynamite dikes and divert
water away from the Yangtze to protect its weakened embankments
downstream, officials said. Those embankments protect rich farmland
and cities, including Wuhan's 7 million people, but threaten to
give way after weeks of torrential rain and record-high waters.
Officials fear a flood crest surging down the river could cause
them to collapse. (CHINA-FLOODS)
	   LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The leader of Londonderry's
main Protestant brotherhood has appealed for a peaceful parade
through this mostly Catholic city Saturday. The annual march of the
15,000-strong Apprentice Boys organization, commemorating the
city's successful defense from a besieging Catholic army in 1689,
normally fuels sectarian tensions with Catholics or street clashes
with police. But in a hopeful sign for the future of British-ruled
Northern Ireland, the stubborn Protestant group agreed to impose
restrictions on this year's parade after indirect negotiations with
hard-line Catholics, who in turn canceled their plans to block the
parade. Apprentice Boys leader Alistair Simpson urged would-be
Protestant rioters to stay out of Londonderry, warning that ``this
city will not accommodate or tolerate the use of violence or
intimidation to further or underscore any cause.'' (NORTHERN
IRELAND)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Tutsi fighters ignored diplomatic efforts
to end their rebellion in eastern Congo on Saturday and vowed to
push forward to Kinshasa in their war against President Laurent
Kabila. Having already captured several key cities in the Kivu
region near the border with Rwanda, the rebels announced a new set
of targets in western Congo, which would position them within 250
kilometers (150 miles) of the capital. ``We want to remove
President Kabila from power for the interest of the people because
he failed to rule them,'' rebel Radio Bukavu said. Kabila was
meeting with regional heads of state in nearby Zimbabwe on Saturday
to seek support for his troubled 14-month-old regime. The rebels
already control the cities of Goma and Bukavu and the town of Kindu
in eastern Congo, the radio said. Now their focus had turned to
extending their foothold along the western Atlantic
coastline.(CONGO)

Court convicts 27 Muslim militants of robbery, plotting killings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A court on Saturday convicted 27 Muslim
militants, including a 15-year-old boy, of crimes ranging from
robbing jewelry stores to plotting to kill government officials.
They were sentenced to up to 15 years in prison.
	   Nine other men were found innocent, according to police
officials who spoke under customary condition of anonymity.
	   All 36 defendants were suspected members of al-Gamaa
al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Group, which has carried out a violent,
six-year campaign to oust the government and replace it with strict
Islamic rule. More than 1,200 people have died in the violence.
	   As the sentences were read, the defendants broke into chants of
``Allahu Akbar,'' or God is great, a Muslim rallying cry. They then
began laughing, applauding each other and shouting that ``judgment
belongs only to God,'' said the officials.
	   As is normal, verdicts and sentences were announced together.
Two of the men, Hossam el-Din Abdel-Fattah and Hussein Mahmoud
Khodeir, were ordered to serve 15 years at hard labor.
	   Abdel-Fattah was wanted for attacks on police and civilians from
1990 to 1993. Police said that Khodeir was an electrical engineer
who prepared bombs and trained others in using explosives.
	   The State Security Court sentenced one defendant to seven-years
hard labor and gave 23 others five-year jail terms.
	   Amr Atef Abdel-Fadil, 15, was sentenced to three-years at hard
labor on charges of sheltering Abdel-Fattah. At the time of his
arrest, he was 13.
	   The militants were arrested in 1996 after a series of robberies
at jewelry shops owned by Coptic Christians in Cairo suburbs.
Minority Christians have often been targets of Muslim militants,
especially in impoverished southern Egypt.
	   The defendants were also accused of unlawful surveillance of
police and government officials, illegal possession of arms and
ammunition and membership in an outlawed organization.

Russian general concerned about reported Taliban victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian military commander expressed concern
Saturday about the Taliban Islamic army's claim to have captured a
strategic city in northern Afghanistan, which would give it
effective control over the entire country.
	   Gen. Lt. Nikolai Reznichenko said he did not expect a mass
exodus of Afghan refugees into former Soviet republics of Central
Asia. But he told the ITAR-Tass news agency he was concerned that a
victorious Taliban would attempt to recruit supporters in
neighboring countries.
	   Afghanistan borders three former Soviet republics _ Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
	   Russia fears the entrenchment of a radical Islamic state in
Afghanistan would bring an influx of refugees and arms onto its
southern borders, causing unrest in a region already strained by
political rivalries and economic hardship.
	   Reznichenko commands 25,000 Russian troops who are stationed in
Tajikistan to support its government and guard the Tajik-Afghan
border. He said without elaborating that steps have been taken to
reinforce the border if necessary to ``prevent an uncontrollable
breakthrough and possible provocations,'' ITAR-Tass said.
	   He said that if the Taliban has captured the city of
Mazar-e-Sharif from a northern-based opposition alliance, many
members of the alliance will try to leave the country.
	   He said he also feared the Taliban would establish posts along
its northern border from which it would attempt to recruit
supporters from the former Soviet Union.

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Three Americans injured in the
bomb blast at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi arrived here for
treatment aboard a South African military plane.
	   A woman and two men, who were not identified, were taken by
ambulance from Waterkloof Air Force Base to One Military Hospital
near Pretoria.
	   The woman was taken by stretcher. She suffered cuts and bruises
to her face and had a broken left hand, and was in stable
condition, military surgeon Dawie Roux said.
	   The two men walked to ambulances. Both sustained head injuries
and appeared dazed.
	   ``They are all extremely shocked, not just physically but
mentally,'' Roux told reporters.
	   There was room for more than 60 blast victims on the Boeing 707,
but Kenyan authorities on Friday night were still trying to decide
where patients should be taken, he said.
	   ``It was chaos when we arrived (in Nairobi). People were still
trying to sort out which patients should be taken where,'' Roux
said.
	   The military hospital near Pretoria had extra doctors and nurses
on standby in case more patients arrive on other flights. South
Africa has made its facilities available.

In hopeful sign, Protestants march peacefully through Londonderry
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout with march under way
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (AP) _ To the beat of a lone bass
drum, about 400 Protestants marched peacefully Saturday atop
Londonderry's medieval walls after a compromise with Catholics
ensured no confrontations.
	   The sombre, sensible atmosphere stood in stark contrast to
previous years' showdowns over whether the Apprentice Boys
brotherhood _ founded to commemorate Londonderry's 1689 defense
from Catholics _ has a right to parade annually in today's
predominantly Catholic city.
	   Two years ago the British army barricaded the walls to prevent
the Apprentice Boys from marching there, fearing Catholic riots
otherwise. Last year Protestants rioted with police in the Diamond,
the central square inside the walled town, as the march concluded.
	   But the mood across Northern Ireland shifted from confrontation
to compromise last month after a stalemate over another blocked
Protestant march led to three young Catholic boys being burned to
death by arsonists.
	   Apprentice Boys leaders and Catholic protesters from the city's
Bogside district agreed that local Apprentice Boys could march atop
the walls as usual, but no bands from outside Londonderry would be
allowed to circle the Diamond.
	   Such fife-and-drum bands _ dubbed ``kick the pope'' bands
because of their propensity for loud, sectarian tunes _ cause most
anger to Catholics, who have long resented the annual Apprentice
Boys demonstrations.
	   But few Catholics were around Saturday as the Protestants, many
in their traditional uniform of crimson vestments, suit and bowler
hat, stepped off along the stretch of wall overlooking the Bogside
amid mist and drizzling rain.
	   The Black Skull fifes and drums of Glasgow, Scotland, was the
only band permitted to accompany the marchers, which included the
city's hard-line Protestant mayor, Joe Miller. Another prominent
Protestant politician, David Brewster, carried a ceremonial sword.
	   The band didn't play as agreed until the parade turned away from
the Bogside to continue circling the 2-mile-round (3 km) walls.
	   ``Every sensible citizen of Londonderry, Protestant and Roman
Catholic alike, wants this parade to pass off peacefully,'' said
Miller, who became Londonderry's mayor this year thanks to support
from moderate Catholic politicians.
	   The marchers then joined four bands and a few hundred spectators
at the Diamond. Apprentice Boys leader Alistair Simpson laid a
wreath at the memorial there to local dead, British and Irish
alike, from World Wars I and II.
	   A gaggle of Bogside Catholic boys cheered derisively as a
trumpeter played ``The Last Post,'' the sad, slow lament for
British war dead, but no Protestant marchers broke ranks and adult
Catholic onlookers remained silent.
	   In the afternoon, more than 10,000 Apprentice Boys and bands
from across Northern Ireland planned to march from the city center
across the River Foyle into Londonderry's predominantly Protestant
east side and back again.
	   Thirteen senior Apprentice Boys _ each representing the original
13 apprentice workers who bolted the city's gates against the
forces of Catholic King James II some 310 years ago _ will lay more
memorial wreaths in the Diamond. But the bands were barred from
circling it, because that's where the fighting broke out last year.
	   ``This is the hopeful beginning of a resolution of a conflict
with deep roots,'' said Robin Percival, secretary of the Bogside
Residents Group protesters, who watched the Diamond ceremony.
	   ``The problem hasn't been the right of Protestants to express
their culture, it's the size and scale of their demonstrations that
intimidates. When 15,000 (Protestant) loyalists march into a city
which is overwhelmingly (Catholic) nationalist, that creates real
tension.''

Taliban forces claim capture of Mazar-e-Sharif

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban militia on
Saturday claimed to have entered Mazar-e-Sharif following an
onslaught of rockets and bombs, capturing the last major prize in
its four-year war against a fractious northern alliance.
	   A spokesman for the anti-Taliban alliance confirmed Taliban
fighters were in Mazar-e-Sharif, but said they did not have
complete control. The spokesman for Hezb-e-Wahadat, a partner in
the alliance who refused to be named, reported fierce street
fighting in the city.
	   The fall of Mazar-e-Sharif would be a major blow to an
opposition pushed to a dwindling corner of northern Afghanistan,
and would give the Taliban control of virtually all of Afghanistan.
	   Taliban spokesman Abdul Ramana Hutaki said opponents retreated
south of Mazar-e-Sharif to Bamyan Province after the Taliban
attacked from the west early Saturday morning. Taliban troops also
had been poised east of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Hutaki said the entire city was under Taliban control, but Abdul
Rahof, another Taliban official, said both sides were still
battling for the airport. Neither had details on casualties or the
number of prisoners taken.
	   Taliban fighters briefly held Mazar-e-Sharif last May,
retreating after street battles that left several hundred Taliban
soldiers dead. It is believed as many as 2,000 Taliban prisoners of
war were later massacred.
	   The Islamic Republic News Agency in Iran, which had reported a
Taliban victory even before Taliban officials claimed it, described
a dramatic battle for the city Saturday.
	   ``Continuous explosions are being heard in the city and there
are sporadic acts of resistance in the streets,'' the Iranian news
agency reported from Mazar-e-Sharif. ``Various districts are
burning and a large number of houses have been destroyed.''
	   In Iran, which has backed the anti-Taliban coalition, Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi called on the Taliban to protect the
well-being of staff at the Iranian consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   ``We have conveyed this wish also to the Pakistani government,
which has close ties with the Taliban,'' Kharrazi said.
	   Sources in Mazar-e-Sharif, who refused to be named, said the
city was heavily bombed and a heavy exchange of rocket- and
shell-fire could be heard. Residents took shelter in basements.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance has been under heavy pressure since
the Taliban captured its stronghold of Shebergan, about 100
kilometers (60 miles) west of Mazar-e-Sharif, nearly a week ago.
	   The Taliban, which means ``students of Islam,'' emerged in 1994,
pledging to bring peace to Afghanistan after years of civil war.
They have imposed a strict version of Islamic law in territory they
control. Since capturing Kabul in 1996, Taliban officials have
barred girls from school, confined most women to their homes,
forbade all music except religious songs and banned anything
published outside Afghanistan.
	   The anti-Taliban coalition is mostly made up of Afghanistan's
minority ethnic and religious groups, factions that sometimes fight
each other as well as the Taliban army.

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with blueprint of proposal drawn up,
 &UR; By ISMET HADJARI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following a heavy Serb crackdown on
militant Albanian secessionists in Kosovo province, international
powers proposed a political solution to stop the fighting between
Serb forces and rebel Kosovo Albanians.
	   The British ambassador to Yugoslavia, Brian Donelly, met with
moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova Saturday to hand him a
blueprint of the plan. On Friday, Donelly met Yugoslav Vice
Premier, Nikola Sainovic Friday to show him the so-called ``options
paper.''
	   Speaking to reporters after the meeting in Pristina Saturday,
Donnelly said ``I came to hand to Dr. Rugova options paper produced
by contact group which set some variety ideas on how the current
problems in Kosovo might be resolved.''
	   ``I gave the same paper to representatives of federal government
in Belgrade,'' he said. ``We hope that both parties will find ideas
in this paper helpful to them when they sit down to negotiate, that
we believe they must.''
	   The plan was drawn up by the so-called Contact Group of
international powers _ Britain, Germany, France, Italy, the United
States and Russia _ which has been trying to secure a political
solution for Kosovo since fighting between Serb and Yugoslav forces
and the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army escalated in March.
	   Previous attempts at bringing representative from Serb-dominated
Yugoslavia and Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leaders to the negotiating
table have broken down. A major sticking point has been getting the
Albanians _ divided between those who support Rugova and those who
back the KLA _ to rally behind a representative.
	   State-run Tanjug news agency said the blueprint drawn up by the
group rejected the idea of independence for Kosovo and firmly
supported the sovereignty sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Serbia and Yugoslavia.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia, where ethnic Albanians,
who demand independence, represent 90 percent of the population.
Serbia and the smaller republic of Montenegro make up what is left
of Yugoslavia.
	   According to Donelly, the immediate priority of the plan is ``to
establish security situation which will make negotiations
possible,'' which includes halting the fighting and creating
conditions for refugees to return to their homes.
	   ``Serbian authorities tell us that they will make every effort
to try ensure this happens,'' Donelly said. ``We hope they will and
the international community stands ready to help in that
endeavor.''
	   Nearly 200,000 people had been uprooted from their homes in the
past two weeks, many of them fleeing to the forests and mountains
where they remain camped without little to eat. International
humanitarian officials fear the situation will worsen when cold
weather sets in, should the refugees be unable to return to their
homes.
	   There were no immediate reports of fighting in Kosovo Saturday.
	   On Friday, Serb force reportedly entered the village of Likovac,
the former rebel headquarters in the region. A top Serb police
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the offensive in
Kosovo, aimed at driving the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army from
their remaining strongholds, was ``nearly over.''

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Jordan's foreign minister arrived in Tehran
Saturday, saying nothing stood in the way of improving ties between
the two countries.
	   Jawad Anani was received by his Iranian counterpart, Kamal
Kharrazi, shortly after his small executive jet touched down at
Tehran's Mehrabad Airport.
	   He told reporters he would be meeting with Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami to deliver an invitation to Jordan from King
Hussein.
	   ``I am scheduled to meet President Khatami, which is an honor
for me,'' said Anani. ``We are to discuss bilateral, cultural,
regional, economic and tourism issues.''
	   ``There are no political obstacles to the promotion of ties
between two countries,'' he said, speaking in Arabic.
	   Kharrazi said that issues pertaining to the Islamic world and
the Middle East also would be discussed during Anani's three-day
visit.
	   Before leaving Jordan for Iran earlier Saturday, Anani said his
talks in Tehran will include Arab-Iranian relations, eliminating
weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East and the Arab-Israeli
peace process.
	   ``After a break of several years, we believe that with the new
political leadership in Iran, the time is suitable to promote and
upgrade our ties on all levels,'' he said.
	   Jordan and Iran broke off diplomatic ties during the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war but resumed them after the conflict ended. The May
1997 election of Khatami brought warmer ties between Iran and Arab
states, including Jordan.
	   However, Jordan and Iran still disagree about the Middle East
peace process. Jordan has signed a peace treaty with Israel; Iran
opposes any peace with the Jewish state.
	   The two sides will also discuss setting up joint ventures in
Jordan to produce phosphate fertilizers, which mostly will be
exported to Tehran, and explore ways to increase trade between the
two countries, Anani said.
	   Last November, Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan met with Khatami
during his visit to Tehran for a meeting of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following a heavy Serb crackdown on
militant Albanian secessionists in Kosovo province, international
powers proposed a political solution to stop the fighting between
Serb forces and rebel Kosovo Albanians.
	   The British ambassador to Yugoslavia, Brian Donelly, met with
moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova Saturday to hand him a
blueprint of the plan. On Friday, Donelly met Yugoslav Vice
Premier, Nikola Sainovic to show him the so-called ``options
paper.''
	   Speaking to reporters after the meeting in Pristina Saturday,
Donnelly said ``I came to hand to Dr. Rugova options paper produced
by contact group which set some variety ideas on how the current
problems in Kosovo might be resolved.''
	   ``I gave the same paper to representatives of federal government
in Belgrade,'' he said. ``We hope that both parties will find ideas
in this paper helpful to them when they sit down to negotiate, that
we believe they must.''
	   The plan was drawn up by the so-called Contact Group of
international powers _ Britain, Germany, France, Italy, the United
States and Russia _ which has been trying to secure a political
solution for Kosovo since fighting between Serb and Yugoslav forces
and the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army escalated in March.
	   Previous attempts at bringing representative from Serb-dominated
Yugoslavia and Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leaders to the negotiating
table have broken down. A major sticking point has been getting the
Albanians _ divided between those who support Rugova and those who
back the KLA _ to rally behind a representative.
	   State-run Tanjug news agency said the blueprint drawn up by the
group rejected the idea of independence for Kosovo and firmly
supported the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Serbia and
Yugoslavia.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia, where ethnic Albanians,
who demand independence, represent 90 percent of the population.
Serbia and the smaller republic of Montenegro make up what is left
of Yugoslavia.
	   According to Donelly, the immediate priority of the plan is ``to
establish security situation which will make negotiations
possible,'' which includes halting the fighting and creating
conditions for refugees to return to their homes.
	   ``Serbian authorities tell us that they will make every effort
to try ensure this happens,'' Donelly said. ``We hope they will and
the international community stands ready to help in that
endeavor.''
	   Nearly 200,000 people had been uprooted from their homes in the
past two weeks, many of them fleeing to the forests and mountains
where they remain camped without little to eat. International
humanitarian officials fear the situation will worsen when cold
weather sets in, should the refugees be unable to return to their
homes.
	   There were no immediate reports of fighting in Kosovo Saturday.
	   On Friday, Serb force reportedly entered the village of Likovac,
the former rebel headquarters in the region. A top Serb police
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the offensive in
Kosovo, aimed at driving the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army from
their remaining strongholds, was ``nearly over.''

Dozens escape from Sicilian detention center
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Dozens of illegal immigrants squeezed through barbed
wire around their detention center in Sicily early Saturday and
fled through the countryside under the cover of darkness.
	   Police searched the streets and surrounding areas of
Caltanissetta, but by midday, more than 12 hours after the mass
escape, only eight of the Africans had been tracked down.
	   Italian news reports said that the escaping men threw stones at
pursuing police to slow down the chase.
	   It was the third escape in a week from the center, which was
holding 120 illegal arrivals.
	   More than 3,000 immigrants have reached Italy's southern shores
since early July, as warm weather and calm seas aid nightly
clandestine boat runs from North Africa.
	   Italy has signed a series of agreements with foreign countries
which, in exchange for development aid, have promised to take back
the immigrants.
	   Rome is under pressure from northern European countries to crack
down on illegal entry through Italy's porous sea coast. Instead of
just handing illegal immigrants expulsion papers giving them 15
days to leave, Italian authorities now confine them to shelters
while they await repatriation by ship or plane.
	   But there have been brawls and escapes in several of the
centers.

World leaders strongly condemn U.S. embassy bombings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Stunned by twin terrorist bombings at U.S.
embassies in east Africa, world leaders on Saturday strongly
condemned the attacks that killed at least 107 people.
	   In a message to U.S. President Bill Clinton, Russian President
Boris Yeltsin called the bombings a brazen challenge to the entire
world community and pledged to act with other countries to do
whatever was necessary to combat terrorism, the Interfax news
agency said.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said he felt ``strong
indignation'' and ``deep sorrow'' for those killed and injured.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak called the attacks ``vicious
criminal acts.''
	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh said she could ``find
no word adequate enough to condemn the heinous bomb attacks.''
	   U.S. allies weren't the only ones to express their outrage.
	   The government of Cuban President Fidel Castro on Friday
condemned the bombings and expressed ``its most deeply felt
sorrow.''
	   The car bombings Friday at U.S. embassies in the capitals of
Kenya and Tanzania prompted U.S. diplomatic compounds worldwide to
beef up security.
	   In Paris, a heavy police presence prevented people from
approaching the U.S. embassy, which was cordoned off with metal
barriers. Thailand's prime minister ordered his country's police to
provide special security to the U.S. Embassy in the Thai capital of
Bangkok.
	   In Malaysia, U.S. embassy spokesman Chip Barclay said the
compound was ``definitely on heightened security. We're keeping our
guard up and taking appropriate measures. When I came in today, it
was apparent that effective measures have been taken.''
	   Friday's blast in Nairobi, Kenya, damaged at least 53 buildings,
severed phone and power lines, shattered windows as far as 10
blocks away, and sent black smoke into the sky. Several people
aboard two passing buses were killed by shrapnel, witnesses said.
	   It was not immediately known who was responsible.
	   The Kenyan government declared five days of mourning on
Saturday.
	   In the United States, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the U.S. special
envoy to Africa, said the bombing was puzzling because ``there were
no signs on the ground of anti-American sentiment. These are very
pro-American allies.''
	   ``The U.S.-Kenyan alliance is a strong one, getting stronger.
The same can be said of Tanzania,'' Jackson said during a news
conference Friday in Chicago.

Bosnian Croat traders lift blockade off southern border crossings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSTAR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnian Croat traders ended
their road block of southern border crossings between Bosnia and
Croatia Saturday, transportation officials said.
	   Angry Bosnian agricultural exporters barricaded five
southwestern Bosnian-Croat border crossings with their trucks three
days ago to protest a new Croatian customs law that tightens
regulations for Bosnian traders and introduces import taxes.
	   Angry merchants ditched crates of tomatoes and paprikas onto the
roads or rolled water melons down rocky roadside cliffs, demanding
the Croatian government to revoke the law.
	   The producers agreed to lift the blockade after the regional
government, based in Mostar, decided to buy off all products from
the local producers through private companies.
	   The southern border crossings are on a key route to Croatia's
Adriatic coast and the blockade jammed-up traffic of thousands of
tourists for kilometers (miles).

England recover after the loss of Atherton
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ England made the worst possible star,
losing Mike Atherton to the first ball, but recovered to 67 for one
at lunch on the third day of the fifth cricket test at Headingley
Saturday.
	   The home side is effectively 45 for one after South Africa had
squeezed out a 22-run first innings lead in a tense battle with the
series deadlocked at 1-1.
	   Atherton fell to his rival Allan Donald as the big fast bowler
hit the target with his first ball of the day.
	   Javed Akhtar, the independent umpire from Pakistan who had made
three contentious leg before decisions in the South African
innings, appeared to have an easy on, when the Donald delivery
pinned Atherton plumb in front. But TV replays indicated that the
ball had touched the inside of Atherton's bat first.
	   England, after bowling South Africa out for 252, resumed the day
on two without loss.
	   Mark Butcher continued from where he left off in his first
innings 116 with a watchful unbeaten 35 while Nasser Hussain kept
him company with 22 in two minutes under two hours.
	   South Africa managed to keep a tight rein on England's second
innings progress, but 24 runs off Makhaya Ntini's four overs took
some pressure off the home team.
	   Butcher hit five boundaries off 93 balls despite repeatedly
playing and missing against the seam and swing of Shaun Pollock.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Spurred by cries for help, rescue workers
used backhoes and bare hands Saturday to free people trapped under
tons of steel and concrete shattered by two terrorist bombings at
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   The death toll rose to at least 108 in the 24 hours after the
blasts, the Red Cross said.
	   ``Help me, help me. I have gone now,'' gasped one of the latest
victims, a Kenyan man buried in rubble, just before he died.
	   He was one of eight people whose bodies were brought out of the
collapsed building next to the embassy on Saturday. Rescuers were
talking to one man who was still trapped, and he in turn was
communicating with another person trapped further down in the
rubble, the Red Cross said.
	   ``Right now, we seem to be at our wits end, and there is nothing
more that we can do. We just need to get some sniffer dogs and more
sophisticated equipment in there if we want to save lives,'' said
Red Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe.
	   Just a few minutes apart, the suspected car bombings 700
kilometers (450 miles) from each other Friday turned busy streets
in two African capitals into bloody piles of concrete and knots of
steel.
	   It was not immediately known who was responsible.
	   The number of injured topped 2,212. At least eight Americans
died in Kenya, U.S. Embassy spokesman Chris Scharf said. The State
Department said a child was among those killed and five other
Americans were missing. Three injured Americans were flown to South
Africa for medical treatment.
	   Medical facilities in Nairobi were overwhelmed and anxious
families went from hospital to hospital, and finally to the morgues
looking for missing loved ones.
	   More than 24 hours after the blasts, 200 people were still in
need of urgent treatment at Kenyatta Hospital and there were
shortages of syringes, needles and blood for transfusions, the Red
Cross said.
	   Twenty gravely injured people died at Kenyatta Hospital
overnight, some because of the shortage of trained medical staff to
care for the massive number of casualties, said Galbe, the Red
Cross spokeswoman.
	   More than two dozen FBI agents and bomb examiners, plus 43 U.S.
Air Force troops arrived in Kenya aboard U.S. military flights to
investigate and help with rescue efforts.
	   ``Our top priority at the scene is to determine the kind of
explosive device that was used and the kind of vehicle that carried
it there,'' FBI spokesman Frank Scafidi said in Washington.
``Knowing the kind of explosive and vehicle can be like a
fingerprint of who did it.''
	   National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley said, ``This
appears to have been a very well-coordinated, very well-planned
attack _ clearly not the work of amateurs.''
	   As dawn broke under a drizzle in Nairobi Saturday, rescuers
could hear two people calling out from inside a debris-choked
elevator shaft.
	   ``It is horrific to hear moaning, sighs and whimpers from under
the rubble when we can do so little to reach victims quickly,'' Red
Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe said.
	   The number of deaths in Kenya had reached ``more than 100 that's
for sure,'' she said.
	   The Kenyan government declared five days of mourning Saturday.
	   The blast in Nairobi sent a crowded building toppling toward the
embassy and a street packed with cars, trucks and buses. At least
100 were killed and 2,140 were wounded here, Red Cross and
government officials said.
	   Almost simultaneously, the U.S. Embassy in the Tanzanian
capital, Dar es Salaam, was shattered by an explosion in an
adjacent parking lot. At least seven people were killed and 72
hurt, officials said. It was not clear which bombing occurred
first.
	   No Americans were killed in Dar es Salaam, hospital officials
said.
	   Car bombs were believed to have caused both blasts, Kenyan and
Tanzanian officials said.
	   Tanzania's Police Commissioner Wilson Mwansasu was quoted in
several newspapers Saturday saying that initial investigations
indicate the bomb had been planted on a petrol tanker that belonged
to the embassy. The tanker was apparently driving into the main
gate at the time of the explosion, he said.
	   Working through the night beneath floodlights, rescuers in both
capitals used pick axes, shovels and ropes to clear rubble.
	   After an hour-long effort in Nairobi, one person was pulled
alive from the wreckage to cheers from the gathered crowd.
	   But another rescue attempt ended tragically.
	   Kenyan Sgt. David Kambi, an army engineer, said he struggled for
four hours to free a 40-year-old man named Gitau whose chest was
weighed down by a slab of concrete.
	   ``I told him, `Gitau we're going to help you,''' Kambi said. He
pleaded for help twice, then died, the officer said.
	   In Washington, President Clinton said the United States would
bring the terrorists to justice ``no matter what or how long it
takes.''
	   Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye echoed Clinton's determination.
	   ``The government of the United Republic of Tanzania will leave
no stone unturned to make sure that those responsible for the
attack are arrested and sentenced,'' he was quoted in the
independent Guardian newspaper as telling Parliament.

Partial strike against tax hits major Pakistani cities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A strike by traders and small
businessmen Saturday kept most markets shut in major Pakistani
cities including the capital, Islamabad, witnesses and traders
said.
	   The traders are protesting the imposition of a 12.5 percent
general sales tax at the retail level by Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif's government.
	   Most markets were closed in the capital Islamabad and
neighboring Rawalpindi, and in other large cities, including the
port city of Karachi, Hyderabad and Quetta.
	   ``Rulers withdraw the tax,'' read an Urdu-language banner at one
Islamabad shopping center.
	   In Peshawar, the provincial capital of North West Frontier
Province, protesters burned tires and chanted slogans against the
government.
	   ``The literacy rate in Pakistan is very low .... There are few
people who can maintain written records and do the necessary
documentation required for this system,'' Umer Sailya, chairman of
All Pakistan Organization of Small Traders, told the Associated
Press by telephone from Karachi.
	   ``If the government is so desperate for revenues, we are
prepared to give a fixed tax at the rate of one percent. But we
don't want to deal with corrupt tax officials,'' he said.
	   The cash strapped Sharif government, hit hard by sanctions from
major world powers including the United States and Japan for its
nuclear tests in May, imposed the tax to boost its dwindling
revenues.
	   In Karachi, a separate strike by a transport organization
against a recent 25 percent increase in petrol prices kept the
traffic thin on the roads. The petrol price increase was also part
of the government's revenue-raising campaign.

World leaders strongly condemn U.S. embassy bombings

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Stunned by twin terrorist bombings at U.S.
embassies in east Africa, world leaders on Saturday strongly
condemned the attacks that killed at least 107 people.
	   In a message to U.S. President Bill Clinton, Russian President
Boris Yeltsin called the bombings a brazen challenge to the entire
world community and pledged to act with other countries to do
whatever was necessary to combat terrorism, the Interfax news
agency said.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said he felt ``strong
indignation'' and ``deep sorrow'' for those killed and injured.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak called the attacks ``vicious
criminal acts.''
	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh said she could ``find
no word adequate enough to condemn the heinous bomb attacks.''
	   U.S. allies weren't the only ones to express their outrage.
	   The government of Cuban President Fidel Castro on Friday
condemned the bombings and expressed ``its most deeply felt
sorrow.''
	   Two of the governments on U.S. State Department's list of
terrorist-sponsoring nations also spoke out.
	   ``We condemn the bombings, and sympathize with the victims and
their families,'' said Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi.
	   Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said: ``Sudan
condemns acts of violence. Such acts as these (the Kenya and
Tanzania bombings) do not accomplish anything, but victimize
innocents,'' Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported from Sudan's
capital Khartoum.
	   The car bombings Friday at U.S. embassies in the capitals of
Kenya and Tanzania prompted U.S. diplomatic compounds worldwide to
beef up security.
	   In Paris, a heavy police presence prevented people from
approaching the U.S. embassy, which was cordoned off with metal
barriers. Thailand's prime minister ordered his country's police to
provide special security to the U.S. Embassy in the Thai capital of
Bangkok.
	   In Malaysia, U.S. embassy spokesman Chip Barclay said the
compound was ``definitely on heightened security. We're keeping our
guard up and taking appropriate measures. When I came in today, it
was apparent that effective measures have been taken.''
	   Friday's blast in Nairobi, Kenya, damaged at least 53 buildings,
severed phone and power lines, shattered windows as far as 10
blocks away, and sent black smoke into the sky. Several people
aboard two passing buses were killed by shrapnel, witnesses said.
	   It was not immediately known who was responsible.
	   The Kenyan government declared five days of mourning on
Saturday.
	   In the United States, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the U.S. special
envoy to Africa, said the bombing was puzzling because ``there were
no signs on the ground of anti-American sentiment. These are very
pro-American allies.''
	   ``The U.S.-Kenyan alliance is a strong one, getting stronger.
The same can be said of Tanzania,'' Jackson said during a news
conference Friday in Chicago.

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ An American diplomat injured in
the U.S. Embassy bombing in Nairobi said Saturday she heard what
sounded like gunfire before the immense blast.
	   ``I was on the fourth floor. My colleague says, `Oh, I think I
hear some shooting out there,' '' said Mary Robinson, the
administrative attache.
	   ``We went out into the corridor. Then we heard this boom, and
that's all I remember until I woke up in the hospital,'' she said
after being evacuated to a South African military hospital.
	   ``I heard the shooting. That's why I came out of my office,''
said Ms. Robinson, 46, of Temple, Texas.
	   The diplomat suffered cuts and bruises to her face and a broken
left hand. She was brought here from a hospital in Nairobi for a
week's observation after suffering a concussion, and planned to
return to Kenya.
	   Two other Americans, on temporary duty at the embassy, came back
with her on the South African military flight, she said.
	   Officials at One Military Hospital did not immediately have the
names of the other two Americans.
	   The three arrived at Pretoria's Waterkloof Air Force Base, near
Pretoria, aboard a South African military plane, provided by the
government at the request of the U.S. Embassy.
	   There was room for more than 60 blast victims on the Boeing 707,
but Kenyan authorities on Friday night were still trying to decide
where patients should be taken, he said.
	   ``It was chaos when we arrived (in Nairobi). People were still
trying to sort out which patients should be taken where,'' military
surgeon Dawie Roux said.
	   The military hospital, near Pretoria, had extra doctors and
nurses on standby in case more patients arrive on other flights.
South Africa has made its facilities available.

Germany setting up 200 million marks fund victims of Nazis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The German government is setting up a 200
million marks (dlrs 111.1 million) fund to pay restitution to
victims of the Nazis who thus far have not been compensated, the
finance ministry said Saturday.
	   The ministry said the fund is intended for some 18,000 victims
of the Nazis from eastern Europe, after which they are to receive
further payment from a fund for Holocaust survivors.
	   The ministry made the comments in confirming a report by Der
Spiegel weekly magazine Saturday, that the government had reached
agreement with the Jewish Claims Conference after months of
negotiations on payments to victims who thus far had received none.
	   In addition, the agreement simplifies the criteria for seriously
impaired Jewish victims in western countries to allow more victims
to receive compensation, the magazine said.
	   In the past, when establishing restitution payments based on the
length of time a victim was held in a Nazi concentration camp, the
time spent in similar work camps in Austria and on the
Austrian-Hungarian border was not considered, the magazine said.
	   No one could be immediately reached Saturday at the Jewish
Claims Conference for comment.
	   Germany has paid more than 100 billion marks (dlrs 55 billion)
to survivors of the Nazi regime, but those living in the Soviet
bloc could not apply for compensation during the Cold War.
	   After the collapse of communism, Germany gave 1.8 billion marks
(dlrs 1 billion) in one-time payments to east European victims of
all ethnic groups that suffered under the Nazis.
	   Jewish groups had argued that eastern European survivors
deserved the same kind of direct, monthly compensation from Germany
as their counterparts in western Europe. They got support from the
Clinton administration and 82 U.S. senators, who signed an open
letter in August 1997 urging Germany to pay the pensions.
	   The German government promised at that time to find a solution
for eastern European Jews.

Landslides, floods kill at least seven in Korea

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Fresh rains fell on South Korea's
already saturated capital Saturday, triggering new mud slides and
floods that killed at least seven people and forced tens of
thousands to flee their homes.
	   Among those killed Saturday were two U.S. Army soldiers who were
buried under a mud slide at their camp south of Seoul. Twelve
others were injured, two seriously.
	   Ten of the injured soldiers were hospitalized in stable
condition, said Col. Carl Kropf, a military spokesman. He declined
to give further details pending an investigation and notification
of relatives.
	   All of the soldiers were with the 304th Signal Battalion of the
U.S. 8th Army's 1st Signal Brigade, Kropf said.
	   Saturday's seven deaths brought to 212 the number of people
killed by a storm front that swept in from China seven days ago and
wreaked havoc in widely separated parts of South Korea.
	   The death toll was exceeded only by the estimated 350 killed by
a typhoon in 1987. Ninety-four people are still missing and feared
dead from this week's series of floods.
	   Damage estimates ranged from dlrs 200 million to dlrs 2 billion.
	   Many of those forced to flee their homes Saturday had evacuated
them in the face of floods Thursday. Only hours after their return
on Friday, they again had to seek higher ground because of
torrential overnight rains.
	   Weathermen had a dismal warning: More heavy rain was expected
Saturday night and Sunday.
	   With heavy rains causing dams upstream to discharge water from
swollen reservoirs, officials issued a flood warning along the Han
River, which bisects Seoul.
	   Water levels in the Han River were two meters below the mark
that could trigger further massive evacuations in the city of more
than 10 million people.
	   At least two Han River tributaries had already overflowed,
submerging some 30,000 homes in and around Seoul, the Home
Ministry's Disaster Relief Headquarters said.
	   Officials using loudspeakers were urging residents in low-lying
districts in Seoul to evacuate. Lightening crisscrossed the Seoul
sky, disrupting electricity and telephone service and making the
evacuation more difficult.
	   Soldiers and rescue workers picking through flood debris people
still missing from Thursday's flooding were ordered to retreat to
higher ground.
	   ``We are fighting with guerrilla rain showers. They come and
dump and go away. We can not predict where they will appear again.
It's impossible to predict how much more damage we have to
sustain,'' said Won Yoo-jin, a government relief official.
	   The deluge was brought by the same storm system that a week
earlier sent flash floods raging down mountain valleys in the
southern tip of the Korean peninsula, killing 67 campers and
leaving 29 missing and feared dead.
	   About 1,000 U.S. soldiers were evacuated from several small
camps near the border with communist North Korea, said Sgt. Major
Billy Foster of the 2nd Infantry Division. Foster called flood
damage to the camps the worst ``I've seen in one place in my
30-year Army career.''
	   The deluge wrecked entire villages. Streams were clotted with
overturned cars. Alleys were piled with sodden furniture pulled
from homes knee deep in water.

Kabila sits down in talks with Rwandan foe
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe (AP) _ After a week of hostilities and
war threats, a reticent Congolese president sat down with his
adversary from Rwanda within sight of one of the world's grandest
water falls.
	   Congo's President Laurent Kabila and Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu joined five other regional leaders for a day-long summit
on the grim conflict brewing in Congo, formerly known as Zaire.
	   At an informal buffet dinner Friday night, the two leaders
developed a ``rapport'' that showed there was serious intent to
find a solution, said the spokesman for Zimbabwe President Robert
Mugabe.
	   ``The signs are promising,'' George Chiramba told reporters.
	   But a Congolese advisor said Kabila was not hopeful of any
results, and came only out of respect for Mugabe.
	   Kabila waved off questions on the way to a morning meeting.
Bizimungu said things were going ``well.'' The presidents were
still meeting four hours later.
	   A key faction that supported Kabila in last year's ouster of the
late corrupt Zairian dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, has broken away
and occupied a wide strip of eastern Congo.
	   Called the Bunyamulenge, the group has close ethnic ties with
the Tutsis, who govern neighboring Rwanda.
	   Kabila, who claims Rwanda is supporting the rebels, has
threatened war and Bizimungu said his government would return any
hostilities.
	   The resurgence of conflict in the vast Congo and the prospect of
civil war looming in its equally vast and mineral rich neighbor to
the south, Angola, has alarmed regional leaders.
	   The fighting threatens the spirit of peace in southern Africa
that rose after apartheid's end in South Africa in 1994.
	   The optimism grew with Kabila's ouster of Mobutu. And until
recent months, it even appeared that Angola would carry out a 1994
peace accord to end a 20-year civil war.
	   Four other presidents _ Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, who
instigated the summit; Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania; Sam Nujoma of
Namibia; and Frederick Chiluba of Zambia _ also sat at Saturday's
meeting, with their foreign advisors.
	   Noticeably absent was South Africa's President Mandela. It was
not clear if he received an invitation.

	   PENGZEMING, China (AP) _ Peng Zejia looks after a dike that
protects his neighbors' houses. His own, on the wrong side of the
flood barrier, is under 1.5 meters (4 1-2 feet) of water.
	   The rising Xincha River in south-central China's Hunan province,
linked to the rain-swollen Yangtze River, forced more than 100
members of the Peng clan from their homes six weeks ago.
	   Yet Peng still puts in 12-hour shifts, squatting under a plastic
lean-to in the blazing sun, watching for erosion in an earthen dam
that can do him no good.
	   But the 55-year-old schoolteacher expects nothing in return for
his diligence.
	   ``We all have a responsibility. One day it's my turn, the next
day it's someone else,'' said Peng, whose family has lived here for
generations and gave its name to the village _ Pengzeming.
	   Pengzeming is a microcosm of the sacrifices and volunteer labor
routinely demanded along the fickle Yangtze, the abundant waters of
which irrigate China's farming heartland. Nearly every summer the
river becomes a raging torrent that devastates towns and villages.
	   With flooding worse than it has been in decades, millions of
civilians and soldiers have been drafted this year to maintain
dikes. Huts like Peng's are a common sight throughout central
China.
	   Authorities have called for an even more drastic sacrifice from
330,000 people living some 120 kilometers (75 miles) northwest of
Pengzeming. They have been evacuated in preparation for the
possibility that their homes and farmland will be flooded
intentionally to protect cities down river.
	   The plan calls for blowing up dikes and opening floodgates in
Hubei province, turning a plain covered with farming communities
into a giant basin to help drain the Yangtze. Disaster officials
hope lower river levels will take the pressure off weakened
embankments downstream that protect areas such as Wuhan, a major
industrial city of 7 million.
	   Before the water began to rise in Pengzeming in June, local
leaders handed out shovels and organized teams to reinforce dikes
that run for kilometers (miles) along the Xincha River.
	   ``We spent days filling sandbags and working on the dikes,''
said Peng, who was sitting with his cousin, Peng Guo'an.
	   As the water rose, the Peng clan moved furniture onto the dike,
where it stands covered in plastic. After their homes were flooded,
Peng Zejia moved with four other families into the primary school
where he teaches.
	   By now, the river has tripled in width to 1,500 meters (yards),
taking on the appearance of a lake.
	   Despite having to flee, Peng Zejia said local leaders did a good
job organizing emergency work.
	   ``They gave us all this sand for free,'' he said, pointing to
piles of sand and basketball-size rocks along the dike, ready to
pour into spots weakened by rain or waves.
	   The river has risen to within one meter (three feet) of the top
of the dike where Peng and his cousin sit.
	   Behind the barrier, the rooftops of one-story houses are below
the river level. Runoff from torrential summer rains fills rice
paddies and vegetable plots, with nowhere to drain until the river
subsides.
	   Snow-white cranes wade through fields looking for insects while
tawny cattle graze on the grassy slopes of the dike.
	   Many villagers are going about life normally, looking after
children or tending the few dry fields. They are used to living
through floods.
	   ``Three years out of every four it's like this: 1996, 1997, 1998
_ all flooded,'' said Peng Guo'an, 45, ticking off years on his
fingers. ``But this year is the worst.''

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban militia on
Saturday claimed to have entered Mazar-e-Sharif following an
onslaught of rockets and bombs, capturing the last major prize in
its four-year war against a fractious northern alliance.
	   A spokesman for the anti-Taliban alliance confirmed Taliban
fighters were in Mazar-e-Sharif, but said they did not have
complete control. The spokesman for Hezb-e-Wahadat, a partner in
the alliance who refused to be named, reported fierce street
fighting in the city.
	   The fall of Mazar-e-Sharif would be a major blow to an
opposition pushed to a dwindling corner of northern Afghanistan,
and would give the Taliban control of virtually all of Afghanistan.
	   Taliban spokesman Abdul Ramana Hutaki said opponents retreated
south of Mazar-e-Sharif to Bamyan Province after the Taliban
attacked from the west early Saturday morning. Taliban troops also
had been poised east of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Hutaki said the entire city was under Taliban control, but Abdul
Rahof, another Taliban official, said both sides were still
battling for the airport on the eastern edge of town, with Taliban
jets unleashing bombs. Neither had details on casualties or the
number of prisoners taken.
	   Taliban fighters briefly held Mazar-e-Sharif last May,
retreating after street battles that left several hundred Taliban
soldiers dead. It is believed as many as 2,000 Taliban prisoners of
war were later massacred.
	   The Islamic Republic News Agency in Iran, which had reported a
Taliban victory even before Taliban officials claimed it, described
a dramatic battle for the city Saturday.
	   ``Continuous explosions are being heard in the city and there
are sporadic acts of resistance in the streets,'' the Iranian news
agency reported from Mazar-e-Sharif. ``Various districts are
burning and a large number of houses have been destroyed.''
	   In Iran, which has backed the anti-Taliban coalition, Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi called on the Taliban to protect the
well-being of staff at the Iranian consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif.
IRNA later reported the consulate had been occupied by Taliban
troops, but had no details.

Low-key security in Myanmar; Suu Kyi party refuses meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES 7th graf with protests in Japan, Malaysia, Bangladesh

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military regime said Saturday
that the Southeast Asian nation was calm on the 10th anniversary of
a pro-democracy uprising that was crushed by bullets and bayonets,
while exiles marked the date with demonstrations for democracy.
	   The government, criticized internationally for a recent six-day
standoff with Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi on a road outside the
capital, announced it had complied with her request to remove a
security detail from her compound.
	   Authorities also expressed hope that Suu Kyi's National League
for Democracy would accept an invitation to send officials other
than Suu Kyi to meet government representatives for talks.
	   The opposition party, fearing government attempts to divide its
leadership, rejected that invitation Friday.
	   The anniversary marked the day ten years ago when months of
simmering discontent in the capital exploded into a nationwide
protest against military rule. The dictatorship changed leaders,
but the demonstrations were crushed. An estimated 3,000 people
died.
	   The anniversary comes two weeks ahead of the Aug. 21 deadline
that Suu Kyi has set for the army to finally turn over power to a
parliament elected in 1990. The military refused to hand over power
after the opposition captured 80 percent of the seats in the vote.
	   Anticipation that the anniversary could build pressure for
change has been seized upon by opposition groups outside Myanmar,
also known as Burma. Hundreds of exiles from Myanmar staged
protests in Thailand, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Japan.
	   But Yangon, the capital of Myanmar, was calm.
	   Security checkpoints were visible around Yangon University, the
site of much student unrest in 1996. But no tanks or soldiers were
visible and there was no sign of panic-buying at markets. Schools
and businesses were open.
	   ``There are no demonstrations in Yangon or anywhere else in the
country,'' a government official, on condition of anonymity, said
in a faxed statement to The Associated Press in Bangkok.
	   Meanwhile, Suu Kyi urged her countrymen in a videotaped message
seen in Bangkok on Friday not to give up hope that the military,
which has ruled since 1962, would relinquish power.
	   ``We will win,'' said Suu Kyi, who has spent most of the past
decade under house arrest or restriction to her home. ``Do not lose
heart. We will never give up, so don't give up.''
	   The government official said that security personnel had been
withdrawn from Suu Kyi's compound at her request, but given her
prominence, she ``will always be provided with all necessary
security and protection.''
	   In a speech reported in official newspapers, Lt. Gen. Khin
Nyunt, a member of the ruling State Peace and Development Council,
accused internal traitors _ widely believed to mean Suu Kyi and her
followers _ of trying to break the country apart ``under the
pretext of democracy and human rights.''

Catholics clash with Protestant marchers in central Londonderry
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with sectarian clashes; edits; no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police in flak jackets used
armored cars Saturday to separate Catholic protesters and members
of a Protestant fraternal order staging their annual parade through
this predominantly Catholic city.
	   The confrontation came despite an agreement between the
Apprentice Boys and Catholic residents aimed at eliminating the
clashes that have dogged the parade in recent years. Earlier, about
400 local Apprentice Boys marched peacefully around the city's
medieval walls.
	   But as the first of more than 10,000 Apprentice Boys and bands
from across Northern Ireland passed along one edge of the Diamond,
the central square inside the city walls, about 100 Catholics on
the other side jeered and hurled stones and drink bottles. Some
shouted ''Orange bastards'' _ a reference to Northern Ireland's
largest Protestant brotherhood, the Orange Order _ provoking jeers
from Protestant onlookers.
	   Hastily donning their flak jackets, police parked armored
vehicles in a line between the marchers and the protesters. There
were no immediate reports of injuries.
	   In previous years there have been showdowns over whether the
Apprentice Boys brotherhood _ founded to commemorate Londonderry's
1689 defense against Catholics _ has a right to parade annually in
Northern Ireland's second city.
	   Two years ago the British army barricaded the walls to prevent
the Apprentice Boys from marching there, fearing Catholic riots
otherwise. At the close of last year's march, Protestants fought
with police in the Diamond.
	   But the mood across Northern Ireland moved toward compromise
last month after a stalemate over another blocked Protestant march
led to three young Catholic boys being burned to death in a
sectarian arson attack.
	   Apprentice Boys leaders and Catholic protesters from the Bogside
district alongside the city walls agreed that local Apprentice Boys
could march atop the walls as usual, but no bands from outside
Londonderry would be allowed to circle the Diamond.
	   Such fife-and-drum bands _ dubbed ``kick the pope'' bands
because of their propensity for loud, sectarian tunes _ cause most
anger to Catholics, who have long resented the annual Apprentice
Boys demonstrations.
	   There were few Catholics around as local Apprentice Boys, many
in their traditional uniform of crimson vestments, suits and bowler
hats, stepped off for their march around the city walls in a light
rain Saturday.
	   The Black Skull fifes and drums of Glasgow, Scotland, was the
only band permitted to accompany the marchers, which included the
city's hard-line Protestant mayor, Joe Miller. Another prominent
Protestant politician, David Brewster, carried a ceremonial sword.
	   The band didn't play as agreed until the parade turned away from
the Bogside to continue circling the 2-mile-round (3 km) walls.
	   The marchers then joined four bands and a few hundred spectators
at the Diamond, where Apprentice Boys leader Alistair Simpson laid
a wreath to British and Irish dead in two world wars.
	   In the mass parade later, thousands of Apprentice Boys marched
from the city center across the River Foyle into Londonderry's
predominantly Protestant east side and back again.
	   Thirteen senior Apprentice Boys _ representing the 13 apprentice
workers who bolted the city's gates against the forces of Catholic
King James II three centuries ago _ laid more wreaths in the
Diamond.
	   ''The problem hasn't been the right of Protestants to express
their culture, it's the size and scale of their demonstrations that
intimidates,'' said Robin Percival, secretary of the Bogside
Residents Group protesters, who watched the parade.
	   `` When 15,000 (Protestant) loyalists march into a city which is
overwhelmingly (Catholic) nationalist, that creates real tension.''

Independence fighters and border guard die in border shootout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ An army border guard and a number of
Kosovo Albanian guerrillas died in a clashes along Yugoslavia's
border with Albania, media reported Saturday.
	   An army statement released by state news agency Tanjug said the
conflict occurred when a group of ethnic Albanian guerrillas tried
Friday to enter Albania from Kosovo province, where they have been
fighting for independence from Serbia, which together with
Montenegro makes up Yugoslavia.
	   A 27-year old Yugoslav army border guard and an unknown number
of ethnic Albanians died in the shootout, Tanjug said. There was no
immediate report from Albanian sources and the reports could not be
independently confirmed.
	   Other Albanians reportedly fled to the nearby village of Junik,
which remains in the hands of the pro-independence Kosovo
Liberation Army, following a heavy crackdown by Serb forces in the
past two weeks.

Body of Taiwan politician killed in mainland China flown home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI (AP) _ The body of a Taiwanese politician whose death in
a kidnapping on the Chinese mainland sparked an exchange of angry
words between arch-rivals Taiwan and China was flown back to her
home city Saturday.
	   City officials in southern Kaohsiung and politicians from across
Taiwan's political spectrum greeted the casket of 32-year old city
councilor Lin Ti-chuan.
	   Relatives and friends waved bright yellow sunflowers as they
followed the casket, led by a Taoist priest, to a makeshift tent
near the airport where a memorial service was held for Lin.
	   Liu Gangqi, deputy secretary-general of Beijing's semiofficial
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, saw Lin's
family members and relatives off at Beijing airport earlier before
the body was flown back to Taiwan via Hong Kong.
	   Li, 32, was found death on July 29 in a hospital in the northern
Chinese town of Haicheng.
	   China's official Xinhua News Agency reported earlier that three
suspects have been arrested in connection with Lin's death, but
that the man suspected of plotting the crime remained at large.
	   Xinua quoted one of the arrested suspects as confessing that he
was part of a gang of five men who abducted Lin and her boyfriend
Wei Dang-kung on July 27.
	   Lin began having trouble breathing after her captors gave her
several injections and the gang took her to a hospital in Haicheng,
where she died, the suspect was quoted as saying.
	   The kidnapping had been an attempt to force payment of business
debts owed by Wei, who escaped and alerted police.
	   Lin's killing prompted scathing comments from both sides of the
Taiwan Straits _ threatening the delicate and politically tenuous
relations between Taipei and Beijing.
	   Taiwanese public opinion was quick to accuse Beijing of
neglecting the safety of Taiwanese nationals in the mainland.
	   A scathing commentary by Xinhua on Saturday accused Taiwan's
main opposition Democratic Progressive Party _ of which Lin was a
member _ of ``totally misguided comments concerning the mainland's
indifference over the life and property of compatriots'' from
Taiwan.
	   A survey of 1,130 people conducted by the Taiwan's United Daily
News on Friday showed that that 60 percent favored increased
exchange with the mainland, while only 18 percent wanted fewer
contacts. The poll had a margin of error of 2.9 percent.
	   Despite the harsh words, both Taiwan and Beijing have sought to
prevent the incident from slowing gradual movement toward a renewal
of their dialogue, broken off in 1995.
	   Taiwan's semiofficial Straits Exchange Foundation had recorded
19 cases of violence against Taiwanese businessmen in China so far
this year, compared with 27 cases for all of 1997.
	   Since 1991, the semiofficial body handling exchanges with China,
said it has handled 184 cases of Taiwanese kidnapped, intimidated,
or threatened with extortion, of whom 25 were killed.

Ukrainian president abolishes Chernobyl Fund payments
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian employers have been freed from
making payments to the state-run Chernobyl Fund, raising questions
about the government's ability to deal with the aftermath of the
Chernobyl nuclear disaster.
	   Last month, President Leonid Kuchma halved employers' payments
to the Chernobyl Fund to 5 percent of their workers' salaries. On
Saturday, the presidential press service announced that he had
eliminated them altogether.
	   The president also decreased Social Security Fund payments by
employers to 3 percent from the current 4 percent. Kuchma's press
service stressed that the order would ease tax pressure on
Ukrainian businesses and encourage economic development.
	   The step was part of a series of economic reforms launched
recently by Kuchma and his government in an attempt to win an
international aid package and provide for more foreign investment.
	   The government set up the Chernobyl Fund to respond to the
consequences of the 1986 explosion and fire that destroyed reactor
No. 4 at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The explosion sent a
radioactive cloud over much of Europe in the world's worst nuclear
accident.
	   The presidential press service insisted that the new scheme
would not affect Chernobyl victims. It said the Cabinet would
finance social payments and other measures directly from the
budget.
	   But Chernobyl victims' groups doubt that the cash-strapped
government will be able to help them. The groups began protesting
last month when Kuchma halved the payments. They plan a major
demonstration on Ukraine's Aug. 24 Independence Day.
	   The Chernobyl tax allowed the government to collect over dlrs 1
billion annually. Now, Chernobyl groups say the government will
have no money to finance medical treatment and compensate those who
suffered from the 1986 disaster.
	   Emergency Situations Minister Valery Kalchenko also has warned
that the changes in the Chernobyl tax could make it much more
difficult for the government to deal with the aftermath of the
catastrophe.
	   The Chernobyl Fund owed 458 million hryvna (dlrs 229 million) in
social payments as of the beginning of 1998, said Kalchenko.
	   The government estimates that over 10 percent of Ukrainian
territory has been contaminated by radiation. About 3,600
Ukrainians who took part in the Chernobyl cleanup effort have died
from radiation exposure.
	   Kuchma recently estimated Chernobyl's total cost to Ukraine at
dlrs 130 billion.

China anxiously waits for possible flood diversion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with setback for plugging efforts in 4th-6th grafs,
misery for evacuees in 9th-12th grafs.
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Flood workers struggled Saturday to plug a major
breach along China's raging Yangtze River, while hundreds of
thousands of people upstream waited to see if their farmland and
rural homes would be deliberately inundated to safeguard
densely-populated cities.
	   Some 330,000 people have been evacuated from an area in central
Hubei province that would be flooded if the government gives a
last-ditch order to dynamite dikes and divert water away from the
Yangtze to protect its weakened embankments downstream, officials
said.
	   Those embankments protect rich farmland and cities, including
Wuhan's 7 million people, but threaten to give way after weeks of
torrential rain and record-high waters. Officials fear a flood
crest surging down the river could cause them to collapse.
	   One such levee partially collapsed Friday in Jiujiang, along the
Yangtze in southeast China, releasing a torrent of water that by
Saturday had submerged 4 square kilometers (1.6 square miles) of
the city of 500,000 people, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
	   The breach widened to 60 meters (nearly 200 feet) across
Saturday, even after disaster workers sank eight boats loaded with
rock, as well as thousands of tons of rice, coal and soybeans, into
the gap to plug it, Xinhua said.
	   No casualties were reported, but a shortage of plugging
materials and a power cut hampered efforts to staunch the flow,
Xinhua said. More than 30,000 soldiers and civilians were drafted
in to help, it said.
	   To take pressure off the Yangtze embankments, officials said
preparations were in place Saturday to dynamite dikes and open
floodgates to divert waters into Hubei's Jingjiang flood plain. The
move would require the approval of China's State Council, or
Cabinet.
	   ``We're prepared,'' said Chen Zhichao, director of the Jingjiang
Flood Diversion Management Bureau. ``When the order comes, we are
ready to carry it out.''
	   But authorities were struggling to house, feed and provide
medical care for the 330,000 people evacuated from the area,
another official at the bureau said.
	   Some people were without shelter, others were living under
plastic lean-tos, and medicine supplies were running short, said
the official, who gave just his surname, Yuan.
	   He described the situation as ``miserable'' and said the
problems would take days to solve.
	   ``It's really difficult for the people who moved out,'' he said.
If their homes are flooded, ``they'll have nothing left,'' he
added.
	   The area was last used to divert the Yangtze in 1954, when
floods killed more than 30,000 people.
	   Military police and soldiers combed the area Saturday to move
those reluctant to leave, said another local flood official, who
gave his surname, Tian. The area was placed under curfew Friday and
only military personnel were permitted to enter.
	   For the order to be given for deliberate flooding, water levels
on the Yangtze would have to reach the record high of 45 meters
(148.5 feet) at Shashi city, north of the flood diversion area,
Xinhua reported.
	   As the flood crest passed the city Saturday morning, the river
peaked at a record 44.95 meters (148.3 feet) _ just five
centimeters (two inches) below the mark _ and then began to drop,
Xinhua said.
	   Unexpected breaches on two smaller, secondary dikes downstream
helped lower the river's water level, it said.
	   So far this year, more than 2,000 people have died in summer
floods that began in June and have so far affected 240 million
people, a fifth of the population, to varying degrees. And the
death toll continues to rise.
	   At least 41 people were killed and 156 injured in rainstorms
which battered Chongqing city in southwest China on Thursday and
Friday, Xinhua said. It said 41 others were missing.

Poland lifts suspension of soccer committee right before deadline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The sports minister reinstated Poland's
soccer administrators late Friday after they agreed to an
investigation into allegations of mismanagement, meeting a deadline
set by the World and European Soccer Federations.
	   FIFA and UEFA had refused to extend a midnight deadline for
lifting suspensions on the Polish Football Association, which would
mean that Polish teams could not take part in upcoming
international competitions.
	   At a news conference Saturday, Sports Minister Jacek Debski said
he sent a fax to the world soccer group, FIFA, in Zurich,
Switzerland 15 minutes before deadline informing them of lifting
the suspensions, imposed in May.
	   ``Conditions set by FIFA and UEFA were met and I don't see why
those institutions would make decisions unfavorable for Polish
soccer,'' said Debski.
	   Polish Soccer Federation administrators agreed to a probe of
mismanagement, due to begin on Monday, only a half an hour before
the FIFA deadline, Debski said.
	   The administrators had previously claimed they were independent
of state controls and had refused to accept the sports ministry's
appointment of a control board supervisor to examine their records.
	   Debski said he now expects voluntary dismissal of Soccer
Federation President Marian Dziurowicz, which would open the way
for reforming Polish soccer.
	   Poland's national team, which achieved successes in 1970s and
early 1980s, has not qualified for soccer's World Cup since 1982.
Debski blames administrators and soccer activists for corruption
among players and referees, lack of training facilities and
programs.
	   Nine of Poland's first-division soccer clubs had said that if
Dziurowicz did not quit they would not take part in first division
competition.
	   Polish soccer activists are expected to meet Tuesday to call for
the general meeting of the national soccer federation.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Ahmad Tarawneh, a former aide to Jordanian
kings who served repeatedly as a Cabinet minister, died Saturday at
age 78, the Royal Palace and prime minister's office announced.
	   Tarawneh, who also had been a member of the upper and low houses
of Parliament, died in his hometown of Kerak, 125 kilometers (75
miles) south of the capital Amman. The announcements gave no cause
of death except old age.
	   He was the father of Fayez Tarawneh, current chief of the Royal
Court. He held that position three times himself, in 1950 under
King Hussein grandfather, King Abdullah, and in 1960 and 1970 under
Hussein.
	   Tarawneh served as minister of justice, agriculture, transport,
trade, public works, finance, defense and interior at various times
from 1950 to 1972.
	   King Hussein ordered Tarawneh to be buried in the Royal Cemetery
in Amman on Sunday.

Landslides, floods kill at least seven in Korea

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Fresh rains fell on South Korea's
already saturated capital Saturday, triggering new mud slides and
floods that killed at least seven people and forced tens of
thousands to flee their homes.
	   Among those killed Saturday were two U.S. Army soldiers who were
buried under a mud slide at their camp south of Seoul. Twelve
others were injured.
	   Ten of the injured soldiers were hospitalized in stable
condition and two were treated and released, said Col. Carl Kropf,
a military spokesman. He declined to give further details pending
an investigation and notification of relatives.
	   All of the soldiers were with the 304th Signal Battalion of the
8th Army's 1st Signal Brigade, Kropf said.
	   Saturday's deaths brought to 212 the number of people killed by
a storm front that swept in from China seven days ago and wreaked
havoc in widely separated parts of South Korea.
	   The death toll was exceeded only by the estimated 350 killed by
a typhoon in 1987. Ninety-four people are still missing and feared
dead from this week's series of floods.
	   Damage estimates ranged from dlrs 200 million to dlrs 2 billion.
	   Many of those forced to flee their homes Saturday had evacuated
them in the face of floods Thursday. Only hours after their return
on Friday, they again had to seek higher ground because of
torrential overnight rains.
	   Weathermen had a dismal warning: More heavy rain was expected
Saturday night and Sunday.
	   With heavy rains causing dams upstream to discharge water from
swollen reservoirs, officials issued a flood warning along the
downstream Han River, which bisects Seoul.
	   Water levels in the Han River were two meters below the mark
that could trigger further massive evacuations in the city of more
than 10 million people.
	   At least two Han River tributaries had already overflowed,
submerging some 30,000 homes in and around Seoul, the Home
Ministry's Disaster Relief Headquarters said.
	   Officials using loudspeakers were urging residents in low-lying
districts in Seoul to evacuate. Lightening crisscrossed the Seoul
sky, disrupting electricity and telephone service and making the
evacuation more difficult.
	   Soldiers and rescue workers picking through flood debris for
people still missing from Thursday's flooding were ordered to
retreat to higher ground.
	   ``We are fighting with guerrilla rain showers. They come and
dump and go away. We can not predict where they will appear again.
It's impossible to predict how much more damage we have to
sustain,'' said Won Yoo-jin, a government relief official.
	   The deluge was brought by the same storm system that a week
earlier sent flash floods raging down mountain valleys in the
southern tip of the Korean peninsula, killing 67 campers and
leaving 29 missing and feared dead.
	   About 1,000 U.S. soldiers were evacuated from several small
camps near the border with communist North Korea, said Sgt. Major
Billy Foster of the 2nd Infantry Division. Foster called flood
damage to the camps the worst ``I've seen in one place in my
30-year Army career.''
	   The deluge wrecked entire villages. Streams were clotted with
overturned cars. Alleys were piled with sodden furniture pulled
from homes knee deep in water.

Swiss cycling chief wants leniency against disgraced riders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Three top Swiss riders disgraced by the
drug scandal that has rocked cycling should be treated leniently,
the president of the Swiss Cyclists Federation was quoted as saying
Saturday.
	   ``We should give these riders a second chance,'' Hugo Steinegger
said in a newspaper interview. ``They don't deserve a two-year
suspension,'' he said, in reference to Alex Zuelle, Laurent Dufaux
and Armin Meier.
	   The three men were members of the Festina team expelled from the
scandal-rocked Tour de France for using the banned
performance-boosting hormone, EPO. They confessed to taking the
drug.
	   Steinegger said he hoped for a ``humane decision,'' from the
Swiss federation's anti-doping commission. The commission, headed
by Raymond Von Daeniken, will pronounce sanctions after receiving a
report from cycling's international governing body.
	   In the absence of universal rules from the International Cycling
Union (UCI), each individual federation is responsible for deciding
on sanctions against its own nationals.
	   Steinegger _ who has criticized the lack of international rules
_ said the Swiss and French federations would try to harmonize
their standards to ensure riders from both countries were treated
equally.
	   The UCI is due to meet next week to examine the issue of doping
and come up with a new strategy against the problem. Several
cyclists, including Tour de France winner Marco Pantani, are
expected to put the case of the riders.
	   Steinegger called for a clampdown against ``doping dealers''
including trainers, team leaders and doctors involved in banned
substances.
	   ``The riders are often only instruments of this sad system,''
Steinegger told the Tribune de Geneve newspaper. In addition to
heading the Swiss federation, Steinegger is organizer of the Tour
de Suisse.
	   He said Zuelle, Dufaux and Meier had made a serious mistake.
	   ``But they are not criminals,'' he said. ``They had the courage
to tell the truth. We should take that into account and not crush
them with a disproportionate sanction.''

Goh urges Singapore to overcome deepest economic crisis in modern
</HEADLINE>
history

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's prime minister urged his country on
Saturday to rally and overcome the challenges facing the tiny
island republic as it prepares to mark its independence anniversary
amid growing economic uncertainty.
	   With the prospects of a deep and possibly prolonged recession on
the horizon, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said the obstacles
confronting Singapore ``are the most formidable since independence
in 1965.''
	   Addressing the nation live on television in his annual national
day message, a somber Goh outlined a litany of economic problems
besetting the Southeast Asian nation and regional economic powers.
	   ``If Japan does not succeed in jump-starting its economy, it
will invest less in the region, buy less from us, and worsen the
recession in the rest of Asia,'' he warned.
	   Noting that demand for Singapore's goods and services from its
traditional Asian trading partners has dropped sharply, he reminded
the country that ``when our external demand falls, we are severely
affected.''
	   External demand accounts for about 70 percent of the island
republic's economic outlet, he said.
	   Compounding the problem is the relative strength of the
Singapore dollar against its neighbor's currencies. It has
depreciated about 20 percent against the greenback since the start
of the Asian financial crisis more than a year ago, compared to
drops of 35 to 80 percent in the currencies of Singapore's Asian
competitors.
	   ``Our neighbor's weaker currencies have made their wages and
other costs much cheaper that our's,'' said Goh. ``This has made
their exports to the U.S. and Europe more competitive.''
	   Domestic problems are becoming more dire too.
	   Unemployment, layoffs, bankruptcies and business failures are
all on the rise, and the government has warned that these figures
will reach record levels before the crisis eases.
	   Property values and the stock market have seen sharp corrections
over the past year, and every indication of continued weakness in
the immediate to medium-term future.
	   While the cause of Singapore's woes are directly linked to
regional developments, Goh argued that the country is not helpless.
	   ``We can counter the impact of the regional crisis on us, up to
a point, by going into budget deficit for a short period, and by
taking more measures to reduce business costs,'' he said.
	   A two billion Singapore dollar (dlrs 1.14 billion) package of
special measures to cushion the economy's fall was announced in
June, resulting in the first budget deficit for the island republic
in over a decade.
	   Goh said Singapore must be prepared for another budget deficit
next year, but cautioned that the government must be careful in how
it dips into the country's considerable reserves.
	   He said Singapore must continue to trim costs for businesses,
through reduced wages, lower taxes and levies, and cheaper land and
rentals.
	   The government will also continue to accelerate the pace of
infrastructure spending and attract foreign investment.
	   Repeating a frequent refrain from the leadership in the last few
years, Goh said that workers must be retrained in modern skills to
ensure the nation's competitiveness.
	   ``The decisive long-term factor is the quality of our people,
how well trained and educated we are, how resolutely and
resourcefully we tackle our problems.''

First Lady, Hollywood stars support Bosnian women's rights

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ U.S. First Lady, Hillary
Rodham Clinton, Glenn Close and Marisa Tomei joined voices Saturday
with representatives of local and international women's association
in supporting the rights of women in post-war Bosnia.
	   In an effort to raise awareness about women's rights,
particularly sexual violence against women, and to mobilize
resources for women war victims in the region, Glenn Close and
Marisa Tomei traveled to Sarajevo to join leading Bosnian actors in
a production of Eve Ensler's Broadway play ``Necessary Targets,''
an account of women traumatized by the war in former Yugoslavia.
	   Before the Saturday evening performance, the women are to meet
on the Suada Dilberovic bridge and cast flowers into the Miljacka
river in commemoration of all women killed in the war.
	   The project, called ``Suada's Bridge,'' was named after Suada
Dilberovic, a medical student who was killed in April 1992 by
Bosnian Serb sharpshooters who opened fire on peace demonstrators.
	   Suada was officially proclaimed the first victim of the Bosnian
3 and 1/2-year war, and the bridge where she was killed was later
named after her.
	   It is not known exactly how many tens of thousands of women
there are among the estimated 200,000 dead and missing from the
war.
	   In a public letter written for the occasion, Mrs. Clinton called
upon Bosnian women to use the upcoming September general elections
and cast votes rejecting ``ethnic tensions of the past in favor of
a united, multi-ethnic Bosnia where your families can prosper.''
	   ``You can be a voice for reconciliation and cooperation in
building a better life together,'' she said in the letter obtained
by The Associated Press. ``The Dayton Agreement helped end the
death and despair in Bosnia-Herzegovina. You can help lead to a
future of peace and promise.''
	   Some 200 women from across the former Yugoslavia are
participating in the project, organized by Columbia University in
New York City. In addition to the performance, it will also include
a round table discussion with representatives of women and Bosnian
politicians.
	   Among the topics are the issue of organized rape as a war crime.
In 1996, the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal ruled
that the rapes of Muslim women in Bosnia were gender-related war
crimes.

Ukrainian authorities detain former policemen in bus shooting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Five former Russian and Ukrainian police
officers are suspected of carrying out an armed attack on a bus
packed with Vietnamese traders and wounding a policeman who guarded
it, a news report said Saturday.
	   The attack took place last Wednesday when the bus with about 50
Vietnamese businessmen on board was traveling from the northeastern
town of Kharkiv to Odessa on the Black Sea coast, the Interfax news
agency said.
	   One of the attackers, who wore a police uniform, allegedly
signaled for the bus to stop and the other four burst in, demanding
that the passengers surrender their money and other valuables.
	   A shootout then broke out between the attackers and a police
guard on the bus.
	   The guard killed one and wounded another attacker and himself
sustained several wounds, Interfax said. The Vietnamese disarmed
two other attackers and police seized the last member of the group
who tried to flee.
	   Three cars, an assault rifle, a pistol and other weaponry and
equipment were seized from the suspected criminals.
	   The group consisted of four Russian citizens and one Ukrainian,
all former police officers, including an ex-Interior Ministry major
from Russia's border region of Belgorod who headed the group, it
said.
	   The report did not specify which of the attackers was killed.

Pakistan secures dlrs 1.5 loan from Saudi banks, officials say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ A group of Saudi-based banks agreed
Saturday on a dlrs 1.5 billion loan for Islamabad, bankers said,
providing a shot in the arm for Pakistan's ailing economy.
	   Agreement on the loan followed recent talks in Saudi Arabia by
Pakistan's newly appointed adviser for finance and economic
affairs, Hafiz Pasha, said bank officials who spoke on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   They said final arrangements for the loan package would be
worked out when Pasha returns to the kingdom later this month. The
package has been put together by the Islamic Development Bank,
based in the Saudi port city of Jiddah.
	   Pasha had asked for commercial loans, not economic assistance,
the officials said.
	   Pakistan, which has been hard pressed by anti-nuclear sanctions
imposed by the United States, Japan and other industrial nations,
could seek a moratorium on the payment of its dlrs 30 billion
foreign debt.
	   Analysts say the foremost concern for the country's economic
managers remains that crushing debt and lack of foreign exchange.
	   Pakistan was thought to have been looking for oil on a deferred
payment basis from Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich Gulf states, but
there have been no signs that these countries agreed to the
request.
	   Pasha was appointed adviser Thursday in a major Cabinet
reshuffle, replacing Sartaj Aziz, the new foreign minister.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif now holds the additional role of
finance minister, with Pasha as his top official and de facto
minister.

Italian Olympic officials summon outspoken Roma coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian Olympic Committee officials have summoned
for questioning Roma coach Zdenek Zeman, who has alleged that a
number of top league Italian soccer players might use medicine to
stimulate muscle growth.
	   Zeman, a Czech who coaches the Serie A team, will face the
officials on Tuesday, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.
	   In interviews with some Italian daily newspapers and the Italian
newsweekly Espresso, Zeman said he was amazed by the quick muscular
development of some players such as Alessandro Del Piero and
Gianluca Vialli.
	   Zeman never mentioned doping substances openly. He always
referred to medicines.
	   On Friday, Del Piero, a Juventus star, instructed his agent to
sue for libel.
	   Vialli, a former player of Juventus and currently Chelsea's
player-coach in the English Premier League, angrily refused to
comment on Zeman's allegations.

<TEXT>
	   LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police in riot gear used
armored cars Saturday to separate Catholic protesters and members
of a Protestant fraternal order staging their annual parade through
this predominantly Catholic city.
	   The confrontation came despite an agreement between the
Apprentice Boys and Catholic residents aimed at eliminating the
clashes that have dogged the parade in recent years. Earlier, about
400 local Apprentice Boys marched peacefully around the city's
medieval walls.
	   But as the first of more than 10,000 Apprentice Boys and bands
from across Northern Ireland passed along one edge of the Diamond,
the central square inside the city walls, some 100 Catholics on the
other side jeered and hurled stones and drink bottles. Some shouted
``Orange bastards'' _ a reference to Northern Ireland's largest
Protestant brotherhood, the Orange Order _ provoking jeers from
Protestant onlookers.
	   Hastily donning flak jackets, police parked armored vehicles
between the marchers and the protesters.
	   As the Catholic crowd swelled to around 200, the mood got
increasingly ugly and some Protestants broke away from the parade
to throw bottles and stones. Police later put on full riot gear and
formed a line to keep the two sides apart.

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Talk of a third cut in OPEC output is
``premature,'' a leading Kuwaiti economist said Saturday.
	   If members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
respect the commitments they made in March and June to curb
production, and if producers outside the cartel agree to an
additional reduction in output, a third cut would not be required,
Jassem al-Saadoun said in a weekly report published by his company,
Al-Shall Economic Consultants.
	   Future agreements would be ``meaningless'' if OPEC producers do
not abide by these ones, he warned.
	   Al-Saadoun was reacting to remarks by Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheik
Saud al-Sabah who said last week that oil producers would have to
reduce their output further if the price of Brent blend crude
futures remains below dlrs 17 a barrel in November.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The Housing Bank of Jordan, newly converted
to a commercial bank, increased its profits by 190 percent during
the first half of this year, its chairman of the board said in
remarks published Saturday.
	   The state-owned bank was a savings and loans association until
May 1997 when the government granted it a commercial bank license
in order to allow it to compete with other banks in Jordan.
	   Chairman Zuhair Khoury said the profits for the first half
reached 18.4 million Jordanian dinars (dlrs 25.9 million),
newspapers reported.
	   Khoury said the bank expects profits to reach 30 million dinars
(dlrs 42.2 million) by the end of this month owing to last week's
sale of its shares in the Arab Banking Corporation, which netted
6.3 million dinars (dlrs 8.9 million).
	   ____
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Internet companies in Lebanon have
combined earnings of about dlrs 1 million a month, thanks to the
large number of subscribers, the Post, Telephone and
Telecommunications Ministry said in remarks published Saturday.
	   Abdel-Monem Youssef, director general of the PTT Ministry's
maintenance and investment department, said of the 85,000 Internet
subscribers in the Arab world, no fewer than 40,000 were in
Lebanon.
	   ``The Internet situation in Lebanon, compared to Arab countries,
is very satisfactory,'' Youssef was quoted as saying by the
newspaper An-Nahar and others. He put Lebanon's success down to its
link up to the Internet in early 1996.
	   He expected Internet charge rates to drop considerably once
companies hook up to the PTT lines.

Kabila sits down in talks with Rwandan foe

	   VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe (AP) _ After a week of hostilities and
war threats, Congo's president and his Rwandan adversary sat down
for talks Saturday but appeared to make little progress.
	   Congo's President Laurent Kabila and Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu joined five other regional leaders for a summit on the
grim conflict brewing in Congo, formerly known as Zaire.
	   Kabila claims Rwanda is supporting rebels fighting his
government, and has threatened war. Bizimungu denies it, and said
his government would return any hostilities.
	   At a news conference after the six-hour session, host President
Robert Mugabe restated those positions. But a committee, made up of
the presidents of Tanzania, Zambia, Namibia and Zimbabwe was formed
to push for a cease fire, Mugabe said.
	   He warned that if Rwandan troops are in Congo, ``They have to
withdraw.''
	   Kabila later told reporters: ``I didn't come to seek support but
to explain a situation.''
	   He blamed the rebel attacks on ``people (who) are very jealous
of the life of the Congolese and of Congo as a state.''
	   ``We have an ambitious program of democratization. We expect to
go into elections next year,'' said Kabila, who is under pressure
from human rights groups.
	   The United States has expressed concern about reports of
persecution of Tutsis and other ethnic groups in the Congolese
capital, Kinshasa.
	   The resurgence of conflict in the vast Congo and the prospect of
civil war looming in its equally vast and mineral rich neighbor to
the south, Angola, has alarmed regional leaders.
	   A key faction that supported Kabila in last year's ouster of the
late corrupt Zairian dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, has broken away
and occupied a wide strip of eastern Congo.
	   Called the Bunyamulenge, the group has close ethnic ties with
the Tutsis, who govern neighboring Rwanda.
	   Among other things, the fighters accuse Kabila of failing to
contain Rwandan Hutu rebels launching attacks from inside Congo.
	   That is a ``big lie,'' Kabila said Saturday.
	   Asked if he felt like Mobutu before his overthrow, Kabila
laughed and said he wasn't afraid.
	   ``I am not Mobutu,'' he said.

Palestinian legislators hold heated debate on Arafat's Cabinet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IMAD MUSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian legislators nearly came
to blows Saturday in a heated debate over whether to approve
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's new Cabinet.
	   Legislators had been scheduled to vote on the new Cabinet, but
there were so many requests to speak _ mostly by critics of
Arafat's appointments _ that the session was continued until
Sunday.
	   Arafat announced his new Cabinet last week, a year after
legislators demanded the old one be dissolved because of widespread
corruption. But his roster left in place most of the former
ministers _ including those accused of corruption _ and added 10
more.
	   Two ministers _ Hanan Ashrawi and Abdel Jawad Saleh _ quit last
week in protest.
	   ``We have to respect ourselves. We have to make tough
decisions,'' Ashrawi _ one of the most prominent Palestinian
political figures _ said Saturday, urging her colleagues to vote
down the new Cabinet.
	   ``We need much more than adding people to the Cabinet, we need a
change in methodology,'' said independent legislator Ziad Abu Amr,
head of the council's political affairs committee. ``I cannot give
this government a vote of confidence with a clear conscience.''
	   More than a dozen of the 88 council members took the podium to
criticize Arafat's administration and proposed Cabinet. However
only one of the critics was from Arafat's Fatah faction, which has
a solid 66-seat majority in the council.
	   Although legislators have frequently rebuked Arafat in the past,
they have so far failed to make good on threats to vote
no-confidence in his government, and Arafat has largely ignored the
council's demands.
	   Arafat met Friday night with Fatah members to rally their
support for the new Cabinet.
	   But Fatah legislator Husam Khader said he refused to attend the
meeting, calling the proposed Cabinet ``a conspiracy against the
Palestinian people'' and saying he would vote against it.
	   In an unusually blunt criticism of the Palestinian Authority
president and his authoritarian rule, Khader proposed ``naming
Arafat the god of the Palestinian people forever.''
	   His comment prompted Fatah legislator Burhan Jarrar to leap from
his chair and rush toward the podium, threatening to ``break
(Khader's) face.'' Several other council members stopped the two
men from exchanging blows.
	   The fiery debate was a departure from the council's usual policy
of easing pressure on Arafat at times of crisis in the peace talks
with Israel.
	   One of Arafat's few defenders on Saturday was Salah Tamari,
usually a critic of the Palestinian leader, who was named minister
of settlement affairs in the new Cabinet.
	   ``This new Cabinet has a prisoner affairs ministry and a
ministry to monitor Israeli settlement activity,'' Tamari told the
council. ``These are steps in the right direction.''
	   Independent political analyst Ghassan Khatib predicted that the
new Cabinet would easily win approval on Sunday, noting that Arafat
had coopted critics like Tamari by inviting them to join his
government.
	   But Khatib said it would further undermine the credibility of
the council if it voted to approve the same ministers that
legislators declared corrupt last year.

Georgian parliament approves four new ministers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ The Georgian parliament approved the
appointments of four new ministers to the country's new government
on Saturday. Nearly all Georgian ministers resigned in a shakeup
late last month.
	   The ministers approved Saturday were appointed by President
Eduard Shevardnadze, who said a new government was needed to carry
out economic reforms in the former Soviet republic. They are:
	   _ Alexander Kartozia, minister of education, formerly chief of
the national library.
	   _ Mikhail Ukleba, minister of state property and privatization,
formerly first deputy foreign minister.
	   _ Badri Shoshitaishvili, minister of industry, formerly mayor of
Tbilisi.
	   _ Lado Chanturia, minister of justice, formerly professor of
law.
	   The full list of the new government is expected to be adopted by
Aug. 20. The latest appointments bring the number of ministers in
the new government to eight, including three holdovers from the
previous government and new State Minister Vazha Lordkipanidze.
	   The former government consisted of 21 ministers.
	   Parliament, which met in special session, also approved the
appointment of Konstantin Zaldastanishvili, former minister of
trade, as Georgian representative to the European Council.

Protesters end sit-in at Vatican mission in Paris
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A group of protesters on Saturday ended a week-long
sit-in at the Vatican mission in Paris, but vowed to press on with
their demands that 17 illegal immigrants receive residency permits.
	   The occupiers, mostly Africans, are seeking papers for 17
comrades who were part of a group of some 300 African illegal
immigrants who occupied the Saint Bernard church in Paris for two
months in 1996.
	   Police stormed the church and expelled the group, but most since
then have become legal residents of France.
	   The group voluntarily left the Papal Nuncio on Saturday, but a
delegation plans to meet with French authorities in coming days, a
spokeswoman for the protesters said.
	   ``They'll discuss the dossiers of the 17 illegal immigrants,''
Madjyguene Cisse said. ``And also the general situation of those
without papers.''
	   So-called ``sans papiers,'' which means ``without papers'' in
French, frequently occupy churches to dramatize their plight. But
the sit-in an the Papal Nuncio was one of the highest profile
protests so far by illegal immigrants.
	   The Vatican last week urged the immigrants to end their
``illegal action,'' stressing the need to obey French laws.

Body of Taiwan politician killed in mainland China flown home EDS:
</HEADLINE>
UPDATES 6th-7th grafs with Chinese newspaper report on arrests

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI (AP) _ The body of a Taiwanese politician whose death in
a kidnapping on the Chinese mainland sparked an exchange of angry
words between arch-rivals Taiwan and China was flown back to her
home city Saturday.
	   City officials in southern Kaohsiung and politicians from across
Taiwan's political spectrum greeted the casket of 32-year old city
councilor Lin Ti-chuan.
	   Relatives and friends waved bright yellow sunflowers as they
followed the casket, led by a Taoist priest, to a makeshift tent
near the airport where a memorial service was held for Lin.
	   Liu Gangqi, deputy secretary-general of Beijing's semiofficial
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, saw Lin's
family members and relatives off at Beijing airport earlier before
the body was flown back to Taiwan via Hong Kong.
	   Li, 32, was found death on July 29 in a hospital in the northern
Chinese town of Haicheng.
	   Beijing's China Daily reported on Saturday that police have
arrested four suspects. Yang Rongxi was arrested on Thursday in
northern Dalian, and Zhao Chuang surrendered to police an hour
later, the newspaper said.
	   Police in Anshan, also in northeast China, had already announced
the arrests of Huang Shidong and Zhang Shifeng, it added. But Li
Guangzhi, suspected of plotting the kidnapping, remained at large,
the newspaper said.
	   China's Xinhua News Agency earlier quoted one of the suspects as
confessing that he was part of a gang of five men who abducted Lin
and her boyfriend Wei Dang-kung on July 27.
	   Lin began having trouble breathing after her captors gave her
several injections and the gang took her to a hospital in Haicheng,
where she died, the suspect was quoted as saying.
	   The kidnapping had been an attempt to force payment of business
debts owed by Wei, who escaped and alerted police.
	   Lin's killing prompted scathing comments from both sides of the
Taiwan Straits _ threatening the delicate and politically tenuous
relations between Taipei and Beijing.
	   Taiwanese public opinion was quick to accuse Beijing of
neglecting the safety of Taiwanese nationals in the mainland.
	   A scathing commentary by Xinhua on Saturday accused Taiwan's
main opposition Democratic Progressive Party _ of which Lin was a
member _ of ``totally misguided comments concerning the mainland's
indifference over the life and property of compatriots'' from
Taiwan.
	   A survey of 1,130 people conducted by the Taiwan's United Daily
News on Friday showed that that 60 percent favored increased
exchange with the mainland, while only 18 percent wanted fewer
contacts. The poll had a margin of error of 2.9 percent.
	   Despite the harsh words, both Taiwan and Beijing have sought to
prevent the incident from slowing gradual movement toward a renewal
of their dialogue, broken off in 1995.
	   Taiwan's semiofficial Straits Exchange Foundation had recorded
19 cases of violence against Taiwanese businessmen in China so far
this year, compared with 27 cases for all of 1997.
	   Since 1991, the semiofficial body handling exchanges with China,
said it has handled 184 cases of Taiwanese kidnapped, intimidated,
or threatened with extortion, of whom 25 were killed.

Glider pilot killed in crash on Lebanese mountains

<TEXT>
	   BAALBEK, Lebanon (AP) _ A glider pilot was killed Saturday when
his plane crashed into a mountain in eastern Lebanon, police said.
	   Thomas Sfeir, 25, who held dual Lebanese and French citizenship,
was flying above the Cedars mountains when his plane hit a rock
near a peak, police said.
	   A herdsman in the area, which is some 45 kilometers (28 miles)
northwest of Baalbek, spotted Sfeir and promptly called the police
in a local town. But Sfeir had suffered severe injuries and died
before he could be taken to hospital, a policeman said, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Three colleagues of Sfeir who were also piloting gliders
Saturday landed safely, police said.
	   Sfeir's corpse was brought to a hospital in Baalbek, 85
kilometers (53 miles) northeast of the Lebanese capital, Beirut.

Japan's second remote satellite docking attempt delayed again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's space agency has been unable for a second
day to complete a remote docking experiment between two orbiting
research satellites, a spokeswoman said Saturday.
	   An unidentified thrust-related problem prevented the satellites
from coming close enough to carry out a planned rendezvous
Saturday, said Akiko Suzuki of the National Space Development
Agency. A separate problem prevented the maneuver to link the two
orbiting units from taking place as originally scheduled Friday.
	   NASDA technicians plan to try again as early as Sunday, Suzuki
said.
	   In July, the agency successfully orchestrated a docking _ the
first time such a feat had been accomplished via remote control
from the Earth.
	   Japan hopes its remote-controlled docking experiments will pave
the way for regular shipments of supplies by unmanned spacecraft to
space stations.
	   The satellites ``Orihime'' (Vega) and ``Hikoboshi'' (Altair),
named after the two stars that cross on July 7 each year, were
launched last November.

Pakistan secures dlrs 1.5 billion loan from Saudi banks, officials
</HEADLINE>
say

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ A group of Saudi-based banks agreed
Saturday on a dlrs 1.5 billion loan for Islamabad, bankers said,
providing a shot in the arm for Pakistan's ailing economy.
	   Agreement on the loan followed recent talks in Saudi Arabia by
Pakistan's newly appointed adviser for finance and economic
affairs, Hafiz Pasha, said bank officials who spoke on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   They said final arrangements for the loan package would be
worked out when Pasha returns to the kingdom later this month. The
package has been put together by the Islamic Development Bank,
based in the Saudi port city of Jiddah.
	   Pasha had asked for commercial loans, not economic assistance,
the officials said.
	   Pakistan, which has been hard pressed by anti-nuclear sanctions
imposed by the United States, Japan and other industrial nations,
could seek a moratorium on the payment of its dlrs 30 billion
foreign debt.

More than 70 people killed by rebels, army in Rwanda
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GISENYI, Rwanda (AP) _ More than 70 people have been killed in
northwestern Rwanda in attacks by Hutu rebels and counter-attacks
by the army, the Rwanda News Agency reported Saturday.
	   Rebels armed with guns, clubs and machetes killed 11 people in a
pre-dawn attack Saturday in Kanama, near the border town of
Gisenyi, 100 kilometers (60 miles) northwest of Kigali.
	   The attack was apparently aimed at punishing the majority Hutu
population for refusing to provide the rebels with food, shelter
and money.
	   Seven others were wounded in the same attack, army sources told
the private news agency.
	   Armed soldiers patrolled on foot and in vehicles the main road
between Kigali and Gisenyi on Saturday, and the traffic was scarce.
	   Thousands of people have been killed in attacks by Hutu rebels
since former Hutu soldiers and militiamen, responsible for the 1994
genocide of at least 500,000 people, returned from exile in 1996.
	   The victims were minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.
The killing ended when Tutsi-led rebels won power in July 1994.
	   The government says more Hutus were disassociating themselves
from the rebels and cooperating with the authorities in a bid to
restore security. But impassable forests and thick banana
plantations appear to make it easier for the rebels to escape and
hide after each attack.
	   Military sources in Gisenyi, who refused to be identified, said
the army killed at least 38 rebels and recovered eight rifles after
a battle on Thursday near Kanama.
	   The battle followed a similar rebel attack in which six people
were killed, including a Presbyterian pastor.
	   The same night, rebels wounded two children and abducted their
father, sources said.
	   On Aug. 2, rebels killed 16 people in Mutura, which is in the
same area, sources said. The incidents were not reported until
Saturday.
	   Renewed rebel attacks followed the army crackdown on rebel
leaders. Last month, soldiers closed in and killed three top rebel
commanders and claimed to have dealt a major blow to their
organization.
	   The rebels have been using bases inside Rwanda and in
neighboring Congo for launching attacks on road convoys and
recruiting Hutus for what they say is a struggle against Tutsi
occupation of Rwanda.

Hundreds of Muslims return to southern villages

	   SOVICI, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Some 700 Muslims returned
Saturday to their pre-war homes in southern villages of Sovici and
Doljani, after living nearly five years as refugees.
	   The returnees arrived in a convoy of more than 70 vehicles,
escorted by the NATO-led peace force and U.N. police monitors. No
incidents were recorded.
	   More than 3,300 people, mainly Muslims, lived in the region,
some 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of the Bosnian capital, until
1993 when Bosnian Croats expelled them during the war. The majority
of them fled to the Muslim-dominated town of Jablanica.
	   By returning to their pre-war homes Saturday, the Muslims have
freed up a large number of Bosnian Croat homes in Jablanica, making
it possible for their owners to return.
	   Several thousands of Bosnian Serb, Croat and Muslim refugees
have returned to their homes since the end of the war in 1995, but
nearly two million others remain displaced in Bosnia and across
Europe.
	   International officials, hoping to speed up the return of
refugees, have dubbed 1998 the year of return.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The government gave the green light
and earmarked special funding to produce a new Romanian fighting
plane, media reported Saturday.
	   The plane, named the IAR-99 Soim, or Hawk, combines systems
compatible with those in NATO and Russian planes and is to be
manufactured in Craiova, 185 kilometers (115 miles) west Bucharest,
Evenimentul Zilei daily reported. The government allocated 170
billion lei (dlrs 20 million) for its production.
	   The plane, the first of its kind to be produced in Romania, will
have NATO-like guidance system, Russian-made machine guns,
Rolls-Royce engines and Romanian air-ground rockets.
	   ``By the end of this year, four new planes will leave our
factory,'' Tudor Bistreanu, the aircraft factory manager told
Evenimentul Zilei. The Romanian army is to purchase 26 of 40 planes
ordered by 2001, Bistreanu said.
	   A prototype of IAR-99 was exhibited last year at an airshow in
Paris.

Chinese focus on post-communist Europe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A group of Chinese delegates from
around the globe gathered in Budapest Saturday to discuss a host of
issues they face in Europe, focusing on the former communist-bloc
nations.
	   Some 400 delegates from China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore,
Malaysia, the United States, Canada, Australia and 25 European
countries convened for the sixth-annual congress of the Federation
of Chinese People in Europe.
	   Tens of thousands of Chinese immigrants flooded Hungary in the
early 1990s, when the government dropped a law requiring visas for
Chinese residents.
	   In 1992, estimates of the number of Chinese staying in Hungary
ranged as high as 80,000. Thousands were deported or left on their
own when police started cracking down on illegal aliens later that
year. In March 1993, the government reinstated the visa requirement
for Chinese citizens.
	   According to Zhang Ming, who came to Budapest in 1992 and works
for a Chinese-language weekly, ``Europe Today,'' there are some
15,000 Chinese in Hungary today.
	   Yang Yijia, who helped organize the conference said the local
Chinese community felt it was time they were recognized. ``We have
restaurants and stores selling Chinese-made goods and in the past
several years we have become a community with strong ties. We think
we have earned the right to play host,'' she said.
	   Conference topics focus on the problems of assimilation,
immigration and work permit legislation, business laws, investment
opportunities and the language barrier.

Taliban forces claim capture of Mazar-e-Sharif

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban came in blazing Saturday,
raining rockets and bombs on the last major Afghan city not under
their control. Fierce street fighting was reported hours after the
religious militia claimed a shaky hold on Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Residents in the town, 300 kilometers (190 miles) northwest of
Kabul, cowered in basements, listening to a barrage of explosions.
The Islamic Republic News Agency in neighboring Iran, said bombings
were continuous and reported ``sporadic acts of resistance in the
streets.''
	   Mazar-e-Sharif is a major prize in the Taliban's four-year-old
campaign to impose their strict version of Islamic rule over all of
Afghanistan. The city's fall would be a severe blow to an
opposition already pushed to a dwindling corner of northern
Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban appeared determined not to repeat the mistake they
made last May, when they entered Mazar-e-Sharif at the invitation
of a warlord who had turned on his anti-Taliban allies. The warlord
turned again _ allegiance-switching has been a hallmark of
Afghanistan's years of civil war _ and the Taliban were driven out,
suffering heavy casualties.
	   Elsewhere, the Taliban have bribed military commanders to
surrender or counted on being welcomed by local residents either
eager to embrace anyone promising peace or to accept the Taliban as
their ethnic brothers.
	   The Taliban are in far from friendly territory in
Mazar-e-Sharif. The city is inhabited mostly by ethnic Uzbeks and
Tajiks, while the Taliban, like most other Afghans, are Pashtuns.
The Taliban are also Sunni Muslims, while the local Hezb-e-Wahadat
militia that is part of the anti-Taliban alliance adheres to the
Shiite sect of Islam.
	   A Hezb-e-Wahadat spokesman confirmed Taliban fighters were in
Mazar-e-Sharif, but said they did not have complete control. The
spokesman, who refused to be named, reported fierce street fighting
in the city.
	   Abdullah, another anti-Taliban spokesman, claimed later that the
Taliban had been pushed to the western part of the city, leaving
behind ``tens of bodies.'' He accused the Taliban of killing many
civilians in their bombardment, but had no exact figures.
	   Abdullah, who uses one name only, said an anti-Taliban commander
had been bribed to allow the religious militia to enter the city.
But the ferocity of the fighting brought his account of a
treacherous betrayal into question.
	   Taliban spokesman Abdul Rahof said both sides were battling late
Saturday for the airport on the eastern edge of town. He had no
details on casualties or the number of prisoners taken.
	   The Taliban, which means ``students of Islam,'' emerged in 1994,
pledging to bring peace to Afghanistan after years of civil war.
	   In 1979, the Soviet army invaded and occupied Afghanistan for 10
years until it was driven out by U.S.-backed Afghan guerrillas, and
internecine battles resumed. More than 1.5 million Afghans have
died in the power struggles since the 1980s.
	   The Taliban have imposed a strict version of Islamic law in
territory they control. Since capturing Kabul in 1996, Taliban
officials have barred girls from school, confined most women to
their homes, forbade all music except religious songs and banned
anything published outside Afghanistan.
	   The anti-Taliban coalition is mostly made up of Afghanistan's
minority ethnic and religious groups, factions that sometimes fight
each other as well as the Taliban.

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ An American diplomat injured in
the U.S. Embassy bombing in Nairobi said Saturday she heard what
sounded like gunfire before the immense blast.
	   ``I was on the fourth floor. My colleague says, `Oh, I think I
hear some shooting out there,' '' said Mary Robinson, the
administrative attache.
	   ``We went out into the corridor. Then we heard this boom, and
that's all I remember until I woke up in the hospital,'' she said
after being evacuated to a South African military hospital.
	   ``I heard the shooting. That's why I came out of my office,''
said Ms. Robinson, 46, of Temple, Texas.
	   The diplomat suffered cuts and bruises to her face and a broken
left hand. She was brought here from a hospital in Nairobi for a
week's observation after suffering a concussion, and planned to
return to Kenya.
	   Two other Americans, on temporary duty at the embassy, came back
with her on the South African military flight, she said.
	   A spokesman for the One Military Hospital, Lt. Jay Jay Els,
identified them as August Naffrey, 55, and Rizwan Khalied, 27, both
of Washington, D.C. He said they were in stable condition.

South Koreans make illegal trip to North
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Defying a government ban, two South
Korean students have arrived in North Korea to promote
reunification of the divided Korean peninsula, the communist
state's news media reported Saturday.
	   South Korean prosecutors, meanwhile, said they will arrest the
two college seniors as soon as they return home.
	   North Korea's official Korea Central News Agency said the two _
Kim Dae-won and Hwang Sun _ were ``warmly greeted'' by officials
and students on Friday at Pyongyang's airport.
	   Kim and Hwang are leaders of Hanchongryon, South Korea's largest
student activist group, which has been outlawed by the government
for its alleged pro-North Korean leanings.
	   They visited Pyongyang as guests to participate in North Korean
student rallies timed to celebrate the Aug. 15 anniversary of
Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial, which lasted from 1910
to 1945.
	   The anniversary is one of few holidays celebrated by both
Koreas.
	   Seoul opposes such visits because it fears the students'
activities will play into North Korea's anti-South propaganda.
	   No South Korean can visit the North without prior government
approval, which is rarely given.
	   The two Koreas are technically still at war 43 years after the
end of the 1950-53 Korean War. They were divided into North and
South upon liberation from Japan.

Envoy winds up emergency mission with cautious optimism

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ A special U.N. envoy ended an eight-day
emergency visit to Angola Saturday by urging the government and the
former rebel UNITA movement not to waste what he called ``flashes
of opportunities for peace.''
	   Speaking to reporters at the U.N. headquarters in Luanda,
Lakhdar Brahimi said the situation was still very dangerous, but
that the risk of an immediate slide back into civil war had been
avoided.
	   ``The resumption of full-scale hostilities is not on the horizon
in the near future and there are flashes of opportunities for peace
which must be taken advantage of,'' he said.
	   The U.N. Secretary-General's special envoy was due to depart for
Namibia later Saturday at the start of a regional tour to discuss
the Angolan situation with neighboring leaders. He was also
expected to visit South Africa, Zimbabwe and Zambia over the next
week before returning to New York. His schedule was not released.
	   About 500,000 people died in Angola's 20-year civil war between
UNITA and President Jose Eduardo dos Santos' government before a
U.N.-brokered accord established a tenuous peace in 1994.
	   Implementation of the accord had long been bogged down in
delays. A sudden surge in tension in recent weeks _ including the
massacre of over 100 civilians in a remote northern village and a
reported military build up on both sides _ prompted the U.N.
Secretary General to send Brahimi to Angola.
	   Kofi Annan's envoy, who arrived on July 31, held separate talks
with Dos Santos, and UNITA's emblematic leader Jonas Savimbi.
	   In his closing press conference, Brahimi told reporters that he
had recommended a face-to-face meeting between the two leaders but
that ``right now would not be the right moment for such a meeting
because the tension is so high.''
	   But Brahimi stressed that the two sides had renewed their
commitment to the 1994 peace deal.
	   The 1994 accord required UNITA to demobilize its 70,000 strong
army and relinquish control of almost half the country. The
government in return was to guarantee the former rebels the right
to full political participation as civilians.
	   In a report released in New York Friday, the U.N.
Secretary-General stressed his concern about Angola's ``drift
towards full-fledged hostilities.''
	   The report stressed ``the failure of UNITA to demobilize fully
its forces and to facilitate the extension of state administration
throughout the country ( by handing over control of its remaining
strongholds).''
	   He criticized the government for hostile propaganda against
UNITA and apparently preparing for renewed war with a forced
recruitment drive.
	   Annan said he would recommend that the Security Council renew
the mandate of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Angola for one
month. The mandate was due to run out Aug. 15.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Defending champion Jubilo Iwata beat Bellmare
Hiratsuka 3-1 Saturday, winning the first-stage title of Japan's
professional J-League by goal differences over Shimizu S-Pulse.
	   Iwata and Shimizu, a 3-0 winner over Avispa Fukuoka, both
finished the first stage with a 13-4 mark and 39 points, six points
clear of Nagoya Grampus Eight.
	   But Iwata has had more goals than Shimizu.
	   The second stage extends Aug. 22 through Nov. 14.
	   If two different teams emerge as stage winners, they will have
to play off for the league championship in a two-leg series Nov. 21
and 28.

Neel helps power Orix past Hawks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Troy Neel blasted a pair of homers Saturday to lead
the Orix BlueWave past the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks 6-4 in Green Stadium
Kobe.
	   Neel, formerly of the Oakland Athletics, hit his second homer in
the bottom of the eighth to tie the game 4-4. It was his 16th home
run of the season.
	   Later in the inning, Hirofumi Ogawa knocked out a two-run shot
to give Orix its first win in four games.
	   At Chiba Marine Stadium, the Pacific League's last place Lotte
Marines scored three runs on four hits in the first inning to
defeat the Kintetsu Buffaloes 4-1.
	   Lotte starter Satoru Komiyama pitched his seventh complete game,
striking out five for the win.
	   Kintetsu fell to 7 1/2 games behind the league leading Nippon
Ham Fighters, whose game against the Seibu Lions was called in the
first inning because of a heavy fog.
	   In the Central League, Hiroshima Carp hitters knocked out five
homers for eight runs on their way to a 9-5 victory over the
Yokohama BayStars at Hiroshima Stadium.
	   Reliever Shigeo Tamaki gave up one hit and one walk over three
scoreless innings for the win, his fifth of the year against two
losses.
	   The loss ended the Central-League-leading BayStar's winning
streak at five.
	   At the Tokyo Dome, Chunichi hitter Takeshi Yamasaki doubled in
the go-ahead run to help lift the Dragons past the Yomiuri Giants
3-1.
	   Hiroshi Yamada gave up one run on three hits for the win and
reliever Eiji Ochiai pitched 2 1/3 scoreless innings of relief for
his fifth save.
	   At Jingu Stadium in Tokyo, Yakult's Hatsuhiko Tsuji singled home
the winning run in the bottom of the 13th inning to give the
Swallows a 4-3 win over the last-place Hanshin Tigers.

Garrido takes three stroke lead at German Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAD SAAROW, Germany (AP) _ Spain's Ignacio Garrido Saturday
solved one of Europe's toughest courses with a 4-under par 68 to
grab a three-stroke lead heading into the final round of the German
Open.
	   The European Ryder Cup player, whose only career victory came at
the event last year, pulled away from the field with a total of
9-under 207 at the dlrs 1.15 tournament.
	   Five players shared second at 210.
	   ``I feel they have to take the title away from me now, which is
nice,'' said Garrido. ``Of course I wouldn't have believed at the
start I would by leading by three. I haven't been playing well.''
	   Garrido, who has missed eight cuts this season, eagled the first
hole and seized the lead from New Zealand's Michael Campbell with a
sixth hole birdie.
	   Campbell shared second along with India's Jeev Singh, Mark Roe
and Andrew Beal of England and little-known Frenchman Olivier
Edmond, who doesn't own a tour card.
	   Only 27 players were under par after Friday's cut at Sporting
Club Berlin.
	   But on a windless sunny day numerous players finally solved the
tough Nick Faldo-designed course for sub-par rounds.
	   Garrido, thrown back by injuries and shaky putting this season,
built his lead by sinking birdies on the ninth and 11th holes.
	   The Spaniard held a four stroke lead late in his round, but one
melted away when he bogied the 17th after his approach shot flew
into the rough.
	   ``It's easy to get a bogey on this course,'' Garrido said. ``One
mistake and you can be in trouble.''
	   Germany's Bernhard Langer, a five-time winner of the event,
fired one of the day's best rounds at 67 to pull five strokes back.
	   But the two-time Masters champion, still looking for his first
title this year, was pessimistic about breaking his drought at the
event.
	   ``I give myself a five percent chance,'' Langer said. ``The
leaders are really going to have to let down.''
	   This was the first year the course at Berlin Sporting Club has
been used for the German Open. Last year, the event was played in
Stuttgart.

More than 50 people killed by rebels, army in Rwanda
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GISENYI, Rwanda (AP) _ More than 50 people have been killed in
northwestern Rwanda in attacks by Hutu rebels and counter-attacks
by the army, the Rwanda News Agency reported Saturday.
	   Rebels armed with guns, clubs and machetes killed 11 people in a
pre-dawn attack Saturday in Kanama, near the border town of
Gisenyi, 100 kilometers (60 miles) northwest of Kigali.
	   The attack was apparently aimed at punishing the majority Hutu
population for refusing to provide the rebels with food, shelter
and money.
	   Seven others were wounded in the same attack, army sources told
the private news agency. Armed soldiers patrolled on foot and in
vehicles along the main road between Kigali and Gisenyi on
Saturday, and the traffic was scarce.
	   Thousands of people have been killed in attacks by Hutu rebels
since former Hutu soldiers and militiamen, responsible for the 1994
genocide of at least 500,000 people, returned from exile in 1996.
	   The victims were minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.
The killing ended when Tutsi-led rebels won power in July 1994.
	   The government says more Hutus were disassociating themselves
from the rebels and cooperating with the authorities in a bid to
restore security. But impassable forests and thick banana
plantations make it easy for the rebels to escape and hide after
each attack.
	   Military sources in Gisenyi, who refused to be identified, said
the army killed at least 38 rebels and recovered eight rifles after
a battle on Thursday near Kanama.
	   The battle followed a similar rebel attack in which six people
were killed, including a Presbyterian pastor.
	   The same night, rebels wounded two children and abducted their
father, sources said.
	   The rebels have been using bases inside Rwanda and in
neighboring Congo for launching attacks on road convoys and
recruiting Hutus for what they say is a struggle against Tutsi
occupation of Rwanda.

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ An American diplomat injured in
the U.S. Embassy bombing in Nairobi said Saturday she heard what
sounded like gunfire before the immense blast.
	   ``I was on the fourth floor. My colleague says, `Oh, I think I
hear some shooting out there,' '' said Mary Robinson, the
administrative attache.
	   ``We went out into the corridor. Then we heard this boom, and
that's all I remember until I woke up in the hospital,'' she said
after being evacuated to a South African military hospital.
	   ``I heard the shooting. That's why I came out of my office,''
Ms. Robinson, 46, of Temple, Texas, said by telephone.
	   The diplomat suffered cuts and bruises to her face and a broken
left hand. She was brought here from a hospital in Nairobi for a
week's observation after suffering a concussion, and planned to
return to Kenya.
	   Two other Americans, on temporary duty at the embassy, came back
with her on the South African military flight, she said.
	   Rizwan Khaliq, 27, of Washington, D.C., said he suffered head
and facial cuts, and added U.S. officials told him not to speak to
reporters without embassy permission.
	   A spokesman for One Military Hospital, Lt. Jay Jay Els,
identified the other American as August Naffrey, 55, also of
Washington. A nurse said Naffrey had received pain medication and
was too shaky to come to the phone.

Stewart and Hussain punish South Africa

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with tea score: ADDS byline
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ Skipper Alec Stewart made South Africa pay
dearly for a dropped catch, as he combined with Nasser Hussain to
put England back in control of the fifth and final cricket test at
Headingley Saturday.
	   England, initially trailing by 22, was 141 for two at tea on the
third day with Hussain on 55 and Stewart 35, teaming up for an
unbroken 60-run stand for the third wicket.
	   That made England 119 runs ahead with eight second innings
wickets intact, well placed to push for its first five-test series
win in 12 years. The series is tied at 1-1 with two drawn.
	   Stewart began nervously, and after a cover-driven boundary off
Shaun Pollock, edged the paceman to second slip. But Jacques Kallis
failed to hold onto a head-high catch. Stewart was on four at the
time and England 91 for two and the England captain hit next ball
through the covers for a third boundary.
	   With the test tantalizingly poised at the half way stage,
England, clawed its way back into game Saturday, thanks to opener
Mark Butcher (37) and Hussain.
	   After losing the key wicket of Mike Atherton to the first ball
of the day, England, didn't lose another till after lunch when
Pollock found the edge of Butcher's bat en route to Brian McMillan
at first slip.
	   Butcher, England's first innings hero with his maiden test
century, hit five fours in his 150-minute stay. He helped Hussain
add 79 runs for the second wicket in 142 minutes after coming
together just a ball into the day.
	   Pollock bowled seven outstanding overs after lunch beating both
Hussain and Butcher with seam and swing under a heavy blanket of
gray cloud.
	   The ginger-haired Pollock was rewarded with the wicket of
Butcher after he beat the left hander through the air and off the
pitch.
	   Stewart was lucky and, once settled down, punished Pollock and
then Allan Donald, hitting them out of the attack.
	   Donald, who won his battle with Atherton when he pinned for
former captain in plum in front, was hit for 25 runs in five overs
inclusive of six boundaries, four of them to Stewart, who began to
rediscover his form.
	   While Hussain stonewalled for eight minutes over four hours,
Stewart, played the role of the senior partner, dominating the
third wicket stand. Hussain's contribution has been 22 runs.
	   Hussain, whose second innings century in the second test at
Lord's failed to save England from a 10-wicket defeat, consolidated
England's second innings with his 198-ball knock inclusive of seven
fours.

Catholics clash with Protestant marchers in central Londonderry

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with policeman injured; pickup graf 6 pvs &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A policeman was injured
Saturday in clashes with Catholic protesters as members of a
Protestant fraternal order staged their annual parade through this
mainly Catholic city.
	   Police in riot gear used armored vehicles and attack dogs to
prevent more than 200 Catholic protesters from directly confronting
members of the Apprentice Boys as they marched through the Diamond,
the central city square.
	   But there were repeated scuffles and the mood was tense. As the
3 1/2-hour march came to an end, a group of about a dozen Catholics
knocked a policeman to the ground, then punched and kicked him
until one of his colleagues fired two shots from his handgun above
their heads. The attackers quickly dispersed and the injured
policeman was carried away bleeding from a cut on his forehead.
	   The confrontatation came despite an agreement between the
Apprentice Boys and Catholic residents aimed at eliminating the
clashes that have dogged the parade in recent years. Earlier, about
400 local Apprentice Boys marched peacefully around the city's
medieval walls.
	   But as the first of more than 10,000 Apprentice Boys and bands
from across Northern Ireland passed along one edge of the Diamond,
a swelling group of Catholics on the other side jeered and hurled
stones and drink bottles. Some shouted ``Orange bastards'' _ a
reference to Northern Ireland's largest Protestant brotherhood, the
Orange Order _ provoking jeers from Protestant onlookers.
	   The atmosphere got increasingly acrimonious and some Protestants
broke away from the parade to throw bottles and stones.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Kinshasa was on a war footing Saturday,
broadcasting accusations against neighboring Rwanda, enlisting
fresh army recruits and detaining ethnic Tutsis on suspicion of
treason.
	   At an emergency regional summit in Zimbabwe, Congo's President
Laurent Kabila sat down with his Rwandan adversary President
Pasteur Bizimungu to try to find a peaceful end to growing
hostilities.
	   Few details of the talks were immediately available.
	   Kabila accuses Rwanda and masterminding an armed rebellion in
the eastern Kivu region. Several key cities, including Goma and
Bukavu, are already in rebel hands.
	   ``They want to create a Tutsi empire,'' Kabila said in an
earlier statement broadcast Saturday on state radio. ``But are we
Congolese prepared to accept the challenge of a toad which wants to
swallow an elephant?''
	   The government has been repeatedly broadcasting statements by
Kabila declaring their was no room to bargain with Rwanda.
	   ``There is nothing to negotiate in Zimbabwe except the immediate
withdrawal of Rwandan troops,'' Kabila was quoted as saying on
state-controlled Voice of the People radio.
	   Hundreds of unemployed men and women turned out at a local
military base on Saturday to enlist in the army, vowing to crush
the rebellion and take the war to Rwanda.
	   ``We're determined to protect our country,'' said one young
woman who refused to give her name. ``If they give us arms today we
are ready to go all the way to Rwanda.''
	   The rebel Tutsi fighters also appeared to ignore diplomatic
efforts to end the conflict and vowed to push toward the capital of
Kinshasa.
	   The rebels announced a new set of targets in western Congo,
pledging to push inland from their Atlantic coastline stronghold of
Muanda to Boma, within 250 kilometers (150 miles) southwest of the
capital.
	   ``We want to remove President Kabila from power for the interest
of the people because he failed to rule them,'' rebel-run Radio
Bukavu said.
	   With sabers rattling, several European countries and the United
States have ordered their non-essential embassy employees out of
Congo.
	   The U.S. Embassy stepped up calls for all Americans to leave the
country immediately, an embassy official said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Rwanda on Friday denied it was behind Congo's uprising and said
Kabila was trying to divert attention away from disenchantment with
his government.
	   Rwandan soldiers and Congolese Tutsi fighters, called
Banyamulenge, backed Kabila last year in his ouster of dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko, but they have since grown disaffected. Among
other things, the fighters accuse Kabila of failing to contain
Rwandan Hutu rebels launching attacks from inside Congo.
	   Kabila was served a warning by Rwanda: Bizimungu declared Friday
that his country will ``hit back'' if Congo strikes.
	   In face of growing hostility, ethnic Tutsis in Kinshasa are
facing reprisal attacks for the rebellion.
	   Hundreds, perhaps thousands of Tutsis and other nationals have
been rounded up by the police, while troops loyal to Kabila looted
their shops, the United Nations human rights agency said.
	   One foreign resident in Congo who had been arrested and later
released said dozens of Tutsis, Ethiopians and Lebanese were being
held at one police station on suspicion of treason.
	   In Washington, the U.S. State Department expressed similar
concerns.
	   Spokesman James Foley said the reports from Congo suggest that
Tutsis and possibly civilians of other ethnicities in Kinshasa
``are being rounded up, detained, beaten, tortured and killed
because of their ethnicity.''
	   The revenge attacks on Tutsis reflect a growing instability in
Kinshasa and elsewhere in Congo amid displeasure with Kabila's
rule, which critics say is marked by corruption and mismanagement.

Guinea-Bissau's government and rebels begin second round of talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A second round of peace talks between
Guinea-Bissau's government and a rebel military faction began
Saturday on board a Portuguese frigate moored off the tiny West
African country's coast, news reports said.
	   The talks aimed to shore up a ceasefire negotiated two weeks ago
in the two-month-old conflict between the rebels, led by Brig.
Ansumane Mane, and the government of President Joao Bernardo
Vieira.
	   The ceasefire was brokered by a delegation from the Committee of
Portuguese-Speaking Countries, or CPLP, and negotiated on the
frigate.
	   Saturday's second round of talks were postponed for several
hours due to the late arrival of the government delegation, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   The delay was due to the government's demand that neighboring
Senegal and the Republic of Guinea be represented at the
negotiating table, Lusa said quoting an unnamed source close to the
negotiations.
	   The conflict dates back to an attempted coup led by Mane on June
7, after he was dismissed as arms forces chief for allegedly
running arms to Senegal's Casamance separatists. The rebels accused
Vieira of rampant corruption and demanded he step down.
	   Saturday's face-to-face negotiations between the rebels and the
government came the day after brief meetings between the CPLP
mediators and the delegations from the two sides, the Portuguese
news agency Lusa reported.
	   The CPLP is made up of Portugal, Brazil, Angola, Mozambique,
Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe.

Love machines and techno freaks fill Zurich
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss financial capital was
transformed into one of the world's biggest techno parties
Saturday, with hundreds of thousands of ravers celebrating love and
peace.
	   A procession of 30 pulsating love machines _ crammed with techno
fans in crazy costumes and weird and wonderful hairdos _ snaked its
way through sun-drenched streets, belting out the latest in techno
and house music.
	   The partying was expected to last through the night. Swiss
railways laid on an extra 50 trains to bring in fans from
Switzerland and neighboring nations. A charter flight from Moscow
allowed Russian ravers to join the fun.
	   Now in its seventh year, the Zurich Street Parade has evolved
from a small event for dedicated fans into one of the world's
biggest and brightest techno parties.
	   At the other end of the country, a smaller lakeside techno
parade vibrated around the lake of Geneva as the city's summer
festival reached a peak. The festival culminates in a spectacular
fireworks display late Saturday and is a magnet for hundreds of
wealthy Arab tourists who flock to the attractions.

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ A special U.N. envoy ended an eight-day
emergency visit to Angola Saturday by urging the government and the
former rebel UNITA movement not to waste what he called ``flashes
of opportunities for peace.''
	   Speaking to reporters at the U.N. headquarters in Luanda,
Lakhdar Brahimi said the situation was still very dangerous, but
that the risk of an immediate slide back into civil war had been
avoided.
	   ``The resumption of full-scale hostilities is not on the horizon
in the near future and there are flashes of opportunities for peace
which must be taken advantage of,'' he said.
	   The U.N. Secretary-General's special envoy left for Namibia
later Saturday at the start of a regional tour to discuss the
Angolan situation with neighboring leaders. He was also expected to
visit South Africa, Zimbabwe and Zambia over the next week before
returning to New York. His schedule was not released.

Three Belarusian pilots released after African captivity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Three Belarusian helicopter pilots have
returned home after more than a year of what they described as
forced labor and detention in Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
	   The three returned late Friday after the Russian Foreign
Ministry, which represents Belarus in countries where it has no
diplomats, secured their release from a Nigerian prison.
	   Their Russian commander was also freed, the pilots said.
	   According to the pilots, they were working in Sierra Leone in
May 1997, when the government was ousted in a military coup. They
said the ruling junta forced them to work for the new leaders. When
the junta left for Liberia in February of this year, the pilots
said, they were arrested on charges of helping the coup plotters.
	   They said they were held in Liberia and then Nigeria until being
freed.
	   ``We got out of that hell, where we could have been killed any
moment,'' Ivan Martynovich said after his arrival. ``It is there
that I realized that God existed. He saved us. ... When I stepped
down onto native land I was crying, and I'm not ashamed for that.''
	   The other two pilots identified themselves as Vladimir Chepel
and Vasily Kulkov.

German state police have program to track pedophiles using
</HEADLINE>
Internet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ An information specialist with the
Hesse state police has developed a computer program to track down
pedophiles who surf the Internet to find or introduce child
pornography, a newspaper said Saturday.
	   The Frankfurt Allgemeine daily, quoted Hesse state police
Director, Klaus Timm, as saying the program worked like a
``bloodhound,'' that could be used to stop Internet providers from
spreading child pornography.
	   While police appear pleased with the new development, some
involved with the Internet responded negatively.
	   Joerg Lammers, spokesman for Germany's largest Internet
provider, T-Online, was quoted by the newspaper as saying that
``the finding of criminal Internet information is the
responsibility of crime fighting officials. It can't be our task to
act as deputies for the authorities.''
	   American On-Line spokesman in Germany, Ingo Reese, was quoted by
the report as saying that ``the program is not suitable for our
purposes. It doesn't guarantee that the Internet will be cleaner.''
	   In 1997, the Federal Criminal Police in Wiesbaden reported
investigating 1,628 cases of child pornography, double the number
in 1996.
	   But the statistics don't reveal how many of those cases were in
connection with the Internet, the newspaper said.
	   The new software program named ``Perkeo'' is produced by the
Autem company in Emden. It is to be offered commercially in coming
days and private German companies have shown an interest for their
internal computer systems, the report said.
	   It said the program was developed on the basis of about 5,000
known child pornographic photographs, that are then compared with
images contained in the Internet.
	   The newspaper quoted an official at the Autem company as saying
that ``now that for the first time data can be quickly researched
for these types of violations, the Internet providers find
themselves under great pressure.''
	   Searches for questionable material will for the time being find
only known images. The success rate of identifying someone surfing
for such images is more than 60 percent, the report said.
	   Since pedophiles ``normally like stamp collectors make an effort
to obtain a full collection of such images,'' state police say the
chances of uncovering new material are increased, the newspaper
said.
	   It said that the new program had already been installed for use
internationally by Interpol as well as by German police to track
down offenders.
	   Despite the fact that the program was also introduced to
American Online Inc., it is not being used there, the report said.
	   German law forbids anyone from pulling up even one child
pornographic image on the Internet, and authorities have been
actively working to get such material banned completely.
	   On May 28, a Munich state court convicted Felix Somm, the former
head of CompuServe Germany of propagating pornography by not
blocking data available on the Internet. He was sentenced to two
years probation and ordered to pay dlrs 57,000 to charity.

Polish government condemns ``irresponsible'' persons escalating

cross conflict &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The Polish government has condemned
persons contributing to the escalation of a Polish-Jewish conflict
about crosses outside the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz, PAP news
agency reported Saturday.
	   ``Initiatives of a few and irresponsible persons employing the
policy of accomplished facts cause the escalation of conflict and
mobilization of extremists on both sides,'' PAP quoted a government
statement issued late Friday.
	   Several dozen Roman Catholic faithful erected almost 90 crosses
over the last two weeks as a sign of protest against efforts to
remove a much larger, eight-meter (26-foot) cross that has stood
just meters from the camp's wall since 1988.
	   The faithful were urged to erect crosses by the conservative
Catholic radio station and Kazimierz Switon, former Solidarity
veteran and author of anti-Semitic publications.
	   In response, rabbi Awi Weiss from New York said he would come to
Poland to protest the crosses.
	   Erecting the crosses ``without knowledge and approval of the
church hierarchy'' contributes to ``forming false opinions and
stereotypes about the Polish society,'' said the government
	   Israel asked the Polish government to remove the smaller
crosses. The government said it lacked authority to order the
removal of the crosses but it promised to sort out the question of
ownership of the grounds where the large cross is located.
	   The large cross, used during a 1979 papal mass, was later placed
on the grounds of a former Carmelite convent on Auschwitz's
periphery. After the nuns moved out, a veteran's group has claimed
legal rights to the property based on a 35-year-old rental
agreement.
	   The large cross is located outside the camp walls at the site
where 152 Polish resisters were executed by the Nazis but it is
visible from ``the death wall,'' where thousands were shot.
	   The statement said that the Auschwitz memorial is a symbol of
the Holocaust but it is also a place of martyrdom of Gypsies,
Poles, Russians and others.
	   According to Polish historian Franciszek Piper, at least a
million Jews, up to 75,000 Poles, 21,000 Gypsies and others died at
Auschwitz.

Kosovo demonstators condemn freezing of Swiss accounts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Several thousand Kosovo Albanians
demonstrated in the Swiss capital Saturday, demanding U.N. military
strikes against Serb units and an end to all links with Serbian
authorities.
	   The protestors also called for Switzerland to release millions
of francs (dollars) in assets from two Swiss-based Kosovo
foundations. Swiss authorities froze the accounts late last month
on suspicion that money was being used to finance illegal arms
trafficking in the Yugoslav province.
	   ``If you're not going to help us, then at least don't hinder
us,'' read one banner.
	   ``We need the money for war victims,'' read another.
	   Police estimated that 2,000 people took part in the
demonstration. Organizers put the figure at 5,000. It passed
peacefully.

Fromberg upsets top-seeded Kucera to reach final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Australia's Richard Fromberg hit
back from 3-1 down in the final set to upset top-seeded Slovak
Karol Kucera 6-1, 6-7 (7-4), 6-4 Saturday and reach the final of
the dlrs 500,000 Grolsch Open ATP clay court tennis tournament.
	   Sweden's Magnus Norman also advanced to the final, defeating
Argentinian Mariano Zabaleta 7-5, 6-4 after receiving treatment
from a doctor at courtside because of heat exhaustion.
	   No. 6 seed Fromberg kicked off the match with a quick and
comfortable win in the first set, but Kucera, 14 in the rankings,
fought back in the second, which ended in a tiebreaker.
	   Kucera began the tiebreaker with a perfect drop shot winner and
went on to win it 7-4.
	   In the third set, Fromberg stumbled briefly, trailing 1-3 at one
point. The Australian eventually recovered and won a crucial break
point after a long rally to even the score at 3-3.
	   Fromberg kept up the pressure, broke Kucera again and ran out a
6-4 winner.
	   In the Norman-Zabaleta match, the score was tied at 5-5 in the
first set and Norman squandered several chances to take the lead
before breaking for 6-5.
	   A lengthy game followed, but it was stopped when Norman
apparently had problems triggered by the heat.
	   A doctor came on court and measured his blood pressure and
allowed him to return to the match, which he served out to win 7-5.
The Swede then finished off the match with a 6-4 win in the second
set.

House Speaker Gingrich leads congressional mission to Ireland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich arrived
Saturday in Dublin for a weeklong survey of the Northern Ireland
peace process, Irish economic success _ and his own Irish roots.
	   Accompanied by four Democrat and two Republican lawmakers,
Gingrich said it was important for American politicians ``to
demonstrate our joint commitment to the peace process.''
	   ``I teach history, and Ireland is a country full of history, so
I would love to spend a month here instead of a week,'' Gingrich
(R-Georgia) said in a phone interview.
	   He said he'd talked Friday with President Clinton about the
efforts to forge a new cross-community government of Catholics and
Protestants for Northern Ireland. The new power-sharing Assembly,
cornerstone of April's peace agreement, convenes Sept. 14 _ the
week after Clinton is expected to visit.
	   ``With this powerful congressional delegation coming to Ireland
at the start of this month and the president coming the next, it
demonstrates the depth of American commitment to promoting peace in
Northern Ireland _ and not just Irish-American commitment.''
	   His colleagues are Jim Walsh (D-N.Y.), Ken Bentsen (D-Texas),
Jerry Lewis (R-Calif.), Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.), John Dingell
(D-Michigan) and Raymond LaHood (R-Illinois).
	   Gingrich will travel Sunday to Kilkenny, southeast Ireland, for
social engagements in the town's famed castle, and back to Dublin
to meet senior government ministers.
	   On Tuesday he plans to help build a Belfast house for a
U.S.-funded project called Habitat for Humanity, which helps poor
people construct their own homes in international trouble spots.
	   He expects to meet David Trimble, the Protestant first minister
of the new Assembly, and Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-allied Sinn
Fein party.
	   Potentially most controversially, he's scheduled a visit with
the Rev. Ian Paisley, the hard-line Protestant politician who has
refused to meet other visiting Americans and condemns most foreign
visitors as Sinn Fein sympathizers.
	   ``It's important to demonstrate that we're committed to every
single person's interests here, in having their personal freedoms
protected and their right to pursue prosperity enhanced,'' he said.
``So that means you talk to Paisley as well as Adams.''
	   On Thursday and Friday, Gingrich heads to Ireland's remote
northwest corner of Donegal, where his grandmother's O'Doherty clan
and its genealogical research center are based.
	   ``My grandmother always told me I had the gift of the blarney,''
he said. ``This will definitely be the most interesting part of the
visit for me.''
	   Before leaving Ireland Aug. 15, Gingrich will visit factories of
U.S. computer makers in the Shannon-Limerick region of southwest
Ireland. The Irish Republic currently enjoys the best economic
growth in western Europe, the so-called ``Celtic tiger'' economy
owing much to strong U.S. private investment.
	   Gingrich said he intends to make his own contribution to the
local consumer economy by downing at least a few pints of the local
black Guinness stout.
	   He's previously only paused in Ireland at the international
airport in Shannon. ``And the Guinness is always a significant part
of every visit,'' he said. ``I refuel myself while they refuel the
plane.''

Poland lifts suspension of soccer committee right before deadline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES last two grafs with two games canceled and details on
meeting &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The sports minister reinstated Poland's
soccer administrators late Friday after they agreed to an
investigation into allegations of mismanagement, meeting a deadline
set by the World and European Soccer Federations.
	   FIFA and UEFA had refused to extend a midnight deadline for
lifting suspensions on the Polish Football Association, which would
mean that Polish teams could not take part in upcoming
international competitions.
	   At a news conference Saturday, Sports Minister Jacek Debski said
he sent a fax to the world soccer group, FIFA, in Zurich,
Switzerland 15 minutes before deadline informing them of lifting
the suspensions, imposed in May.
	   ``Conditions set by FIFA and UEFA were met and I don't see why
those institutions would make decisions unfavorable for Polish
soccer,'' said Debski.
	   Polish Soccer Federation administrators agreed to a probe of
mismanagement, due to begin on Monday, only a half an hour before
the FIFA deadline, Debski said.
	   The administrators had previously claimed they were independent
of state controls and had refused to accept the sports ministry's
appointment of a control board supervisor to examine their records.
	   Debski said he now expects voluntary dismissal of Soccer
Federation President Marian Dziurowicz, which would open the way
for reforming Polish soccer.
	   Poland's national team, which achieved successes in 1970s and
early 1980s, has not qualified for soccer's World Cup since 1982.
Debski blames administrators and soccer activists for corruption
among players and referees, lack of training facilities and
programs.
	   On Saturday, current Polish champion LKS Ptak Lodz refused to
take part in a game with Odra Wodzislaw and appealed to other first
division soccer clubs to follow suit. In response, Wisla Krakow
canceled the game with Zaglebie Lublin.
	   The Polish Soccer Federation is to meet Wednesday to call for a
general meeting of the national soccer activists and invite FIFA
and UEFA representatives.

Hours' wait for ferries; 20-kilometer backup on Italian road
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Vacationers waited hours to load their cars on
ferries to Sicily and sweated in traffic backups as long as 20
kilometers (13 miles) as an estimated 4 million vehicles jammed
Italian roads Saturday.
	   Italians and foreigners were headed to resorts in the mountains
or at the sea for vacations straddling Ferragosto, the Aug. 15
holiday.
	   At least two travelers were reported killed on the A14
autostrada in north-central Italy when their car went out of
control and ended up in lanes of oncoming traffic.
	   The longest highway backup, 20 kilometers (13 miles), was
reported on the A4 autostrada connecting Venice and Padua in
northeast Italy.
	   On the A3 autostrada which runs from Salerno to Reggio Calabria
down the ``toe'' of the Italian peninsula, travelers were stuck for
hours in traffic backed up for 12 kilometers (7.5 miles).
	   Trying to prevent injuries in case of accidents, authorities in
Salerno, which is a port city south of Naples, ordered a crackdown
on those who don't wear seatbelts. Despite a law which provides for
fines, most Italians don't buckle up and enforcement is generally
lax.
	   Smoke and flames from brush fires have aggravated traffic
problems in much of Italy over the last few days, especially in
Liguria, Italy's northwestern coastal region. On Saturday, a
tollbooth along the A10 highway between Genoa and Ventimiglia, near
the French border, was closed because of a blaze nearby.

Brazil government grants extension for environmental law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ The government has given companies
up to five years to bring their operations into compliance with a
strict new environmental law approved earlier this year, a
newspaper reported Saturday.
	   O Estado de Sao Paulo reported that the Environment Ministry
granted extensions ranging from three months to five years before
it begins imposing fines under the new law.
	   Environment Minister Gustavo Krause said the government has
already imposed some fines under the new law, but will not impose
any new fines until the extension period expires.
	   Environmental authorities are investigating 2,056 complaints
that the companies are breaking the law in the state of Sao Paulo,
the newspaper reported.
	   Under a law approved earlier this year, companies caught
breaking environmental rules cannot participate in government bids
for 10 years. The companies won't qualify for tax breaks, and
owners must pay fines proportionate to the profits of the company.
	   The law also sets prison terms of up to three years for anyone
caught illegally trading animals, burning trees, extracting
minerals or polluting.
	   The law was passed in an effort to protect Brazil's Amazon rain
forest. About 13 percent of the 2 million square-mile (5 million
square-kilometer) Amazon rain forest already has been destroyed.
Some scientists say the destruction accelerates global warming.

Guyana may withdraw from UN accord to speed executions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT WILKINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Guyana may withdraw from a United
Nations accord to speed up executions, a top government official
said Saturday.
	   If Guyana withdraws from the United Nations Optional Protocol on
Civil and Political Rights, it would follow the lead of two other
Caribbean nations, Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica.
	   Several of Guyana's 26 death-row prisoners have appealed to the
Geneva-based U.N. Human Rights Committee to have their sentences
commuted because of the length of time they have been in prison.
	   Cabinet Secretary Roger Luncheon said Saturday the government's
choice between giving up the U.N. protocol and ending capital
punishment would be an easy one.
	   ``If it becomes evident ... that the access to the Optional
Protocol frustrates that exercise, then capital punishment will go
on and the Protocol will have to be modified,'' said Luncheon.
	   Guyana signed the agreement in 1993, saying it wanted to give
Guyanese an independent international body to which they could
appeal. Now the system has returned to haunt authorities.
	   In June, the Human Rights Commission angered the government by
recommending that two prisoners on death row for a murder in 1987
be freed because they had suffered enough punishment during years
of incarceration. Attorney General Charles Ramson has already said
the two will be hanged regardless.
	   Officials in other Caribbean countries, such as Jamaica, have
said that appeals to the United Nations and to the Privy Council in
London, a high court of appeals for some former British colonies,
have the effect of making capital punishment impossible.
	   The appeals delay the executions and then the courts rule that
keeping prisoners on death row for so long is inhumane and they
should be released.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Australia and Russia said they wanted to help with
the investigation. Israel provided rescue workers. The pope sent up
prayers.
	   Twin terrorist bombings at U.S. embassies in east Africa that
killed at least 139 people and injured more than 2,200 brought
expressions of horror from world leaders Saturday _ and offers of
help.
	   ``We are committed to working with our allies and friends to
combat the threat posed by terrorism and will cooperate in any way
that might be useful in efforts to uncover the perpetrators of
these bombings,'' Australian Prime Minister John Howard said in a
statement from his Canberra office.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the bombings were
``cowardly acts'' and he pledged that his country would help ``in
any way it can.''
	   In a message to U.S. President Bill Clinton, Russian President
Boris Yeltsin called the bombings a brazen challenge to the entire
world community and pledged to act with other countries to do
whatever was necessary to combat terrorism, the Interfax news
agency said.
	   Vatican Radio said Pope John Paul II had offered prayers for the
dead and hopes that the attacks will encourage the international
community ''to cooperate and double efforts aimed at building a
world of peace and justice.''
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak called the attacks ''vicious
criminal acts'' and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh said
she could ``find no word adequate enough to condemn the heinous
bomb attacks.''
	   In a statement issued by the official Saudi Press Agency, the
government of Saudi Arabia said it ``strongly condemns any kind of
terroristic activity in any form and anywhere in the world.''
	   Even governments on U.S. State Department's list of
terrorist-sponsoring nations spoke out.
	   ``We condemn the bombings, and sympathize with the victims and
their families,'' said Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi.
	   The government of Cuban President Fidel Castro on Friday
condemned the bombings and expressed ``its most deeply felt
sorrow.''
	   Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said his country
''condemns acts of violence. Such acts as these do not accomplish
anything, but victimize innocents,'' he said.
	   It was not immediately known who was responsible for the car
bombings Friday at U.S. embassies in the capitals of Kenya and
Tanzania. Around the world, U.S. diplomatic compounds beefed up
security.
	   In Paris, a heavy police presence prevented people from
approaching the U.S. embassy, which was cordoned off with metal
barriers. Thailand's prime minister ordered his country's police to
provide special security to the U.S. Embassy in the Thai capital of
Bangkok.
	   In Malaysia, U.S. embassy spokesman Chip Barclay said the
compound was ``definitely on heightened security. We're keeping our
guard up and taking appropriate measures. When I came in today, it
was apparent that effective measures have been taken.''
	   Israel on Saturday despatched 170 specially trained rescue
workers to Nairobi, scene of the more serious blast. They were met
by British troops who have been helping to dig bodies out of the
rubble.
	   The Kenyan government declared five days of mourning on
Saturday.

Mexico issues arrest warrants for San Diego gang members
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) _ A Mexican judge has issued arrest
warrants for seven members of a San Diego street gang in connection
with the attempted assassination of a Tijuana publisher.
	   Mexican Army Maj. Felipe Perez Cruz, of the Federal Judicial
Police, confirmed that a judge issued arrest warrants for members
of San Diego's Logan 30s gang in connection with the attempted
murder of Jesus Blancornelas, publisher of the Tijuana newsweekly
Zeta, The San Diego Union Tribune reported Friday.
	   Perez refused to say which judge issued the arrest orders.
Virtually all of them are believed to be in the United States, he
said.
	   Ten Logan 30s members were indicted in February by a federal
grand jury in San Diego on conspiracy charges in connection with
the Blancornelas case. It was not clear if any of the seven sought
by Mexico were in that group.
	   Blancornelas, whose paper has reported extensively on drug
trafficking in the Baja California region, was ambushed Nov. 27 as
he was being driven to work in Tijuana.
	   Blancornelas, 62, was shot four times but survived. His
bodyguard-driver, Luis Lauro Valero, was killed.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico exported 158,461 bags of coffee in

released by the government-run Mexican Coffee Council.
	   July exports were 22.6 percent above the 129,252 bags exported

million bags worth dlrs 738.1 million. The coffee season begins in

	   The council's production estimate for 1997-98 is 4.85 million
bags.

Nine Indian and Pakistani soldiers killed or wounded in firing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian and Pakistani soldiers resumed
firing mortar shells at each other across the disputed Kashmir
frontier Saturday, killing or wounding at least nine soldiers,
local news agencies reported.
	   Officials in Islamabad did not immediately comment on the claim
by an Indian government spokesman that seven Pakistani soldiers
were either killed or injured in the firing, which was reported by
United News of India and Press Trust of India news agencies.
	   Friday's lull in nine days of firing ended early Saturday when
Pakistani soldiers fired mortar shells into India-held Kashmir, UNI
said. Indian soldiers retaliated, it said.
	   Two Indian soldiers were also injured during the exchange of
fire, it said.
	   On Friday, a Pakistan Cabinet minister said that 130 Pakistanis,
mostly civilians, were killed by Indian firing in the last nine
days. The figures were significantly higher than previously
reported.
	   Also, 425 others, mostly civilians, were wounded, Majeed Malik,
the minister in charge of Pakistani policy on the disputed
territory of Kashmir, told reporters in Muzaffarabad, capital of
Pakistan-held Kashmir.
	   The Indian toll touched 58, including 16 soldiers, until Friday.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, the
Himalayan territory divided between them. Firing across the
disputed Kashmir border is common. Most recently, fierce exchanges
broke out July 30 and began to die down only a few days ago.

More than half of Khartoum suffering daily power cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's electricity authority apologized
Saturday for shortages that are depriving businesses and residents
of power for more than 14 hours a day in this capital city.
	   ``We would like to stress that the present deficiency is out of
our control but, God willing, the situation will return to normal
within a few days,'' the National Electricity Corp. said in a
statement published in the state-run Al-Gumhuriya newspaper.
	   The corporation said the two hydro-electric power stations that
supply Khartoum, at Sennar and Damazin, are operating at a fraction
of their full capacity.
	   The dams at Sennar and Damazin, on the Blue Nile 150 miles (240
kilometers) and 280 miles (448 kilometers) southeast of Khartoum,
have their sluice gates open to allow the outflow of sediment
washed down by recent floods in Ethiopia.
	   In addition, two thermal power stations in the city, Bahri and
Burri, are functioning at well below their capacity as the
corporation has long lacked the funds to maintain their generators
adequately.
	   Khartoum and its twin Omdurman are cities where public services
function poorly at the best of times. They have a combined
population of about 5 million people.
	   The corporation did not say what proportion of the city is
affected by the outages, but talk is that well over half the
population has no power for 14 to 15 hours a day.
	   Pedestrians walking the downtown find it hard to speak above the
din of diesel generators that shops and banks run on the pavement
to provide power for their interiors.
	   The corporation believes it will soon be possible to close the
sluice gates and return the hydro-electric generation to normal.

Icelandic signing nets late leveller for Bolton at Palace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Icelandic international Arnar Gunnlaugsson powered
home a last-minute equalizer Saturday as Bolton hit back to tie 2-2
with Crystal Palace. That means that two teams relegated from the
Premier League started the new season in division one even.
	   Bolton took the lead through Dean Holdsworth in the 33th minute
only for Palace, now managed by former England and Australia coach
Terry Venables, went 2-1 ahead through Matt Jansen and Yugoslav
international Sasa Curcic.
	   Venables' team looked set to start with a win until
Gunnlaugsson, who replaced Scott Sellars 20 minutes from the end,
drove the ball from from 20 meters (yards) for a spectacular
leveller.
	   Barnsley, the other team relegated from the Premier League,
twice fell behind but gained a 2-2 tie at home to West Bromwich
Albion thanks to headed equalizers by Dutch defender Arjan De
Zeeuw.
	   Another Dutch player, Richard Sneekes, had fired the Baggies
ahead and Albion's other goal came from Northern Ireland
international James Quinn after a dazzling run by Irish
international winger Kevin Kilbane.
	   Sunderland, beaten by Charlton on penalties in a post-season
promotion playoff, started its latest attempt to regain a Premier
League place with a 1-0 victory over Queens Park Rangers before
some 40,000 fans at the Stadium of Light.
	   It needed a penalty 15 minutes from the end after Rangers'
defender Ian Barraclough had blocked a goalbound header with his
hand. Barraclough was sent off and Kevin Phillips scored from the
spot.
	   Grim news for Sunderland was that former Newcastle midfielder
Lee Clark broke his leg during the game in an challenge by QPR
midfelder Keith Rowland.
	   Sheffield United, beaten in the playoff semifinal, scored a 2-1
victory over modest Swindon thanks to first half goals by Graham
Stuart and Vassilis Borbokis. An own goal by David Holdsworth
provided Swindon's lone reply.
	   Birmingham, which just missed out on the playoffs after a late
run last season, scored an impressive 2-0 win at Port Vale thanks
to goals by Paul Furlong and Dele Adebola.
	   Wolves, another club likely to be among the promotion
contenders, cruised to a 2-0 victory over Tranmere with goals from
18-year-old Irish international Robbie Keane and a penalty by
former England international defender Keith Curle.
	   Danish international Soren Andersen scored twice on his debut
for promoted Bristol City but the Robins were held 2-2 by Oxford
United at Ashton Gate.
	   Watford, another promoted club which has former England manager
Graham Taylor at the helm, scored a 2-1 win at Portsmouth after two
goals in the last 10 minutes _ an Andy Thompson own goal and a
strike by former Nottingham Forest forward Jason Lee.

International powers propose solution to Kosovo troubles
</HEADLINE>

the plan. SUBS 7th graf pvs with new reax. UPDATES with new reports

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following a heavy Serb crackdown on
militant Albanian secessionists in Kosovo province, international
powers proposed a political solution to stop the fighting between
Serb forces and rebel Kosovo Albanians.
	   The British ambassador to Yugoslavia, Brian Donelly, met with
moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova Saturday to hand him a
blueprint of the plan. On Friday, Donelly met Yugoslav Vice Premier
Nikola Sainovic to show him the so-called ``options paper.''
	   Speaking to reporters after the meeting in Pristina Saturday,
Donnelly said, ``We hope that both parties will find ideas in this
paper helpful to them when they sit down to negotiate, that we
believe they must.''
	   The plan was drawn up by the so-called Contact Group of
international powers _ Britain, Germany, France, Italy, the United
States and Russia _ which has been trying to secure a political
solution for Kosovo since fighting between Serb forces and the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army escalated in March.
	   Russia's deputy foreign minister, Nikolai Afanasyevsky, who has
been shuttling between the two sides in an attempt to bring them
closer together, told reporters in Belgrade Saturday that the
proposal is a ``document about possible variants of political
solution.''
	   ``It is about different degrees of autonomy in similar
situations in different European countries,'' Afanasyevsky said.
``Not a prepared recipe nor imposing of a solution.''
	   Previous attempts at bringing representatives from
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia and Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leaders to
the negotiating table have broken down. A major sticking point has
been getting the Albanians _ divided between those who support
Rugova and those who back the KLA _ to rally behind a
representative.
	   Yugoslav officials called the proposal a ``positive step,'' but
the Albanians were more reluctant. After meeting with Donelly,
Rugova repeated a previous statement ``the best solution ... is an
independent and neutral Kosovo with the possibility of
international protectorate as an interim phase.''
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia, where ethnic Albanians,
who demand independence, represent 90 percent of the population.
Serbia and the smaller republic of Montenegro make up what is left
of Yugoslavia.
	   According to Donelly, the immediate priority of the plan is ``to
establish a security situation which will make negotiations
possible,'' which includes halting the fighting and creating
conditions for refugees to return to their homes.
	   Nearly 200,000 people had been uprooted from their homes in the
past two weeks, many of them fleeing to the forests and mountains
where they remain camped without little to eat. International
humanitarian officials fear the situation will worsen when cold
weather sets in, should the refugees be unable to return to their
homes.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to Rugova's government said
Serb forces gave an ultimatum to three KLA-controlled villages near
Djakovica to surrender by Saturday evening, or face attack.
	   Serb and government forces reportedly continued mop-up
operations Saturday in the Drenica region, burning and destroying
villages.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Kinshasa was on a war footing Saturday,
broadcasting accusations against neighboring Rwanda, enlisting
fresh army recruits and detaining ethnic Tutsis on suspicion of
treason.
	   At an emergency regional summit in Zimbabwe, Congo's President
Laurent Kabila sat down with his Rwandan adversary President
Pasteur Bizimungu to try to find a peaceful end to growing
hostilities.
	   Few details of the talks were immediately available although
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan told reporters in Lisbon,
Portugal on Saturday that he was worried by the situation in the
Congo.
	   ``I am concerned about what is happening in Central Africa, and
also about the Democratic Republic of Congo. The leaders in the
region should come together to see what they can do and bring some
order into this situation,'' Annan said.

Police van bombed in Dagestan; two reported hurt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A remote-control bomb exploded Saturday in a
parked police van in the capital of Dagestan, a troubled Russian
republic in the Caucasus region, a Russian news agency reported.
Two people were reported injured.
	   The bomb exploded close to a crowded marketplace in the center
of the capital, Makhachkala, early in the evening, Interfax said,
citing local police. Shortly after, an unidentified person was seen
hurling a hand grenade, which also exploded near the van.
	   A police officer and a passer-by were reported injured, Interfax
said. It was not clear whether the officer, or anyone else, was in
the van at the time of the explosion.
	   The case was under investigation. Dagestan borders the breakaway
republic of Chechnya, and has been caught up in a siege of violence
and lawlessness that has afflicted the entire Caucasus region.

Israel's archaeological digs become religious-secular battleground
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Clinging to the blade of an idled power shovel,
four men in black hats and long black coats howled their fury at
the archaeologist and his crew.
	   ``Grave robbers! Desecrators!'' they shrieked while the workers
brushed dirt from a rocky outcropping believed to contain a cluster
of fourth- or fifth-century tombs.
	   The rancorous scene on a sun-baked hillside just north of
Jerusalem was the latest skirmish in what has become a full-blown
war on Israel's archaeology establishment, waged by a small but
determined band of ultra-Orthodox Jews.
	   The protesters believe excavations like this one, which is being
carried out by Israel's state antiquities authority in conjunction
with the building of a major road, are an unspeakable affront to
Jewish dead of centuries past.
	   ``The living suffer if graves are desecrated,'' said Yehuda
Meshi-Zahav, an organizer of protests that have delayed the road
project by nearly two years. ``So respect for the dead is really
respect for the living.''
	   But some scholars and scientists fear increased religious
influence could have a chilling effect on archaeological work in
Israel, one of the world's great centers of antiquities research.
	   ``Israel's international role in archaeology is something that
was built up very slowly, literally with lots of sweat,'' said
Ornit Ilan, curator at the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem. ``But
our standing could fall very quickly, and that would be quite
sad.''
	   To the ultra-Orthodox, it is an article of faith that if a
Jewish grave must be opened or moved, it can be done so only under
painstaking procedures set down in halacha, or traditional
religious law.
	   Grave-tampering is considered a particularly terrible offense
because Jewish doctrine says that if body parts are missing, the
soul can never rest in peace.
	   So deeply held is this belief that ultra-Orthodox volunteers
rush to the scene of car wrecks and suicide bombings to try to
reclaim victims' every scrap of flesh and bone for burial.
	   The growing dispute over burial sites is frustrating to
archaeologists, who already follow religious supervision in
handling human remains
	   Bones excavated at the roadway dig are put in earthenware jars
and handed over to the religious affairs ministry for reburial. A
ministry official keeps a watchful eye on the daily digging.
	   On a recent day, as a power shovel scooped up crumbling
red-brown earth, the official spotted a change in soil composition
that he thought could signal the presence of more graves. He called
for a halt, and the dig supervisor quickly complied. Work resumed
only after the official gave permission.
	   Such cooperation does not satisfy ultra-Orthodox protesters, who
turn out daily at the site in numbers ranging from handfuls to
hundreds. They grab at the power shovels, lie on the dusty ground
to block the diggers, shout verses from the Torah and scuffle with
police.
	   Ultra-Orthodox political parties, which wield disproportionate
clout because they act as a parliamentary swing vote, have even
pressed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to fire the director of
the Antiquities Authority, archaeologist Amir Drori, and replace
him with a religious choice.
	   In a compromise, more rabbis are being added to an archaeology
advisory committee and Drori is keeping his job. But a shakeup at
the Antiquities Authority is all but certain when his term expires
in a year.
	   Observers like Ilan, the museum curator, warn that the
ultra-Orthodox campaign could backfire.
	   Commercial developers who stumble onto archaeological finds are
required by law to report them to the Antiquities Authority. But if
builders are worried that protests will cause bad publicity and
long delays, they may simply bulldoze under burial sites and
artifacts.
	   That would be a tremendous blow to archaeological research and
the protesters' cause of protecting graves, Ilan said.
	   ``What we have here is so precious, a heritage for everyone,''
she said. ``It belongs to all humanity.''
	   In this dispute, however, there seems little room for
compromise. In a stark illustration of the divide, some
ultra-Orthodox question whether the discipline of archaeology ought
to even exist.
	   ``The archaeologists, they try to connect with the past through
their work. But we don't need this,'' said Meshi-Zahav, the protest
leader. ``Our real link with the past and with the land of Israel
is through the Torah, our contract with God. And we are honoring
that contract.''

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban came in blazing Saturday,
raining rockets and bombs on the last major Afghan city not under
their control. Fierce street fighting was reported hours after the
religious militia claimed a shaky hold on Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Residents in the town, 300 kilometers (190 miles) northwest of
Kabul, cowered in basements, listening to a barrage of explosions.
The Islamic Republic News Agency in neighboring Iran, said bombings
were continuous and reported ``sporadic acts of resistance in the
streets.''
	   Mazar-e-Sharif is a major prize in the Taliban's four-year-old
campaign to impose their strict version of Islamic rule over all of
Afghanistan. The city's fall would be a severe blow to an
opposition already pushed to a dwindling corner of northern
Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban appeared determined not to repeat the mistake they
made last May, when they entered Mazar-e-Sharif at the invitation
of a warlord who had turned on his anti-Taliban allies. The warlord
turned again _ allegiance-switching has been a hallmark of
Afghanistan's years of civil war _ and the Taliban were driven out,
suffering heavy casualties.
	   ``Last year, we were invited in. But this time, we burned the
mountains,'' said Taliban spokesman Abdul Manam Niyazi, using an
expression for heavy fighting. Niyazi spoke by satellite phone from
Mazar-e-Sharif, claiming his forces were in complete control of the
city and had killed ``hundreds'' of opposition soldiers in the
battle. He did not mention Taliban casualties.
	   He said the opposition still controlled Hayratan, about 60
kilometers (40 miles) east. Another Taliban spokesman, Abdul Rahof,
speaking from Taliban military headquarters in the southern city of
Kandahar, said both sides were battling late Saturday for the
airport on the eastern edge of town.
	   Elsewhere, the Taliban have bribed military commanders to
surrender or counted on being welcomed by local residents either
eager to embrace anyone promising peace or to accept the Taliban as
their ethnic brothers.
	   The Taliban are in far from friendly territory in
Mazar-e-Sharif. The city is inhabited mostly by ethnic Uzbeks and
Tajiks, while the Taliban, like most other Afghans, are Pashtuns.
The Taliban are also Sunni Muslims, while the local Hezb-e-Wahadat
militia that is part of the anti-Taliban alliance adheres to the
Shiite sect of Islam.
	   Taliban radio reported Saturday that residents in areas near
Mazar-e-Sharif welcomed the Taliban by waving white flags.
Residents in Badakshan province eastern Afghanistan, along the
border with Pakistan, also reportedly raised white flags Saturday,
the radio said.
	   A Hezb-e-Wahadat spokesman confirmed Taliban fighters were in
Mazar-e-Sharif, but said they did not have complete control. The
spokesman, who refused to be named, reported fierce street fighting
in the city.
	   Abdullah, another anti-Taliban spokesman, claimed later that the
Taliban had been pushed to the western part of the city, leaving
behind ``tens of bodies.'' He accused the Taliban of killing many
civilians in their bombardment, but had no exact figures.
	   Abdullah, who uses one name only, said an anti-Taliban commander
had been bribed to allow the religious militia to enter the city.
But the ferocity of the fighting brought his account of a
treacherous betrayal into question.

More than half of Khartoum suffering daily power cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's electricity authority apologized
Saturday for shortages that are depriving businesses and residents
of power for more than 14 hours a day in this capital city.
	   ``We would like to stress that the present deficiency is out of
our control but, God willing, the situation will return to normal
within a few days,'' the National Electricity Corp. said in a
statement published in the state-run Al-Gumhuriya newspaper.
	   The corporation said the two hydro-electric power stations that
supply Khartoum, at Sennar and Damazin, are operating at a fraction
of their full capacity.
	   The dams at Sennar and Damazin, on the Blue Nile 150 miles (240
kilometers) and 280 miles (448 kilometers) southeast of Khartoum,
have their sluice gates open to allow the outflow of sediment
washed down by recent floods in Ethiopia.
	   In addition, two thermal power stations in the city, Bahri and
Burri, are functioning at well below their capacity as the
corporation has long lacked the funds to maintain their generators
adequately.
	   Khartoum and its twin Omdurman are cities where public services
function poorly at the best of times. They have a combined
population of about 5 million people.
	   The corporation did not say what proportion of the city is
affected by the outages, but talk is that well over half the
population has no power for 14 to 15 hours a day.
	   Pedestrians walking the downtown find it hard to speak above the
din of diesel generators that shops and banks run on the pavement
to provide power for their interiors.
	   The corporation believes it will soon be possible to close the
sluice gates and return the hydro-electric generation to normal.

Germany setting up 200 million marks fund for victims of Nazis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead, moves up some information, adds details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Under pressure from Jewish leaders and U.S.
lawmakers, Germany on Saturday announced a 200 million mark
restitution fund for Nazi victims who were never directly
compensated because they lived in communist countries after World
War II.
	   The German government had resisted pressure since the fall of
the Iron Curtain to make individual payments to those who were not
previously compensated. West Germany paid 1.8 billion marks (dlrs 1
billion) to nations that fell under the Soviet influence after the
war, but that money never reached many individuals who suffered at
the hands of the Nazis.
	   Jewish and other groups have estimated that up to 45,000 east
European victims were eligible for payments.
	   However, the finance ministry said the latest funding was
intended for some 18,000 victims, who are later to receive further
payments from a fund that already makes regular monthly payments to
Holocaust survivors.
	   The agreement with the Jewish Claims Conference comes after
months of negotiating with government officials.
	   According to Der Spiegel weekly magazine, it also relaxes the
criteria for seriously impaired Jewish victims in western countries
to allow more people to receive compensation.
	   For example, the fund will now take into account the length of
time a victim was held in work camps, not just concentration camps.
	   No one could be immediately reached Saturday at the Jewish
Claims Conference for comment.
	   Germany has paid more than 100 billion marks (dlrs 55 billion)
to survivors of the Nazi regime, but those living in the Soviet
bloc could not apply for direct compensation during the Cold War.
	   Jewish groups had argued that eastern European survivors
deserved the same kind of direct, monthly compensation from Germany
as their counterparts who lived outside the Soviet bloc.
	   They got support from the Clinton administration and 82 U.S.
senators, who signed an open letter in August 1997 urging Germany
to pay the pensions.
	   The German government promised at that time to find a solution
for eastern European victims.

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ An American balloonist attempting
to circle the globe lost use of two of his four propane burners
after a small fire Saturday, but put out the flames and pressed on
over the Atlantic.
	   Undeterred by the fire that erupted from equipment that heats
air for his balloon Solo Spirit, Steve Fossett messaged his St.
Louis Command Center saying, ``I am committed to making it around
the world,''
	   Fossett, a 54-year-old Chicago stockbroker, left western
Argentina late Friday on a planned 14- to 18-day circumnavigation
of the Southern Hemisphere, a 20,000-mile (32,185-kilometer) course
mainly over treacherous oceans.
	   No balloonist yet has circled the world.
	   At 11 a.m. Eastern time (1600 GMT), Solo Spirit had covered 838
miles (1,348 kilometers) since a Friday night launch was about 50
miles (80 kilometers) southeast of the Argentine coast resort of
Mar del Plata, moving southeasterly at 55 mph (88 kph) just above
20,000 feet (6,000 meters).
	   ``He's moving right along. He had some trouble ... and he
sustained some minor burns but he's carrying right on,'' said Betsy
Rogers, speaking Saturday afternoon by telephone from the St. Louis
center.
	   Fossett was expected to take four days crossing the South
Atlantic toward Capetown, South Africa. If all goes to plan, he
would then try to fly on to Australia before returning to South
America via the Pacific.
	   Alan Blount, director of mission control in St. Louis, said the
fire started at about 0630 GMT when Fossett was checking a pilot
light problem on one of the burners that heats the air in the
silver-and-white balloon.
	   The balloon gets its lift from a combination of hot air and
helium chambers.
	   A leak of liquid propane from a pressurized fuel hose ``caught
fire,'' according to Blount, who spoke with The Associated Press by
telephone.
	   ``It was under pressure so it was spewing flame. We don't have
all the details, but he received a minor burn on his left wrist and
burned part of the sleeves off his outfit,'' said Blount.
	   Fossett was not seriously injured in putting out the fire and it
didn't damage the aircraft or cause significant fuel leakage,
according to Blount.
	   Fossett's first attempt to circle the Earth lasted just 36
hours, cut short in January 1996 by winter storms. A year later, he
set the distance record: a 10,361-mile (16,600-kilometer) , six-day
journey from St. Louis to Sultanpar, India. He landed after running
short of fuel while awaiting clearance to cross Libyan airspace.
	   On Jan. 5, 1998, Fossett landed 5,802 (9,330 kilometers) miles
away from St. Louis, in a wheat field near Krasnodar, southern
Russia.
	   Conditions for Fossett are rugged in the 4-foot-by-7-foot (1.2
by 2 meter) capsule, crammed with communications gear, batteries,
water and enough military-style rations to last days adrift should
he ditch at sea.
	   He also has a parachute, wetsuit, life raft and rescue beacon.
	   He planned to catnap each night and use an oxygen mask to
breathe in the unpressurized capsule above 20,000 feet. Teammates
have strapped aboard 40 tanks of propane fuel _ enough to stay
aloft 28 days.

England, Australia draw first test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GUILDFORD, England (AP) _ England and Australia drew the first
test of a three-match women's Ashes series Saturday after a feast
of high run-scoring but little fun for the bowlers.
	   England finished its second innings on 160 for one after the
Australians declared on 569 for six, following England's first
innings 414 all out.
	   England's Jan Brittin set a world record for runs gathered in
test matches, her 146 and 59 not out taking her to 1,690, easily
passing the mark of 1,594 owned by former England captain Rachael
Heyhoe Flint.
	   Australia's Joanne Broadbent and Melanie Jones also scored big
centuries. Broadbent hit exactly 200, four runs short of Kirsty
Flavell's world record scored against England two years ago, while
Jones was run out for 131.
	   The tie at least maintains England's hope of winning the Ashes
which looked uncertain when Australia crushed the home team 5-0 in
a series of one-day games.
	   The Ashes series resumes at Harrogate on Tuesday and the two
teams meet again at Worcester Aug 21.

Starr probe taking its toll on presidency
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Seemingly immune from scandal, U.S. President
Bill Clinton has so far avoided a falling out with the American
public over the Monica Lewinsky investigation. But the embarrassing
probe unmistakably has weakened his presidency, diminished his
power and darkened his future.
	   A Republican Congress once eager to cooperate with Clinton on
reforming welfare and balancing the budget now thumbs its nose at
the beleaguered president. A White House that had been instrumental
in setting Washington's agenda is instead preoccupied with the
president's survival.
	   Democrats hopeful of taking control of the House fret that
Clinton's troubles will drag them down in November's mid-term
elections. America's allies around the world worry that a U.S.
president who needs to be strong in global affairs is distracted
and even endangered.
	   ``Who's looking after Kosovo? Who's worrying about Iraq?'' said
Vanderbilt University political scientist Erwin Hargrove. ``I don't
get the impression the president is at all involved in foreign
affairs. There seems to be some concern abroad that he's not in
charge.''
	   ``This has been in many respects a tragic episode in American
politics,'' said Thomas Mann, director of governmental studies at
the Brookings Institution. ``We have weakened the presidency and
criminalized the political process.''
	   ``Whether the president can recoup, whether we can repair the
damages caused by the zealousness of Ken Starr and the frenzy of
the media and the lack of discipline by the president, who knows?''
Mann said.
	   By any measure, 1998 has been a bust for Clinton.
	   The tobacco settlement that the White House hoped would be
1998's crowning achievement was shelved. So were Clinton proposals
to raise the minimum wage, hire 100,000 new teachers, spend dlrs
21.7 billion on childcare initiatives and allow Americans as young
as 55 buy into the Medicare system.
	   ``Congress really hasn't done anything, except name the Reagan
airport,'' said University of Rochester historian John Mueller.
	   White House counselor Rahm Emanuel insisted Clinton still has
clout _ as demonstrated by the shrinking of tax-cutting proposals
by Republican leaders in the face of opposition from Clinton and
the Senate. ``The president has stared down the Congress,'' Emanuel
said. ``If that's happening in the eye of the storm, I don't know
how one concludes the president's power is diminished.''
	   Constitutional scholars lament that court rulings have narrowed
the boundaries of presidential privacy and privilege and
established that presidents could be forced into civil litigation
during their terms. Secret Service agents sworn to take a bullet
for the president now may have to testify against him.
	   The Lewinsky scandal has had ``a much greater impact than many
people realize,'' said University of Pennsylvania presidential
scholar Mark Rozwell.
	   ``This is the stage of a second term when a president should be
looking toward establishing his legacy and capitalizing on his
popularity,'' Rozwell said. ``Instead, this president and his
administration are in a defensive mode trying to protect himself.
Right now it's more about self preservation than creating an
enduring legacy for the future.''
	   Republican pollster Linda DiVall said, ``The mark of an
excellent president is one who is willing to use his political
capital to move significant issues. This president uses his capital
only to save himself.''
	   Many people who watch the political world were stunned that
Clinton's approval ratings climbed rather than fell after the
Lewinsky investigation was revealed.
	   ``You look at his approval rating, you could make the case that
this has helped his approval,'' said analyst Norman Ornstein of the
American Enterprise Institute. He summed up Americans' view this
way: ``We think he's done this stuff. Our sense of him as a moral
character is low. But we think he's doing a good job as president.
He's trying to focus on things that matter for us. This is not
relevant for us. We just want this to go away.,''
	   But, of course, it will go on for many more months. In the
meantime, analysts are trying to assess the damage and what lies
ahead for Clinton. The conventional wisdom is that Clinton will
survive in some fashion.
	   ``The bully pulpit authority of the president has been eroded by
all of this,'' said Ornstein.
	   University of Wisconsin historian Stanley Kutler, a specialist
on Richard Nixon's fall from power, said, ``These things cost. They
cost the nation. I think this is a very, very crucial time with the
Chinese, and the president is playing the game with one hand tied
behind his back.''
	   ``And if the economy sours in any way,'' Kutler said, ``I think
his troubles will mount. As the degree of unhappiness in the
society rises, so that will reflect on his position.''
	   Others believe Clinton can rebound.
	   ``One thing we should have learned about Bill Clinton is that
that any reports about his death are premature and usually wrong,''
said Ornstein. ``If he can weather this storm and keep his approval
rating above 50 percent, that will have an impact.''

With Kenya-Embassy Bombings

 &UR; Survivors shocked, horrified by blast at U.S. Embassy
 &UR; By DIANNA CAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Within seconds of the blast,
Valentine Matthew Katunda went from being a security watchman at
the American Embassy to being buried alive underneath wreckage.
	   ``I was underground and I was recovered,'' said Katunda, 42,
shaking his head in confusion.
	   Katunda, his cheek and neck were wrapped in large, bloodied
bandages, limped along the corridors of Muhambili Hospital on
Saturday, trying to make sense of a bomb blast that tore through
the U.S. Embassy on Friday morning.
	   ``It happened so abruptly. I still can't understand it.''
	   Many of his colleagues were not so lucky, sitting just a few
meters (yards) away from Katunda inside the guard house for the
main embassy entrance. The bomb exploded just outside, ripping the
guard house to pieces, and apparently killing all of the guards
inside.
	   The explosion left a crater nearly 2 meters (6 feet) in
diameter, blew up the main gate, and ripped off the back portion of
the embassy wall.
	   Six people perished immediately and a seventh died on the
operating table, hospital officials said. Another 65 people were
injured.
	   ``I only had to look at the guard house to know there were
casualties,'' said American Jim Owens, who was blown 5 feet (1.5
meters) by the blast.
	   ``Everybody we encountered was covered in blood. The air was
thick with smoke and dust and soot ... There were people lying on
the ground, bleeding,'' said Owens, 50, of Falls Church, Virginia.
He suffered a concussion and cuts along his face and neck from the
blast.
	   Initial investigations suggested the bomb was planted on an oil
tanker that belonged to the embassy and was entering the main gate
as it exploded, newspapers cited police commissioner Wilson
Mwansasu as saying.
	   No suspects had been reported arrested in the case.
	   The small tanker lay upside down Saturday, half buried in the
rubble of the embassy's first floor. Charred car, motorcycle and
bicycle frames lay tangled amidst broken glass, papers and chunks
of cement.
	   Pieces of burned rubber and human flesh still hung from nearby
trees. Media reports said several bodies had been blown to bits.
	   Portions of the large building were ripped apart, debris went
flying and fire raged as shocked embassy workers and innocent
passers-by struggled to escape the horror.
	   ``Hell broke loose yesterday,'' proclaimed the state-run Daily
News newspaper Saturday.

Serb war crimes suspect fatally shot in a drunken brawl
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with official police statement, CORRECTS
perpetrator was policeman sted bar owner, ADDS detail.
 &UR; By MISA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A war crimes suspect wanted by the
U.N. tribunal for atrocities allegedly committed during the Bosnian
war died in a bar brawl in Serbia, where he remained at large,
police said Saturday.
	   Slobodan Miljkovic, also known by his nom de guerre, Lugar, died
in a drunken brawl late Friday in his hometown of Kragujevac, 100
kilometers (60 miles) southeast of Belgrade, local police said in a
statement Saturday.
	   Miljkovic, 36, was indicted by the U.N. War Crimes tribunal at
The Hague, Netherlands for war crimes and crimes against humanity
committed in the northeastern Bosnian town of Bosanski Samac in
1992.
	   His file at the tribunal says that Miljkovic was the deputy
commander a paramilitary unit from Serbia known as the ``Gray
Wolves.'' In May 1992, Miljkovic, along with other commanders
ordered roughly 50 Croat and Muslim detainees to line up against a
wall and directed the soldiers to shoot them. Miljkovic shot and
killed of 16 detainees himself.
	   Known as a pre-war thug and shady underworld figure, Miljkovic
returned to Serbia after the war because authorities in Belgrade
were not willing to extradite him to The Hague.
	   According to the police report, Miljkovic and a friend
reportedly got into a violent brawl at a late-night bar with an
off-duty policeman after they insulted his girlfriend. The officer,
identified as Branislav Lukovic, opened fire, killing Miljkovic,
his friend and the bar owner. Two others were wounded.
	   Lukovic has been arrested and police are investigating.
	   In March, Miljkovic gave an interview to a Belgrade paper,
claiming his innocence and blaming it all on politicians.
	   ``The war is over and we are declared war criminals. What about
those who sent me there?'' Miljkovic was quoted by Demokratija
daily as saying. ``They pushed us into war, they explained to us
the goals and aims. And now we are war criminals and they are still
in their positions.''
	   In the past six weeks two other Serb suspects, both already at
The Hague, have died. One committed suicide, the other died of
ruptured aorta.

Francesco Casagrande of Italy wins San Sebastian Classic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) _ Italy's Francesco Casagrande on
Saturday clinched the San Sebastian Classic, winning a three-man
sprint across the finish line and achieving second place in the
overall World Cup rankings.
	   Casagrande from the Cofidis team finished the 232-kilometer
(144-mile) course that winds through Spain's mountainous northern
region of Guipuzcoa, in five hours, 43 minutes and 45 seconds.
	   Belgium's Axel Mercks from Ponti and Italian Leonardo Piepoli
from Saeco kept pace with Casagrande for the final 15 kilometers
(9.4 miles), finishing with the same time.
	   The San Sebastian classic was the first world-class event since
the Tour of France finished Sunday with the participation of 24
teams, including several affected by the French race's doping
scandal such as Festina, ONCE or Banesto.
	   The first big breakaway came 25 kilometers from the start when
Frenchman Cedric Vasseur from Le Credit Agricole wedged 20 minutes
between himself and the rest. He managed to be at the head of the
race for 155 kilometers (97 miles), but the riders of the Spanish
Banesto team closed the gap.
	   Casagrande, Mercks and Piepoli attacked at the Jaizkibel
mountain pass 32 kilometers (20 miles) from the finish line and
made their move coming fast off the last downhill section of the
course.
	   Defending champion Davide Rebellin of Italy, American Bobby
Julich and Spain's Abraham Olano fell behind with few kilometers
(miles) to go, and finished 12th, 13th and 16th, respectively, one
minute behind the lead group.
	   The classic was the sixth in the 10-race World Cup.
	   Casagrande's fellow countryman, Michele Bartoli, held on to his
spot atop the overall World Cup rankings, with 206 points.
	   The victory boosted Casagrande to second place with 151 points
in the rankings and into contention for the title.
	   Franco Ballerini sits third nineteen points behind Casagrande.
France's Emmanuel Magnien is fourth with 130.

his duties if he were incapacitated _ a touchy issue, given
Yeltsin's health history.
	   The measure, passed by parliament last month, is ``conceptually
unconstitutional and is not subject to further consideration,''
Yeltsin said.
	   The Russian constitution says a president must step down if he
suffers a ``lasting inability to exercise his powers.'' But it
provides no mechanism for carrying out a transfer of power to the
prime minister.
	   Many of Yeltsin's Communist opponents in parliament claim that a
series of illnesses in recent years, including a heart attack, have
left him physically unfit to hold office.
	   Even a top aide to Yeltsin said recently that the president was
too unhealthy to run for another term. But Yeltsin has insisted
that his health is fine.
	   Under the measure rejected by Yeltsin, the president would have
to temporarily relinquish power if he were hospitalized, committed
to a sanitarium or even on vacation.
	   In a letter to Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov, Yeltsin said this
would violate the constitution. He argued that a long illness or a
hospital stay cannot be considered sufficient grounds for turning
over power to the prime minister.
	   It was not clear whether Yeltsin formally vetoed the bill or
merely refused to sign it.

Hussain unbeaten 83 hold innings together as England chase victory

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stumps score &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ A backs-to-the-wall, unbeaten 83 by Nasser
Hussain tilted the decisive fifth test in England's favor at
Headingley Saturday.
	   England, initially trailing by 22, was 206 for four at stumps on
the third day with Hussain providing the backbone of the second
innings in his six-hour stay.
	   That made England 184 runs ahead with six second innings wickets
intact, well placed to push for its first five-test series win in
12 years. The series is tied at 1-1 with two drawn.
	   South Africa, desperately in need of a breakthrough, took the
second new ball with England 155 runs in front, but Hussain and
Mark Ramprakash were equal to the task, until Shaun Pollock sneaked
one through the latter's defense.
	   A dropped catch dearly cost South Africa the upper hand of
another tensed day's play, as they let skipper Alec Stewart off the
hook.
	   Stewart, dropped on six by Jacques Kallis off Pollock, dominated
a 62-run third wicket stand with Hussain, to gradually bat South
Africa out of contention.
	   Stewart, who starred in England's fourth test victory charge at
Trent Bridge, hammered 35 runs off 68 balls, inclusive of seven
boundaries off Pollock and fast bowler Allan Donald.
	   Pollock, having beaten the bat all afternoon in conditions ideal
for seam and swing bowling, was rewarded for his persistence _
picking up the wickets of Butcher (37), Stewart (35) and Ramprakash
_ as he finished with 3-39 in 25 overs.
	   Hussain, calmed any hopes of another England collapse, with a
well calculated assault on South Africa's all pace attack,
repeatedly penetrating a strong off side field for most of his 11
boundaries
	   Pollock removed Ramprakash (25) four overs before stumps,
trapping the right hander leg before wicket with the second new
ball.
	   It ended a 57-run stand put together in 90 minutes either side
of a 11-minute break for bad light.
	   After losing the key wicket of Mike Atherton to the first ball
of the day, England, didn't lose another till after lunch when
Pollock found the edge of Butcher's bat en route to Brian McMillan
at first slip.
	   Butcher, England's first innings hero with his maiden test
century, hit five fours in his 150-minute stay. He helped Hussain
add 79 runs for the second wicket in 142 minutes after coming
together just a ball into the day.
	   Stewart was lucky to escape and, once settled down, punished
Pollock and then Allan Donald, hitting them out of the attack.
	   Donald, who won his battle with Atherton when he pinned for
former captain in plumb in front, was hit for 25 runs in five overs
inclusive of six boundaries, four of them to Stewart.
	   He was finally done by an outstanding Pollock delivery, a leg
cutter that bounced, and wicketkeeper Mark Boucher completed a good
catch.
	   The Hussain-Stewart stand raised 62 runs for the third wicket
after England was 81 for two soon into the post lunch session.

Serb war crimes suspect fatally shot in a drunken brawl
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with official police statement, CORRECTS perpetrator

 &UR; By MISA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A war crimes suspect wanted by the
U.N. tribunal for atrocities allegedly committed during the Bosnian
war died in a bar brawl in Serbia, police said Saturday.
	   Slobodan Miljkovic, also known as Lugar, died in a drunken brawl
late Friday in his hometown of Kragujevac, 100 kilometers (60
miles) southeast of Belgrade, local police said in a statement
Saturday.
	   Miljkovic, 36, was indicted by the U.N. War Crimes tribunal at
The Hague, Netherlands for war crimes and crimes against humanity
committed in the northeastern Bosnian town of Bosanski Samac in
1992.
	   His file at the tribunal says that Miljkovic was the deputy
commander a paramilitary unit from Serbia known as the ``Gray
Wolves.'' In May 1992, Miljkovic, along with other commanders,
ordered roughly 50 Croat and Muslim detainees to line up against a
wall and directed the soldiers to shoot them. Miljkovic shot and
killed 16 detainees himself.
	   Known as a pre-war thug and shady underworld figure, Miljkovic
returned to Serbia after the war because authorities in Belgrade
were not willing to extradite him to The Hague.
	   According to the police report, Miljkovic and a friend
reportedly got into a violent brawl at a late-night bar with an
off-duty policeman after they insulted his girlfriend. The officer,
identified as Branislav Lukovic, opened fire killing Miljkovic, his
friend and the bar owner. Two others were wounded.
	   Lukovic has been arrested and police are investigating.
	   In March, Miljkovic gave an interview to a Belgrade paper,
claiming his innocence and blaming it all on politicians.
	   ``The war is over and we are declared war criminals. What about
those who sent me there?'' Miljkovic was quoted by the Demokratija
daily as saying. ``They pushed us into war, they explained to us
the goals and aims. And now we are war criminals and they are still
in their positions.''
	   In the past six weeks two other Serb suspects, both already at
The Hague, have died. One committed suicide, the other died of a
ruptured aorta.

Spin control: In Kosovo's capital, the war is all about words
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; AP Graphic KOSOVO &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Out in the countryside, Serbs and
ethnic Albanian rebels have been fighting over Kosovo province with
land mines, machine guns and tanks.
	   Back in the so-far peaceful capital of Pristina, however, the
weapon is propaganda, with each side reporting daily events that
differ so completely they seem to come from separate planets.
	   Through their government-run news agency, Serbs claim to be
``liberating'' villages of ``terrorists'' _ their name for the
secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Ethnic Albanian groups rely on the Internet, using e-mail and
Web sites to charge that all of Kosovo is ``in flames'' and that
Serbs are practicing ``ethnic cleansing,'' the emotional Balkan war
buzzword that conjures images of Serbs in Bosnia methodically
wiping out Muslims.
	   Each side also has information centers in Pristina, which churn
out press releases only slightly more impartial.
	   Serbs say a village was ``taken.'' Albanians say it has
``fallen.''
	   Albanians never mention Serbs killed by the KLA. Serbs never
refer to the masses of ethnic Albanian refugees.
	   Call it spin.
	   ___
	   One of the weirder moments in Kosovo public relations happened
last week, when Serbs escorted a convoy of visitors to a burial
ground.
	   Eager to disprove reports of a mass grave in the town of
Orahovac, Serb police said they had ``correctly'' buried 40 ethnic
Albanians at the site, essentially an old garbage dump.
	   Serb police insisted it wasn't a dump, despite old trash mixed
with dirt and a fresh pile of garbage nearby.
	   On the other hand, police had no qualms about leading the convoy
through the town of Malisevo, where a row of shops was charred and
smoking and one shop was still in flames.
	   When accused of burning down villages, Serb police usually say
ethnic Albanians are setting fire to their homes before they flee.
But Malisevo had been in Serb control for more than a week, and it
was clear Serbs had burned the shops.
	   ___
	   Driving around the Drenica region is spooky these days because
all the residents have fled to the hills. Village after village in
the historic ethnic Albanian stronghold is burned or wrecked by
mortar shells.
	   Left behind are farm animals. Milk cows wander the roads in pain
from udders near bursting. Calves gallop in deranged circles.
There's plenty of hay, but no water and no one to draw from the
wells.
	   Crazed dogs leap in front of cars, most loaded with journalists,
diplomatic monitors and aid workers hoping to make it past Serb
police checkpoints to reach refugees.
	   From tanks and armored personnel carriers, Serb soldiers and
police flash their victory salute: two fingers and thumb.
	   ___
	   His body has not been found. So the family of Adem Ademi erected
a shrine to his memory just off the dirt road of their village.
Deep in the hills, it was one pocket of Drenica last week still
untouched by Serb police.
	   Ademi's framed photo rests on a table against the crimson
backdrop of the flag of neighboring Albania. He was 29.
	   Sitting under a nearby shelter of twined branches covered with
leaves, Ademi's father told a story typical of many Kosovo
Liberation Army rebels.
	   Ademi was living in Germany but came home when fighting started
five months ago to ``protect his family and defend his house.'' An
overwhelming number of Kosovo Albanians work in Germany, Austria or
Switzerland, sending money to their large families back home.
	   There's a saying that Albanians need 10 children in Kosovo _
``nine to fight for independence, and one to keep.''
	   ___
	   Not only ethnic Albanians are searching for missing loved one.
	   On Thursday, a large group of Serbs talked first to journalists
at the Serbian Media Center in Pristina, then went to the offices
of the International Red Cross and the U.S. Information Services.
	   They said their relatives, about 140 people, had been kidnapped
by the KLA.

Poland lifts suspension of soccer committee right before deadline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDs two grafs with all but one game canceled and details on
soccer president's dismissal

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The sports minister reinstated Poland's
soccer administrators late Friday after they agreed to an
investigation into allegations of mismanagement, meeting a deadline
set by the World and European Soccer Federations.
	   FIFA and UEFA had refused to extend a midnight deadline for
lifting suspensions on the Polish Football Association, which would
mean that Polish teams could not take part in upcoming
international competitions.
	   At a news conference Saturday, Sports Minister Jacek Debski said
he sent a fax to the world soccer group, FIFA, in Zurich,
Switzerland 15 minutes before deadline informing them of lifting
the suspensions, imposed in May.
	   ``Conditions set by FIFA and UEFA were met and I don't see why
those institutions would make decisions unfavorable for Polish
soccer,'' said Debski.
	   Polish Soccer Federation administrators agreed to a probe of
mismanagement, due to begin on Monday, only a half an hour before
the FIFA deadline, Debski said.
	   The administrators had previously claimed they were independent
of state controls and had refused to accept the sports ministry's
appointment of a control board supervisor to examine their records.
	   Debski said he now expects voluntary dismissal of Soccer
Federation President Marian Dziurowicz, which would open the way
for reforming Polish soccer.
	   Poland's national team, which achieved successes in 1970s and
early 1980s, has not qualified for soccer's World Cup since 1982.
Debski blames administrators and soccer activists for corruption
among players and referees, lack of training facilities and
programs.
	   On Saturday, five scheduled first division games were canceled
in protest of Dziurowicz's failure to quit immediately. Only the
game between GKS Katowice and Ruch Radzionkow took place.
Dziurowicz was once chairman of the Katowice club.
	   The soccer federation, which is to meet Wednesday, will decide
on Dziurowicz's dismissal, said federation spokesman Tomasz
Jagodzinski.
	   It will also call for a general meeting of national soccer
activists and invite FIFA and UEFA representatives.

Late layup gives Russia 66-64 win over US

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Sergey Panov drove the length of the court
to score the winning layup with 4 seconds left as Russia rallied to
beat the United States 66-64 Saturday and reach the gold medal game
at the World Basketball Championship.
	   Wendell Alexis banked in a desperation 30-foot shot which would
have won the game for the ragtag Americans, but he released the
ball just after the final buzzer.
	   The United States, which went scoreless for the final 3:08, will
play for the bronze Sunday.
	   Sergey Babkov had a game-high 30 points for Russia, while
Vassily Karassev added 10.
	   Fittingly, no one stood out for the U.S. crew of castoffs.
Center Gerald King, who plays in Italy, led the way with 10 points,
but had none after halftime.
	   The loss means the United States will have to go through
qualifying for a spot in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Only the world
champion and host Australia earn automatic berths.
	   Saturday's games was a rematch of the gold medal game at the
1994 world championship, which Dream Team II, stocked with such
stars as Shaquille O'Neal, Reggie Miller and Shawn Kemp, won
137-91.
	   While the core of that Russian team still is in uniform for the
country, this U.S. squad is vastly different, of course.
	   With the NBA lockout looming, the stars threatened to boycott
the worlds and USA Basketball responded in mid-June by dumping them
in favor of a mix of players mostly from the minor-league CBA and
European leagues.
	   European champion Yugoslavia, which plays the best basketball
outside of the NBA and got the silver medal behind the Dream Team
in the '96 Olympics, played Greece in Saturday's second semifinal.
	   An emphatic breakaway dunk by Jimmy King gave the United States
a 62-52 lead with 6:21 left, but Russia fought back. Babkov hit
back-to-back 3-pointers to tie the score, 64-64, with 1:23 on the
clock.
	   The United States missed trey attempts on consecutive trips up
the court and then Hawkins was whistled for an offensive foul with
10 seconds remaining. Karassev inbounded the ball to Panov (7
points), who dribbled through the U.S. defense for the winner.
	   Jason Sasser's off-balance jumper off the glass at the buzzer _
his only shot of the first half _ gave the United States a 39-37
lead at the break. It was the Americans' first lead since the
opening minutes of the game.
	   Greece hasn't captured a medal at a major event since it hosted
and won 1987 European championship. That tournament was also the
last time it defeated Yugoslavia.
	   The Yugoslavians were 70-62 winners Friday over Argentina, while
Greece reached the medal round by holding on for a 69-62 victory
over Spain.
	   Elsewhere Saturday, in games to determine fifth through eighth
places, Italy defeated Lithuania 76-71, while Spain beat Argentina
77-64. Also, Australia edged Brazil 79-75 to take ninth place and
Puerto Rico beat Canada 92-81 for 11th.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Investigators began a painstaking search
for clues to the terrorist bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania Saturday as Israeli rescue experts and sniffer dogs
took over the hunt for survivors in Nairobi.
	   The parking lot behind the Nairobi embassy, where a car bomb was
believed to have exploded, was monitored by closed circuit
television cameras which could provide a crucial clue _ but U.S.
Ambassador Prudence Bushnell said she didn't know whether the
cameras or film survived the blast.
	   The FBI, which sent 60 investigators to Nairobi and a separate
team to Dar es Salaam, has said its top priority is to determine
the kind of vehicle and the type of explosive device used in the
attacks, which spokesman Frank Scafidi said ``can be like a
fingerprint of who did it.''
	   Bushnell, who was injured in the attack, told a news conference
she saw at least one burning vehicle behind the embassy when,
bloody and somewhat dazed, she was led from a neighboring building.
	   ``I have no idea what kind of a vehicle it is, and that's one of
the many, many, many questions that I hope is going to be answered
in the next few days with the people who are coming in,'' she said.
	   Just a few minutes apart, the suspected car bombings 700
kilometers (450 miles) from each other Friday turned busy streets
in two African capitals into bloody piles of concrete and knots of
steel.
	   The bombings caused outrage and grief in the United States and
were national tragedies of immense proportions in Kenya and
Tanzania which have never before been terrorist targets.
	   In Kenya, the death toll rose to at least 140, including 11
Americans, the U.S. Embassy said. The State Department said a child
was among those killed and four other Americans were missing.
	   Bushnell said 14 Kenyan employees at the embassy died and 109
were unaccounted for. She said embassy staffers were trying to find
out whether they were alive or still buried under the rubble.
	   Seven people died in the Tanzanian bombing, but no Americans
were killed there.
	   With 4,257 people injured in Nairobi and a total of 154 people
still missing, medical facilities in Nairobi were overwhelmed and
some victims were taken to hospitals 30 miles (48 kms) away.
	   Some 200 people were still in need of urgent treatment at
Kenyatta Hospital and there were shortages of syringes, needles and
blood for transfusions, the Red Cross said.
	   President Daniel Arap Moi met diplomats Saturday and appealed
for medicine such as intravenous fluids, pain killers and
antibiotics.
	   Anxious relatives and friends went from hospital to hospital,
and finally to the morgues looking for missing loved ones.
	   ``I am looking for my sister. I have looked for her in all the
hospitals before finally I decided to come here,'' Daniel Maina
said outside the mortuary.
	   He followed a trail of bloody footprints inside, holding a hand
to his nose against the stench of rotten and singed flesh. Most of
the 80 bodies were charred. The head of a woman wearing blue jeans
was blown off.
	   Among the dead, Maina found his sister.
	   Exhausted Kenya army, police and civilian rescue teams who
recovered eight bodies on Saturday welcomed the arrival of 118
Israelis who brought eight sniffer dogs and specialized equipment
to search for victims.
	   Two Kenyans _ a man and a woman _ were still trapped but Israeli
and Kenyan officials were hopeful that they could be saved.
	   It was not immediately known who was responsible.
	   The only claim so far has been by a previously unknown group
calling itself the ``Army for the Liberation of Islamic Shrines.''
	   It took responsibility in a phone call to the Cairo, Egypt
office of Al-Hayat, a daily Arabic language newspaper published in
London. The caller gave no clues about the group's makeup.
	   Unknown groups frequently claim responsibility after terrorist
attacks.
	   A group known as the Islamic Jihad vowed last week to strike
American interests because some of its members were arrested in
Albania, according to a report in Thursday's Al-Hayat.
	   Several groups use the name Islamic Jihad. This one is
considered the successor to groups that assassinated Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
	   One suspected terrorist being examined in the wake of the
explosions is exiled Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, U.S.
officials said. Bin Laden has threatened a holy war against U.S.
troops and Americans.
	   He also is suspected of backing other terrorist acts including
the 1996 attack in Saudi Arabia.
	   A man was seen being taken into custody at the Nairobi bombing
scene. Witnesses said he spoke Arabic, but police would not
comment. His connection, if any, to the bombings was not known.
	   Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana told a news conference that a car
bomb apparently went off in front of the entrance to the basement
parking lot of the American Embassy.
	   ``It is probable that in fact the person tried to get in and
could not get into the basement,'' he said.
	   ``Whether it was suicidal and the person involved was in it or
not, is difficult to say,'' Godana said.

Horton moves two clear of Barnes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORTRUSH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Tommy Horton birdied three of
the last five holes for a 3-under 69 Saturday to move two strokes
ahead of former Ryder Cup teammate Brian Barnes at the Senior
British Open.
	   Horton wound up with a three-round total of 209 at Royal
Portrush with Barnes, who carded a 68, on 211.
	   With Welshman Brian Huggett on 212 after a 71 and Northern
Ireland's Eddie Polland a further stroke back, Horton, who has
never won the title despite 19 wins on the senior tour, is six
strokes clear of the fifth-place players.
	   Horton moved two clear of the field with birdies at the second
and ninth. But he hooked his second shot into the rough at the
par-five 10th and took another four shots to get down.
	   Another dropped shot on the 12th put him further back but Horton
then started his move with a birdie two at the 14th.
	   Two more on the 15th and 17th took him to seven under par and he
saved par at the last with an eight-foot putt despite hitting his
second in the rough on the right.
	   ``It's a nice cushion going into the final round but this is an
Open Championship and there are good players up there,'' Horton
said. ``The putter was working and it was a relief to hole those
putts towards the end.
	   ``I will just try to go out there and keep smiling and hopefully
at the end I will have the biggest smile.''
	   Barnes reached the turn in 33, three under par, but dropped a
shot at the 12th. He moved to within a shot of Horton with birdies
at the 14th and 17th until the leader also birdied 17.
	   Leading United States challenger Jay Dolan III picked up eight
birdies in nine holes from the ninth, his amazing run only spoilt
by a double bogey six on the last. His back nine of 31 gave him the
best of the tournament, a 67, and he stands tied for 12th on 218,
nine off the lead.

Catholic youths attack policemen after bitter Protestant march
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; NEW throughout
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Catholic youths attacked
two policemen, forcing a colleague to fire shots into the air,
after an annual Protestant parade passed through Londonderry's
disputed center Saturday.
	   About a dozen teen-agers surrounded the two officers, knocked
them down with stones and kicked them repeatedly in the face and
body minutes after Protestant marchers passed through the other
side of the Diamond, the central square in Northern Ireland's
second-largest city.
	   Another policeman fired two shots from a pistol to scatter the
cheering attackers. Both officers, one with a bloodied forehead,
were carried away and taken to Londonderry's Altnagelvin hospital
where they were reported in stable condition.
	   The violence capped a tense, hate-filled afternoon in
Londonderry, where an agreement between Protestant leaders of the
Apprentice Boys brotherhood and Catholic protesters from the
Bogside Residents Group had minimized the chance that the parade
would trigger outright sectarian conflict.
	   The Bogsiders had agreed not to physically block the annual
parade, as they have threatened in previous years, after the
Protestants promised to play no music on walls overlooking the
Bogside and not to parade in a circle in the Diamond.
	   Despite this, a few hundred Catholics _ most of them teen-agers
and children _ walked to the Diamond to jeer the marchers and throw
objects across police lines.
	   And the Protestant marchers also broke the spirit of the
agreement, which specified that the parade should skirt the edge of
the Diamond without loud music.
	   Egged on by drunken and baying spectators, many of the more than
50 swaggering ``kick the pope'' bands of fife and drum accompanying
the Apprentice Boys intentionally pumped up the volume as they
neared the square.
	   One band played a bigoted variant of ``Home on the Range,''
whose lyrics include: ``Oh give me a home where there's no pope of
Rome, where there's nothing but Protestants stay ...''
	   Others half-shouted, half-sang ``We Are the Billy Boys,'' which
includes the line: ``We're up to our necks in Fenian blood,
surrender or you'll die!'' Fenians is a Protestant term of abuse
for Irish Catholics.
	   Beer cans and bottles, rocks and chunks of brick sporadically
flew through the air across the Diamond between the sides during
the 2 1/2 hours it took the parade to pass along the edge of the
Diamond.
	   Many projectiles struck riot police and their armored cars
separating the two camps. Others found their mark among the ranks
of Protestant marchers, who responded by furiously but futilely
trying to breach the lines of riot police.
	   Police made just one arrest during the parade _ a Protestant man
who climbed a streetlight pole waving a Union Jack flag _ but for
hours afterward waged running battles with gangs of Catholic youths
in hopes of flushing them back into the Bogside.
	   Several shops had windows broken by stones, and Catholic
children destroyed the two wreaths laid by Apprentice Boys at the
Diamond's memorial to the dead from two world wars.
	   The day began positively as about 400 Apprentice Boys
accompanied by the Black Skull fife-and-drum band paraded along the
most contentious section of their route _ the 17th-century
battlements that overlook the Bogside.
	   But tension grew after the Apprentice Boys' service at the
nearby Anglican cathedral, where the group gave formal thanks for
Protestants' successful defense of Londonderry from a Catholic army
in 1689.
	   More than 10,000 members and supporters from all over Northern
Ireland then joined local Apprentice Boys in a second, mass parade
into the Diamond and back out again into the predominantly
Protestant east side of the city.
	   The Apprentice Boys take their name from the apprentice
tradesmen who bolted the gates of Londonderry as the army of the
deposed Catholic king of Britain, James II, approached the walled
town 310 years ago. The starving occupants survived a 105-day
siege, an event emblazoned in Protestant folk memory.

Late layup gives Russia 66-64 win over US

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ It was too much to ask.
	   After a series of narrow escapes, the U.S. crew of castoffs at
the World Basketball Championship could not produce one more
Saturday, losing to Russia 66-64 in the semifinals.
	   Sergey Panov drove the length of the court to score the winning
layup with 4 seconds as Russia completed a late rally from a
10-point deficit and advanced the gold medal game.
	   Wendell Alexis banked in a desperation 30-foot shot which would
have won the game for the ragtag Americans, but he released the
ball just after the final buzzer.
	   The United States, which went scoreless for the final 3:08, will
play for the bronze Sunday. A loss would mean the first worlds
without a U.S. medal in 20 years.
	   ``It was the chance of a lifetime for us,'' U.S. center David
Wood said. ``The guys are devastated. It wasn't because of a lack
of effort. (Russia) played like a veteran team.''
	   Russia's Sergey Babkov had a game-high 30 points, including
back-to-back 3-pointers that tied the game, 64-64, with 1:23
remaining. Vassily Karassev added 10.
	   Fittingly, no one stood out for the makeshift U.S. team. Center
Gerald King, who plays in Italy, led the way with 10 points, but
had none after halftime.
	   European champion Yugoslavia faced Greece later Saturday for the
other spot in Sunday's title game.
	   The loss to Russia means the United States will have to go
through qualifying for a spot in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Only the
world champion and host Australia earn automatic berths.
	   Saturday's game was a rematch of the gold medal game at the 1994
world championship, in which Dream Team II, stocked with such stars
as Shaquille O'Neal, Reggie Miller and Shawn Kemp, routed Russia
137-91.
	   While the core of that Russian team is in Athens, this U.S.
squad is vastly different, of course.
	   With the NBA lockout looming, the stars threatened to boycott
the worlds and USA Basketball responded in mid-June by dumping them
in favor of a mix of players mostly from the minor-league CBA and
European leagues.
	   ``I feel we had the game under control,'' said Wood, who is with
a club in the Italian League, ``but we played like a real young
team. They took the game from us. We made the mistakes of an
inexperienced team.''
	   The United States had moved into the semis thanks to a
three-point win over Italy in the quarterfinals and a two-point
victory over Spain in preliminary play.
	   And an emphatic breakaway dunk by Jimmy King gave the United
States a 62-52 lead with 6:21 left, but Russia fought back and tied
the game on Babkov's treys.
	   ``We had a nice 10-point lead, but we had several mental lapses,
like leaving the best shooter we've seen all year wide open,'' U.S.
coach Rudy Tomjanovich said.
	   The United States missed 3-pointers on consecutive trips up the
court and then point guard Michael Hawkins was whistled for an
offensive foul with 10 seconds remaining.
	   Karassev inbounded the ball to Panov (7 points), who dribbled
through the U.S. defense for the winner.
	   Jason Sasser's off-balance jumper off the glass at the buzzer _
his only shot of the first half _ gave the United States a 39-37
lead at the break. It was the Americans' first lead since the
opening minutes of the game.
	   Elsewhere Saturday, in games to determine fifth through eighth
places, Italy defeated Lithuania 76-71, while Spain beat Argentina
77-64. Also, Australia edged Brazil 79-75 to take ninth place and
Puerto Rico beat Canada 92-81 for 11th.

the game on Babkov's treys.
	   ``We had a nice 10-point lead, but we had several mental lapses,
like leaving the best shooter we've seen all year wide open,'' U.S.
coach Rudy Tomjanovich said.
	   The United States missed 3-pointers on consecutive trips up the
court and then point guard Michael Hawkins was whistled for an
offensive foul with 10 seconds remaining.
	   Karassev inbounded the ball to Panov (7 points), who dribbled
through the U.S. defense for the winner.
	   Jason Sasser's off-balance jumper off the glass at the buzzer _
his only shot of the first half _ gave the United States a 39-37
lead at the break. It was the Americans' first lead since the
opening minutes of the game.
	   Elsewhere Saturday, in games to determine fifth through eighth
places, Italy defeated Lithuania 76-71, while Spain beat Argentina
77-64. Also, Australia edged Brazil 79-75 to take ninth place and
Puerto Rico beat Canada 92-81 for 11th.

Icelandic signing nets late leveller for Bolton at Palace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Manchester City's division two game, Scottish penalty
shootout drama &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Icelandic international Arnar Gunnlaugsson powered
home a last-minute equalizer Saturday as Bolton hit back to tie 2-2
with Crystal Palace. That means that two teams relegated from the
Premier League started the new season in division one even.
	   Bolton took the lead through Dean Holdsworth in the 33th minute
only for Palace, now managed by former England and Australia coach
Terry Venables, went 2-1 ahead through Matt Jansen and Yugoslav
international Sasa Curcic.
	   Venables' team looked set to start with a win until
Gunnlaugsson, who replaced Scott Sellars 20 minutes from the end,
drove the ball from from 20 meters (yards) for a spectacular
leveller.
	   Barnsley, the other team relegated from the Premier League,
twice fell behind but gained a 2-2 tie at home to West Bromwich
Albion thanks to headed equalizers by Dutch defender Arjan De
Zeeuw.
	   Another Dutch player, Richard Sneekes, had fired the Baggies
ahead and Albion's other goal came from Northern Ireland
international James Quinn after a dazzling run by Irish
international winger Kevin Kilbane.
	   Sunderland, beaten by Charlton on penalties in a post-season
promotion playoff, started its latest attempt to regain a Premier
League place with a 1-0 victory over Queens Park Rangers before
some 40,000 fans at the Stadium of Light.
	   It needed a penalty 15 minutes from the end after Rangers'
defender Ian Barraclough had blocked a goalbound header with his
hand. Barraclough was sent off and Kevin Phillips scored from the
spot.
	   Grim news for Sunderland was that former Newcastle midfielder
Lee Clark broke his leg during the game in an challenge by QPR
midfelder Keith Rowland.
	   Sheffield United, beaten in the playoff semifinal, scored a 2-1
victory over modest Swindon thanks to first half goals by Graham
Stuart and Vassilis Borbokis. An own goal by David Holdsworth
provided Swindon's lone reply.
	   Birmingham, which just missed out on the playoffs after a late
run last season, scored an impressive 2-0 win at Port Vale thanks
to goals by Paul Furlong and Dele Adebola.
	   Wolves, another club likely to be among the promotion
contenders, cruised to a 2-0 victory over Tranmere with goals from
18-year-old Irish international Robbie Keane and a penalty by
former England international defender Keith Curle.
	   Danish international Soren Andersen scored twice on his debut
for promoted Bristol City but the Robins were held 2-2 by Oxford
United at Ashton Gate.
	   Watford, another promoted club which has former England manager
Graham Taylor at the helm, scored a 2-1 win at Portsmouth after two
goals in the last 10 minutes _ an Andy Thompson own goal and a
strike by former Nottingham Forest forward Jason Lee.
	   Relegated for the second time in three seasons and now outside
the top two leagues for the first time in its 111-year history,
once-proud Manchester City scored a 3-0 victory over Blackpool in
division two with goals from Shaun Goater, Lee Bradbury and
Kakhaber Tskhadadze.
	   In the second round of the Scottish League Cup, goalkeeper Sieb
Dykstra rescued Premier League Dundee United from embarrassment
against division two Stirling Albion with three penalty shootout
saves after the two teams had tied 2-2 at United's Tannadice
stadium.
	   United won the shootout 3-0.

Former Soviet president calls for early Russian elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev called
Saturday for early presidential elections in Russia, along with
parliamentary elections and a referendum on a new constitution, a
news agency said.
	   ``Russia needs a new president, a new government and a new
parliament,'' Gorbachev said in an interview with the Interfax news
agency.
	   Gorbachev has been a frequent critic of Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, and the two men have long been rivals. Gorbachev has said
in the past that the current constitution _ ramrodded into law by
Yeltsin _ gives the president far too much power.
	   He repeated that Saturday, saying the constitution should be
amended to allow for ``a more fitting balance between powers.''
	   He also called for an amendment giving outgoing presidents a
lifetime term in the Federation Council, the upper house of
Russia's parliament.
	   In calling for early elections, Gorbachev said it would be ``an
intractable task'' for Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and his
government to lead the country out of its current economic crisis.
	   ``They are doomed to failure because 80 percent of the people
today to not support this government,'' Gorbachev said. ``Let those
whom people trust come to power through elections.''
	   The next presidential elections are scheduled for 2000.
	   Gorbachev is one of the few people in Russia who ranks lower in
opinion polls than Yeltsin, and his call for elections is unlikely
to carry much weight.

CNN reporter and State Department spokesman wed in Italy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRACCIANO, Italy (AP) _ She covers the globe for millions of
viewers. He speaks for the Clinton administration on foreign
policy. They married overseas Saturday in an Old World church with
a Renaissance bell tower.
	   Townspeople in this sleepy village whose lake is lined with
villas turned out along with famous guests like John F. Kennedy Jr.
for the wedding of CNN foreign correspondent Christiane Amanpour
and State Department spokesman James Rubin.
	   Celebrating the marriage in St. Stephen's Church was a hospital
chaplain from Dublin Amanpour had met in Tehran. Afterwards, the
couple moved to a lakeside garden for a Jewish blessing.
	   Sleeveless and simple seemed to be the motif of the moment.
Amanpour wore a plain veil and a sheath-like, full-length dress
with neither train nor sleeves. Kennedy's wife, Caroline Bessette,
showed up in a sleekly-fitting black dress complementing
well-tanned arms.
	   The groom sported a gray tie, black suit and white carnation,
and, after the ceremony, grains of rice in his hair.
	   The bride clutched a small bouquet of white and peach-colored
roses wrapped in a single, huge leaf. Sunflowers towering out of
vases and laurel garlands draped here and there added touches of
color. The voice of a friend of the bride singing a version of
``Ave Maria'' and notes of Vivaldi drifted to the outside.
	   Reception for the 180 guests, among them the U.S. special envoy
Richard Holbrooke, was right next door in something most people
don't have right next door -- a late 15th-century castle with a
library with frescoed ceiling and a loggia looking out on the lake
40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Rome.
	   ``It's a wonderful place for a wedding,'' said Kennedy.

International powers propose solution to Kosovo troubles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMS. UPDATES with KLA faction consent to join Rugova; reax
from Western diplomat; CHANGES byline.
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Peace negotiations for Kosovo
province were back on track, a Western diplomat said Sunday, as a
heavy Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels appeared to be
winding down.
	   Serbs and ethnic Albanians were reviewing a blueprint for talks,
and one faction of the Kosovo Liberation Army has agreed in
principle to join politicians in an alliance that would form the
basis for an ethnic Albanian negotiating team.
	   Diplomats on Friday and Saturday handed both sides a proposal
outlining models for how autonomy might work in Kosovo, a province
of the Serb republic of Yugoslavia where KLA rebels have been
fighting for independence. The province has a large majority of
ethnic Albanians.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has agreed to restore
Kosovo's autonomy, which he revoked in 1989, and ethnic Albanian
politicians have said they would accept autonomy as a first step to
independence. But the biggest stumbling block to negotiations has
been the KLA, a loosely organized band, in which moderate factions
lean toward politicians and extremists reject any options that
might forsake their secessionist goals.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, a Rugova-allied politician said
Saturday that a moderate KLA faction had ``agreed in principle'' to
enter an alliance with ethnic Albanian politicians and headed by
Rugova to be formed in Kosovo.
	   Ilaz Ramajli told The Associated Press that the KLA had not yet
announced its final decision, ``but they are examining all the
proposes made to them in a positive way.''
	   It is impossible to pin down who, if anyone, has the authority
to speak for the entire KLA, nevertheless, a Western diplomat said
Ramajli's statement showed that painstaking, U.S.-led diplomacy
toward starting talks was again moving forward.
	   The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the
combination of events _ the presentation of the autonomy blueprint,
and a KLA faction showing readiness to join politicians _ added up
to a sign of progress.
	   The blueprint was drafted by the so-called Contact Group of six
international powers _ Britain, Germany, France, Italy, the United
States and Russia _ which has been trying to secure a political
solution for Kosovo since fighting between Serb forces and the KLA
escalated in March.
	   ``We hope that both parties will find ideas in this paper
helpful to them when they sit down to negotiate, which we believe
they must,'' said Brian Donelly, the British ambassador to
Yugoslavia, who presented the paper to both sides.
	   Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky, who with
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill has been working to bring the two sides
closer together, said the document was ``about possible variants of
political solution.''
	   ``It is about different degrees of autonomy in similar
situations in different European countries _ not a prepared recipe
or the imposing of a solution,'' Afanasyevsky said.
	   From the beginning, international powers have rejected
independence for Kosovo, fearful that it would encourage extremist
groups seeking to annex parts of Macedonia and the smaller Yugoslav
republic, Montenegro, dominated by ethnic Albanians, and join them
with Kosovo in a ``Greater Albania.''
	   The Russian envoy said the proposal reiterated that stance,
firmly supporting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Serbia and Yugoslavia.
	   Yugoslav officials called the proposal a ``positive step,'' but
Albanians were less enthusiastic.
	   After meeting with Donelly, Rugova repeated his mantra that
``the best solution ... is an independent and neutral Kosovo with
the possibility of international protectorate as an interim
phase.''
	   While the recent Serb offensive against the rebels has been
winding down, Serb forces on Saturday continued attacks on villages
in the Drenica region, a hotbed of ethnic Albanian nationalism. The
operation appeared designed to secure Serb control on KLA
strongholds seized in recent days.
	   The Rugova-allied Kosovo Information Center said Serb forces
gave an ultimatum to three KLA-controlled villages near Djakovica
to surrender by Saturday evening, or face attack.
	   An immediate priority of the Contact Group proposal, Donelly
said, was to stop the fighting and to create secure conditions for
ethnic Albanian refugees to return to their homes.
	   Tens of thousands of people have been driven from their homes in
the past two weeks, swelling the ethnic Albania refugee population
to an estimated 200,000 since the fighting started in March.
	   Many recent refugees are camped in forests and hills where they
have little to eat or drink, and U.S. envoy Hill has warned of a
``humanitarian catastrophe.''

Former agent says Britain plotted to assassinate Libyan leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A former British intelligence agent has said
Britain's foreign intelligence agency engineered a plot to
assassinate Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
	   David Shayler said in a televised interview Friday with the
British Broadcasting Corp. that Britain channeled about 100,000
pounds (dlrs 160,000) to an Islamic group to kill the Libyan
leader.
	   The government has denied Shayler's allegations about Gadhafi,
which first surfaced last week in Britain's Sunday newspapers. The
BBC interview was the most detailed account so far.
	   ``It is not true,'' Home Office minister Lord Williams said
earlier in the week.
	   Shayler, who worked for Britain's internal MI5 intelligence
agency until 1997, was arrested in Paris on Aug. 1. London is
trying to extradite him to face charges under the Official Secrets
Act.
	   Shayler said in the interview that when he was attached to the
section of MI5 that dealt with Libya, he was in regular contact
with counterparts at MI6, the country's foreign intelligence
agency.
	   Shayler said he learned MI6 had given money to a ``Libyan
Islamist extremist group'' that mounted a failed assassination
attempt on Gadhafi by planting a bomb under a road on which the
Libyan leader was traveling. The BBC reported that the February
1996 attack killed several people.
	   The interview was recorded before Shayler's arrest.

Sweden becomes sixth to qualify for Women's World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Sweden became the sixth nation to qualify
for next year's Women's World Cup on Saturday, getting goals from
five different players to beat Ukraine 5-0.
	   Jane Tornqvist scored the only goal the Swedes needed five
minutes after the opening kickoff and Hanna Ljungberg added another
in the 33rd before Christine Lilja, Kristin Bengtsson and Camilla
Ackerfors completed the rout with second-half tallies.
	   Ukraine joined Italy, China, North Korea, Japan and Brazil in
the 16-nation finals field along with the host United States for
the 17-match event set for June 19-July 10, 1999.
	   Four more teams will qualify from Europe. Ukraine fell to 2-0-3
in Group One with the loss, but remained in second place a point
ahead of Iceland, which has a game in hand, for a berth in the
European playoffs.
	   European group winners qualify automatically with the runners-up
drawn into two, two-leg playoff with the winners on aggregate
qualifying.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An officer of Russia's Federal Security Service
has been released from captivity in Chechnya, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported Saturday.
	   The officer, identified only as Maj. M. Golikov, was released
Friday as a result of a rescue operation carried out by a joint
Russian-Chechen force, the news agency said. It did not say where
the operation occurred, who had been holding Golikov or how long he
had been held.
	   The Federal Security Service is the successor agency to the
Soviet KGB.
	   Kidnappings have been a frequent occurrence in Chechnya since
the end of the province's 1994-96 war for independence. They are
usually motivated by ransom.

Late layup gives Russia 66-64 win over US
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Russia quotes, Babkov played 24 minutes. Edits. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ It was too much to ask.
	   The crew of castoffs defending the U.S. title at the World
Basketball Championship could not produce one more escape and lost
to Russia 66-64 Saturday in the semifinals.
	   Sergey Panov drove the length of the court to score the winning
layup with 4 seconds left as Russia completed a late rally from a
10-point deficit and advanced the gold medal game.
	   Wendell Alexis banked in a desperation 30-foot shot which would
have won the game for the ragtag Americans, but he released the
ball just after the final buzzer.
	   The United States, which went scoreless for the final 3:08, will
play for third place Sunday. A loss would mean the first worlds
without a U.S. medal in 20 years.
	   ``It was the chance of a lifetime for us,'' U.S. center David
Wood said. ``The guys are devastated. It wasn't because of a lack
of effort. (Russia) played like a veteran team.''
	   Russia's Sergey Babkov had a game-high 30 points in just 24
minutes, including back-to-back 3-pointers that tied the game,
64-64, with 1:23 remaining. Vassily Karassev added 10 points.
	   Fittingly, no one stood out for the makeshift U.S. team. Center
Gerard King, who plays in Italy, led the way with 10 points, but
had none after halftime.
	   ``In a competitive tournament like this it is difficult to be
competitive night after night,'' Russian coach Sergey Belov said.
``We were able to come back tonight even though we weren't at 100
percent.''
	   European champion Yugoslavia faced Greece later Saturday for the
other spot in Sunday's title game.
	   The loss to Russia means the United States will have to go
through qualifying for a spot in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Only the
world champion and host Australia earn automatic berths.
	   Saturday's game was a rematch of the gold medal game at the 1994
world championship, in which Dream Team II, stocked with such stars
as Shaquille O'Neal, Reggie Miller and Shawn Kemp, routed Russia
137-91.
	   While the core of that Russian team is in Athens, this U.S.
squad is vastly different, of course.
	   With the NBA lockout looming, the stars threatened to boycott
the worlds. USA Basketball responded by dumping the NBAers in favor
of a mix of players mostly from the minor-league CBA and European
leagues.
	   ``I feel we had the game under control,'' said Wood, who is with
a club in the Italian League, ``but we played like a real young
team. They took the game from us. We made the mistakes of an
inexperienced team.''
	   The United States had moved into the semis thanks to a
three-point win over Italy in the quarterfinals and a two-point
victory over Spain in preliminary play.
	   And an emphatic breakaway dunk by Jimmy King gave the United
States a 62-52 lead with 6:21 left, but Russia fought back and tied
the game on Babkov's treys.
	   ``We had a nice 10-point lead, but we had several mental lapses,
like leaving the best shooter we've seen all year wide open,'' said
U.S. coach Rudy Tomjanovich, who cobbled together his team in about
a month.
	   The United States missed 3-pointers on consecutive trips up the
court _ the team went 4-for-20 (20 percent) from behind the arc
overall _ and then point guard Michael Hawkins was whistled for an
offensive foul with 10 seconds remaining.
	   Karassev inbounded the ball to Panov (7 points), who dribbled
through the U.S. defense for the winner.
	   ``The original plan was to get the ball to Babkov, but it went
to Panov so the play changed on the fly,'' Belov said.
	   Jason Sasser's off-balance jumper off the glass at the buzzer _
his only shot of the first half _ gave the United States a 39-37
lead at the break. It was the Americans' first lead since the
opening minutes of the game.
	   Elsewhere Saturday, in games to determine fifth through eighth
places, Italy defeated Lithuania 76-71, while Spain beat Argentina
77-64. Also, Australia edged Brazil 79-75 to take ninth place and
Puerto Rico beat Canada 92-81 for 11th.

Kofi Annan stresses the potential and problems of youth
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
inaugurated an international conference on youth policy on Saturday
with a call for governments to get closer to their young citizens.
	   ``A society that cuts itself from its youth severs its lifeline
and is condemned to bleed to death,'' Annan told some 150 senior
government officials attending the first World Conference of
Ministers Responsible for Youth.
	   The five-day conference was organized as a follow-up to the U.N.
World Program of Action for Youth adopted by the General Assembly
in 1995. Ten years after International Youth Year, the Program
identified priority issues for youth policies from drug abuse to
leisure-time activities.
	   ``A lack of political will to address the problems and the
potential of youth ... has obstructed effective governmental
action,'' according to a statement issued from the United Nations
at the start of the conference.
	   At the opening ceremony, Annan told the officials that
governments have a responsibility to help young people fulfill
their aspirations.
	   ``A growing number of them (the young) face unemployment,
insecure livelihoods, hopelessness, social exclusion and ethnic
prejudice,'' he said.
	   By the final day of the conference on Wednesday, the plenary is
due to have approved a final version of a Declaration on Youth.
	   Organizers expect a contentious debate over the clause in the
draft declaration that recognizes the special difficulties faced by
young people in countries under foreign occupation.
	   The Lisbon conference was preceded by the World Youth Forum in
the northern city of Braga, where 350 delegates from young peoples'
associations debated recommendations to take to the governmental
discussion.
	   Their recommendations included the creation of a U.N. special
rapporteur on youth rights before the turn of the century, and
direct action to increase the involvement of young people in
decision-making processes.
	   According to the United Nations, there are 1.3 billion
officially ``young'' people ages 15 to 24 who make up about
one-fifth of the global population.
	   ``No one is born a good citizen; no nation is born a democracy.
Rather both are processes that continue to evolve over a lifetime.
Young people must be included from birth,'' Annan said.

Canada wants medals taken from Smith
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Adds results of other races involving Smith; CORRECTS month of
accused tampering to January in fourth graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Canadian swimming authorities will seek to have
Michelle Smith stripped of the three gold medals she won at the
Atlanta Olympics.
	   If that happens, Canadians Marianne Limpert and Joanne Malar
would move up to first and third in the 200-meter individual medley
at the 1996 games.
	   ``We'd love to see that happen,'' Swimming Canada CEO Harold
Cliff told the Toronto Sun. ``Is it realistic? Is it practical?
That's up to the International Olympic Committee to decide.''
	   Smith was suspended for four years by FINA for tampering with an
out-of-competition urinalysis in April. The Irish swimmer has vowed
to fight the sanction and sue the swimming federation for damages.
	   Cliff said he will petition FINA later this month at meetings in
Lausanne, Switzerland, to pressure the IOC into taking back Smith's
medals.
	   Rumors of drug use have surrounded Smith ever since she won the
three golds in Atlanta, although Smith passed drug tests at the
games.
	   ``We owe it to these kids who've given so much to the sport,''
said Cliff of Limpert and Malar. ``If the national federation won't
stand up for you, who will?''
	   China's Li Lin finished between the Canadians in the 200 medley.
	   Smith also won the 400-meter freestyle and 400 individual medley
in Atlanta and finished third in the 200-meter butterfly. American
Allison Wagner finished second in the 400 medley, followed by
Krisztina Egerszegi of Hungary and Sabine Herbst of Germany.
	   Dagmar Hase of Germany and Kirsten Vlieghuis of the Netherlands
finished right behind Smith in the 400 freestyle. Kerstin Kielgass
of Germany was fourth.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with KLA faction consent to join Rugova; reax from
Western diplomat; CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Peace negotiations for Kosovo
province were back on track, a Western diplomat said Sunday, as a
heavy Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels appeared to be
winding down.
	   Serbs and ethnic Albanians were reviewing a blueprint for talks,
and one faction of the Kosovo Liberation Army has agreed in
principle to join politicians in an alliance that would form the
basis for an ethnic Albanian negotiating team.
	   Diplomats on Friday and Saturday handed both sides a proposal
outlining models for how autonomy might work in Kosovo, a province
of the Serb republic of Yugoslavia where KLA rebels have been
fighting for independence. The province has a large majority of
ethnic Albanians.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has agreed to restore
Kosovo's autonomy, which he revoked in 1989, and ethnic Albanian
politicians have said they would accept autonomy as a first step to
independence. But the biggest stumbling block to negotiations has
been the KLA, a loosely organized band, in which moderate factions
lean toward politicians and extremists reject any options that
might forsake their secessionist goals.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, a Rugova-allied politician said
Saturday that a moderate KLA faction had ``agreed in principle'' to
enter an alliance with ethnic Albanian politicians headed by Rugova
to be formed in Kosovo.
	   Ilaz Ramajli told The Associated Press that the KLA had not yet
announced its final decision, ``but they are examining all the
proposals made to them in a positive way.''
	   It is impossible to pin down who, if anyone, has the authority
to speak for the entire KLA, nevertheless, a Western diplomat said
Ramajli's statement showed that painstaking, U.S.-led diplomacy
toward starting talks was again moving forward.
	   The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the
combination of events _ the presentation of the autonomy blueprint,
and a KLA faction showing readiness to join politicians _ added up
to a sign of progress.
	   The blueprint was drafted by the so-called Contact Group of six
international powers _ Britain, Germany, France, Italy, the United
States and Russia _ which has been trying to secure a political
solution for Kosovo since fighting between Serb forces and the KLA
escalated in March.
	   ``We hope that both parties will find ideas in this paper
helpful to them when they sit down to negotiate, which we believe
they must,'' said Brian Donelly, the British ambassador to
Yugoslavia, who presented the paper to both sides.
	   Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky, who with
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill has been working to bring the two sides
closer together, said the document was ``about possible variants of
political solution.''
	   ``It is about different degrees of autonomy in similar
situations in different European countries _ not a prepared recipe
or the imposing of a solution,'' Afanasyevsky said.
	   From the beginning, international powers have rejected
independence for Kosovo, fearful that it would encourage extremist
groups seeking to annex parts of Macedonia and the smaller Yugoslav
republic, Montenegro, dominated by ethnic Albanians, and join them
with Kosovo in a ``Greater Albania.''
	   Yugoslav officials called the proposal a ``positive step,'' but
Albanians were less enthusiastic.
	   After meeting with Donelly, Rugova repeated his mantra that
``the best solution ... is an independent and neutral Kosovo with
the possibility of international protectorate as an interim
phase.''
	   While the recent Serb offensive against the rebels has been
winding down, Serb forces on Saturday continued attacks on villages
in the Drenica region, a hotbed of ethnic Albanian nationalism. The
operation appeared designed to secure Serb control on KLA
strongholds seized in recent days.
	   The Rugova-allied Kosovo Information Center said Serb forces
gave an ultimatum to three KLA-controlled villages near Djakovica
to surrender by Saturday evening, or face attack.
	   An immediate priority of the Contact Group proposal, Donelly
said, was to stop the fighting and to create secure conditions for
ethnic Albanian refugees to return to their homes.
	   Tens of thousands of people have been driven from their homes in
the past two weeks, swelling the ethnic Albania refugee population
to an estimated 200,000 since the fighting started in March.
	   Many recent refugees are camped in forests and hills where they
have little to eat or drink, and U.S. envoy Hill has warned of a
``humanitarian catastrophe.''

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban came in blazing Saturday,
raining rockets and bombs on the last major Afghan city not under
their control. Fierce street fighting was reported hours after the
religious militia claimed a shaky hold on Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Residents in the town, 300 kilometers (190 miles) northwest of
Kabul, cowered in basements, listening to a barrage of explosions.
The Islamic Republic News Agency in neighboring Iran, said bombings
were continuous and reported ``sporadic acts of resistance in the
streets.''
	   Mazar-e-Sharif is a major prize in the Taliban's four-year-old
campaign to impose their strict version of Islamic rule over all of
Afghanistan. The city's fall would be a severe blow to an
opposition already pushed to a dwindling corner of northern
Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban appeared determined not to repeat the mistake they
made last May, when they entered Mazar-e-Sharif at the invitation
of a warlord who had turned on his anti-Taliban allies. The warlord
turned again _ allegiance-switching has been a hallmark of
Afghanistan's years of civil war _ and the Taliban were driven out,
suffering heavy casualties.
	   ``Last year, we were invited in. But this time, we burned the
mountains,'' said Taliban spokesman Abdul Manam Niyazi, using an
expression for heavy fighting. Niyazi spoke by satellite phone from
Mazar-e-Sharif, claiming his forces were in complete control of the
city and had killed ``hundreds'' of opposition soldiers in the
battle. He did not mention Taliban casualties.
	   He said the opposition still controlled Hayratan, about 60
kilometers (40 miles) east. Another Taliban spokesman, Abdul Rahof,
speaking from Taliban military headquarters in the southern city of
Kandahar, said both sides were battling late Saturday for the
airport on the eastern edge of town.
	   Elsewhere, the Taliban have bribed military commanders to
surrender or counted on being welcomed by local residents either
eager to embrace anyone promising peace or to accept the Taliban as
their ethnic brothers.
	   The Taliban are in far from friendly territory in
Mazar-e-Sharif. The city is inhabited mostly by ethnic Uzbeks and
Tajiks, while the Taliban, like most other Afghans, are Pashtuns.
The Taliban are also Sunni Muslims, while the local Hezb-e-Wahadat
militia that is part of the anti-Taliban alliance adheres to the
Shiite sect of Islam.
	   Taliban radio reported Saturday that residents in areas near
Mazar-e-Sharif welcomed the Taliban by waving white flags.
Residents in Badakshan province eastern Afghanistan, along the
border with Pakistan, also reportedly raised white flags Saturday,
the radio said.
	   spokesman confirmed Taliban fighters were in Mazar-e-Sharif, but
said they did not have complete control. The spokesman, who refused
to be named, reported fierce street fighting in the city.
	   Abdullah, another anti-Taliban spokesman, claimed later that the
Taliban had been pushed to the western part of the city, leaving
behind ``tens of bodies.'' He accused the Taliban of killing many
civilians in their bombardment, but had no exact figures.
	   Abdullah, who uses one name only, said an anti-Taliban commander
had been bribed to allow the religious militia to enter the city.
But the ferocity of the fighting brought his account of a
treacherous betrayal into question.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Investigators began a painstaking search
for clues to the terrorist bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania Saturday as Israeli rescue experts and sniffer dogs
took over the hunt for survivors in Nairobi.
	   The parking lot behind the Nairobi embassy, where a car bomb was
believed to have exploded, was monitored by closed circuit
television cameras which could provide a crucial clue _ but U.S.
Ambassador Prudence Bushnell said she didn't know whether the
cameras or film survived the blast.
	   The FBI, which sent 60 investigators to Nairobi and a separate
team to Dar es Salaam, has said its top priority is to determine
the kind of vehicle and the type of explosive device used in the
attacks, which spokesman Frank Scafidi said ``can be like a
fingerprint of who did it.''
	   Bushnell, who was injured in the attack, told a news conference
she saw at least one burning vehicle behind the embassy when,
bloody and somewhat dazed, she was led from a neighboring building.
	   ``I have no idea what kind of a vehicle it is, and that's one of
the many, many, many questions that I hope is going to be answered
in the next few days with the people who are coming in,'' she said.
	   Just a few minutes apart, the suspected car bombings 700
kilometers (450 miles) from each other Friday turned busy streets
in two African capitals into bloody piles of concrete and knots of
steel.
	   The bombings caused outrage and grief in the United States and
were national tragedies of immense proportions in Kenya and
Tanzania which have never before been terrorist targets.
	   In Kenya, the death toll rose to at least 140, including 11
Americans, the U.S. Embassy said. The State Department said a child
was among those killed and four other Americans were missing.
	   Bushnell said 14 Kenyan employees at the embassy died and 109
were unaccounted for. She said embassy staffers were trying to find
out whether they were alive or still buried under the rubble.
	   Seven people died in the Tanzanian bombing, but no Americans
were killed there.
	   With 4,257 people injured in Nairobi and a total of 154 people
still missing, medical facilities in Nairobi were overwhelmed and
some victims were taken to hospitals 30 miles (48 kms) away.
	   Some 200 people were still in need of urgent treatment at
Kenyatta Hospital and there were shortages of syringes, needles and
blood for transfusions, the Red Cross said.
	   President Daniel arap Moi met diplomats Saturday and appealed
for medicine such as intravenous fluids, painkillers and
antibiotics.
	   Anxious relatives and friends went from hospital to hospital,
and finally to the morgues looking for missing loved ones.
	   ``I am looking for my sister. I have looked for her in all the
hospitals before finally I decided to come here,'' Daniel Maina
said outside the mortuary.
	   He followed a trail of bloody footprints inside, holding a hand
to his nose against the stench of rotten and singed flesh. Most of
the 80 bodies were charred. The head of a woman wearing blue jeans
was blown off.
	   Among the dead, Maina found his sister.
	   Exhausted Kenya army, police and civilian rescue teams who
recovered eight bodies on Saturday welcomed the arrival of 118
Israelis who brought eight sniffer dogs and specialized equipment
to search for victims.
	   Two Kenyans _ a man and a woman _ were still trapped but Israeli
and Kenyan officials were hopeful that they could be saved.
	   Some Kenyans complained that the Americans sealed off the
embassy and refused to allow them to help in the rescue operation,
and were confrontational.
	   ``They were just interested in protecting their damaged
embassy,'' volunteer rescue worker Fawz Abubakar was quoted as
saying in the East African Standard. ``It has given us a very bad
picture of the Americans. ... When we tried to rescue a body from
inside the U.S. Embassy they chased us awa and threatened to
shoot.''
	   Ambassador Bushnell, asked about reports of mishandling
relations with the Kenyans, accepted that there could be
misunderstandings but stressed that it was crucial to keep the area
as intact as possible for investigators.
	   ``It is in everybody's interest to find out who is behind the
evil,'' she said, speaking with a bandaged bottom lip which needed
stitches and gesturing with bandaged hands.
	   It was not immediately known who was responsible.
	   The only claim so far has been by a previously unknown group
calling itself the ``Army for the Liberation of Islamic Shrines.''
It phoned the Cairo, Egypt office of Al-Hayat, a daily Arabic
language newspaper published in London, and sent a fax to Radio
France International in Paris.
	   The group vowed in the fax to strike against U.S. forces and
intrests until all Americans and Westerners leave ``Muslim
countries in general, and Saudi Arabia in particular.''
	   Unknown groups frequently claim responsibility after terrorist
attacks.
	   A group known as the Islamic Jihad vowed last week to strike
American interests because some of its members were arrested in
Albania, according to a report in Thursday's Al-Hayat.
	   Several groups use the name Islamic Jihad. This one is
considered the successor to groups that assassinated Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
	   One suspected terrorist being examined in the wake of the
explosions is exiled Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, U.S.
officials said. Bin Laden has threatened a holy war against U.S.
troops and Americans.
	   He also is suspected of backing other terrorist acts including
the 1996 attack in Saudi Arabia.
	   A man was seen being taken into custody at the Nairobi bombing
scene. Witnesses said he spoke Arabic, but police would not
comment. His connection, if any, to the bombings was not known.
	   Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana told a news conference
that a car bomb apparently went off in front of the entrance to the
basement parking lot of the American Embassy.
	   ``It is probable that in fact the person tried to get in and
could not get into the basement,'' he said.
	   ``Whether it was suicidal and the person involved was in it (the
car) or not, is difficult to say,'' Godana said.
	   The U.S. Embassy is located at a busy intersection in downtown
Nairobi and its section of a parking lot, shared with several
banks, has a swinging-arm gate manned by unarmed private Kenyan
guards.
	   Once inside this barrier, Bushnell said, other private guards
inspect the trunk, hood and undercarriage of vehicles before they
are allowed to enter the basement parking lot.
	   She said she had worked with diplomatic security experts to beef
up security at the embassy and after an assessment two months ago,
new grills were ordered for the front of the building. They had not
yet arrived.
	   ``Did we do everything that we possibly could to make that
building safe? You bet we did. Can I look into the eyes of the
people I am going to be meeting with who lost their loved ones and
leave with a conscience clear, you bet I am,'' Bushnell said.

O'Meara goes for the hat trick at Sahalee
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ Mark O'Meara never thought he would
hear his name mentioned in the same sentence with Ben Hogan, nor
does he find it appropriate even now.
	   Hogan was the consummate perfectionist who practiced alone and
was rarely satisfied, a survivor who emerged as the most feared
competitor of his time _ four-time U.S. Open champion, winner of
nine major championships.
	   In 1953, Hogan set a standard that no one has been able to meet
by winning three major championships in one year.
	   Since then, six players in nine seasons have come to the U.S.
PGA Championship with a chance to equal him. The closest anyone
came was Tom Watson in 1977, when he finished four strokes back in
a tie for sixth.
	   The next candidate is an unlikely one.
	   O'Meara is a career grinder who played in 56 majors as a pro
before finally winning at the U.S. Masters. At age 41, he is gray
around the edges and one of the most congenial players around, a
big brother to Tiger Woods.
	   He is playing the best golf of his life, not because he has
mastered the game, but because he refuses to let it master him.
	   ``Because I put too much pressure on myself, I didn't perform as
well,'' O'Meara said. ``I backed off and said, `Listen, this is an
important tournament, but let's keep everything in check. It's not
the end of the world.' When I did that, I took a little pressure
off myself and started to perform better.''
	   He comes to Sahalee Country Club having won the U.s. Masters and
the British Open, not wanting his incredible season to end, but not
believing he is any different than before.
	   ``I don't classify myself as a great player,'' O'Meara said.
``Great players are Jack Nicklaus, Byron Nelson, Ben Hogan ... you
can go on down the list. Players who have won a lot of major
championships, have been incredible ambassadors to the game.
	   ``I consider myself a consistent player, a player that tries to
do the best I can at all times,'' he said. ``Yet I try to treat my
fellow competitors with the utmost respect. Maybe because of that,
good things happen.''
	   Good things?
	   By winning the British Open, O'Meara became the oldest player to
win two majors in one year. Since 1980, only four others have won
two majors in a season _ Nick Price in 1994, Nick Faldo in 1990,
Tom Watson in 1982 and Jack Nicklaus in 1980.
	   All of them were regarded the best in the world. And yet, when
O'Meara arrived at The Olympic Club for the U.S. Open, no one
broached the subject of a grand slam, which was fine with him.
	   ``I don't live for the limelight,'' he said.
	   But don't be deceived. O'Meara may be kind, but he is a killer
inside the ropes. He routinely takes cash from Woods in casual
rounds, despite losing about 40 yards to him off the tee.
	   Put him near the lead of a tournament, and he's usually there at
the end.
	   ``Winning one major is an honor,'' O'Meara said. ``Winning two
is a great thrill. And now, to have the opportunity to win a third,
it means a lot. I'm just hoping to give myself a chance to win on
Sunday.''
	   That in itself would be an accomplishment.
	   The U.S. PGA Championship may be the less heralded of the four
majors, but it always has the strongest field _ and this will be
the strongest ever.
	   Going into the week, 74 of the top 75 players in the world
rankings, and 92 of the top 100, are entered. The exception is Greg
Norman, out until November with a shoulder injury.
	   O'Meara isn't quite sure what to expect from Sahalee, a
29-year-old course carved from a forest of Douglas fir trees
outside Seattle.
	   Sahalee measures 6,906 yards (5,486 meters) and plays as a par
70 _ two par 5s have been converted to par 4s, including the
475-yard (428-meter) closing hole. The rough will be thick and
punishing, as usual, but the real trouble lies among the 30-meter
(100-foot) trees that line just about every fairway.
	   Paul Runyan, a two-time U.S. PGA champion and the first head pro
at Sahalee, once described each hole as ``playing down a cathedral
aisle.''
	   Don't be surprised if the player holding the Wanamaker Trophy on
Sunday has never won a major championship before _ nine of the past
10 champions won their first major at the American PGA.
	   That could bode well for players like David Duval, a five-time
winner on U.S. tour since October who has played well in all the
majors this year; or for Jim Furyk, whose straight driving and
smooth putting are a perfect combination for Sahalee.
	   And a year after 20-something stars like Woods, Ernie Els and
Justin Leonard won three of the four majors, they haven't made a
peep this year.
	   Experience has fought back in 1998, led by O'Meara and U.S. Open
champion Lee Janzen, a nine-year veteran. Zimbabwean Nick Price,
41, won two weeks ago in Memphis and will try to join Gene Sarazen
and Sam Snead as three-time winners of the U.S. PGA.
	   The mystery has been Tom Watson, who lacks only the U.S. PGA
Championship to become the fifth player to win the career grand
slam. At 48, Watson is hitting the ball well and has overcome the
putting problems that haunted him for a decade.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The twin bombings at U.S. embassies in east Africa
that killed at least 140 people and injured more than 2,200 brought
expressions of horror from world leaders Saturday.
	   United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the deaths
``tragic and senseless'' and said ``they should be condemned in no
uncertain terms.''
	   Vatican Radio said Pope John Paul II offered prayers for the
dead and hoped that the attacks would encourage the international
community ``to cooperate and double efforts aimed at building a
world of peace and justice.''
	   Australia and Russia said they wanted to help fight terrorism.
Israel and France said they were sending rescue workers to Nairobi
help British soldiers already there.
	   ``We are committed to working with our allies and friends to
combat the threat posed by terrorism and will cooperate in any way
that might be useful in efforts to uncover the perpetrators of
these bombings,'' Australian Prime Minister John Howard said in a
statement from his Canberra office.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, holidaying in Italy, said
that the world's democratic forces should condemn the bombings.
	   In a message to U.S. President Bill Clinton, Russian President
Boris Yeltsin called the attacks a brazen challenge to the entire
world community and pledged to act with other countries to do
whatever was necessary to combat terrorism, the Interfax news
agency said.
	   The explosions occurred within minutes of each other at the
embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. It was
not clear who was responsible for the attacks.
	   In the Middle East, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak called the
attacks ``vicious criminal acts,'' while Saudi Arabia's government
said in a statement that it ``strongly condemns any kind of
terroristic activity in any form and anywhere in the world.''
	   Lebanese President Elias Hrawi Saturday sent cables of
condolences to the presidents of the United States, Kenya and
Tanzania.
	   Even governments on U.S. State Department's list of
terrorist-sponsoring nations spoke out.
	   ``We condemn the bombings, and sympathize with the victims and
their families,'' said Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi.
	   The government of Cuban President Fidel Castro on Friday
condemned the bombings and expressed ``its most deeply felt
sorrow.''
	   Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said his country
``condemns acts of violence. Such acts as these do not accomplish
anything, but victimize innocents,'' he said.
	   Around the world, U.S. diplomatic compounds beefed up security.
	   In Paris, a heavy police presence prevented people from
approaching the U.S. embassy, which was cordoned off with metal
barriers. Thailand's prime minister ordered his country's police to
provide special security to the U.S. Embassy in the Thai capital of
Bangkok.
	   In Malaysia, U.S. embassy spokesman Chip Barclay said the
compound was ``definitely on heightened security. We're keeping our
guard up and taking appropriate measures. When I came in today, it
was apparent that effective measures have been taken.''
	   Israel on Saturday despatched 180 specially trained rescue
workers to Nairobi, scene of the more serious blast. They were met
by British troops who have been helping to dig bodies out of the
rubble. France also said it was sending a team of workers later.
	   The Kenyan government declared five days of mourning on
Saturday.

Taliban forces claim capture of Mazar-e-Sharif

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Taliban soldiers bombed the last major
Afghan city outside their control Saturday and claimed they had
captured it, although reports of street fighting made their hold
appear shaky.
	   Residents in Mazar-e-Sharif, 190 miles (300 kms) northwest of
Kabul, cowered in basements, listening to a barrage of explosions.
The Islamic Republic News Agency in neighboring Iran said bombings
were continuous and reported ``sporadic acts of resistance in the
streets.''
	   Mazar-e-Sharif would be a big prize in the Taliban's 4-year-old
campaign to impose their strict interpretation of Islamic rule,
including a ban on music and tight restrictions for women, on all
of Afghanistan. The city's fall would be a severe blow to an
opposition already pushed to a dwindling corner of northern
Afghanistan.
	   Taliban spokesman Abdul Manam Niyazi, speaking by satellite
phone from Mazar-e-Sharif, claimed his forces were in complete
control of the city.
	   A spokesman for the key opposition militia in Mazar-e-Sharif
confirmed Taliban fighters were in the city, but denied they had
control. The Hezb-e-Wahadat spokesman, who insisted on anonymity,
described fierce street fighting. Another anti-Taliban spokesman
claimed later that the Taliban killed many civilians, but had been
pushed to a western part of the city.
	   Fighters were battling late Saturday for control of the airport
on the eastern edge of town, Taliban spokesman Abdul Rahof said
from the group's military headquarters in the southern city of
Kandahar. He had no details on casualties.
	   The Taliban appeared determined not to repeat the mistake they
made in May, when they entered Mazar-e-Sharif at the invitation of
a warlord who had turned on his anti-Taliban allies. The warlord
turned again _ allegiance-switching has been a hallmark of
Afghanistan's years of civil war _ and the Taliban took heavy
casualties while being driven out.
	   ``Last year, we were invited in. But this time, we burned the
mountains,'' Niyazi said, using an expression for heavy fighting.
	   Elsewhere, the Taliban have bribed military commanders to
surrender or counted on being welcomed by local residents eager to
embrace anyone promising peace or to accept the Taliban as their
ethnic brothers.
	   But Mazar-e-Sharif is inhabited mostly by ethnic Uzbeks and
Tajiks, while the Taliban, like most other Afghans, are Pashtuns.
The Hezb-e-Wahadat militia that calls the city its stronghold is
made up of Shiite Muslims; the Taliban adheres to the Sunni sect of
Islam.
	   Residents of the city resented last year's Taliban edicts
banning music and barring women from work.
	   In Iran, which has backed the anti-Taliban coalition, state-run
television reported that Taliban forces seized 11 Iranian diplomats
in their Mazar-e-Sharif consulate. The Taliban closed the Iranian
Embassy in Kabul last year.
	   In Iran, which has backed the anti-Taliban coalition, Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi called on the Taliban to protect the staff
at the consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Niyazi, the Taliban spokesman, said his troops occupied the
Iranian consulate in order to protect Iranian diplomats, but found
none there. He said the whereabouts of the envoys were unknown.
	   The Taliban, which means ``students of Islam,'' emerged in 1994,
pledging to bring peace to Afghanistan after years of civil war.
	   In 1979, the Soviet army invaded and occupied Afghanistan for 10
years until it was driven out by U.S.-backed Afghan guerrillas, and
internecine battles resumed. More than 1.5 million Afghans have
died in the power struggles since the 1980s.
	   The Taliban have imposed a strict version of Islamic law in
territory they control. Since capturing Kabul in 1996, Taliban
officials have barred girls from school, confined most women to
their homes, forbade all music except religious songs and banned
anything published outside Afghanistan.

Kabila at peace summit while Kinshasa readies for war

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Kinshasa was on a war footing Saturday,
broadcasting accusations against neighboring Rwanda, enlisting
fresh army recruits and detaining ethnic Tutsis on suspicion of
treason.
	   At a crisis summit in Zimbabwe, Congo's President Laurent Kabila
sat down with his Rwandan adversary President Pasteur Bizimungu,
where, according to the Rwandan leader, the two agreed to hold off
on hostilities.
	   Although few details from the talks were immediately available,
Bizimungu told reporters in the Zambian capital of Lusaka that the
two sides had agreed not attack one another.
	   ``A cease-fire has been established to find a solution and a
committee has been set up,'' Bizimungu said during a stopover in
Lusaka while en route to Rwanda.
	   He did not elaborate on the agreement, which appeared to be
aimed at forestalling direct hostilities between Rwanda and Congo
and not at the ongoing rebellion inside Congolese territory.
	   Although Kabila has accused Rwanda of masterminding the Tutsi
uprising, there have been no reports of direct fighting across the
borders of the two countries.
	   Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe said earlier Saturday that
the leaders of Tanzania, Zambia, Namibia and Zimbabwe had formed a
committee to press for a cease-fire, and warned Rwanda to withdraw
its troops from Congo if they were there.
	   Kabila played down expectations for a resolution, saying he had
come to the summit ``to explain a situation.''
	   The rebellion in eastern Congo's Kivu region and near the
country's Atlantic coastline in the west has been led by Congolese
Tutsis, known as Banyamulenge, with the support of Rwandan troops
already in Congo. The Rwandan troops until recently had been in
Congo in support of Kabila.
	   Several key cities, including Goma and Bukavu, are already in
rebel hands.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan told reporters in Lisbon,
Portugal, on Saturday that he was worried about the situation in
Congo.
	   Despite Bizimungu's report of a cease-fire agreement, Kinshasa
was preparing for war Saturday. No mention of any agreement was
made on state-run Voice of the People Radio.
	   ``They want to create a Tutsi empire,'' Kabila said in the
broadcast. ``But are we Congolese prepared to accept the challenge
of a toad which wants to swallow an elephant?''
	   Hundreds of unemployed men and women turned out at a Kinshasa
military base on Saturday to enlist in the army, vowing to crush
the rebellion and take the war to Rwanda.
	   ``We're determined to protect our country,'' said one young
woman who refused to give her name. ``If they give us arms today we
are ready to go all the way to Rwanda.''
	   Bizimungu on Saturday reiterated his earlier warning that his
country would retaliate if Congo strikes.
	   The rebel Tutsi fighters also appeared to ignore diplomatic
efforts to end the conflict and vowed to push toward the capital of
Kinshasa.
	   The rebels announced a new set of targets in western Congo,
pledging to push inland from their Atlantic coastline stronghold of
Muanda to Boma, within 250 kilometers (150 miles) southwest of the
capital.
	   ``We want to remove President Kabila from power for the interest
of the people because he failed to rule them,'' rebel-run Radio
Bukavu said.
	   With sabers rattling, several European countries and the United
States have ordered their non-essential embassy employees out of
Congo.
	   Ethnic Tutsis in Kinshasa are facing reprisal attacks for the
rebellion.
	   Hundreds, perhaps thousands of foreign and Congolese Tutsis have
been rounded up by the police while troops looted their shops, the
United Nations human rights agency said.
	   A foreign resident in Congo who had been arrested and later
released said dozens of Tutsis, Ethiopians and Lebanese were being
held at one police station on suspicion of treason.
	   In Washington, the U.S. State Department expressed similar
concerns.
	   Spokesman James Foley said the reports from Congo suggest that
Tutsis and possibly civilians of other ethnicities in Kinshasa
``are being rounded up, detained, beaten, tortured and killed
because of their ethnicity.''

	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) - Ato Boldon turned the tables on
Olympic champion Donovan Bailey in the men's 100 while Marion Jones
posted another fast time in the women's 100 Saturday at the
Herculis international meeting, part of the IAAF Golden League
series.
	   Boldon timed 9.92 seconds in beating Bailey, second in 9.96.
Third was Frankie Fredericks, 10.02, losing out on his Golden
League streak.
	   Only Maurice Greene of the United States was missing from the
top field. World-record holder Bailey had won in Paris on July 29,
beating Greene and Boldon in 10.02 on a cool and wet night.
	   Boldon had the two times of the year, running 9.86 twice earlier
in the season. Bailey's world record in 9.84.
	   A dlrs 1 million bonus will be shared among the athletes who
remain unbeaten through the six Golden League meets and the Grand
Prix final in Moscow Sept. 5 in certain events.
	   On a warm but not hot evening on the French Riviera, there were
a number of season bests set with some approaching world records.
	   Jones stayed unbeaten in the women's 100 with a convincing win
in 10.72, just .01 off her season's best. Christine Arron of
France, who had a 10.85 earlier this week, was a well-beaten
seventich, Switzerland, next Wednesday.
	   ``The track is so fast there I think I can beat my personal
best,'' Jones said.
	   Only world-record holder Florence Griffith-Joyner has gone under
10.70 with a best of 10.49.
	   In the women's 400 American Kim Batten ran 52.74, just .13 from
her own world record and equal to the third best of all time.
	   ``I ran a great race,'' Batten said. ``All the right things
happened at the right time.''
	   Glory Alozie of Nigera ran 12.44 in the women's 100 hurdles,
another 1998 best.
	   Michael Johnson ran a 43.96 in the 400, the second time he has
been under 44.00 this season. It was his first race in more than
two weeks since winning at the Goodwill Games but he was just third
at the first Golden League meet in Oslo.
	   Hichis year.
	   ``I was a bit worried because I was ill,'' El Guerrouj said. ``I
had stomach pains.''
	   El Guerrouj set the world record in the 1,500 at the last Golden
League meet, in Rome when he ran 3:26.00. Two days later he missed
the world record in the mile by .21 seconds in Nice and was less
than a half second from the world 2,000 mark three days later.
	   Bryan Bronson of the United States won the men's 400 hurdles in
47.93 to keep alive his Golden League sweep.
	   Russia's Yelena Asfansyeva handed Mozambique's Maria Mutola her
first loss of the year in the women's 800. Asfansyeva did a season
best of 1:56.63 edging Mutola by .02.
	   ``I lost in the last 100 meters,'' Mutola said. ``I got
bumped.''
	   Gabriela Szabo of Hungary stopped Svetlana Masterkova's
GoldLeague series continues in Zurich with the Weltklasse meet on
August 12.

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ The blast at the U.S. Embassy in
Tanzania blew tour guide Jim Owens from a chair and threw him five
feet against an office wall inside the building.
	   As he and other survivors stumbled out of the embassy, he said,
``everybody we encountered was covered in blood. The air was thick
with smoke and dust and soot.''
	   ``There were people lying on the ground, bleeding,'' said Owens,
50, of Falls Church, Va. He suffered a concussion and cuts along
his face and neck from the blast.
	   The explosion Friday left a crater nearly 6 feet in diameter,
blew up the main gate, ripped off the back portion of the embassy
wall and destroyed the main embassy guard house.
	   ``I only had to look at the guard house to know there were
casualties,'' said Owens, who conducts tours in the footsteps of
early European explorers of Africa.
	   Six people perished immediately and two died in hospital.
Another 65 people were injured.

Witnesses describe carnage at bombings of U.S. embassies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Kenya-Embassy Bombings &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN DAVIES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy's weekly staff meeting
was wrapping up in a top-floor office of the heavily fortified,
five-story concrete building. Bill Barr was anxious for it to end,
and he looked at his watch: 10:40 a.m.
	   That's when they heard the first noise. A loud thump.
	   Barr remembers someone saying, ``That was an explosion.''
	   Then the big bomb went off. ``And all hell broke loose,'' said
Barr, the embassy spokesman.
	   ``We crawled out down the stairs in darkness. There was a lot of
dust. We couldn't see. Some people were injured on the way out.''
	   ___
	   Inside the embassy there was fear and chaos. Outside the scene
was much worse.
	   The terrorist blast that tore open the embassy Friday _ nearly
simultaneously with a bombing at the U.S. Embassy in neighboring
Tanzania _ had toppled the adjacent four-story Ufundi Co-op House
and shattered all the windows in the 22-story Cooperative Bank
House.
	   Thousands of people with bloody wounds fled the blast in terror.
Plumes of black smoke billowed from the ruins and from gutted cars.
At least 53 buildings were damaged and windows were shattered 10
blocks away. Flames shot through a passenger bus.
	   Severed body parts littered Moi Avenue. Seriously hurt people
moaned on the sidewalk. A pregnant woman clutched her slashed
belly.
	   Doors blown off their hinges and plate glass windows were used
as makeshift stretchers.
	   Passersby ferried the wounded to hospitals in their cars and
pickup trucks.
	   ___
	   The confusion now is reflected in the many different accounts of
how the attack supposedly took place.
	   A preacher who was waiting for a bus outside the embassy said he
heard what sounded like shots and ran into a parking lot behind the
embassy to see four men jump from a yellow van, one of them firing
a weapon.
	   ``I thought it was a normal bank robbery,'' Julius Koiyet told
The Associated Press. ``The man saw that I was not afraid, and he
fired at me.''
	   As the preacher fell with a shoulder wound, he saw the other
three men throw three foot-long (30-centimeter-long) canisters that
fell against the Ufundi Co-op House. Then the blast came.
	   ___
	   Embassy administrative attache Mary Robinson said she heard what
sounded like gunfire before the immense blast.
	   ``I was on the fourth floor. My colleague says, `Oh, I think I
hear some shooting out there,''' she said.
	   ``We went out into the corridor. Then we heard this boom, and
that's all I remember until I woke up in the hospital.'' She spoke
at a South African military hospital, where she was flown for
treatment of a broken hand.
	   ___
	   Ambassador Prudence Bushnell wasn't in the embassy, but she was
close enough to get hurt. Bushnell, Trade Minister Joseph Kamotho
and others had just ended a news conference on the 18th floor of
the Cooperative Bank House when they heard the first thump.
	   ``I asked was there any construction going on because that's
what it sounded _ the sort of boom that you hear in construction
work,'' Bushnell said. ``The next thing I knew I was sitting and
had my hands over my head, which was why I had cuts on my hands.''
	   Flying debris clinked, clanked as it fell. Then, silence.
	   ``My first thought was, is the building going to collapse? And
ay-ay-ay, we're on the 18th floor.''
	   She and the others flew down the stairwell.
	   ``Everybody was bleeding ... and the bannister was wet with
blood.''
	   ___
	   At the embassy in the Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam, it was
the same nightmare.
	   ``Everyone was just drenched in blood. I didn't see anyone who
wasn't injured,'' said Jim Owens, a tour guide at an embassy
meeting when it blew up within minutes of the blast in Nairobi.
	   Through the dust and smoke, he could see John Lange, the acting
ambassador, struggling to lift a heavy file cabinet. There was a
woman trapped under it.
	   Lange's office, Owens said, ``is in the very inner sanctum of
the embassy and he had a cut on his head and was also bleeding. So
the bomb was strong enough to penetrate the far reaches of the
embassy.''
	   ___
	   Outside, a small oil tank truck lay upside down, half buried by
the embassy's collapsed first floor. Authorities say they suspect
the bomb may have been planted on or in it.
	   Right next to it, the guard house at the embassy's entrance was
a twisted wreck. Every guard inside, all potential witnesses to the
truck's arrival, was dead.
	   ___
	   Mohammed Muganda, the embassy's motor pool dispatcher, recalls
it was ``around 10:30, a quarter to eleven'' when the bomb went
off.
	   ``The ceiling fell down and hit me,'' he said.
	   Bleeding badly, he scrambled to find a way out. In one
direction, he found fire. He went another way and found freedom. He
jumped over a wall.
	   ``That's when I fell down, and people came to pick me up. I
think I fainted. Then I woke up in a hospital.''

	   People, hundreds of them, were also rushing to the wreckage of
the Nairobi embassy, climbing over mountains of rubble, using pick
axes and bare hands in their bids to reach trapped survivors.
	   A secretarial school was in session on the second floor of the
Ufundi Co-op House when it toppled, and at 11 a.m. a note was
passed out through the ruins from about a dozen trapped students
inside, according to Ruth Amwai, one of the rescuers.
	   ``We are alive,'' it read.
	   The students have not been heard from since.
	   Officials brought in backhoes and a crane. But overnight, with
harsh search lights trained on the ruins, those who were trapped
were dying.
	   ``Help me, help me. I have gone now,'' a Kenyan man buried in
rubble gasped just before he died.
	   ___
	   Friends and relatives searched hospitals for familiar faces
beneath bandages.
	   ``I am looking for my sister. I have looked for her in all the
hospitals before, finally, I decided to come here,'' Daniel Maina
said outside the City Council Mortuary.
	   Her name was on the list of dead, ``but I want to be sure she is
the one,'' Maina said.
	   Finally, he summoned the courage to join the silent line of
Kenyans with hands held tightly to their noses against the smell of
rotting and singed flesh.
	   They filed past more than 80 charred bodies, some on white
tables, others on the blood-covered floor. A woman in blue jeans
had no head, others had no hands.
	   Maina found his sister, and recorded the numbered aluminum tag
on her left ankle so he could claim her body for burial.
	   ``This is horrible. People, many people have lost their lives
for nothing,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu
threatened a preemptive strike against Congo on Saturday, accusing
his Congolese counterpart of training Hutu rebels against his
country.
	   ``We will not wait for Congo to attack first,'' Bizimungu said
after a day of unsuccessful talks with Congolese President Laurent
Kabila.
	   ``He is building a case for our confrontation with Congo,''
Bizimungu told The Associated Press on his return to Kigali from
Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, where the talks were held.
	   Bizimungu said Rwanda had credible evidence of Kabila's training
of at least 10,000 former Hutu soldiers and militiamen in the
southern city of Kamina, and that he planned to use them against
Rwanda.
	   The rebels were responsible for the 1994 genocide of more than
500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus. The killing
ended when Tutsi-led rebels won power in Rwanda in July 1994,
sending the former Hutu government across the border into Congo.
	   Bizimungu again rejected Kabila's charges that two battalions,
or 2,000 regular Rwandan troops, were fighting alongside Congolese
Tutsis and advancing from the east of the country.
	   ``What is happening in Congo is not our responsibility,''
Bizimungu said. ``Kabila accused us of a building a Tutsi empire
... but what is happening is that he is paying the price for
mismanaging the country.''
	   He said Kabila directed the same accusations against Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni, a close ally of Rwanda who also helped
install Kabila in power.
	   Bizimungu returned from Zimbabwe's Victoria Falls and talks
which yielded no progress toward ending the suspicion and hostility
that threatens war between the two Central African neighbors.
	   At a news conference after the six-hour session, the host of the
summit, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, merely reiterated the
Rwandan and Congolese positions.
	   Mugabe said, however, the leaders of Tanzania, Zambia, Namibia
and Zimbabwe had formed a committee to press for a cease-fire, and
warned Rwanda to withdraw its troops from Congo if they were there.
	   Kabila played down expectations for a resolution, saying he
hadn't come to the summit in search of support ``but to explain a
situation.''
	   ``We have an ambitious program of democratization. We expect to
go into elections next year,'' said Kabila, who has been under
pressure from human rights groups since his rebel forces ousted
longtime leader Mobutu Sese Seko last year.
	   The United States has expressed concern about reports of
persecution of Tutsis and other ethnic groups in the Congolese
capital, Kinshasa.
	   Bizimungu, too, said Rwanda found it difficult to watch
impassively the same level of persecution against Congolese Tutsis
that eventually led his country to intervene and topple Mobutu two
years ago.
	   ``He's doing the same thing,'' he said of Kabila. ``That's
incredible.''
	   The resurgence of conflict in the vast Congo and the prospect of
civil war looming in its equally vast and mineral-rich neighbor to
the south, Angola, has alarmed regional leaders.
	   Bizimungu said, however, he did not expect Angola to get
involved.

Boldon, Jones win 100s in Monte Carlo meet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Boldon quote, CORRECTS El Guerrouj time to
3:28.37

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) - Ato Boldon turned the tables on
Olympic champion Donovan Bailey in the men's 100 while Marion Jones
posted another fast time in the women's 100 Saturday at the
Herculis international meeting, part of the IAAF Golden League
series.
	   Boldon timed 9.92 seconds in beating Bailey, second in 9.96.
Third was Frankie Fredericks, 10.02, losing out on his Golden
League streak.
	   Only Maurice Greene of the United States was missing from the
top field. World-record holder Bailey had won in Paris on July 29,
beating Greene and Boldon in 10.02 on a cool and wet night.
	   Boldon had the two times of the year, running 9.86 twice earlier
in the season. Bailey's world record in 9.84.
	   ``I've been second a few times this year but every now and then
I run tyhe race I wan to win,'' Boldon said.
	   A dlrs 1 million bonus will be shared among the athletes who
remain unbeaten through the six Golden League meets and the Grand
Prix final in Moscow Sept. 5 in certain events.
	   On a warm but not hot evening on the French Riviera, there were
a number of season bests set with some approaching world records.
	   Jones stayed unbeaten in the women's 100 with a convincing win
in 10.72, just .01 off her season's best. Christine Arron of
France, who had a 10.85 earlier this week, was a well-beaten
seventh in 11.19.
	   `I was motivated because I knew there were some competitiors who
were fast,'' Jones said. ``But I think I can go faster than 10.70
in the coming weeks. ''
	   She looks forward to running in the next Golden League meet in
Zurich, Switzerland, next Wednesday.
	   ``The track is so fast there I think I can beat my personal
best,'' Jones said.
	   Only world-record holder Florence Griffith-Joyner has gone under
10.70 with a best of 10.49.
	   In the women's 400 American Kim Batten ran 52.74, just .13 from
her own world record and equal to the third best of all time.
	   ``I ran a great race,'' Batten said. ``All the right things
happened at the right time.''
	   Glory Alozie of Nigera ran 12.44 in the women's 100 hurdles,
another 1998 best.
	   Michael Johnson ran a 43.96 in the 400, the second time he has
been under 44.00 this season. It was his first race in more than
two weeks since winning at the Goodwill Games but he was just third
at the first Golden League meet in Oslo.
	   Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco ran 3 minutes, 28.37 seconds in
the 1,500. It was a good time for many but only average for El
Guerrouj this year.
	   ``I was a bit worried because I was ill,'' El Guerrouj said. ``I
had stomach pains.''
	   El Guerrouj set the world record in the 1,500 at the last Golden
League meet, in Rome when he ran 3:26.00. Two days later he missed
the world record in the mile by .21 seconds in Nice and was less
than a half second from the world 2,000 mark three days later.
	   Bryan Bronson of the United States won the men's 400 hurdles in
47.93 to keep alive his Golden League sweep.
	   Haile Gebrselassie captured the 3,000 in an unchallenged 7:
	   Russia's Yelena Asfansyeva handed Mozambique's Maria Mutola her
first loss of the year in the women's 800. Asfansyeva did a season
best of 1:56.63 edging Mutola by .02.
	   ``I lost in the last 100 meters,'' Mutola said. ``I got
bumped.''
	   Gabriela Szabo of Hungary stopped Svetlana Masterkova's Golden
League streak in a fast 1,500, winning in 3:56.97. Eight women were
under 4 minutes.
	   The Golden League series continues in Zurich with the Weltklasse
meet on August 12.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Investigators began a painstaking search
for clues to the terrorist bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania Saturday as Israeli rescue experts and sniffer dogs
took over the hunt for survivors in Nairobi and rescued one man.
	   Thirty six hours after tons of concrete and steal crashed to the
ground, an Israeli team drilled through a wall at the Nairobi
embassy and pulled out a man from an adjacent building which had
collapsed. He was weak, had a deep cut to his forehead which
exposed his skull, and was suffering from a broken leg, said Red
Cross spokesman Tom Maina.
	   Even though the Israelis didn't hear any more voices, the rescue
spurred on the search teams who continued drilling through the
night. Rescuers had spoken to a trapped woman earlier in the day.
	   Investigators also continued picking through rubble, placing
some pieces in plastic containers.
	   One bomb was believed to have exploded in a vehicle in the
parking lot behind the embassy in Nairobi, which was monitored by
closed-circuit television cameras. They could provide importance
evidence, but U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell said she didn't
know whether the cameras or film survived the blast.
	   The FBI, which was sending 60 investigators to Nairobi and a
separate team to Dar es Salaam, has said its top priority is to
determine the kind of vehicle and the type of explosive device used
in the attacks, which spokesman Frank Scafidi said ``can be like a
fingerprint of who did it.''
	   Bushnell, who was injured in the attack, told a news conference
she saw at least one burning vehicle behind the embassy when,
bloody and somewhat dazed, she was led from a neighboring building.
	   ``I have no idea what kind of a vehicle it is, and that's one of
the many, many, many questions that I hope is going to be answered
in the next few days with the people who are coming in,'' she said.
	   Just a few minutes apart, the suspected car bombings 700
kilometers (450 miles) from each other Friday turned busy streets
in two African capitals into bloody piles of concrete and knots of
steel.
	   The bombings caused outrage and grief in the United States and
were national tragedies of immense proportions in Kenya and
Tanzania.
	   In Kenya, the death toll rose to at least 140, including 11
Americans, the U.S. Embassy said. Four Americans were still
missing.
	   Bushnell said 14 Kenyan employees at the embassy died and 109
were unaccounted for. She said embassy staffers were trying to find
out whether they were alive or still buried under the rubble.
	   Eight people died in the Tanzanian bombing, but no Americans
were killed there, hospital officials said.
	   With 4,257 people injured in Nairobi and a total of 154 people
still missing, medical facilities in Nairobi were overwhelmed and
some victims were taken to hospitals 30 miles (48 kms) away.
	   Some 200 people were still in need of urgent treatment at
Kenyatta Hospital and there were shortages of syringes, needles and
blood for transfusions, the Red Cross said.
	   President Daniel arap Moi met diplomats Saturday and appealed
for medicine such as intravenous fluids, painkillers and
antibiotics.
	   Anxious relatives and friends went from hospital to hospital,
and finally to the morgues looking for missing loved ones.
	   ``I am looking for my sister. I have looked for her in all the
hospitals before finally I decided to come here,'' Daniel Maina
said outside the mortuary.
	   He followed a trail of bloody footprints inside, holding a hand
to his nose against the stench of rotten and singed flesh. Most of
the 80 bodies were charred. The head of a woman wearing blue jeans
was blown off.
	   Among the dead, Maina found his sister.
	   Exhausted Kenya army, police and civilian rescue teams who
recovered eight bodies on Saturday welcomed the arrival of 118
Israelis who brought eight sniffer dogs and specialized equipment
to search for victims.
	   Some Kenyans complained that the Americans sealed off the
embassy and refused to allow them to help in the rescue operation,
and were confrontational.
	   ``They were just interested in protecting their damaged
embassy,'' volunteer rescue worker Fawz Abubakar was quoted as
saying in the East African Standard. ``It has given us a very bad
picture of the Americans. ... When we tried to rescue a body from
inside the U.S. Embassy they chased us awa and threatened to
shoot.''
	   Ambassador Bushnell, asked about reports of mishandling
relations with the Kenyans, accepted that there could be
misunderstandings but stressed that it was crucial to keep the area
as intact as possible for investigators.
	   ``It is in everybody's interest to find out who is behind the
evil,'' she said, speaking with a bandaged bottom lip which needed
stitches and gesturing with bandaged hands.
	   It was not immediately known who was responsible.
	   The only claim so far has been by a previously unknown group
calling itself the ``Army for the Liberation of Islamic Shrines.''
It phoned the Cairo, Egypt office of Al-Hayat, a daily Arabic
language newspaper published in London, and sent a fax to Radio
France International in Paris.
	   The group vowed in the fax to strike against U.S. forces and
interests until all American and Western forces withdraw ``from
Islamic countries in general, especially the Arabian peninsula.''
	   Unknown groups frequently claim responsibility after terrorist
attacks.
	   A group known as the Islamic Jihad vowed last week to strike
American interests because some of its members were arrested in
Albania, according to a report in Thursday's Al-Hayat.
	   Several groups use the name Islamic Jihad. This one is
considered the successor to groups that assassinated Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
	   One suspected terrorist being examined in the wake of the
explosions is exiled Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, U.S.
officials said. Bin Laden has threatened a holy war against U.S.
troops and Americans.
	   He also is suspected of backing other terrorist acts including
the 1996 attack in Saudi Arabia.
	   A man was seen being taken into custody at the Nairobi bombing
scene. Witnesses said he spoke Arabic, but police would not
comment. His connection, if any, to the bombings was not known.
	   Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana told a news conference
that a car bomb apparently went off in front of the entrance to the
basement parking lot of the American Embassy.
	   ``It is probable that in fact the person tried to get in and
could not get into the basement,'' he said.
	   ``Whether it was suicidal and the person involved was in it (the
car) or not, is difficult to say,'' Godana said.
	   The U.S. Embassy is located at a busy intersection in downtown
Nairobi and its section of a parking lot, shared with several
banks, has a swinging-arm gate manned by unarmed private Kenyan
guards.
	   Once inside this barrier, Bushnell said, other private guards
inspect the trunk, hood and undercarriage of vehicles before they
are allowed to enter the basement parking lot.
	   She said she had worked with diplomatic security experts to beef
up security at the embassy and after an assessment two months ago,
new grills were ordered for the front of the building. They had not
yet arrived.
	   ``Did we do everything that we possibly could to make that
building safe? You bet we did. Can I look into the eyes of the
people I am going to be meeting with who lost their loved ones and
leave with a conscience clear, you bet I am,'' Bushnell said.

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Within seconds of the blast,
Valentine Matthew Katunda went from being a security watchman at
the American Embassy to being buried alive underneath wreckage.
	   ``I was underground and I was recovered,'' said Katunda, 42,
shaking his head in confusion.
	   Katunda, his cheek and neck were wrapped in large, bloodied
bandages, limped along the corridors of Muhambili Hospital on
Saturday, trying to make sense of a bomb blast that tore through
the U.S. Embassy on Friday morning.
	   ``It happened so abruptly. I still can't understand it.''
	   Many of his colleagues were not so lucky, sitting just a few
meters (yards) away from Katunda inside the guard house for the
main embassy entrance. The bomb exploded just outside, ripping the
guard house to pieces, and apparently killing all of the guards
inside.
	   The explosion left a crater nearly 2 meters (6 feet) in
diameter, blew up the main gate, and ripped off the back portion of
the embassy wall.
	   Six people were killed immediately and two died in the hospital.
Another 65 people were injured.

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ A heatwave has killed 15 people in the
past 24 hours on this eastern Mediterranean island where
temperatures have reached 43 Celsius (110 Fahrenheit), the
authorities said Saturday night.
	   Cypriot Health Minister Andreas Solomis said most of the victims
were elderly, the national television reported.

heat exhaustion, he said.

Jamaica, Cable &AMP; Wireless at odds over telecommunications policy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LLOYD WILLIAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ The government and international
telecommunications giant Cable &AMP; Wireless appear to be at odds over
a new policy announced Friday by Prime Minister P.J. Patterson.
	   While Cable &AMP; Wireless Jamaica Ltd. has a 25-year contract as
the monopoly provider of telecommuncations in Jamaica, Patterson
announced plans to allow other firms to compete in some segments of
the market, such as wireless telephone service.
	   Patterson said the old telecommunications policy was out of
date. Parliament would begin working on a new policy in September,
he said.
	   ``The objective,'' Patterson said, ``is to enable Jamaica to
move apace in economic, social and technological development.''
	   But Cable &AMP; Wireless issued a statement saying it was
``surprised and disappointed'' by Patterson's announcement.
	   ``This unsettling development raises questions about Cable &AMP;
Wireless' existing investments and places a great deal of
uncertainty about the company's future investment program in
Jamaica,'' said the statement.
	   In 1988, Cable &AMP; Wireless signed a 25-year contract with the
government, then led by the Jamaica Labor Party. Patterson leads
the rival People's National Party.
	   Patterson said the new telecommunications policy will allow
competition in some areas of service without infringing on Cable &AMP;
Wireless' 1988 contract.
	   Bitter disputes have arisen in the industry in Jamaica with
would-be competitors arguing with Cable &AMP; Wireless over access to
the telephone network. In one case, one company's equipment was
seized by police at the request of Cable &AMP; Wireless.

Russia rallies to beat US, will face Yugoslavia in final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Bodiroga quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ It was too much to ask.
	   The crew of castoffs defending the U.S. title at the World
Basketball Championship could not produce one more escape and lost
to Russia 66-64 Saturday in the semifinals.
	   Russia will play for the gold medal Sunday against Yugoslavia,
which needed overtime to get past Greece 78-73.
	   Dejan Bodiroga had 31 points and Zeljko Rebraca added 20 points
and 13 rebounds for the European champions, who overcame a 12-point
deficit in the second half. Yugoslavia is aiming for a record
fourth title.
	   ``We never thought we would lose the game, even when were losing
by 12,'' said Bodiroga, who plays for Spanish club Real Madrid.
``Games like that you win with heart and pride and we had plenty of
both.''
	   Russia also staged a late rally, coming back from 10 points down
and winning when Sergey Panov drove the length of the court to
score the winning layup with 4 seconds left.
	   Wendell Alexis banked in a desperation 30-foot shot which would
have won the game for the ragtag Americans, but he released the
ball just after the final buzzer.
	   The United States, which went scoreless for the final 3:08, will
play Greece for third place Sunday. A loss would mean the first
worlds without a medal for the Americans in 20 years.
	   ``It was the chance of a lifetime for us,'' U.S. center David
Wood said. ``The guys are devastated. It wasn't because of a lack
of effort. (Russia) played like a veteran team.''
	   So did Yugoslavia, which won the silver medal at the 1996
Olympics, after Greece _ backed by a capacity crowd of 18,000 at
Olympic arena _ opened up its biggest lead of the game at 48-36
with 11:00 remaining.
	   But Yugoslavia clawed back thanks to some poor foul shooting by
Greece, which finished 11-for-22 from the line.
	   A layup by Aleksandar Djordjevic _ his first points of the game
_ put Yugoslavia ahead 57-56 with 1:40 left in regulation. Greece's
Nikos Economou (team-high 25 points) hit one of two free throws 23
seconds later to tie the game and send it to overtime as each team
missed shots that would have won it.
	   Yugoslavia opened the extra period with a 9-2 run, capped by a
Bodiroga jumper, and held on for its 16th straight victory over the
Greeks, dating to 1987.
	   ``Greece played better than us for nearly 40 minutes, but we
fought back well,'' Bodiroga said. ``Maybe Greece needs to wait
another 11 years to beat Yugoslavia.''
	   Russia's Sergey Babkov had a game-high 30 points in just 24
minutes, including back-to-back 3-pointers that tied the game,
64-64, with 1:23 remaining. Vassily Karassev added 10 points.
	   Fittingly, no one stood out for the makeshift U.S. team. Center
Gerard King, who plays in Italy, led the way with 10 points, but
had none after halftime.
	   ``In a competitive tournament like this it is difficult to be
competitive night after night,'' Russian coach Sergey Belov said.
``We were able to come back tonight even though we weren't at 100
percent.''
	   The loss to Russia means the United States will have to go
through qualifying for a spot in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Only the
world champion and host Australia earn automatic berths.
	   Saturday's game was a rematch of the gold medal game at the 1994
world championship, in which Dream Team II, stocked with such stars
as Shaquille O'Neal, Reggie Miller and Shawn Kemp, routed Russia
137-91.
	   While the core of that Russian team is in Athens, this U.S.
squad is vastly different, of course.
	   With the NBA lockout looming, the stars threatened to boycott
the worlds. USA Basketball responded by dumping the NBAers in favor
of a mix of players mostly from the minor-league CBA and European
leagues.
	   ``I feel we had the game under control,'' said Wood, who is with
a club in the Italian League, ``but we played like a real young
team. They took the game from us. We made the mistakes of an
inexperienced team.''
	   The United States had moved into the semis thanks to a
three-point win over Italy in the quarterfinals and a two-point
victory over Spain in preliminary play.
	   And an emphatic breakaway dunk by Jimmy King gave the United
States a 62-52 lead with 6:21 left, but Russia fought back and tied
the game on Babkov's treys.
	   ``We had a nice 10-point lead, but we had several mental lapses,
like leaving the best shooter we've seen all year wide open,'' said
U.S. coach Rudy Tomjanovich, who cobbled together his team in about
a month.
	   The United States missed 3-pointers on consecutive trips up the
court _ the team went 4-for-20 (20 percent) from behind the arc
overall _ and then point guard Michael Hawkins was whistled for an
offensive foul with 10 seconds remaining.
	   Karassev inbounded the ball to Panov (7 points), who dribbled
through the U.S. defense for the winner.
	   Elsewhere Saturday, in games to determine fifth through eighth
places, Italy defeated Lithuania 76-71, while Spain beat Argentina
77-64. Also, Australia edged Brazil 79-75 to take ninth place and
Puerto Rico beat Canada 92-81 for 11th.

Gay Games end with fanfare and emotional farewell
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ With fanfare and emotional
farewells, the 1998 Gay Games ended Saturday as tens of thousands
of athletes gathered for a last round of dancing and freewheeling
celebration.
	   On a hot summer night, up to 28,000 people thronged the Arena
Stadium for the bash that ended the week-long Olympics-styled games
spotlighting gay athletes, culture, and boisterous street parties.
	   Sniffling and teary-eyed, participants bid farewell to each
other, promising to meet up again at the next Gay Games in 2002 in
Sydney, Australia.
	   Kicking off the closing ceremony, jubilant and dancing athletes
entered the stadium and ran the gauntlet of flag-waving supporters.
	   With rave music pounding in the background, same-sex couples
entered hand in hand while transvestites in cheerleader outfits
bobbed to the beat, their pom-poms swaying in the air.
	   ``Jesus loves us'' read one poster raised by an athlete. ``Out
and proud in Zimbabwe'' read another.
	   ``I am crying. This is brilliant,'' said tennis competitor
Dominic James of London.
	   ``I came with no expectation except for a game of tennis,'' he
said. Instead, he walked away with a second place in mixed doubles
and a new best friend.
	   The mirth contrasted with the somber moments of the previous
days when financial woes threatened to end the games, which have
attracted 15,000 competitors and even more visitors.
	   Last Sunday, the event's managing director was fired for
overspending, prompting Amsterdam city officials to intervene with
a dlrs 2.5 million bail-out loan to keep the games alive.
	   Some also asked whether the games, which included less-Olympian
categories like ballroom dancing and bridge, have veered too much
from its earlier intentions.
	   The first Gay Games, held in San Francisco in 1982, aimed to
encourage and showcase gay athletes. These days, more and more
non-sporting activities and parties are clogging up the line-up,
said Hunk Krol, the editor of the Netherlands' Gay Newspaper.
	   ``The original games are over,'' he said. ``I love big parties,
but they have nothing to do with the original aim of the Gay
Games.''
	   ``They should change the name to Gay Pride Week or Tolerance
Fair,'' he added.
	   Whatever you call it, Dale Zonk of San Francisco said he'll be
there in Sydney.
	   ``It's just a lot of fun,'' said the 35-year-old swimmer.

Boldon, Jones win 100s in Monte Carlo meet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Kipketer winning; CORRECTS Szabo to Romania

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) - Ato Boldon turned the tables on
Olympic champion Donovan Bailey in the men's 100 while Marion Jones
posted another fast time in the women's 100 Saturday at the
Herculis international meeting, part of the IAAF Golden League
series.
	   Boldon timed 9.92 seconds in beating Bailey, second in 9.96.
Third was Frankie Fredericks, 10.02, losing out on his Golden
League streak.
	   Only Maurice Greene of the United States was missing from the
top field. World-record holder Bailey had won in Paris on July 29,
beating Greene and Boldon in 10.02 on a cool and wet night.
	   Boldon had the two times of the year, running 9.86 twice earlier
in the season. Bailey's world record in 9.84.
	   ``I've been second a few times this year but every now and then
I run tyhe race I wan to win,'' Boldon said.
	   A dlrs 1 million bonus will be shared among the athletes who
remain unbeaten through the six Golden League meets and the Grand
Prix final in Moscow Sept. 5 in certain events.
	   Jones, Haile Gebrselassie, Charity Opara, Bryan Bronson and
Hicham El Guerrouj are still alive for the bonus.
	   On a warm but not hot evening on the French Riviera, there were
a number of season bests set with some approaching world records.
	   Wilson Kipketer open for so long it's nice to start with 1:43.''
	   Kipketer, a Kenyan-born Dane, had a superb 1997. He broke the
world indoor record twice in Paris in March then bettered the world
outdoor record twice, bringing it down to 1 minute, 41.11 seconds
in Cologne after a 1:41.24 in Zurich.
	   Jones stayed unbeaten in the women's 100 with a convincing win
in 10.72, just .01 off her season's best. Christine Arron of
France, who had a 10.85 earlier this week, was a well-beaten
seventh in 11.19.
	   `I was motivated because I knew there were some competitiors who
were fast,'' Jones said. ``But I think I can go faster than 10.70
in the coming weeks. ''
	   She looks forward to running in the next Golden League meet in
Zurich, Switzerland, next Wednesday.
	   ``-Joyner has gone under 10.70 with a best of 10.49.
	   In the women's 400 American Kim Batten ran 52.74, just .13 from
her own world record and equal to the third best of all time.
	   ``I ran a great race,'' Batten said. ``All the right things
happened at the right time.'' Glory Alozie of Nigera ran 12.44 in
the women's 100 hurdles, another 1998 best.
	   Michael Johnson ran a 43.96 in the 400, the second time he has
been under 44.00 this season. It was his first race in more than
two weeks since winning at the Goodwill Games but he was just third
at the first Golden League meet in Oslo.
	   El Guerrouj of Morocco ran 3 minutes, 28.37 seconds in the
1,500. It was a good time for many but only average for El Guerrouj
this year.
	   ``I was a bit worried because I was ill,'' El Guerrouj said. ``I
had stomach pains.''
	   El Guerrouj set the world record in the 1,500 at the last Golden
League meet, in Rome when he ran 3:26.00. Two days later he missed
the world record in the mile by .21 seconds in Nice and was less
than a half second from the world 2,000 mark three days later.
	   Bronson of the United States won the men's 400 hurdles in 47.93
to keep alive his Golden League sweep.
	   Gebrselassie captured the 3,000 in an unchallenged 7:25.54,
keeping alive his chances for the dlrs 1 million.
	   Bernard Barmasai of Kenya took the 3,000 steeplechase in another
season's best with 8:00.67 and Maxim Tarasov of russia won the pole
vault at 5.90.
	   Rssia's Yelena Asfansyeva handed Mozambique's Maria Mutola her
first loss of the year in the women's 800. Asfansyeva did a season
best of 1:56.63 edging Mutola by .02.
	   ``I lost in the last 100 meters,'' Mutola said. ``I got
bumped.''
	   Gabriela Szabo of Romania stopped Svetlana Masterkova's Golden
League streak in a fast 1,500, winning in 3:56.97. Eight women were
under 4 minutes.
	   Jonathan Edwards failed to have a fair mark in the triple jump,
losing his streak in that event. He had a sligh ankle injury coming
into the meet. Denis Kasputin of Russia won with 17.39. Edwards
went 18.01 in winning in Oslo.
	   Nigeria's Opara won the women's 400 in 49.88 to make it
three-for-three in the Golden League.
	   The Golden League series continues in Zurich with the Weltklasse
meet on August 12.

Gay Games end with fanfare and emotional farewell

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ With fanfare and emotional
farewells, the 1998 Gay Games ended Saturday as tens of thousands
of athletes gathered for a last round of dancing and freewheeling
celebration.
	   On a hot summer night, up to 28,000 people thronged the Arena
Stadium for the bash that ended the week-long Olympics-styled games
spotlighting gay athletes, culture, and boisterous street parties.
	   Sniffling and teary-eyed, participants bid farewell to each
other, promising to meet up again at the next Gay Games in 2002 in
Sydney, Australia.
	   Kicking off the closing ceremony, jubilant and dancing athletes
entered the stadium and ran the gauntlet of flag-waving supporters.
	   With rave music pounding in the background, same-sex couples
entered hand in hand while transvestites in cheerleader outfits
bobbed to the beat, their pom-poms swaying in the air.
	   ``Jesus loves us'' read one poster raised by an athlete. ``Out
and proud in Zimbabwe'' read another.
	   ``I am crying. This is brilliant,'' said tennis competitor
Dominic James of London.
	   ``I came with no expectation except for a game of tennis,'' he
said. Instead, he walked away with a second place in mixed doubles
and a new best friend.
	   The mirth contrasted with the somber moments of the previous
days when financial woes threatened to end the games, which have
attracted 15,000 competitors and even more visitors.
	   Last Sunday, the event's managing director was fired for
overspending, prompting Amsterdam city officials to intervene with
a dlrs 2.5 million bail-out loan to keep the games alive.
	   Some also asked whether the games, which included less-Olympian
categories like ballroom dancing and bridge, have veered too much
from its earlier intentions.
	   The first Gay Games, held in San Francisco in 1982, aimed to
encourage and showcase gay athletes. These days, more and more
non-sporting activities and parties are clogging up the line-up,
said Hunk Krol, the editor of the Netherlands' Gay Newspaper.
	   ``The original games are over,'' he said. ``I love big parties,
but they have nothing to do with the original aim of the Gay
Games.''
	   ``They should change the name to Gay Pride Week or Tolerance
Fair,'' he added.
	   Whatever you call it, Dale Zink of San Francisco said he'll be
there in Sydney.
	   ``It's just a lot of fun,'' said the 35-year-old swimmer.

Franchitti wins Mid-Ohio pole
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM PUET &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LEXINGTON, Ohio (AP) _ Scotland's Dario Franchitti won the pole
position Saturday for the CART Indy-car Miller Lite 200 at the
Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course as the track record was broken for the
second straight day.
	   Franchitti, a second-year driver from Scotland, had a fast lap
of 1 minute, 5.679 seconds in his final qualifying try over the
3.62-kilometer (2.25-mile), 13-turn road course in the hills of
north-central Ohio. It's the ninth straight year the track
qualifying record has been broken.
	   Joining him on the front row for the race Sunday will be
American Jimmy Vasser. Bryan Herta of the United States, who had
the fastest time in Friday's first day of qualifying, will start
third.
	   This is the third time this season and fourth in his career that
Franchitti has been the fastest qualifier. He will be on the front
row for the fourth time in the last six races, but he's looking for
his first victory.
	   ``That was all we had on the last lap,'' Franchitti said of his
performance on a stifling day. The temperature was 36 degrees
Celgius (96 Fahrenheit) and the track temperature at 54 Celsius
(130 Fahrenheit) during qualifying. ``I didn't think really we had
the answer here.
	   ``It was just a matter of putting it all together on one lap.
It's a very difficult track where the car is good in some corners
and not so good in others. But we did it.''
	   Franchitti will collect dlrs 410,000 if he wins Sunday. His
winner's purse would be dlrs 100,000, with the rest coming from a
prize fund that has grown each time a driver failed to win from the
pole.
	   Vasser's teammate, Italian Alex Zanardi, was the last driver to
sweep. That was in Cleveland, in July 1997, 20 races ago.
	   Vasser's qualifying time in a Target-Chip Ganassi Racing
Reynard-Honda was 1:05.834. The 1996 series champion will be trying
for his third win this year a sweep of CART's Ohio races after
winning at Cleveland earlier this year.
	   ``I'm pretty happy just to be in the front row,'' Vasser said.
``I would have liked to have a shot at that (pole) money, but
instead I'll have to make sure he (Franchitti) doesn't get it.''
	   Herta's Team Rahal Reynard-Ford had a fast lap of 1:05.863
before sliding off the track near the end of qualifying.
	   That was better than the track record of 1:06.100 Herta had set
Friday, but not good enough for a front-row spot.
	   Herta and owner-teammate Bobby Rahal will be the crowd favorites
Sunday because their team is based about 100 kilometers (60 miles)
from the track, and it will be Rahal's last race at Mid-Ohio as a
driver after 17 seasons.
	   Herta won the pole last year, but exited early with a cut tire.
Polesitters have won eight of the previous 16 CART races at
Mid-Ohio, and Herta said Franchitti had a big advantage.
	   ``This is not an easy place to pass ... so it'll be tough (to
improve his position), but I don't think it will be impossible,''
said Herta, who like Franchitti is chasing his first victory. ``You
just have to be patient sometimes.''
	   Rahal, who will start 16th, said if he were to win, ``it would
be just phenomenal,'' but added that Herta realistically had the
better shot at a victory.
	   If Herta were to win, ``I'm not sure I'd feel exactly the same
as if I won, ... but I'd be very, very happy,'' Rahal said.
	   Asked about his expectations for his last appearance on the
track with which he's most identified, Rahal said, ``It's going to
be unbelievable. I'm not sure if I'm going to choke up, but I''m
very appreciative of everything that's happened to me.''
	   Zanardi, the two-time defending champion of this race, will have
a hard time making it three in a row. He will start 13th on a track
where no CART driver has won from lower than eighth place. He also
slid off course during the final qualifying session.
	   No matter what he does Sunday, Zanardi will retain a comfortable
lead in the driver standings, which he leads by 68 points. He would
have to go pointless for at least three races for any driver to
come close to him.
	   Brazil's Mauricio Gugelmin qualified fourth (1:06.003), Mexico's
Adrian Fernandez fifth (1:06.071) and Canada's Greg Moore sixth
(1:06.098), all with times faster than Herta posted Friday.
	   Rounding out the top 10 will be American Al Unser Jr.
(1:06.234), England's Mark Blundell (1:06.372), Canadian Patrick
Carpentier (1:06.425) and American Michael Andretti (1:06.426).

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ With its president at a peace summit,
Congo was on a war footing Saturday _ broadcasting accusations
against neighboring Rwanda, enlisting fresh army recruits and
detaining ethnic Tutsis on suspicion of treason.
	   Hundreds of unemployed men and women turned out at a Kinshasa
military base to enlist in the army, vowing to crush the rebellion
in eastern Congo and take the war to neighboring Rwanda.
	   ``We're determined to protect our country,'' said one young
woman who refused to give her name. ``If they give us arms today,
we are ready to go all the way to Rwanda.''
	   President Laurent Kabila accuses the Tutsi-led Rwandan
government of masterminding the uprising in the Kivu region.
Several key cities, including Goma and Bukavu, are already in the
hands of rebel Tutsis.
	   Rwanda repeatedly has denied it was behind Congo's uprising and
said Kabila was trying to divert attention from disenchantment with
his government.
	   Kabila sat down Saturday in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, with his
Rwandan adversary, President Pasteur Bizimungu, to try to find a
peaceful end to growing hostilities. They were joined by five other
regional leaders.
	   But prospects for a solution emerging from the talks appeared
dim.
	   On his return to the Rwandan capital Kigali, Bizimungu accused
Kabila of trying to establish a pretext to attack Rwanda and
threatened Congo with a preemptive strike.
	   ``We will not wait for Congo to attack first,'' Bizimungu told
The Associated Press.
	   Earlier Saturday, however, Bizimungo said he and Kabila had
agreed to hold off on hostilities.
	   Although few details from the talks were immediately available,
Bizimungu told reporters in the Zambian capital of Lusaka that the
two sides had agreed not attack one another.
	   ``A cease-fire has been established to find a solution and a
committee has been set up,'' Bizimungu said during a stopover in
Lusaka while en route to Rwanda.
	   It was unclear why Bizimungo had issued seemingly contradictory
statements about the prospects for ending hostilities.
	   The Congolese government has been repeatedly broadcasting
statements by Kabila declaring there was no room to bargain with
Rwanda.
	   ``There is nothing to negotiate in Zimbabwe except the immediate
withdrawal of Rwandan troops,'' Kabila was quoted as saying on
state radio.
	   The rebellious Rwandan soldiers and Congolese Tutsi fighters _
called Banyamulenge _ backed Kabila last year in his ouster of
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, but they have since grown disaffected.
Among other things, the fighters accuse Kabila of failing to
contain Rwandan Hutu rebels launching cross-border attacks from
inside Congo.
	   The Banyamulenge have close ethnic ties with the Tutsis, who now
govern Rwanda.
	   ``They want to create a Tutsi empire,'' Kabila said in another
statement on state-controlled Voice of the People radio. ``But are
we Congolese prepared to accept the challenge of a toad which wants
to swallow an elephant?''
	   The rebel Tutsi fighters also appeared to ignore diplomatic
efforts to end the conflict and vowed to push toward the capital of
Kinshasa.
	   The rebels announced a new set of targets in western Congo,
pledging to push inland from their Atlantic coastline stronghold of
Muanda to Boma, within 150 miles (240 kms) southwest of the
capital.
	   ``We want to remove President Kabila from power for the interest
of the people because he failed to rule them,'' rebel-run Radio
Bukavu said.
	   With sabers rattling, several European countries and the United
States have ordered their non-essential embassy employees out of
Congo. The United States has urged all Americans to leave the
country.
	   Kabila was served a warning by Rwanda on Friday, when Bizimungu
declared that his country will ``hit back'' if Congo strikes.
	   With the hostilities mounting, ethnic Tutsis in Kinshasa are
facing reprisal attacks for the rebellion.
	   Hundreds, perhaps thousands of Tutsis and other citizens have
been rounded up by the police, while troops loyal to Kabila looted
their shops, the U.N. human rights agency said.
	   One foreigner in Congo who had been arrested and later released
said dozens of Tutsis, Ethiopians and Lebanese were being held at
one police station on suspicion of treason.
	   In Washington, the State Department expressed similar concerns.
	   Spokesman James Foley said the reports from Congo suggest that
Tutsis and possibly civilians of other ethnicities in Kinshasa
``are being rounded up, detained, beaten, tortured and killed
because of their ethnicity.''
	   The revenge attacks on Tutsis reflect a growing instability in
Kinshasa and elsewhere in Congo amid displeasure with Kabila's
rule, which critics say is marked by corruption and mismanagement.

PSG, Lens lose in season opener; Marseille wins

 &UR; EDS: REPEATING to CORRECT garble. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Nigeria's Jay-Jay Okocha scored a stunning 30-meter
drive a minute after coming off the bench for new club Paris
Saint-Germain, but it wasn't enough to overcome Bordeaux, which won
the French first-division league season opener for both sides 3-1
Saturday.
	   In other results, host Toulouse defeated defending champion Lens
3-2, and Marseille, fielding three members of France's World Cup
title team, beat Nantes 2-0.
	   Elsewhere, Rennes beat Auxerre 1-0; Bastia drew 2-2 with
Montpellier; Nancy drew 1-1 with Sochaux; and Strasbourg and Lyon
played out a goalless draw.
	   In Friday's games, Le Havre drew 0-0 with last year's
runners-up, Metz, and Monaco came from behind to beat
newly-promoted Lorient 2-1.
	   It couldn't have been a better start for Okocha, who joined PSG
in a French record deal of 100 million francs (dlrs 17 million),
immediately scored after coming on as a second-half substitute.
	   Bordeaux scored twice within three minutes through Lilian
Laslandes and Sylvain Wiltord. But Ali Bernabia put the result
beyond doubt with four minutes left, volleying in a cross from
Diaba Diawara to beat PSG goalkeeper Bernard Lama to the delight of
35,000.
	   The match was marred by first-half red cards for Bordeaux's
Michel Pavon and PSG's Bruno Carotti _ both of whom were cautioned
twice.
	   It was an unhappy start to the season for the defending
champions, who fell behind on a 35th minute goal by Robert Malm,
but rallied to then take the lead on goals by Tony Vairelles and
Stephane Dalmat.
	   Lens, a town of about 35,000 which won its first league title in
a major surprise last season, proved incapable of holding onto the
lead, conceding goals in the last half hour by Ahmed Maharzi and
Jose Galdames.
	   Marseille kicked off the season in front of a capacity crowd of
60,000, getting second-half goals from Italian Fabrizio Ravanelli,
who converted a cross from newly acquired Robert Pires, and a
40-meter lob by Eric Roy in the dying minutes.
	   But the home team began nervously, and had to wait until the
second half to break the deadlock.
	   Like PSG, Marseille _ an eight-time league champion _ spent
lavishly this summer, recruiting Pires, PSG's Florian Maurice,
Nantes' Jocelyn Gourvennec and Lyon's Daniel Bravo to the Stade
Velodrome.

	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ Trinidad's Ato Boldon got revenge
against Olympic champion Donovan Bailey of Canada in the men's 100
meters, and American Marion Jones posted another fast time in the
women's 100 Saturday at the Herculis Golden League athletics meet.
	   Boldon was timed in 9.92 seconds in beating Bailey, second at
9.96. Third was Namibia's Frankie Fredericks in 10.02.
	   Only world champion Maurice Greene of the United States was
missing from the top field. World-record holder Bailey had won at
Paris July 29, beating Greene and Boldon in 10.02.
	   Boldon has the fastest times of the year, running 9.86 twice.
Bailey's world record in 9.84.
	   ``I've been second a few times this year, but every now and then
I run the race I want to win,'' Boldon said.
	   A dlrs 1 million bonus will be shared among the athletes who
remain unbeaten through the six Golden League meets and the Grand
Prix final at Moscow Sept. 5.
	   Jones, Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie, Nigeria's Charity Opara,
American Bryan Bronson and Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj are still
alive for the bonus.
	   On a warm night on the French Riviera, there were several season
bests set.
	   Jones stayed unbeaten in the women's 100, winning in 10.72, only
.01 second off her season's world best. Christine Arron of France,
who had run 10.85 earlier this week, was a well-beaten seventh in
11.19.
	   ``I was motivated because I knew there were some competitors who
were fast,'' Jones said. ``But I think I can go faster than 10.70
in the coming weeks.''
	   The next Golden League meet is at Zurich, Switzerland, on
Wednesday.
	   ``The track is so fast there I think I can beat my personal
best,'' Jones said.
	   Only American Florence Griffith Joyner has gone under 10.70,
with her world record at 10.49.
	   Wilson Kipketer opened his season with a 1:43.74 victory in the
800 meters. It was his first race in nearly 11 months after
contracting malaria in January.
	   ``After what happened this winter, I'm very happy to run
again,'' Kipketer said. ``After being off for so long, it's nice to
start with 1:43.''
	   Kipketer, a Kenyan-born Dane, had a superb 1997. He broke the
world indoor record twice in Paris in March then bettered the world
outdoor record twice, bringing it down to 1 minute, 41.11 seconds
in Cologne after a 1:41.24 in Zurich.
	   In the women's 400 hurdles, American Kim Batten ran 52.74, only
.13 seconds off her world record and equal to the third-best ever.
	   ``I ran a great race,'' Batten said. ``All the right things
happened at the right time.''
	   Glory Alozie of Nigeria won the women's 100 hurdles in 12.44,
another 1998 best.
	   American Michael Johnson won the men's 400 in 43.96, the second
time he has been under 44 seconds this season.
	   El Guerrouj clocked 3:28.37 in winning the 1,500. It was a good
time for many but not for El Guerrouj.
	   ``I was a bit worried because I was ill,'' El Guerrouj said. ``I
had stomach pains.''
	   El Guerrouj set the world record of 3:26.00 at the last Golden
League meet in Rome. Two days later, he missed the world record in
the mile by .21 seconds at Nice and was less than a half-second off
the world 2,000 mark three days later.
	   Gebrselassie captured the 3,000 in an unchallenged 7:25.54.
	   Bernard Barmasai of Kenya took the 3,000 steeplechase in another
season's best with 8:00.67 and Maxim Tarasov of Russia won the pole
vault at 5.90 meters (19 feet-4 1-4 inches).
	   Bronson won the men's 400 hurdles in 47.93, keeping alive his
Golden League unbeaten record.
	   Russia's Yelena Asfansyeva handed Mozambique's Maria Mutola her
first loss of the year in the women's 800. Asfansyeva ran a season
best of 1:56.63, beating Mutola by .02 seconds.
	   ``I lost in the last 100 meters,'' Mutola said. ``I got
bumped.''
	   World record-holder Jonathan Edwards of Britain failed to get a
fair mark in the triple jump, and lost for the first time in the
Golden League series. He had a slight ankle injury coming into the
meet. Denis Kasputin of Russia won at 17.39 (57-0 3-4).
	   Nigeria's Opara won the women's 400 in 49.88, making her 3-for-3
in the Golden League.
	   Gabriela Szabo of Romania handed Russia's Svetlana Masterkova
her first Golden League loss, winning the women's 1,500 in 3:56.97.
Eight women were under four minutes.

<TEXT>
	   CANTERBURY, England (AP) _ Three weeks of debate which pitted
conservative against liberal bishops arguing over the course of the
Anglican Communion ended Saturday.
	   Although debates at the Lambeth Conference, held once a decade,
ranged over issues such as homosexuality, Third World debt and
euthanasia, bishops often returned to a fundamental point: How to
interpret the Bible?
	   ``The wider our family becomes, the more you want to have
something in common,'' the Rt. Rev. Alexis Bilindabagabo, bishop of
Gahini, Rwanda, said during a debate in the conference's closing
week.
	   The complaint of Bilindabagabo and other bishops from the Third
World was that some Anglicans, particularly in the industrial
world, did not share his understanding of Scripture.
	   ``When you talk about sin in certain places, it has ceased to
exist,'' he said. ``When you talk about repentance in certain
places, it has ceased to exist.''
	   Interpreting the Scripture was at the center of debate over
ordaining practicing homosexuals and blessing same-sex unions.
Conservative bishops, pointing to condemnations of homosexuality in
the Bible, easily won the vote Wednesday to denounce homosexuality
as a sin.
	   Disputes between bishops are inevitable in an Anglican Communion
that is made up of 22 separate national churches extending around
the world, and in his closing sermon Saturday at the university
campus which hosted the conference the Archbishop of Canterbury,
George Carey, said that the church should ``enjoy diversity.''
	   ``We have come to know for our own selves that so to delight in
each others' diversity is not ... in any way to `fudge` the hard
questions,'' said the archbishop, who, as head of the Church of
England, the original Anglican body, is the figurehead for 70
million Anglicans worldwide.
	   Although Anglicanism is rooted in the faith of the Church of
England, the Anglican Communion is now mainly an African church:
17.5 million members in Nigeria and 8 million in Uganda dwarf the
Church of England's 2 million active members _ roughly the size of
Anglican churches in Kenya, South Africa and southern India.
	   An important issue, especially for the African bishops, was
Third World debt. The conference adopted a resolution calling for
debt payments to be sharply reduced so that payments are not made
``at great cost to human lives.''
	   Bishops also had an opportunity to personally lobby British
Prime Minister Tony Blair at a reception at Lambeth Palace, Carey's
official residence in London after which the conference was named,
and there was talk about organizing protests to put the issue on
the agenda on the Group of Eight summit in Germany next year.
	   Althoughy a common understanding of Scripture eluded the more
than 700 bishops, before Saturday's end of the conference they took
some small steps to promote cohesion.
	   Bishops voted to extend the powers of the primates of the
national churches, who meet every two years. They would be
permitted to intervene in exceptional cases and give guidelines
``on the limits of Anglican diversity.''
	   Archbishop Carey serves as president of the primates conference,
but has no special powers comparable to a Roman Catholic pope.
	   Anglican churches still have no common policy on ordaining women
priests, the big issue at Lambeth 10 years ago. But they all seem
to be learning to live with it, and the presence of 11 women
bishops from the United States, Canada and New Zealand provoked no
large protest.
	   The bishops did rebuke the Episcopal Church in the United
States, however, for setting a deadline for four reluctant bishops
to accept women priests in their dioceses, and said no bishops
should be forced to act against their consciences.
	   On Friday, the bishops adopted a resolution opposing euthanasia
but allowing one exception: that it might be permissible to
withdraw nourishment from someone in a permanent vegetative state.

Fujimori meets with generals to defuse tension with Ecuador
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ President Alberto Fujimori met with his top
generals on Saturday to find a way to defuse mounting border
tensions after Peru charged that Ecuadorean troops had infiltrated
its territory.
	   During the meeting at the government palace, Fujimori put the
final touches on a proposal to extend an internationally monitored
demilitarized zone around a stretch of disputed border where the
countries fought a brief war in 1995 and remove the Ecuadorean
troops, a government spokesman said.
	   Peru on Thursday accused Ecuadorean troops of entering 12 miles
(20 kms) inside its territory, calling it a ``provocation,'' and
said the two countries' troops had come ``face-to-face.''
	   Ecuador has denied that its troops entered Peruvian territory.
	   The two countries have fought wars in 1941, 1981 and 1995 over
49 miles (78 kms) of disputed border in the largely uninhabited
Andean foothills 560 miles (900 kms) north of Lima.
	   Representatives from Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United
States, who are trying to broker a deal to end the long-running
dispute, met in Ecuador's capital Quito on Saturday to finalize a
plan that would separate the troops.
	   The two countries had appeared on the verge of negotiating a
settlement to the dispute when the alleged infiltration occurred.
	   ``We are very concerned about the recent intensification of
military tensions.... which are particularly undesirable due to the
proximity of a final agreement,'' said a statement issued by
delegates from the mediating countries.
	   The latest tensions come as Ecuador's President-Elect Jamil
Mahuad prepares to take power on Monday and Fujimori has just
suffered the resignation of his outspoken Prime Minister Javier
Valle Riestra.
	   About 20 U.S. military observers are stationed in the area.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ The presidential campaign officially
got underway Saturday with candidates clogging downtown streets
with long caravans of supporters.
	   Before heading out on a 20-kilometer (12-mile) hike,
front-runner and former coup leader Hugo Chavez told a crowd that
``time has run out'' for traditional political parties and ``the
time of the people has arrived.''
	   Former Miss Universe and local mayor Irene Saez told supporters
she was committed to bringing change to Venezuela without violence.
Once leading the polls for the Dec. 6 race, Saez has slipped to
third place. Former state governor Henrique Salas Romer has moved
up to second place.
	   Most candidates are running on anti-corruption platforms,
pledging to bring back prosperity to a country that once enjoyed
the highest per capita income in Latin America.
	   Many Venezuelans blame political corruption and economic
mismanagement for squandering the world's largest oil reserves
outside the Middle East.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A well-known women's rights activist was
robbed in a Mexico City taxicab and smothered to death earlier this
week, police said.
	   A police report said officers in a patrol car found the body of
Libertad Hernandez Landa, 45, director of the Women's Program in
the gulf state of Veracruz, dumped in a vacant lot Thursday night.
	   It had been raining hard and the body was spotted lying in a
puddle of water in Iztapalapa, a district on the southeastern side
of the city. She had been stripped of all belongings and smothered
with a plastic bag, the police report said.
	   Landa, who was well known nationally, had been attending an
international women's rights conference at the Department of
Foreign Affairs. She left the building at around 7 p.m. Thursday
and boarded a taxi for Mexico City airport to pick up her son, who
was arriving from Veracruz.
	   When she failed to appear, her son advised police who broadcast
an urgent city-wide alert, the police report said.
	   Mexico City, with a population of 8.5 million, has been a
high-crime area for the past five years. An average of some 700
crimes involving some kind of weapon and resulting in six deaths
are committed every day, according to police statistics.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ The Brazilian Catholic Church has
issued a stinging criticism of the free market reforms implemented
in Brazil since 1990, O Globo reported Saturday.
	   The document, entitled ``Letter To the Brazilian People,''
criticized the ``subordination of society to large capital.'' The
letter was prepared by the National Conference of Brazilian
Bishops, which heard input from 450 church and lay organizations
throughout the country over the last six months.
	   The document also criticized Brazil's political and electoral
system, which it said concentrates hands in the hands of a few
elites and which ``perpetuates inequalities.''
	   Brazil is a predominantly Roman Catholic Nation of about 155
million people. Policy makers, particularly President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, have implemented a series of reforms in the 1990s
that have reduced the state's role in the economy and opened up
opportunities for private investors.
	   The government sold controlling stake in the state-held
telecommunications system on July 29.

Rafter eases into final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Saturday's first semifinal; Will be led after
Agassi-Krajicek semifinal, scheduled for 2300 GMT start, and after
Rafter's late doubles match &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Third-seeded Patrick Rafter of Australia
continued to methodically dispatch the opposition at the du Maurier
Open, advancing to the final with a 6-2, 6-4 victory Saturday over
Briton Tim Henman.
	   Either American Andre Agassi or Dutchman Richard Krajicek will
meet Rafter for the championship on Sunday. They played later
Saturday in the other semifinal.
	   Rafter, the world's fifth-ranked player has advanced through the
tournament with straight-set wins over fellow Aussie Mark
Philippoussis, the 14th seed, Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden (No. 5), and
Henman (No. 7).
	   ``He played a great match, he never let me get into it,'' Henman
said as Rafter was warming up for a doubles match. ``It's more him
playing a very good match than me doing anything wrong.
	   ``I think Patrick has got good chances against both (Agassi or
Krajicek). He has a lot of quick on his serve and it gives him a
little bit of extra time to get to the net.
	   Rafter took just over an hour to beat Henman with near flawless
tennis. Henman had 23 unforced errors while Rafter finished with
12. Rafter also had 29 winners to 12 for Henman and didn't commit a
single double-fault.
	   The key was Rafter's first serve percentage. Six of 10 first
serves were good, which gave an aggressive Rafter the edge in
attacking the net.
	   ``He hit some really good shots to put me under pressure,''
Henman said. ``I don't think I was given too many opportunities.''
	   Twice Henman led on his serve, but Rafter came back to break the
23-year-old from England.
	   ``When you get up in your service games you've got to not let
them back in,'' Henman said. ``But I won't dwell too much on the
match.''
	   Rafter, 25, has steadily improved his game in the last two
years. He finished the 1996 season ranked 62nd, but a year later
was No. 2 in the world behind Pete Sampras _ thanks largely to
winning the 1997 U.S. Open.

Mayfair, Stricker share Buick lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY ATKINS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GRAND BLANC, Michigan (AP) _ Experience showed as Billy Mayfair
and Steve Stricker moved past struggling Brandel Chamblee and took
a one-stroke lead after three rounds of the Buick Open on Saturday.
	   Mayfair, seeking his second U.S. PGA Tour win of the season,
shot a 7-under-par 65 while Stricker, winless since two triumphs in
1996, shot a 68 to tie at 12-under 204 at Warwick Hills Golf and
Country Club.
	   Chamblee, a journeyman seeking his first tour victory, shot a 72
to fall into a tie with defending champion Vijay Singh (67) and
Phil Blackmar (70).
	   Lurking only three strokes off the lead was Tiger Woods, who
finally found his game on the back nine.
	   A day of sun and wind made play more difficult for some on the
7,105-yard (6,395-meter) course which had been softened by two
nights of heavy rain. But it made things just about right for the
long-hitting Woods who is tuning up for the U.S. PGA Championship
next week at Redmond, Washington.
	   Woods, with a 69, moved into a tie for third with a host of
players at 207.
	   ``I'm right there,'' said Woods, who finished third at the
British Open. ``It's not a bad spot to be in. I'm pleased with some
of the improvements I've made.''
	   Mayfair, who began the day at five under, did just about
everything right on the front side. He birdied Nos. 1 and 3, spun
in a 165-yard (149-meter) 7-iron for eagle on the par-4 4th, then
birdied Nos. 6 and 7 to reach 11 under.
	   Mayfair bogeyed No. 8 and turned in 31. Birdies on the last two
holes got him to 12 under.
	   ``Finishing birdie-birdie was a great way to finish,'' Mayfair
said. ``Especially since I started so hot, then melted around in
the middle.''
	   Stricker, starting at 8 under, made up one stroke on the front
side and birdied Nos. 12 and 13 to reach 11 under. Another birdie
on the par-5 16th got him to 12 under.
	   Striker's 6-meter (20-foot) birdie putt at No. 18 for the
outright lead broke right at the last moment and slid 8 centimeters
(3 inches) below the hole.
	   ``I came here feeling good about my game,'' Stricker said. ``It
feels good to be playing well and headed in the right direction.''
	   Chamblee, who has played the U.S. PGA Tour full time for eight
years and parts of three other campaigns, started with a one-stroke
lead.
	   He logged nine straight pars on the front side, then birdies at
Nos. 10 and 12 got him to 13 under before a pulled 5-iron led to a
bogey at the par-5 13th.
	   Despite the pressure, Chamblee kept himself together the rest of
the round, time after time scrambling out of potential trouble.
	   When he drove into deep rough at No. 15, he still managed to
reach the green in regulation. The problem was that Chamblee wasn't
converting his chances. He missed a very makeable birdie putt at
the par-3 17th.
	   His luck ran out when his drive on the 18th landed in some
muddy, matted thatch, leaving him 205 yards (185 meters) from the
pin. Chamblee stroked a 5-iron to the front edge of the green, but
three-putted to fall out of his share of the lead.
	   ``I'm playing good,'' Chamblee said. ``I just didn't make any
putts.''
	   Singh angrily slammed his club into the soft ground after his
approach at 18 found a greenside bunker. He pulled his 1 1-2-meter
(5-foot) putt to save par left of the cup.

 &UR; GUYANA: Government considers withdrawing from U.N. protocol &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Guyana may withdraw from a United
Nations accord to speed up executions, a top government official
said Saturday.
	   If Guyana withdraws from the United Nations Optional Protocol on
Civil and Political Rights, it would follow the lead of two other
Caribbean nations, Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica.
	   Several of Guyana's 26 death-row prisoners have appealed to the
Geneva-based U.N. Human Rights Committee to have their sentences
commuted because of the length of time they have been in prison.
	   Cabinet Secretary Roger Luncheon said Saturday the government's
choice between giving up the U.N. protocol and ending capital
punishment would be an easy one.
	   ``If it becomes evident ... that the access to the Optional
Protocol frustrates that exercise, then capital punishment will go
on and the Protocol will have to be modified,'' said Luncheon.
 &UR; JAMAICA: Cable &AMP; Wireless concerned about proposed policy change
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ The government and international
telecommunications giant Cable &AMP; Wireless appear to be at odds over
a new policy announced Friday by Prime Minister P.J. Patterson.
	   While Cable &AMP; Wireless Jamaica Ltd. has a 25-year contract as
the monopoly provider of telecommuncations in Jamaica, Patterson
announced plans to allow other firms to compete in some segments of
the market, such as wireless telephone service.
	   Patterson said the old telecommunications policy was out of
date. Parliament would begin working on a new policy in September,
he said.
	   ``The objective,'' Patterson said, ``is to enable Jamaica to
move apace in economic, social and technological development.''
	   But Cable &AMP; Wireless issued a statement saying it was
``surprised and disappointed'' by Patterson's announcement.
	   ``This unsettling development raises questions about Cable &AMP;
Wireless' existing investments and places a great deal of
uncertainty about the company's future investment program in
Jamaica,'' said the statement.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Convict in Virgin Islands case escapes
	   DUBLIN, California (AP) _ A woman suspected in the disappearance
of her husband 12 years ago in the British Virgin Islands has
escaped from a minimum-security federal prison in California.
	   Astarte Rice-Davis walked away from the Federal Prison Camp in
Dublin on Friday. She had been transferred in November to the camp,
which has no fences or other security barriers.
	   Ms. Rice-Davis, 65, was serving a 15-year sentence for
embezzling from her husband's estate.
	   She was the main suspect in the 1986 disappearance of her
husband _ Contra Costa developer James Rice _ from his home in St.
Croix. Rice's body was never found but authorities believe his wife
planned his death in a plot to take over his estate.
	   In a plea bargain with federal prosecutors, she was convicted in
1992 of embezzling from his estate.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Company announces plant closing
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Cleveland-based M.A. Hanna Co. is closing its
Carolina, Puerto Rico, plant as part of a cost-savings plan.
	   None of the specialty chemical maker's Ohio plants will be among
five scheduled to close. In addition to the Puerto Rico plant, the
others that will shut down are in Milford, New Hampshire; Eagan,
Minnesota; North Kansas City, Missouri; and Vancouver, Washington.
	   Hanna announced Thursday about 260 its 7,200 employees worldwide
will be losing their jobs. Most of the cuts will come from the
plant closings, but some will come from administrative positions
throughout the company.

NBA risking fan alienation if lockout persists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ As the summer winds along and the National
Basketball Association's lockout of the players drags on with no
end in sight, signs are starting to emerge that this impasse could
become as divisive and harmful as the strike that wracked U.S.
Major League Baseball four years ago.
	   And this time, American fans could turn their backs on pro
basketball.
	   Consider this recent warning from NBA legend Wilt Chamberlain:
	   ``Baseball should have taught all these leagues a lesson, but
apparently it hasn't. I hope I don't reflect the entire population
of basketball fans, because if I do, the league is in big trouble.
I have no patience for this.''
	   The NBA endured lockouts in 1995 (for almost three months) and
1996 (for a few hours) without damaging its popularity, primarily
because the work stoppages took place during the offseason and the
league never lost a regular-season game to labor strife.
	   American Major League Baseball, however, was struck at the
beginning of September _ a month before the sport headed into to
its post-season championship playoffs. The ensuing cancellation of
the championship series alienated legions of fans, cost the club
owners and players a combined dlr 1 billion, and led to a 20
percent attendance drop the following season.
	   This summer's NBA lockout is similar to the last two, drawing
little interest or concern from fans whose attention has been
focused on baseball, the World Cup and the countdown to the start
of the American gridiron football season.
	   But trouble could set in soon, especially if the current impasse
lasts into September and threatens to disrupt the start of training
camps in early October and the scheduled start of the season Nov.
3.
	   ``The most important people here, other than us players, are the
fans out there,'' said Utah Jazz forward Karl Malone, who made a
surprising appearance at Thursday's bargaining session that ended
with commissioner David Stern and the club owners abruptly walking
out, saying they were ``insulted.''
	   ``I love baseball, but I don't want to see what happened to
(MLB) happen to our game. And that's what I saw today,'' Malone
said.
	   Stern and deputy commissioner Russ Granik said the episode that
made them leave the room came when a union attorney started
lecturing them on the league's chances of success in pending
litigation.
	   ``They disrespected us,'' said New York Knicks center Patrick
Ewing, president of the players association.
	   Stern, whose temper is well-known in the NBA office, already had
a poor relationship with two of the union's lawyers _ so poor, in
fact, that past bargaining sessions have deteriorated into shouting
matches, with curses and insults flying.
	   American MLB commissioner Bud Selig and MLB Players Association
head Donald Fehr engaged in similar exchanges in the months after
the World Series was canceled.
	   In a conference call after the talks broke off, Stern was
pessimistic enough to admit that Jan. 20 would be the drop-dead
date after which the NBA would probably have to cancel the season.
	   With so many harsh feelings and with Stern seemingly willing to
sacrifice games, gambling that the players' loss of paychecks will
make them soften their stance, it would be a major surprise if any
new talks will take place until the end of August at the earliest.
	   In the meantime, the next chapter of the lockout will be
contested in front of arbitrator John Feerick, dean of the Fordham
University law school. The union filed a grievance with Feerick on
June 30, a few hours before the lockout commenced, contending that
the owners should be paying players with guaranteed contracts
during the lockout.
	   If the players win the grievance, the owners' bargaining
position would be weakened considerably, since they would be
obligated to meet about dlrs 800 million worth of contract
obligations for the 1998-99 season.
	   The players also have a complaint before the National Labor
Relations Board, the government agency that brought an end to the
MLB strike by convincing a federal judge that owners were not
bargaining in good faith.
	   ``The message they gave us was they didn't think it's necessary
for them to bargain seriously until that happens,'' Stern said
after talks broke off.
	   The hearing before Feerick will be Aug. 24-25, and the NLRB's
New York director is due to make a report to his superiors in
Washington by Aug. 10.
	   Which means no one should expect any truly meaningful offers to
be extended by either side until outsiders determine who will hold
the leverage.
	   In the end, however, the most leverage will be held by the fans.
	   ``Basketball is different from baseball. Basketball is exactly
where society is at right now _ fast-paced, a lot of scoring, a lot
of dunking, a lot of making money,'' fan Alexi Yulich said Friday
as he stood outside the site of the NBA's soon-to-open merchandise
store on Fifth Avenue in New York City. ``It's all about
19-year-old kids making tons of money, tattoos, brand-new sneakers,
`phat' cars, music videos. Baseball is associated with sitting back
and napping.
	   ``I think the lockout could go on two full years and it wouldn't
hurt the sport.''
	   Chamberlain wouldn't agree.
	   Asked last week by the Record of Hackensack, a suburban New York
newspaper, whether he would stop following the NBA if the lockout
delays the start of the regular season, Chamberlain nodded
emphatically and said, ``Absolutely, absolutely.''
	   The future of the sport may depend on whether a majority of
people agree with Chamberlain or the man on the street.

Mallon takes lead in Star Bank Classic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAMES HANNAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEAVERCREEK, Ohio (AP) _ Meg Mallon shot a 5-under-par 67
Saturday in the second round of the Star Bank LPGA Classic to move
into first place with a one-stroke lead.
	   Mallon had a 13-under 131 total after two trips around the
6,331-yard (5,698-meter) Country Club of the North in this Dayton
suburb.
	   Donna Andrews shot a 65 to move into second place, while
first-round leader Dottie Pepper and Beth Daniel were tied for
third, another stroke back.
	   ``I putted super today,'' said Mallon, who had one-putted nine
greens during her the round. ``That really kept me in the game.''
	   Mallon tied Pepper with a birdie on No. 2, a par-3, but Pepper
birdied Nos. 3 and 4 to go back up by two strokes.
	   Mallon birdied the par-5 8th to move within one stroke of the
leader, then tied Pepper at 11 under on No. 9 by making a 12-meter
(40-foot) birdie putt.
	   Both players birdied the par-5 11th to stay even and matched
pars until the 17th, when Mallon moved ahead with a birdie.
	   Andrews moved to 11 under with a 12-meter (40-foot) eagle putt
on the par-5, 500-yard (450-meter) 15th.
	   Daniel, who birdied Nos. 12 and 13, bogeyed 18 to slip into the
tie for third.
	   Mallon, 35, has won eight tournaments since joining the U.S.
tour in 1986, but hasn't won since the Sara Lee Classic in 1996.
The graduate of nearby Ohio State has had eight top-10 finishes
this year in 19 tournaments.
	   Andrews, 31, has won six tournaments since joining the tour in
1989, the most recent being the Longs Drugs Challenge in California
in April.
	   The 32-year-old Pepper went winless last year after winning four
tournaments in 1996. She recently finished second in the Giant
Eagle Classic, missing a putt on the final hole that would have
sent her into a playoff with rookie sensation Pak Se-ri of South
Korea.
	   Pepper finished in a tie for third at last year's Star Bank
Classic after leading going into the final round.

Irwin, Jenkins tied for seniors lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COON RAPIDS, Minnesota (AP) _ Defending champion Hale Irwin and
senior rookie Tom Jenkins shot 7-under-par 65s Saturday to tie the
tournament record and share the lead halfway through the
rain-shortened Coldwell Banker Burnet Senior Classic.
	   Thirteen others were within three shots of the lead going into
Sunday's final round of the 36-hole event.
	   Japan's Isao Aoki, who had five birdies in a 31 on the back
nine, was at 66, while Argentine Vicente Fernandez and American Jay
Sigel had 67s. Ten players shot 68s.
	   Of the 26 threesomes in Friday's field, 17 had not completed
nine holes before lightning forced a suspension at 5 p.m.. With
threatening conditions and darkness looming, the round was erased
at 6:30 p.m. U.S. Senior PGA Tour rules stipulate that all players
must have at least nine holes completed for any scores to count.
	   Irwin, who had an eagle 3 on No. 12, has won five tournaments
and placed second five times in 14 senior events this year, winning
more than dlrs 2 million. If one adds his tournament-record 17
under score set in his 1997 victory, he was 24 under par as of
Saturday for his last 72 holes on the Bunker Hills course. That
doesn't include his 5-under score through 11 holes that was erased
Friday.
	   After watching his round of 69 on Friday wiped out, Jenkins
posted seven birdies Saturday to tie his best score on tour.
	   Jenkins posted just one career U.S. PGA Tour victory _ the 1975
Philadelphia Classic _ in his 13-year career from 1973-85. He
played a few events on the developmental Nike Tour from 1992-94 in
preparation for a possible run at the U.S. Senior PGA Tour, but
spent the bulk of his last 12 years running clinics on putting and
chipping.
	   Jenkins has been in or near the lead in four of the 15 senior
events he's played this year. His lone top-six finish was a tie for
second in the AT-and-T Canada Senior Open in June. He was tied for
the lead through 36 holes at the State Farm Classic at 10 under,
but ballooned to a 79 on the final day and finished 24th.
	   George Archer, whose 6-under 66 on Friday was erased, birdied
three of his last four holes Saturday for a 68.
	   Gil Morgan, the U.S. Senior PGA Tour's No. 2 money-winner this
year, shot a 69 and extended his streak of consecutive holes
without a bogey to 80. The U.S. Senior PGA Tour record is 97 set by
Jack Kiefer in 1994.

Late goal lifts Galaxy over Chicago 2-1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: NEW with Saturday's early game; WILL be UPDATED. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Steve Jolley's header in the 90th minute lifted
the Los Angeles Galaxy to a 2-1 victory over Chicago on Saturday,
the Fire's fifth consecutive loss.
	   With a record home crowd of 37,122 on hand at Soldier Field,
Chicago had tied the game 1-1 in the 87th minute on an own goal,
but Los Angeles avoided a shootout when Jolley outlept the defense
to get to a flicked on ball off the head of Paul Caligiuri and
headed the ball over the outstretched arms of goalkeeper Zach
Thornton.
	   The goal allowed the Galaxy (18-6) to widen its lead to 15
points over second-place Chicago (13-10) in the MLS' Western
Conference.
	   Both teams scored on own goals.
	   The Galaxy took a 1-0 lead in the 37th minute when Fire defender
Francis Okaroh attempted to play a header back to Mexican
goalkeeper Jorge Campos but the ball floated over Campos and just
inside the left post.
	   Chicago evened the score when Danny Pena of the Galaxy,
attempting to cut off a cross while sliding, knocked the ball
passed keeper Kevin Hartman and into his own net.

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The cable TV channel American Movie Classics
aired a TV tribute called ``Bob Hope: The Road to the Top'' in May,
but apparently he was not impressed.
	   Hope, 95, sued the channel and the program's creators, Iambic
Productions Ltd. and National Video Corp. Ltd., claiming the two
British companies used video footage, still photographs and home
movies that he never gave permission to use.
	   Hope is seeking unspecified damages and wants a judge to
prohibit the program from being broadcast again, according to the
lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court on Friday.
	   The companies could not be reached for comment late Friday.
	   ___
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Jazz singer Nina Simone blamed racism in
the United States for her decision to live abroad for the past 25
years.
	   Simone, who now lives in Europe, said that as a black person she
has ``paid a heavy price for fighting the establishment.''
	   She did not elaborate but said racial inequality in the United
States was now ``worse than ever.''
	   ``I have not lived in America for 25 years ... because of the
racism,'' Simone said Thursday.
	   Simone, 65, took part in the civil rights movement of the 1960s
and dedicated several songs to the cause of racial equality. She
left the United States in 1973 and lived in the Caribbean and
Africa before settling in Europe.
	   Simone was to perform this weekend at the Baalbek International
Festival in Lebanon.
	   ___
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ He's 28, beefy and lives in a funky New York pad
with five interested females.
	   But Dan, a 400-pound (180-kilogram) gorilla at the Bronx Zoo,
isn't a swinger. In fact, zoo officials say that as a love machine,
this ape is a dud.
	   Shipped in from Salt Lake City as part of a national breeding
exchange program, Dan's sexual indifference hasn't yet worried his
new handlers.
	   For now, Dan's libido is awaiting a jump-start from Patty Cake,
Julia, Tunko, Paki and Holli. The opportunity is there: Each is in
heat once a month.
	   So far, Dan just jumps up and down and claps his hands.
	   He's needed to help reproduce the endangered species of about
10,000 gorillas. About 600 are in captivity _ half of which are in
North America.
	   Doherty notes that Dan is still a novice in matters of the
heart: ``He's never been with five females,'' much less five who
``present themselves'' to him in a suggestive fashion.
	   Zoo officials aren't panicking. Dan just might be shy, or just
picky. Noted Doherty: ``There is a factor of compatibility, just as
there is with people.''
	   Or he may be gay. ``There's just no way of telling,'' he said
Thursday.
	   ___
	   VINCENNES, Indiana (AP) _ There'll be no beer at the clubhouse
to celebrate Matthew Stuart's first hole-in-one. Maybe a little
milk, or he can skip nap-time.
	   Matthew is 5 years old.
	   The boy, playing for only his fifth time, aced the 86-yard (78
meter), par-3 seventh hole at Fox Ridge Country Club on Monday,
using his driver from the women's tee.
	   ``He hit a nice, arching shot. It wasn't a line drive or
anything,'' said his father, Troy Stuart of Washington, Indiana.
``His ball hit the front of the green, bounced once and rolled
right into the cup.
	   ``I fell down laughing. I couldn't believe it.''
	   Golf Digest magazine said it was unaware of anyone recording a
hole-in-one at a more tender age _ 5 years, 3 months. The previous
record holder was 6 years, 1 month.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Investigators began a painstaking search
for clues to the terrorist bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania Saturday as Israeli rescue experts and dogs took over
the hunt for survivors in Nairobi. At least 148 people died.
Thirty-six hours after tons of concrete and steal crashed to the
ground, an Israeli team drilled through a wall at the Nairobi
embassy and pulled out a man from an adjacent building that had
collapsed. The attacks, just a few minutes and 700 kilometers (450
miles) apart on Friday, turned busy streets in the two African
capitals into bloody piles of concrete and knots of steel. No
arrests have been made. (KENYA-EMBASSY-BOMBINGS)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ With its president at a peace summit,
Congo was on a war footing Saturday _ broadcasting accusations
against neighboring Rwanda, enlisting fresh army recruits and
detaining ethnic Tutsis on suspicion of treason. President Laurent
Kabila accuses the Tutsi-led Rwandan government of masterminding
the uprising in the Kivu region. Rwanda repeatedly has denied it
was behind Congo's uprising and said Kabila was trying to divert
attention from disenchantment with his government. Kabila met in
Zimbabwe on Saturday with his Rwandan adversary, President Pasteur
Bizimungu, to try to find a peaceful end to growing hostilities.
They were joined by five other regional leaders. But prospects for
a solution emerging from the talks appeared dim. (CONGO)
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Taliban soldiers bombed the last major
Afghan city outside their control Saturday and claimed they had
captured it, although reports of street fighting made their hold
appear shaky. Residents in Mazar-e-Sharif, 190 miles (300 kms)
northwest of Kabul, cowered in basements, listening to a barrage of
explosions. The Islamic Republic News Agency in neighboring Iran
said bombings were continuous and reported ``sporadic acts of
resistance in the streets.'' Mazar-e-Sharif would be a big prize in
the Taliban's 4-year-old campaign to impose their strict
interpretation of Islamic rule, including a ban on music and tight
restrictions for women, on all of Afghanistan. The city's fall
would be a severe blow to an opposition already pushed to a
dwindling corner of northern Afghanistan. (AFGHANISTAN)
	   LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Catholic youths attacked
two policemen, forcing a colleague to fire shots into the air,
after an annual Protestant parade passed through Londonderry's
disputed center Saturday. About a dozen teen-agers surrounded the
two officers, knocked them down with stones and kicked them
repeatedly in the face and body minutes after Protestant marchers
passed through the other side of the Diamond, the central square in
Northern Ireland's second-largest city. Both officers, one with a
bloodied forehead, were carried away and taken to Londonderry's
Altnagelvin hospital where they were reported in stable condition.
The violence capped a tense, hate-filled afternoon in Londonderry,
where an agreement between Protestant leaders of the Apprentice
Boys brotherhood and Catholic protesters had minimized the chance
that the parade would trigger sectarian conflict. (NORTHERN
IRELAND)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Peace negotiations for Kosovo
province were back on track, a Western diplomat said Saturday, as a
heavy Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists appeared to be
winding down. Both sides were reviewing a blueprint for talks, with
one faction of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army already agreeing in
principle to an alliance with politicians that would form the basis
for an ethnic Albanian negotiating team. Diplomats in the past two
days also handed both sides a proposal outlining models for how
autonomy might work in Kosovo, a province of the Serb republic of
Yugoslavia where ethnic Albanians are a majority. Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic has agreed to restore Kosovo's
autonomy, which he revoked in 1989, and ethnic Albanian politicians
have said they would accept that arrangement as a first step to
independence. But the loosely organized KLA has so far rejected
anything besides outright secession. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)

Brunei prepares for future ruler's investiture

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to restore AP name in dateline

<TEXT>
	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ Brushing aside nagging
worries of the present, Brunei's royal family, counted among the
world's wealthiest, Sunday prepared to firm its grip on the future.
	   At the 1,788-room palace, workers gave finishing touches to a
facelift as cranes mounted king-size canopies under which a
procession will pass Monday after the formal proclamation of future
ruler of one of the last outposts of absolute monarchy.
	   Decorated arches with smiling portraits of royals flanked the
broad ways, streamers heralded the future king and gold-domed
mosques and government buildings were festooned with shining
lights.
	   Prince Al-Muhtadee Billah, the 24-year-old eldest son of Sultan
Hassanal Bolkiah, will receive a broad, jeweled traditional Malay
knife, called the Kris, from his father, ensuring his future right
to ascend to the all-powerful throne.
	   The heir to the Bolkiah family's Rolls-Royces, private jets,
prize race horses and oil riches is the third child of the monarch,
the two older daughters being ineligible for the crown because
women aren't allowed to rule.
	   In the blitz of local publicity ahead of Monday's festivities,
the prince has been portrayed both as modern and traditional.
	   Official pictures show him sitting cross-legged with Muslim
tutors as well as engrossed at a school desk, wearing a tie or
aiming a cue stick on a snooker table, wearing a bow-tie and
waistcoat.
	   His love for Islamic studies has been highlighted along with
passing references to his fondness for Western music.
	   It may be sometime before Prince Al-Muhtadee inherits the throne
from his 52-year-old father, but for now the Sultan probably needs
all the help he can get from his grown up son.
	   The ceremony comes at a time of crisis both for the family and
the tiny kingdom of 300,000 people on the tip of the Borneo land
mass flanked by the South China Sea.
	   As the Bolkiah family assembled for ceremonies and prayers over
the weekend, one prominent member was missing from Istana Nurul
Iman, the royal palace.
	   Not far from Oxford University, where the prince recently
received a diploma in diplomacy, one of the king's brothers, in
self-imposed exile somewhere in Europe, has become a major
embarrassment and strain on the kingdom.
	   Prince Jefri, the Sultan's brother, is alleged to have
squandered billions of dollars in bad business deals. Stories of
his wild orgies and extravagances have dented the Sultan's attempts
to portray a clean Islamic image of the family that has ruled
Brunei for four centuries.
	   Because the country's annual budgets are never made public and
the royal finances remain a secret, it may never be know how much
Brunei has hurt from the wayward prince's actions.
	   But last week, officials announced plans to hire foreign
consultants to prevent it from slipping into an economic mess.
	   Abdul Rahman Taib, deputy chairman of the newly formed
Ministerial Economic Council, said it had nothing to do with the
collapse of Prince Jefri's Amedeo company and its estimated dlrs 16
billion loss.
	   ``Brunei's economy is strong and totally viable. The country has
enough money to carry out all its infrastructure developments,'' he
said.
	   After stories about Amedeo's scandals surfaced, the Sultan moved
quickly to strip his brother of control of the failed company and
his position as chief of the Brunei Investment Agency, which is
responsible for overseas investments.
	   Palace problems apart, Brunei also is beginning to be whacked by
the Asian economic turmoil. Tourism has sagged, the construction
and trading sectors are in a gloom.
	   People are complaining, something rare in this
tightly-controlled kingdom where there is no income tax, education
and medical care is free and the per capita income is among the
highest in the world.
	   ``I keep wondering how come most of the goods sold in this
country cost so much more than the same goods sold in our
neighboring country,'' said a letter-writer in the weekend's
edition of Borneo Bulletin, the only English-language newspaper.
The daily does not publish names of the authors of letters for fear
they may be persecuted.
	   Another complained about the exorbitant rates charged by
Brunei's only mobile phone service provider.

	   In Minneapolis, Rafael Palmeiro hit a three-run homer, his 35th
of the season, and Brady Anderson added a two-run shot as Baltimore
beat Minnesota, 6-3.
	   Eric Davis also extended his hitting streak to 24 games for the
Orioles, tying Palmeiro's team record set in 1994 and helping
Baltimore win its fifth straight game improve to 22-5 since the

	   Minnesota's Paul Molitor went 5-for-5 _ his sixth career
five-hit game _ and stole his 500th career base, making him the
fifth player in major league history with at least 3,000 hits and
500 steals.

 &UR; Red Sox 11, Rangers 1 &QC; 
	   In Arlington, Texas, Darren Bragg was 4-for-6 with two homers
and Tim Wakefield pitched eight strong innings as Boston snapped

	   Wakefield (14-5) allowed one run on seven hits, struck out three
and walked two for his eighth victory in last 11 starts.
	   Bragg led off the first and eighth innings with home runs for
his first career multi-homer game. The outfielder also had a career
high with four runs and matched his career high for hits. He has
eight homers this year.
	   Rangers starter Aaron Sele (13-9) allowed seven earned runs on
10 hits in four innings to lose to his former club for the second
time in three starts this year.
	   Mo Vaughn, Nomar Garciaparra and Mike Stanley each had three
hits for Boston. Stanley also drove in three runs.

beat Minnesota, 6-3.
	   Eric Davis also extended his hitting streak to 24 games for the
Orioles, tying Palmeiro's team record set in 1994 and helping
Baltimore win its fifth straight game improve to 22-5 since the
All-Star break.
	   The loss was the seventh straight for Minnesota, its longest
slump of the season. The Twins slipped a season-worst 12 games

	   Minnesota's Paul Molitor went 5-for-5 _ his sixth career
five-hit game _ and stole his 500th career base, making him the
fifth player in major league history with at least 3,000 hits and
500 steals.
	   Rookie Sidney Ponson (6-6) won his fifth straight decision.
 &UR; Red Sox 11, Rangers 1 &QC; 
	   In Arlington, Texas, Darren Bragg was 4-for-6 with two homers
and Tim Wakefield pitched eight strong innings as Boston snapped
Texas' six-game winning streak.
	   Wakefield (14-5) allowed one run on seven hits, struck out three
and walked two for his eighth victory in last 11 starts.
	   Bragg led off the first and eighth innings with home runs for
his first career multi-homer game. The outfielder also had a career
high with four runs and matched his career high for hits. He has
eight homers this year.
	   Rangers starter Aaron Sele (13-9) allowed seven earned runs on
10 hits in four innings to lose to his former club for the second
time in three starts this year.
	   Mo Vaughn, Nomar Garciaparra and Mike Stanley each had three
hits for Boston. Stanley also drove in three runs.

winning run as the Houston scored twice in the ninth to beat
Philadelphia.
	   Bill Spiers led off the inning with a double off Leiter (6-3)
and Derek Bell followed with a single. Jeff Bagwell hit a grounder
to third, but Rolen threw past catcher Bobby Estalella for an
error, allowing Spiers to score and putting runners at second and
third.

Hidalgo in the right leg to give the Astros their 18th win in their
final at-bat.
	   Estalella went 3-for-4 with two homers and three RBIs. His solo
shot off winner Doug Henry (8-2) leading off the ninth put the
Phillies up 6-5.
