<HEADLINE> Aceh Rebel Leader Assassinated  </HEADLINE>
By RANJAN ROY
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- An Indonesian rebel leader living
in exile in Malaysia was assassinated in a restaurant, press
reports and rebel sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The execution-style shooting of Teuku Don Zulfahri, secretary
general of the Free Aceh Movement, or GAM, came hours before a
landmark cease-fire agreement between Aceh separatists and
Indonesian troops was to take effect.
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented agreement is designed to break a cycle of
violence that has raged for more than 25 years in Aceh province,
1,100 miles northwest of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   The motive for the killing was not immediately clear, but a
spokesman for the rebels in Aceh accused the Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   ''Teuku Don Zulfahri used to also work for Indonesian
intelligence and the military and then about five days ago he went
on Malaysian television voicing his support for the cease-fire in
Aceh,'' said Free Aceh Movement spokesman Ismail Syahputra. ''This
really upset the military, so they killed him.''
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said the killing was a violation of the
cease-fire. ''The international community must investigate this and
find out who killed him. Malaysian police must investigate this
properly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Malaysian national news agency reported the killing, but did
not identify Teuku Don by name. It quoted police sources as saying
that a 40-year-old Indonesian man was fatally shot late Thursday at
a restaurant in Kuala Lumpur's Ampang suburb.
</P>
<P>
   The man was shot twice -- once in the back of the head and once
in the left arm -- while having a drink with three friends. The
gunman, who was wearing a gray helmet, fled through the back door
of the restaurant after the shooting, the Bernama news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Police have not made any statement about the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Teuku Don's body was still in the morgue at
Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Hospital. A few friends and
relatives were present, but no funeral plans were announced.
</P>
<P>
   The Aceh newspaper Serambi said in its Friday edition that Teuku
Don's widow, Puteri Mei Abdullah had made an appeal to the people
of Aceh for help. She told the newspaper by telephone that she did
not know what the killer's motive could have been.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is sad that he had to die before he could witness the
implementation of the truce,'' she told the Serambi newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Teuku Don was a supporter of the three-month cease-fire
agreement, signed in Geneva, Switzerland, on May 12. It went into
effect midnight Thursday. Since it was signed, 32 people, including
two soldiers and two police officers, have been killed in clashes.

<HEADLINE> Entertainer Bob Hope Hospitalized  </HEADLINE>
By BART JONES
<TEXT>
<P>
   RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (AP) -- Entertainer Bob Hope was
hospitalized in critical but stable condition Thursday for
gastrointestinal bleeding, a condition his doctor said is common in
elderly people and not life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The 97-year old entertainer was given blood transfusions before
the bleeding was stabilized, Dr. Gary Annunziata told reporters
outside Eisenhower Regional Medical Center, where Hope was in the
critical-care ward.
</P>
<P>
   ''For his age, he is in very, very good shape and has done very,
very well,'' Annunziata said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the condition is not life-threatening and doctors expect
Hope to make a full recovery. He gave the comedian's condition as
''critical but very stable.''
</P>
<P>
   Hope was hospitalized Thursday morning after he woke up with
stomach pains. He is expected to remain in the hospital for a week,
spending perhaps another day in the critical-care section.
</P>
<P>
   The lengthy stay is anticipated because of Hope's age,
Annunziata said.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Dolores, and his daughter Linda were with him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both Mrs. Hope and daughter Linda are very optimistic and ask
that everyone simply keep Bob in their prayers,'' said hospital
spokeswoman Lea Goodsell.
</P>
<P>
   Hope had returned home to nearby Palm Springs on Tuesday after a
trip east to open the Bob Hope Gallery of the Library of Congress.
The comedian, who meticulously filed jokes he told over the years,
donated them and $3.5 million to the exhibit. He also visited a
friend in Maryland, where he went fishing and celebrated his 97th
birthday Monday, his spokesman Ward Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   Hope, master of the one-liner, starred in vaudeville, radio, TV
and film, most notably a string of ''Road'' movies with Bing
Crosby. From World War II to the Gulf War, he took his show to
military bases around the world to boost the morale of soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhower Medical Center is located on 80 acres of land donated
by the entertainer, about 120 miles east of Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) -- Pastor Tyrone Allen's soft
Southern accent rises from a whispered exhortation to a dramatic
crescendo that makes the conference room reverberate with the words
of the living Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ''Touch your neighbor and say, 'I'm in the Lord for life,'''
Allen commands. The assembled U.S. and local Pentecostals touch
hands, fingers and shoulders and murmur amens and hallelujahs.
</P>
<P>
   The words could come from any Christian church or revival tent
in America's Bible Belt. But Pastor Allen, from Virginia Beach,
Va., is preaching in a plush hall of the Trinidad Hilton, part of a
Pentecostal campaign that worries Hindu leaders in the Caribbean
island.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelical Christian churches are sprouting across Trinidad --
and Hindu leaders are starting to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told our people to throw these people out of the villages,''
said Sat Maharaj, head of the Hindu organization Sanatan Dharma
Maha Sabha. ''We launched a counter-campaign'' that includes
literature pointing out alleged inconsistencies in the Bible and
what Maharaj calls its undue focus on material possessions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in the soul-saving business,'' retorts Allen, whose
Bible Way Church held a recent annual conference here. ''We have a
purpose and this purpose is to give out our knowledge of the Lord.
He commanded us to make disciples and that's what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hindus chafe especially at visits by American evangelicals like
Benny Hinn, who came last year and spoke of Trinidad as a ''country
full of devils and demons.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition touches on the delicate balance between
Trinidad's East Indian and African descended communities, each
comprising almost half of the population of 1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   East Indians -- mostly descendants of laborers imported by
British colonizers in the 19th century -- were once overwhelmingly
Hindu, and some Muslim. But Christian churches have made steady
headway in recent decades and now can claim perhaps one-third of
the East Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, census figures show that Hindus now account for
only one-quarter of the Trinidadian population; some 30 percent of
Trinidadians are Catholics, 11 percent Anglican and 6 percent
Muslims, with the others including Pentecostals, Seventh-day
Adventists, Moravians, and Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   Pentecostals say many Hindus need little convincing.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're in an organization that does not satisfy your needs,
I see nothing wrong with moving,'' said the Rev. Peter Hosein, a
Trinidadian who says he's a Christian of no denomination trying to
start his own church. ''It's not stealing. You're just moving to
higher ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Winston Cuffie says Hindus in poor, rural areas may find
some Pentecostal churches attractive because they look affluent.
</P>
<P>
   Cuffie's Miracle Ministry is housed in his Christ Castle Church
in Chaguanas, in central Trinidad. Built from donations and
fund-raisers, the $1.8 million complex arises, magnificently pink,
like a castle from its modest surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Material success is part of it,'' said Cuffie, whose
congregation of 1,600 includes many converts from Hinduism and
offers investment seminars and other financial strategies. ''If
you're in poverty and you're suffering, we teach you how you can
come out of that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside his church are royal purple altar chairs with gold frames
imported from Iran, six chandeliers and a pulpit that features a
rainbow of bright mirrors lit by multicolored lights. Cuffie
himself wears an electric blue suit and bright yellow handkerchief.
</P>
<P>
   Many Hindus say they are mobilizing to stop the conversions -- if
only to maintain a centuries-old tradition on the island.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is, in fact, a religious war, not in the sense of Muslims
and Christians fighting a bloody war, but it is a war,'' said Kamla
Persad, a Hindu activist and newspaper columnist. ''No Hindu
organization over the years had a program to match the Christians.
Now we are going out and trying to reconvert our people. The Hindus
are waking up to that.''

<HEADLINE> 2nd Man Dies After Pool Hall Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A second man died Thursday of injuries caused
by a sport utility vehicle that plowed into a crowded pool hall
near the UCLA campus on Wednesday. The 39-year-old driver remained
in critical condition with self-inflicted wounds from trying to
slit his throat with a piece of glass after the crash, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives had not determined whether Wednesday's collision was
accidental or deliberate, Officer Dan Kemble said Thursday. He said
a preliminary evaluation indicated the driver was not under the
influence of drugs or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Noah Baum, 34, of West Hollywood, was killed when the vehicle
jumped a curb and smashed into the front section of Q's Billiard
Club, coming to rest inside the front bar in a hail of shattered
glass and splintered wood. A 26-year-old man hit during the crash
died Thursday at UCLA Medical Center, hospital spokesman Alan
Eyerly said. His name was not released.

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- U.N. peacekeepers will not be dragged into an

Leoneans, terrified of a possible rebel attack on the capital, Freetown, have

unanimous ruling from a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of

Court. Family lawyer Kendall Coffey said he hadn't decided on a course of

defense system. Washington's proposal to build the system -- a scaled-down
version of the shield against incoming ballistic missiles once championed by
President Reagan in the 1980s -- represents for many Germans the most serious

<HEADLINE> Fire-safe cigarette issue reignited in Legislature  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A week after Gov. George Pataki vetoed a
bill mandating so-called fire-safe cigarettes, a new bill is
circulating that would require manufacturers to certify that the
new cigarettes are no more toxic than traditional ones.
</P>
<P>
   While the new bill would give cigarette makers until mid-2003 to
comply, anti-smoking groups said Thursday that the industry already
knows how to provide a cigarette less likely to start fires without
making it more dangerous to smokers' health.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of increased toxicity was an objection Pataki
raised in vetoing the bill. It would have made New York the first
state in the nation to require cigarettes that have extra bands of
paper to self-extinguish.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such technology can greatly reduce the incidence of
cigarette-caused fires without increasing the risk of cancer, lung
and heart disease in smokers,'' said a letter signed by the
American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association, the League
of Women Voters, New York Public Interest Research Group and other
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for a Tobacco Free New York on Thursday announced it
had a document ascribed to Philip Morris which concluded that
fire-safe cigarettes the tobacco company was working on would be no
more toxic than traditional ones.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would seem to indicate with these tests Philip Morris has
solved the problem which the governor raised in his veto message,''
said Russell Sciandra, of the Center for a Tobacco Free New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''Results of smoke chemistry analysis, cytotoxity testing,
genotoxicity testing, and inhalation revealed only minor,
inconsistent changes,'' the document said. Philip Morris officials
later confirmed they presented the report at a scientific
conference in March.
</P>
<P>
   The group acknowledged that the document was only further
evidence of what company officials already said about initial tests
-- that cigarettes with an experimental paper did not present added
health risks to humans. The document was used mainly to counter
Pataki's argument.
</P>
<P>
   The previous bill would have required fire-safe cigarettes to be
sold in New York in April 2002. The new bill from Assemblyman
Alexander Grannis, a Manhattan Democrat, pushes that back to
mid-2003.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor's suggestions are ones we agree with,'' said Sen.
Frank Padavan, a Queens Republican, who said he will introduce the
same bill as Grannis. ''We will include them in the new bill and
pass it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki also cited potential illegal sales of traditional
cigarettes as a reason for his veto. Grannis' office and Padavan
said separate bills in both houses of the Legislature would deal
with bootlegging concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Fuschillo has offered a bill to ban Internet sales
of tobacco and increase bootlegging penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is ''definitely interested'' in Grannis' legislation,
said spokeswoman Suzanne Morris. He is ''committed to having a bill
and passing it this session and he's hopeful that's going to
happen,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> More fourth graders passing tougher English test  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- More New York fourth grade pupils are
meeting the minimum scores in the state's tougher English test,
state Education Commissioner Richard Mills says.
</P>
<P>
   When the tests were first administered last year, 52 percent
failed while only 48 percent met all the standards. This year,
nearly 60 percent of New York's fourth graders met the minimum
scores in the state's tougher English test.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, 41 percent of 216,649 pupils who took the test in
January failed to achieve the standards. In the state's five
largest cities, more than half the pupils either ''need extra help
to meet the standards'' or have ''serious academic deficiencies,''
the test results showed.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said he was ''very encouraged'' by the ''big jump'' in the
percentage of pupils who met the English standards.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been an improvement across the board,'' Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of pupils in the Level 1 range -- the lowest
possible out of four levels -- dropped by just 1 percentage point to
10 percent. Fourth graders in this category had scores between 455
and 602 out of a possible 800 points.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen percent of the fourth graders scored between 692 and a
perfect score of 800, which means they exceeded the English
standards. Last year only 5 percent of the pupils achieved scores
in that range. In both 1999 and 2000, 43 percent of pupils met the
standards, scoring between 645 and 691.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of pupils who scored between 603 and 644, meaning
they need extra help to meet the standards, dropped from 41 percent
to 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, 42 percent of the pupils met the standards,
compared to 33 percent last year. However, 58 percent were still
below standards. Combined figures for the next four largest cities
-- Buffalo, Syracuse, Rochester and Yonkers -- showed that 39 percent
of pupils met the standards, up 10 points from last year's 29
percent. But 61 percent still failed to meet all the standards.
</P>
<P>
   Mills acknowledged that there are ''large gaps'' between the
big-city figures and the statewide averages.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's still not yet enough. There are still gaps that need to
be closed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He singled out Yonkers as a district that has put in significant
effort to improve student performance. Fifty-three percent of
fourth graders in Yonkers passed the test, up from 33 percent in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have a very, very focused effort ... and the instruction
is very purposefully aligned with the standards,'' Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth grade tests are part of the state Board of Regent's
effort to raise the education standard of New York schools. Pupils
do not have to score at a certain level in order to advance to the
fifth grade. However, pupils who performed at the Level 1 category
would be required to take some kind of assessment test in the fifth
grade. Fourth graders who are retained will have to retake the
English test next year.
</P>
<P>
   Schools will get individual student reports on each of the
fourth graders who took the test, and Mills said the data should
serve as a guide for teachers on how to help pupils improve.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said schools should also keep motivating pupils who have
achieved the standards and provide additional help for those who
need it. Help could mean extra time in class, before or after
school or summer school, and pupils who were at the bottom should
also get ''significant intervention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Kremer, the executive director of the state School Boards
Association, agreed that pupils in Level 1 should get the most
help. Noting that there was just a one percentage-point difference
between 1999 and 2000 results in this category, Kremer said:
''That's going to be a tough group that we're going to need to
concentrate our resources and efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonia Cortese, vice president of the New York State United
Teachers, said the overall improvement among fourth graders
promises an ''up trend.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Ultimately what we have to do is make sure that it isn't just
seen as a fourth grade test. This is an accumulation of what kids
learn kindergarten through grade four ... the skills are not
compressed into a short fourth grade time period,'' Cortese said.

<HEADLINE> Spitzer: Family Dollar will adopt uniform check policy  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A discount merchandise chain has agreed to
adopt a uniform personal check policy in all its stores in New
York, state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer says.
</P>
<P>
   Family Dollar Stores Inc., based in Charlotte, N.C., Thursday
signed a consent decree with Spitzer, promising to accept checks
from all individuals and follow a single set of requirements in all
130 of its New York outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said Family Dollar Stores usually accept personal checks
that are preprinted with the customer's name and address, along
with proper identification, for purchases $150 or less. But some of
its stores in inner-city neighborhoods with large minority
populations refused to accept checks even when customers met the
requirements, he charged.
</P>
<P>
   This practice has been going on for ''at least a couple of
years'' and violated federal and state civil rights laws, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It harmed minority individuals and it fostered prejudice,''
Spitzer said. ''Our consent judgment ... ensures that minority
citizens receive full and fair accommodations in all aspects of our
state's economy.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the investigation stemmed from a customer complaint in
one of Family Dollar's store in Buffalo. His office had petitioned
to a state Supreme Court justice, seeking penalties from Family
Dollar Stores and the chain's immediate enactment of a statewide
policy on accepting personal checks.
</P>
<P>
   George Mahoney, executive vice president of Family Dollar
Stores, denied claims that some stores had selectively refused to
accept check payments. He said a ''limited number'' of stores in
New York had a no-checks policy ''to keep our costs down.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our experience with bad checks at a limited number of stores
caused us not to accept checks at those stores,'' Mahoney said.
''There's nothing wrong in making that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the consent decree, Family Dollar Stores agreed to
maintain a uniform policy for one year. After that time, the
company must notify the attorney general if any one of its stores
deviates from the policy. Then the attorney general would have the
power to conduct an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The store chain did not admit any wrongdoing in reaching the
deal with agreement with the state.

<HEADLINE> A government critic bowing out of litigating -- mostly  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Robert Schulz was clearly not himself.
</P>
<P>
   The critic of government borrowing and gimmick financing read
through the five-page court ruling in silence punctuated by deep
sighs. An appeals court panel in Albany had just dismissed his
latest court challenge unanimously, rejecting every substantive
point he raised weeks earlier in person, acknowledging no merit in
Schulz' arguments.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter wanted to know what he thought.
</P>
<P>
   ''No comment,'' Schulz said, discarding the ruling, his face now
an angry crimson hue.
</P>
<P>
   No comment?
</P>
<P>
   ''No comment,'' he repeated and walked away.
</P>
<P>
   The one comment people would never expect from Schulz is no
comment.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a quarter century he has always seemed to have
something to say, if only to sputter at government actions he found
brazen and unconstitutional or to attempt to explain, in often
excruciating detail, how courts erred in failing to uphold his
legal challenges to those governmental misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   But no comment?
</P>
<P>
   The next week, Schulz explained that that court ruling and other
recent events in his life -- chiefly the arrival of his 60th
birthday -- have dictated changes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a wake up call,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz said he is going to stop filing and arguing so many cases
-- ''I am not taking on any new cases. Well, I am resisting.'' -- and
begin to build an organization based in Albany to challenge
improper government actions throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wants to remake the existing ''We The People
Foundation for Constitutional Education'' by staffing it with
bright, young lawyers willing to challenge misappropriations and
other questionable state and local government actions in court.
</P>
<P>
   He is trying to line up 25,000 people who will pledge $10 a
month for the next three years to generate adequate funding for the
foundation, $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz is also creating what he calls ''Tyranny Response Teams''
of sympathizers to attend meetings of local and state government
agencies to identify bad or illegal policies, try to stop them and
to warn elected officials ''it may be necessary'' to bring legal
action if they do not desist.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to dismiss Schulz as a gadfly, the kind of
annoying but ineffectual critic buzzing around every city hall and
state capitol, except for this: he has channeled his grievances
into more than 100 court cases. Most have ultimately lost, but they
include two he argued successfully before the state's highest
tribunal, the Court of Appeals, two of the six times he has
appeared before that court.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz, who lives near Glens Falls in Warren County, is not a
lawyer and said he has never taken a class on the law in his life.
</P>
<P>
   Among the nefarious governmental deeds that have prompted Schulz
suits: the use of publicly funded materials by state Comptroller H.
Carl McCall to advocate for passage of a state constitutional
amendment in 1995 restricting borrowing practices; the legality of
the New York City Transitional Finance Authority and of members of
the Court of Appeals to hear the case because many personally hold
tax-free municipal bonds; Gov. George Pataki's giveaway of free ski
lift tickets or State Fair passes to volunteers who provided
emergency services during the ice storm of 1998 in northern New
York.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest setback in the ice storm case which prompted
Schulz's uncharacteristic ''no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   He won before the Court of Appeals in cases invalidating a sewer
bonding initiative in Warren County in the late 1970s and former
Gov. Mario Cuomo's attempt to charge taxpayers with the cost of
printing pro-Bill Clinton pamphlets for distribution in New York
City in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz said he believes judges know he was right in scores of
other cases, but that they ruled against him to avoid the chaos of
undoing governmental actions or because judges had personal
conflicts of interest which prevented them from rendering unbiased
rulings.
</P>
<P>
   He is, in fact, darkly suspicious of government at all levels.
He believes that unless checked, government will seek as much power
over citizens and their tax money as it can.
</P>
<P>
   He enumerates a litany of what he calls modern government
''tyrannies'' -- the tyranny of ''corporate welfare,'' the tyranny
of the late state budget, the tyranny of state debt without voter
approval, etc. -- which have also become standard operating
procedure in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz, an engineer by training, ran as Libertarian Party
candidate for governor in 1994. He said he does not find his court
work remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can read and comprehend,'' he said. Of all non-lawyers,
Schulz said engineers have the best grasp of the law ''because
things have to add up. They're used to reading and they're used to
studying. Underneath it all, things have to add up and they just
don't add up.''
</P>
<P>
   Things might ''add up'' better, Schulz said, if young people in
New York are taught about the protections they are accorded under
the state constitution. It is, in fact, a requirement under law
that the constitution be taught each year to all older school
children. It is another tyranny that the requirement is ignored,
Schulz said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is not surprising,'' he said. ''It is in the natural
order of things for government to seek to expand its size, scope,
cost and it is also in the natural order not to teach them about
popular sovereignty.''

<HEADLINE> Onondaga merchant must pay $4.75 million for gas spill cleanup  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) --A former Onondaga Nation merchant will pay
a hefty price for refusing to clean up a massive underground
gasoline spill at his reservation gas station.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Norman Mordue ruled that Oliver
Hill was liable for a $4,746,500 penalty for defying the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency's 1995 cleanup order.
</P>
<P>
   The fine was based on a recommendation by U.S. Magistrate
Gustave DiBianco following a short trial in January. It is the
largest ever imposed for violation of an EPA cleanup order, said
EPA Regional Administrator Jeanne M. Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators blamed Hill for 10,000 gallons of gasoline
that leaked from underground tanks at his gas station on the
reservation just south of Syracuse. The spill contaminated three
private drinking wells as it spread into a local aquifer.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government sued Hill after he refused to clean up
the gasoline spill. Hill operated the gas station and adjoining
grocery store for nearly a decade before he was banished from the
reservation in 1994 for failing to pay a tax to the Onondaga Nation
on cigarette sales.
</P>
<P>
   The station was closed in 1993 but Hill never removed
underground storage tanks from the property, siphoned gasoline from
the tanks or inspected the underground pipes connecting the tanks
to the gas pumps. The leak was discovered in October 1994 when a
resident living near the gas station reported a strong odor of
gasoline coming from a well he was digging on his property.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Hill's actions amounted to a depraved indifference to the
safety of adjacent residents of the community,'' said U.S. Attorney
Daniel J. French.
</P>
<P>
   The January trial showed Hill had ample resources to pay the
penalty and French said authorities would make every effort to
collect it.
</P>
<P>
   Fox called Hill's indifference to the EPA's cleanup order -- and
to the harm his negligence posed to the environment and to the
health of residents -- ''shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He totally failed to comply with EPA's order to clean up the
mess he caused, and for that, he will pay a very hefty price,'' she
said, justifying the magnitude of the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Clean up of the site, which began in 1994, remains ongoing, said
Joseph Heath, an attorney representing the Onondaga Nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are still thousands of gallons of product in the ground.
It's a problem that's not going to go away for a long time,'' Heath
said.
</P>
<P>
   EPA and state Department of Environmental Conservation have
spent approximately $1.6 million on remedial efforts so far.
Initial tests of groundwater in the area revealed levels of harmful
contaminants -- such as toluene, xylene and ethyl benzene -- at
concentrations 10,000 times greater than allowed in drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials asked Hill to assume the costs of the
cleanup but he denied responsibility for the release. Hill, who
defended himself in the case, could not be located for comment.

<HEADLINE> Belfour, Stars Feeling Better  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Ed Belfour didn't feel like he had
anything to prove, he just needed to feel better.
</P>
<P>
   He did Thursday night as the Dallas Stars beat the New Jersey
Devils 2-1 to even the best-of-seven Stanley Cup finals 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   The series shifts to Dallas for the next two games, Saturday and
Monday, before returning to New Jersey for Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour allowed six goals on only 18 shots in the opener two
nights earlier while fighting a cold with medication, but rebounded
with a 27-save effort to atone for the 7-3 defeat. Brett Hull
scored both Dallas goals to make sure Belfour's performance was not
wasted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know I didn't feel good after the first game,'' he said. ''I
just tried to forget about it and get ready for tonight. Just
prepare the same way and go out there and try and do my best.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt a lot stronger and I was seeing the puck well. I
definitely felt a lot more back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   The only questions Belfour, 9-0 after Dallas losses, had to
answer about his first-game performance were from reporters and not
from his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think a lot of people have made a big deal of this,'' coach
Ken Hitchcock said. ''I think that anybody that knows what it's
like to play goal understands that if you don't have energy and you
are a step late, you are going to get scored on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars dropped the opener of the finals for the second
straight year only to even the series in the next game.
</P>
<P>
   History is much more in the Stars' favor, with Game 2 winners
winning the title in 25 of the last 28 years. There have only been
three teams to win after falling behind 2-0 since the finals went
to a best-of-seven in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   ''To come out even, I think it gives everybody in our room a big
boost in the arm,'' Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   The defending Stanley Cup champions now have the home-ice
advantage they held for 11 straight series prior to the finals. The
Stars are 9-1 in these playoffs at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to go home and get ready for Game 3 with the same
attitude and the same team effort,'' Belfour said. ''It is
definitely going to be a real competitive game and they're going to
be a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull scored once in the first period and again with only 4:16
left -- snapping a 1-1 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour kept the Devils at bay for the final 47:18 of the game --
including several key stops in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Devils forward Claude Lemieux, a renowned playoff star, was
denied on a shot and rebound in close midway through the period and
New Jersey checker Randy McKay couldn't convert on two occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Nemchinov got a pass over to McKay in the opening three
minutes of the third, but Belfour was able to slide over and keep
the puck out with his stick. Just over four minutes later, McKay
found himself open in the slot, only to be turned away when his
shot, ticketed for between Belfour's pass, didn't get through fast
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' top line of Hull, Mike Modano and Jere Lehtinen was held
to just one point, an assist by Lehtinen, in the opening loss. The
trio has scored 26 of the Stars' 48 playoff goals this year.
</P>
<P>
   The line also managed to shut down New Jersey's top line of
Patrik Elias, Jason Arnott and Petr Sykora, which had 11 points in
the opener.
</P>
<P>
   Hull's first goal was set up by Modano and defenseman Richard
Matvichuk. His second came when he chopped down a fanned shot by
Lehtinen, deflecting it past Martin Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars looked better as a whole, picking up their physical
play to counteract the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said before the series that the Stars would not sit
back and absorb punishment from tough defenseman Scott Stevens and
the rest of the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   With only 4:10 gone in the game, Mike Keane met Devils forward
Jay Pandolfo with a check between the teams' benches. Keane sent
Pandolfo into the glass, shattering it onto the carpet leading to
the dressing rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars didn't let up.
</P>
<P>
   A little over a minute before Hull's game-winner, Dave Manson
leveled Lemieux at neutral ice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that all falls into the same category of us being
ready to play,'' captain Derian Hatcher said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were embarrassed after Game 1. Now the goalie and the
rest of the team feel a whole lot better.

<HEADLINE> Devils Frustrated With Home Split  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- It wasn't the late goal by Brett
Hull or the play of Ed Belfour in goal that left the New Jersey
Devils frustrated after Game 2 of the Stanley Cup finals on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was all the missed opportunities in a 2-1 loss to the Dallas
Stars that evened the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey outshot the Stars 28-17, had the better scoring
chances and even a late power play, but it wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''The disappointing part of this game was it was certainly there
for us,'' defenseman Ken Daneyko said. ''We knew they would play a
little bit better, but they didn't do anything at all unusual or
anything all that spectacular like they were talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew they were a smart team and they capitalized on their
chances,'' Daneyko said. ''It's more disappointing in the fact it
was certainly there for us. We could be up 2-0. Now we have to go
on the road and try to get a win.''
</P>
<P>
   No one in the Devils' locker room was more frustrated than
forward Randy McKay.
</P>
<P>
   Scoreless in 19 playoffs games this season. he had three great
chances to break the 1-1 tie in the second and third periods and
couldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right I'm just snake bit,'' said McKay, one of the heroes of
the Devils' cup championship team in 1995. ''I could have made it a
different game. Right now I have to keep going, sooner or later one
of them is going to go in for me.''
</P>
<P>
   McKay had a chance in close in the second period and mouthed an
obscenity when it was stopped by Belfour, who allowed six goals on
18 shots in Game 1, an impressive 7-3 win by the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't have much room on that one,'' McKay said.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the third, he missed on a close-range deflection
attempt. With 13:20 to play, he failed to convert from 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had time in front on that one and I thought I would let it
go quick and surprise him,'' McKay said. ''I didn't quite get it up
where I wanted to. In hindsight, maybe I should have taken my
time.''
</P>
<P>
   When the shots aren't going you get those second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Claude Lemieux also had a couple of great chances, one on a
backhander in close in the opening minute of the third period and
another on a 25-foot shot.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Arnott and Petr Sykora, who both scored two goals in Game
1, also had chances on a power play with less than nine minutes to
play, but Belfour stopped them.
</P>
<P>
   ''He played better than the last game obviously,'' Devils center
Bobby Holik said. ''We just didn't put enough pressure on him. We
had some opportunities and he made some good saves but I don't
think he was tested enough by us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull's game-winner, his second of the game, came after a Devils
turnover with 4:16 to play in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Modano pushed the puck around defenseman Brian Rafalski and
Hull redirected Jere Lehtinen's fluttering shot past goaltender
Martin Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   ''They came down and a lucky bounce went through (Rafalski's
leg),'' Brodeur said. ''Lehtinen kind of backhanded it real soft
and I went to grab it and Brett Hull was cutting through the middle
and hit it out of mid-air.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils never got off a good shot after the Stars went ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's the end of the world,'' Devils coach Larry
Robinson said. ''It's the same. I don't think it's time to panic or
anything like that. We certainly knew we didn't play very well and
we have to play a lot better in that building.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Premier Dissolves Parliament  </HEADLINE>
By MARI YAMAGUCHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori dissolved the lower
house of Parliament on Friday, paving the way for national
elections later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Support for Mori has plummeted since his remark last month that
Japan is a ''divine nation'' centered on the emperor -- suggesting
to many the kind of nationalistic rhetoric used by politicians
before World War II.
</P>
<P>
   But while recent polls suggest his administration is the least
popular to face an election since the end of the war, his Liberal
Democrats were not expected to lose their position as the country's
ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   At stake in the elections are 480 seats in the lower house, the
more powerful of Japan's two-chamber Parliament. The Liberal
Democrats hold 267 of the current 500 seats, and with their two
coalition partners control 336, a comfortable majority.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Mori's sagging support, LDP leaders have said they hope
to win at least 229 seats in the reconfigured chamber. Though
considered a fairly easy goal, failure to attain that level could
force Mori to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the controversy over the divine nation comments, Mori
has been dogged by scandals over the way his administration covered
up the gravity of the condition of his predecessor, Keizo Obuchi,
who fell into a coma in early April. Obuchi died May 14.
</P>
<P>
   Mori, who assumed office soon after Obuchi's collapse, has also
faced reports he was caught in a raid on a brothel while still a
college student and that in 1995 he attended a wedding reception
where one of the guests was a leading gangster.
</P>
<P>
   He has denied the brothel allegations and said he was unaware of
the gangster's attendance at the reception.
</P>
<P>
   By dissolving the lower house, Mori effectively shelved a
no-confidence motion posed by the opposition parties, which argued
he has proven himself unfit to lead the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The motion was largely ceremonial -- the Liberal Democrats and
their two coalition partners have easily enough votes in Parliament
to have defeated it.
</P>
<P>
   Yukio Hatoyama, head of the Democratic Party, Japan's largest
opposition group, said that ruling party leaders were hoping the
dissolution of Parliament would pull voter attention away from the
scandals.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are just trying to hide,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders from around the world, including President Clinton, are
to attend a state funeral for Obuchi on June 8, and the date Mori
has chosen for the election, June 25, would have been Obuchi's 63rd
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns that an untested opposition can't be trusted to nurture
Japan's fledgling economic recovery could also outweigh concerns
over Mori's outspokenness. The Liberal Democrats have been in
control throughout most of the postwar era.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the controversies surrounding Mori are expected to take a
bite out of a sizable sympathy vote experts had predicted for the
LDP.
</P>
<P>
   ''Support for the Mori administration has plunged across the
board since his 'divine nation' remarks,'' said an editorial Friday
in the Mainichi, a major newspaper. ''The comments threw doubt on
his fitness to lead, and the public has reacted to that.''

<HEADLINE> Stars 2, Devils 1  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- In the Stanley Cup playoffs,
everything comes up golden if your last name is Hull.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull, one of the greatest clutch scorers in Stanley Cup
history, scored two goals Thursday night -- the second with 4:16 to
play -- and the Dallas Stars rebounded from one of their worst
playoff losses ever to beat the New Jersey Devils 2-1 in Game 2 of
the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Goaltender Ed Belfour, pulled after allowing six goals in an
admittedly embarrassing 7-3 loss in Game 1, bounced back to turn
aside 27 of 28 shots and give the Stars the road split they were
fearful they wouldn't get after Tuesday's dismal game.
</P>
<P>
   ''To come out even after that first game is a big boost to us,''
Hull said. ''We knew we had to play a great game to come away with
a split.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull won the Stanley Cup for the Stars last season, with his
much-disputed in-the-crease goal in the third overtime of Game 6 in
Buffalo. This time, he may have saved the Stars from losing the
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   It also helped that the Stars tightened up defensively and got
an exceptional game from Belfour, who has won his last nine playoff
games following a loss.
</P>
<P>
   The game-winner came after nearly two scoreless periods. Mike
Modano pushed the puck between the legs of Devils rookie defenseman
Brian Rafalski to Jere Lehtinen, who fanned on a shot as he skated
to the left of the net.
</P>
<P>
   But the puck floated directly to the player known as the
''Golden Brett,'' who chopped it down and past Martin Brodeur for
his 11th goal of the playoffs and 88th of his career. It was his
15th career multi-goal playoff game, one more than his famous
father Bobby Hull, known as the ''Golden Jet.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What's his name, Lehtinen, he got a backhand and he kind of
missed it,'' Brodeur said. ''I went to grab it with my glove and
Hull just came along and batted it out of the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull's fifth goal in his last four playoff games also was his
21st career game-winner in the playoffs, three short of
record-holder Wayne Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just went to the net and threw my stick out there, and I
didn't know that it went in until Mike raised his arms,'' Hull
said.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Devils coach Larry Robinson complained Lehtinen was
''four feet offside'' on the play, but said, ''That's not why we
lost. We didn't play our best game; they didn't play their best
game (in Game 1). Now, it's 1-1.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what pains the Devils the most -- the missed opportunity,
and, of course, all the missed shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''The disappointing part of this game for us is it was certainly
there for us,'' Devils defenseman Ken Daneyko said. ''We knew they
were going to play better, but they didn't do anything unusual or
spectacular like they were talking about. We could be up 2-0 and
we're not, and that hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars now have one huge statistical edge on their side going
back to Dallas, where they have won 11 of their last 12 home
playoff games: the team winning Game 2 has won 25 of the last 28
Stanley Cups.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars also were 1-1 after Game 2 last year against Buffalo,
and went on to win four of the next five to win their first Stanley
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came out of here with the split, and I think we're
fortunate after the first game,'' Belfour said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, 4-0 in Game 2s in these playoffs, also got their
first lead of the series from a familiar source -- yes, Brett Hull.
</P>
<P>
   Hull put a hard wrist shot over Brodeur's glove that hit off the
crossbar and fell across the goal line at 4:25 of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Modano also set up the goal, forcing a turnover from Rafalski --
sound familiar? -- along the boards 15 seconds after play resumed
following a six-minute delay to fix some broken glass.
</P>
<P>
   Hull has nearly half as many goals in the playoffs as he had all
season, when his 24 goals were a full-season career low.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it did in Game 1, the first period ended 1-1 as
Alexander Mogilny answered for the Devils at 12:42, snapping a shot
from the edge of the left circle off Scott Gomez's pass from the
blue line. Gomez occupied three Stars in the neutral zone, allowing
Mogilny to get a step on the defense.
</P>
<P>
   It was a first for a Stanley Cup final -- one of the first stars
to defect to the NHL from the former Soviet Union hockey dynasty
being set up for a goal by the league's first Hispanic player.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Stars played just as they promised to after a Game 1
in which Belfour looked dazed and confused from cold medicine he
was taking, allowing six goals on 18 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt a lot stronger. I was seeing the puck really well, and
felt I was a lot more back on track,'' Belfour said. ''And I stayed
away from the cold medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour was on his game in Game 2, thrice turning aside Randy
McKay shots on the doorstep and, another time, halting Bobby Holik
at point-blank range.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were ripe for the taking tonight and we just didn't come
through enough to win it,'' McKay said.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour also held New Jersey's top line of Petr Sykora, Jason
Arnott and Patrik Elias scoreless after they produced four goals
and 11 points in Game 1. Dallas switched up and tried to match its
first line, led by Hull and Modano, against the Devils' top line.
</P>
<P>
   That Dallas top line, so silent in Game 1, generated nearly all
of the Stars' scoring chances, and made Hull's two goals stand up
behind Belfour's big night in goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We let the hype and the nervousness get to us, I guess, in
Game 1,'' Modano said. ''We felt embarrassed, It was more a pride
factor tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were well aware of the dangers of losing Game 2 and
falling down 2-0 to a New Jersey team that had won four straight
games, including the final three of the Eastern Conference finals
against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   After Game 1, Hull said the Stars took the attitude that, ''It's
a bad game. Let's go out and show 'em what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Only three teams since 1939 have rallied from a 2-0 deficit to
win the Stanley Cup: 1942 Toronto, 1966 Montreal and 1971 Montreal.
No team in 29 years has done it.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first loss in six games in Devils' Stanley Cup finals
history. They swept Detroit as a big underdog in 1995 -- the last
Stanley Cup won by an Eastern Conference champion -- and Game 1 of
this series.
</P>
<P>
   Game 3 will be Saturday night in Reunion Arena, with Game 4
there on Monday night.

Japan Premier Dissolves Parliament
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori on Friday declared the lower house
of Parliament be dissolved, paving the way for national elections later this
month. Support for Mori has plummeted since his remark last month that Japan is
a ''divine nation'' centered on the emperor -- suggesting to many the kind of
nationalistic rhetoric used by politicians before World War II. But while recent
polls suggest his administration is the least popular to face an election since
the end of the war, his Liberal Democrats were not expected to lose their
position as the country's ruling party.

Lyme Bacterium Needs No Iron

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The bacterium that causes Lyme disease has been identified
as the first disease-causing germ that does not need to take iron from the blood
stream of its host. Dr. Frank Gherardini of the University of Georgia said that
other bacteria that cause disease have evolved a strategy to scavage from the
blood of victims the iron that is essential to their survival. A report on the
study appears Friday in the journal Science. Lyme disease is caused by a microbe
that is spread to humans through a tick bite.

   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- An Indonesian rebel leader living in exile in
Malaysia was assassinated in a restaurant, press reports and rebel sources said
Friday. The execution-style shooting of Teuku Don Zulfahri, secretary general of
the Free Aceh Movement, or GAM, came hours before a landmark cease-fire
agreement between Aceh separatists and Indonesian troops was to take effect. The
unprecedented agreement is designed to break a cycle of violence that has raged
for more than 25 years in Aceh province, 1,100 miles northwest of Jakarta.

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- U.N. peacekeepers will not be dragged into an
offensive war in Sierra Leone despite signs the country's rebels are massing
ahead of a pullout of British troops, a U.N. official said Thursday. Many Sierra
Leoneans, terrified of a possible rebel attack on the capital, Freetown, have
pleaded for a strong military response by the international community. So far,
the U.N. peacekeeping mission, known as UNAMSIL, has used force infrequently,
and only when attacked.

Court Denies Asylum In Elian Case

   ATLANTA (AP) -- A federal appeals court sided with the government Thursday
and denied an asylum hearing for Elian Gonzalez -- a ruling that could send the
6-year-old shipwreck survivor back to Cuba with his father within weeks. The
unanimous ruling from a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals blocked Elian from leaving the country immediately and gave his Miami
relatives two weeks to appeal -- either to the full appeals court or the Supreme
Court. Family lawyer Kendall Coffey said he hadn't decided on a course of
action.

Clinton Warned On Missile Defense

   BERLIN (AP) -- Displaying a new sense of boldness in dealing with Germany's
staunchest postwar ally, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder warned President Clinton
on Thursday not to start another arms race with a proposed new national missile
defense system. Washington's proposal to build the system -- a scaled-down
version of the shield against incoming ballistic missiles once championed by
President Reagan in the 1980s -- represents for many Germans the most serious

Israelis and Palestinians have been engaging in name-calling and accusing each

<HEADLINE> 'Survivor' Has Strong First Ratings  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Regis, meet Susan, Richard, Rudy and the rest of
the castaways inhabiting a rat-infested tropical island who could
challenge your current reign as prime-time ratings king.
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor,'' CBS' high-profile summer reality series that
debuted Wednesday, managed to hold its own despite ABC's
last-minute decision to launch a programming bomb -- scheduling an
edition of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' as direct competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor,'' an endurance contest filmed on an island off
Borneo, drew an audience of 15.5 million people Wednesday,
according to Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   Viewership for Regis Philbin's quiz show was 16.8 million, the
lowest for an edition ''Millionaire'' since last November.
</P>
<P>
   More encouraging for CBS was that ''Survivor'' drew a younger
audience than any other show on the network's prime-time schedule
does regularly, beating ''Millionaire'' by 63 percent among viewers
aged 18-34.
</P>
<P>
   Young viewers are prized by advertisers and CBS, whose audience
has a median age of over 50, said the ''Survivor'' viewers had a
median age of 39.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a new audience for CBS and it's very exciting for us,''
said David Poltrack, CBS's top researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers saw something quite unlike anything that's been on
American network TV, even though ''Survivor'' is an adaptation of
an idea that's been successful overseas. The 16 castaways are
locked in a competition that, by the summer's 13th episode, will
result in one winner getting $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The contestants voted out the first of their colleagues in
Wednesday's episode. Sonja Christopher, a 63-year-old musician from
Walnut Creek, Calif., who stumbled and fell while carrying a raft
in a race, was sent home.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher, who brought a ukelele to the island and has written
a song about her experience, said on CBS's ''The Early Show'' that
she learned that ''I'm sort of naive.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I went there with certain ideas about how we might play this
as a team and, sportsmanship was important, having done sports in
the past. And I learned that not everybody thinks that way,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   There will be three contestants left by the final episode.
Christopher and others who were voted off the island will return to
determine who wins the prize.
</P>
<P>
   CBS, which already has scheduled a rerun of the first
''Survivor'' episode for Saturday night, said it hoped the audience
will build through word of mouth as the series goes on -- much like
it did for ''Millionaire'' last summer.
</P>
<P>
   One encouraging sign: researchers found the audience for
''Survivor'' grew Wednesday as the hour went on, which meant few
people gave up and switched the channel.
</P>
<P>
   CBS executives were miffed by ABC's decision to use
''Millionaire'' on Wednesday. ABC said it has no immediate plans to
schedule another edition of its game show opposite ''Survivor.''

<HEADLINE> Sabres Sign Peters, Milley  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres signed draft picks
Andrew Peters and Norman Milley just before Thursday's deadline,
but lost out on Western Hockey League MVP Brad Moran.
</P>
<P>
   Although disappointed in losing the rights to Moran, who now
becomes an unrestricted free agent, Sabres general manager Darcy
Regier was pleased with the additions of Peters and Milley, both
forwards that were selected in the second round of the 1998 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ''They add some ingredients that I think down the road will pay
off. It gives us additional depth and talent,'' Regier said. ''It
was something that fit into our salary structure with respect to
other signings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres had until midnight to sign players selected in the
1998 draft or lose their rights. Peters and Milley, had they not
signed, would have re-entered the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Moran will not re-enter the draft because he is 21. The Sabres
also relinquished the rights to two other '98 draft picks, center
Mike Pandolfo (selected 77th overall) and Edo Terglav (249th).
</P>
<P>
   Terms of Peters' and Milley's deals were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty in signing Moran came down to economics as well
as the fact that the Sabres had seen little progress in his
development during two stints at training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''Brad is an outstanding junior player. Hopefully, he can have a
good professional career,'' said Regier. ''Organizationally, it
comes down to choices. You can't always sign everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Selected 191st overall, Moran had a stellar junior career with
Calgary. He recorded three straight 100-plus point seasons, and led
the WHL with 120 points this past season. Moran had 161 goals and
340 points over 215 games in his last three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Art Breeze, Moran's Calgary-based agent, was upset.
</P>
<P>
   ''Never in my 15 years (as an agent) have I ever seen a player,
and especially one of Brad's elite status, treated with such
cavalier indifferent arrogance,'' Breeze said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the business of negotiating contracts, there's tough smart
and tough stupid. And the Sabres' attitude toward Brad takes
absurdity to a whole new depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Milley, selected 47th overall, had 52 goals and 112 points in 68
regular-season games last season for Sudbury in the Ontario Hockey
League. Peters had six goals and 19 points in 42 games for
Kitchener in the OHL.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Dad Makes Plea To Relatives  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After two months in America and three court
rulings in his favor, Juan Miguel Gonzalez again asked Miami
relatives to stop the legal dueling that has kept his 6-year-old
son Elian from going home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   There was little indication the family would oblige. It appeared
Elian was going to spend at least another three weeks in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Thursday just hours after a three-judge federal appeals
court panel in Atlanta sided with him in the lengthy custody
battle, Gonzalez said, ''A child simply should be with his parents,
always with his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the father, I should be speaking on behalf of my son,'' he
said through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Gregory Craig, said that after Thursday's ruling,
there was ''no longer any doubt'' that Gonzalez would eventually
win the case in which the relatives are seeking asylum for Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is now time to end this chapter of Elian's life and let
this family go in peace,'' he told reporters while standing with
Gonzalez in front of his Washington law office.
</P>
<P>
   Craig noted that Miami relatives who took Elian into their home
after he was rescued from the Atlantic Ocean have said they are
concerned about Elian and that they love him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their love and their concern are best expressed today by
calling a halt to this legal battle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for the relatives said they hadn't decided their
next move. But the attorney, Kendall Coffey, asked Justice Anthony
M. Kennedy, who handles emergency matters for Florida in the
Supreme Court, ''to assure that Elian will remain in the United
States'' until the full Supreme Court can consider a formal appeal
he said he would file within 10 days. Later Thursday, the lawyer
asked Kennedy to disregard, at least temporarily, the emergency
request while the family considered its options.
</P>
<P>
   Marisleysis Gonzalez, Elian's cousin who cared for him during
his Miami stay, said she still believes Elian won't be returned to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope the laws of this country favor him and give him the
opportunity to seek asylum,'' she said. She also hopes the courts
will order Elian's father to allow her and her family to visit the
boy.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 protesters expressed their anguish over the court
ruling while gathered outside the small home in Miami's Little
Havana section where Elian stayed with his relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Constitution is dead,'' said Roxana Rodriguez, a
secretary. ''There is no justice. Democracy and freedom have been
thrown to the trash.''
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals said the Immigration and Naturalization Service's
decision that only a parent can act for a 6-year-old child in
immigration matters was reasonable. The court gave the Miami
relatives 14 days to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno welcomed the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said that if Miami relatives don't appeal during that time,
the earliest Elian could leave the United States would be seven
days later -- or 21 days in all.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton, speaking in Berlin, said he supported the Justice
Department's position that the father was the person ''best
suited'' to speak for Elian.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, several member of Congress restated their stand
on the drawn-out international custody case, begun after Elian
survived a November shipwreck that killed his mother and 10 others
attempting to come to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''It can never be in a child's best interests to live under
communist tyranny,'' said Rep. Tom DeLay, a Texas Republican who is
the House majority whip. ''And I hope that the appeals process will
ultimately result in providing Elian Gonzalez with a life of
liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am deeply disappointed in the court's decision,'' said
Florida Republican Sen. Connie Mack, adding that denying Elian an
asylum hearing ''leaves a black mark on our democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The father arrived in the states with Elian's stepmother and
half brother on April 6 in hopes of taking Elian home. Miami
relatives refused to relinquish the boy, so federal agents seized
him April 22 and reunited him with his dad in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said Thursday that in the time since he was reunited
with Elian, ''We have been very happy together.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love him very much. And I would hope that this would come to
an end, and we can finally go back home together with my whole
family and that this delay will not continue unnecessarily.''

<HEADLINE> Lawsuits Threaten Anglican Church  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Anglican worshippers used to giving donations on
Sunday morning got something back last week -- a pastoral letter
describing how the General Synod, or national church, could face
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The letter from Archbishop Michael Peers distributed May 28 in
all 2,400 congregations in Canada explained that lawsuits filed by
victims of physical and sexual abuse decades ago at church-run
schools for aboriginals seek hundreds of millions of dollars in
damages.
</P>
<P>
   ''About 100 cases involve the proven abuse of children, and the
perpetrators are in prison,'' Peers wrote. ''The costs of
litigation and settlements for these alone is sufficient to exhaust
all the assets of the General Synod and of some dioceses
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   It was shocking news for the more than 740,000 Anglicans,
acknowledged Jim Boyles, general secretary of the Anglican Church
of Canada. Few realized the General Synod's assets of $6.8 million
-- $2.7 million in property and $4.1 million in investments -- could
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although this issue has received attention in the media, the
seriousness hadn't hit home,'' Boyles said Thursday from his
Toronto office.
</P>
<P>
   About 7,000 claims have been filed against the Canadian
government involving residential schools, which aboriginal children
were forced to attend. Dating back to the 19th century, the schools
tried to assimilate aboriginals into white culture.
</P>
<P>
   Canada has an estimated 800,000 aboriginals, including Indians,
Inuit and the Metis, a group of mixed French and Indian descent.
</P>
<P>
   Students at the residential schools lost their native language
and culture and often faced physical and sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Four churches that ran residential schools -- Anglican, United,
Presbyterian and Roman Catholic -- were named in some lawsuits.
Those churches now are negotiating with the government on ways to
settle the lawsuits or pay off any judgments.
</P>
<P>
   While some dioceses of the Roman Catholic and Anglican Church
could go bankrupt, the Anglican General Synod is the only national
structure believed to be at risk. The Anglican Church operated 26
schools, closing the last ones in 1969, and faces 1,600 claims.
</P>
<P>
   Boyles said a previous case in British Columbia established that
the government and churches were ''jointly and severally liable,''
meaning that if the churches cannot pay an amount ordered by a
court, the government must.
</P>
<P>
   The structure of the Anglican Church protects most congregations
from liability, Boyles said. Only the dioceses named in lawsuits
and the General Synod would have to pay, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Peers' letter offered the same message to churchgoers worried
that their weekly donations would go to lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to assure all Anglicans that what is at risk
financially are our assets, not the contributions that provide for
the ongoing ministry and mission of the church at parish, diocesan
or national levels,'' Peers wrote. ''Your contributions serve the
mission of the church -- not the costs of litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   His letter and a column in the monthly Anglican Journal
newspaper acknowledged the church's role in running the abusive
residential schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''The facts are that the General Synod is guilty by
participation and association with individuals who physically and
sexually assaulted a substantial number of students at residential
schools,'' journal editor David Harris wrote in a May editorial
that said the General Synod may have to file for bankruptcy
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Such admissions only hurt the church's chances of avoiding
bankruptcy, said Ian Hunter, a law professor at the University of
Western Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Anglican Church is unique in Canadian legal history in
apparently convicting itself from its own mouth and apologizing its
way into a legally untenable position,'' Hunter wrote in the
National Post newspaper on May 29.
</P>
<P>
   While the Anglicans lack cash, Boyles said, the church can offer
resources and expertise for programs to help heal and reconcile
with aboriginal communities.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're saying to government is it makes sense to work out
an agreement whereby we can contribute to the settlement ... with
the strength and gifts that we have,'' he explained. ''Our feeling
is Anglicans would generously support increased work involving
healing and reconciliation with aboriginal people, but are not
likely to contribute to legal costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Peers' letter said the General Synod would be irrevocably
changed, no matter the solution. He previously has tried to inspire
the faithful by noting a parallel with Christ's resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   ''On Good Friday, Jesus stopped,'' he was quoted as saying by
the Anglican News Service. ''His heart stopped beating. His blood
stopped flowing. But the story didn't stop. God's purposes will not
be thwarted.
</P>
<P>
   ''And so, if bankruptcy becomes inevitable, we really are called
to be the body of Christ. Dead. Absolutely dead. And just as
absolutely destined to rise.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Grants Death Row Reprieve  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GRACZYK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Convicted killer Ricky McGinn, the
recipient of Gov. George W. Bush's compassionate conservatism, will
live to see another day.
</P>
<P>
   McGinn avoided execution Thursday when, for the first time, the
Republican presidential contender used his authority as governor to
grant a 30-day reprieve to a condemned murderer facing imminent
death -- an act that may appeal to moderate voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush intervened shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court denied
McGinn's appeals and less than a half-hour before the 43-year-old
Brownwood man would have been taken to the death chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any time DNA evidence used in this context can be relevant as
to the guilt or innocence of a person on death row we need to use
it,'' Bush said at a hastily arranged news conference in
Sacramento, where he was attending a governors' conference.
</P>
<P>
   In his 5{ years as governor, Bush refused to stop 131 lethal
injections, keeping Texas by far the nation's most active capital
punishment state. He has been criticized for running a busy death
chamber while campaigning as a ''compassionate conservative.'' The
state carried out 35 executions last year and 19 so far this year,
including one Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But in the case of McGinn, a mechanic convicted of the rape and
ax killing of his 12-year-old stepdaughter, Stephanie Flanary, Bush
opted to allow extra time for additional DNA tests.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expect the courts and all relevant parties to act
expeditiously to review the evidence and finally determine his
guilt as to the charge of rape in this case,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   The execution would have been the second in as many days and the
first of seven set for June.
</P>
<P>
   The rape element in the May 1993 killing is important because
prosecutors must show an accompanying felony in order to make the
crime eligible for the death penalty. Among items defense attorneys
want retested is a pubic hair recovered from the body during an
autopsy. Earlier tests identified the hair as belonging to McGinn,
who insists new tests will exonerate him.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials described McGinn as reserved when told of the
reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe they'll see what I've been telling them all these
years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief telephone call to his family, McGinn, who already
had eaten his scheduled final meal of a double cheeseburger, french
fries and Dr Pepper, was returned to death row.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know my brother and he's not guilty,'' McGinn's sister,
Verilyn Harbin, of Grenada, Miss., said after waiting outside the
Huntsville Unit prison for word of the reprieve. ''It's been rough
... But we haven't gone through anything compared to what Ricky has
gone through.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinn's attorney, Richard Alley, said while he had planned for
the reprieve, it still brought ''intense relief'' when it finally
was issued.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect to have a working agreement within 48 hours as to
how we're going to get the evidence and how we're going to get the
testing done,'' Alley said.
</P>
<P>
   By law, a new execution date would have to be set by McGinn's
trial judge, but could not be for within the next 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Haney, the Brown County district attorney who prosecuted
McGinn, said he had mixed emotions ''from the standpoint of the
family who was sitting there in Huntsville waiting for this to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Six members of Stephanie Flanary's family, including her parents
and grandparents, were set to witness McGinn's execution. They left
quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel for the Flanary family,'' McGinn's sister, Harbin,
said. ''They have to realize we have a brother and a son that
almost died. We have feelings too.''
</P>
<P>
   A jury at his 1995 trial in Brownwood, about 125 miles southwest
of Fort Worth, took only 40 minutes to decide on the death sentence
for McGinn.
</P>
<P>
   McGinn's case, part of a larger political drama, renewed the
national focus on the death penalty. The 218 Texas executions since
1982 account for more than one-third of all executions in the
country since the Supreme Court allowed capital punishment to
resume in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But the case also gave Bush an opportunity to put his philosophy
of compassionate conservatism to work, allowing him to soften his
image and appeal to moderate voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's likely Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, also
a death penalty supporter, said Bush had a difficult decision that
should not be viewed in terms of politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know the facts of the Texas case, but I think that DNA
and DNA testing is a valuable new tool that can provide new
evidence in a lot of cases,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the New Hampshire Legislature voted to abolish the
state's death penalty, but Gov. Jeanne Shaheen vetoed the measure.
Illinois Gov. George Ryan, a Republican like Bush, imposed a
moratorium on executions in January amid concern that innocent
people were on death row.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has rejected similar calls from death penalty opponents in
Texas, while maintaining that no innocent people have been executed
under his watch.
</P>
<P>
   Because Bush and Republican Lt. Gov. Rick Perry were both out of
state, the actual order for the reprieve came from state Sen.
Rodney Ellis, a Houston Democrat. As president pro tem of the Texas
Senate, he is acting governor in Bush and Perry's absences.

<HEADLINE> Police Free Luxembourg Hostages  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY ULBRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASSERBILLIG, Luxembourg (AP) -- For the gunman who held 25
preschoolers and their teachers at gunpoint for 30 hours, a desire
for publicity apparently proved his undoing.
</P>
<P>
   Police posing as television journalists lured the hostage-taker
into a fake interview Thursday, then shot him twice in the head.
The children and three adults were rescued unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   Luxembourg authorities said they decided on the strategy after
the 39-year-old man, armed with a pistol, grenades and a knife,
twice contacted Radio Television Luxembourg and gave radio
interviews, which were not broadcast until after the drama ended.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea was to simulate an interview,'' said Interior
Minister Michel Wolter. ''He wanted to address the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   Armed police officers dressed in jackets emblazoned with the RTL
logo and carrying a television camera approached the day-care
center where the hostages had been held since midafternoon
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman emerged, carrying a child in one arm and a grenade in
the other. The police disguised as cameramen fired twice, felling
the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman was in serious condition in a Luxembourg hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the interior minister nor RTL would confirm reports that
the gun was concealed in a fake camera.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no RTL team involved,'' said Vic Reuter, RTL's
Luxembourg station manager.
</P>
<P>
   Police were ready to shoot the gunman earlier but, according to
Wolter, ''he was very mistrustful. This morning we were ready to do
it, but he didn't come far enough out.''
</P>
<P>
   Police divisional commissioner Andree Colas said the gunman
seized 46 children on Wednesday along with several teaching staff.
Seventeen of the children were freed Wednesday along with two
teachers. Thursday morning two more children were freed, and two
more came out Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But tension rose when the man, a Luxembourger of Tunisian
origin, appeared in a window on the top floor of the day-care
center and waved his gun and a hand grenade beside a picture of a
teddy bear. At one point he also waved a toddler at the window,
Wolter said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the hostage-taker had a history of mental illness.
Residents of this town of 2,300 near the German border said he
blamed the day-care center for the loss of custody of his two
children after he and his wife separated.
</P>
<P>
   He had demanded that he and the hostages be taken to Luxembourg
airport Thursday to fly to Libya. A deadline he set to be
transported to the airport came and went without incident.
</P>
<P>
   The hostage-taking was an ordeal that shocked this tiny European
country, known for its thick forests and rolling hills. It is a
stranger to the sort of social tensions and crime that punctuate
life elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought we had a quiet little town here,'' said retiree
Raphael Dedapper.
</P>
<P>
   Wedged between France, Belgium and Germany, Luxembourg is
smaller than Rhode Island, with a population of only 365,000.

<HEADLINE> Dems Hope Gun Debate Will Help Gore  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats predict the debate over guns will
rally voters -- especially women -- to support Al Gore for president.
Polls offer little evidence of that now, however.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, has no clear
advantage over Republican George W. Bush on the issue. Polls show
the two about even when people are asked who they trust on guns.
</P>
<P>
   And Republicans argue that the debate may actually help their
candidate because of Bush's call for tougher enforcement of
existing gun laws, instead of new legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not clear to me that this is a one-sided issue moving
toward the Democrats at all,'' says GOP pollster Linda DiVall.
''There's no question that there is a significant gender gap on
guns, with women calling for more gun control and men calling for
tougher enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   DiVall noted that Texas Gov. Bush ''has been clever in taking a
stand'' on trigger locks.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before Mother's Day and the Million Mom March, a
women's movement advocating tougher gun control, Bush announced a
trigger lock giveaway in Texas. He also has said he would sign
legislation requiring that trigger locks be sold with guns.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also backs increasing the minimum age for gun possession
from 18 to 21 and has signed legislation increasing the penalties
for selling guns to juveniles and for parents who leave guns where
children can get them, campaign aides say.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association is viewed fairly positively by
the public, with more than half in a recent Gallup poll having a
favorable view. NRA President Charlton Heston's popularity was
about the same as Gore's in recent polls. When an NRA official was
caught on tape saying the group could work from the White House if
Bush was elected, Bush quickly rejected the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats acknowledge Bush has softened his image on the gun
issue, but they insist the debate will eventually work in Gore's
favor.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Leigh Blek, a lifelong Republican who lost her 21-year-old
son to gunfire in 1994, said the gun debate must be fully aired.
</P>
<P>
   ''I observed the reactions of some of the women when Bush came
up with this trigger lock distribution,'' said the registered nurse
from Orange County, Calif., who now runs the Million Mom March
organization. ''They were like 'Are you kidding?'''
</P>
<P>
   ''The women see right through that,'' Blek said.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the gun debate is ''key toward winning over the
compassionate conservative women,'' said Democratic pollster
Celinda Lake. ''Right now, white married moms are strongly
supportive of Bush. They really like him and they really trust
him.''
</P>
<P>
   When women are told Bush ''is for concealed weapons in public
places including malls they're just flabbergasted,'' Lake said. The
concealed weapon law that Bush signed in Texas is aimed at allowing
law-abiding citizens to carry concealed weapons for their own
protection, aides say.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a growing sense across the country that the best
solution is tough enforcement of existing law, along with
reasonable and rational gun safety measures,'' said Bush spokesman
Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   And the gun debate may be strengthening the NRA, which now
boasts a record 3.6 million members.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has outlined what aides describe as an aggressive stance
toward guns, while trying to signal sportsmen that he doesn't want
to take away their guns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore has no quarrel with gunners and sportsmen who are
members of the NRA,'' spokesman Doug Hattaway said. ''He's been a
hunter. He grew up shooting a gun, but he disagrees with the
increasingly extreme agenda of the NRA.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore says he will push for mandatory child safety locks on new
handguns, ban ''Saturday night specials,'' increase the minimum age
for handgun possession, increase criminal penalties for dealers who
sell guns illegally and oppose special legal protections for gun
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The issue also could be tricky in key Midwestern states with
many rural voters who generally support gun rights, DiVall says.
</P>
<P>
   Blek says continued gun violence is changing the political
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have seen a sea change -- I started to see it after Columbine
(the Colorado high school shooting). Many of these women are new to
the issue, but they are passionate,'' Blek said. ''I didn't get it
until after my kid was shot.''

<HEADLINE> La. Train Wreck Evacuees Return  </HEADLINE>
By NATALIE GOTT
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUNICE, La. (AP) -- Most of the 3,000 people evacuated after a
train carrying hazardous chemicals derailed and exploded last
weekend found their houses unscathed when they finally were allowed
to return home.
</P>
<P>
   But some residents who returned Thursday worried about the
effects the explosion might have on their fields of rice and beans,
their cattle and their health.
</P>
<P>
   ''When are we going to lose our hair?'' joked farmer Keith
Heinen, who lives within a mile of the derailment site.
</P>
<P>
   ''When are we going to get cancer?'' his neighbor Glen Vidrine
quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the soot and ash from the explosion landed in the woods
near the train track and missed the homes, said Jeffrey Meyers, a
supervisor with the Department of Environmental Quality.
</P>
<P>
   More than one-quarter of the town's 11,000 residents have been
living in hotels and friends' homes since Saturday, when 34 cars of
the 113-car Union Pacific train derailed. One car exploded near a
country club at the edge of town.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured, but the explosion sent fireballs in the sky,
and the nearby woods caught fire. Officials evacuated homes as far
as two miles away as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   Police were hopeful that about a dozen families still out of
their houses would be able to return by today, state Trooper Chris
Guillory said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nice just to come home,'' said Preston Richard, who lives
about a half-mile from the derailment site. ''I haven't even seen
my bed yet, but I know it's going to feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   State and federal agencies are supervising the cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brian Amy, regional medical director for the state Office of
Public Health, said he did not know of any threat to public health.
He said a few people went to emergency rooms complaining of mild
irritation, but he had not heard of anyone being hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Heinen said agricultural experts were checking for contamination
in the fields. Monitoring of air and water in the vicinity since
the derailment suggests a minimum of environmental damage,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time to put fungicide on (the rice fields),'' Heinen
said. ''I guess we just got a fungicide, but we just don't know if
it's the right one. We will know in about a week.''

<HEADLINE> Puente: The sweet sounds of salsa finally stop  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- When teen heartthrob Marc Anthony invited Tito
Puente to appear on his February HBO special, he was just repaying
a debt to ''The King of Latin Music.''
</P>
<P>
   Years earlier, when Anthony was breaking into the business,
Puente invited him onstage at Madison Square Garden. It was
typically generous Tito, and Anthony never forgot.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will forever be painful knowing I will never see him walk
through a door and fill up a room again,'' Anthony said Thursday,
hours after the flamboyant 77-year-old bandleader and percussionist
died.
</P>
<P>
   ''But at the same time, I thank God for giving me the
opportunity to know and care for one of the most amazing men ever
to walk the earth,'' Anthony concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Puente, the Grammy-winning artist popularly known as ''El Rey,''
''The King,'' of big-band mambo whose pioneering sound paved the
way for Latin musicians from Carlos Santana to the 31-year-old
Anthony, died Wednesday at the New York University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The hyperactive percussionist and bandleader suffered
complications after open heart surgery, said Eddie Rodriguez, his
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Santana, offering condolences to Puente's wife, Margie, two sons
and a daughter, said he was ''very honored and grateful to have
been touched by Tito Puente's spirit and his monumental talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Memorial services were planned for Sunday and Monday in
Manhattan, with a funeral Tuesday morning in Nanuet.
</P>
<P>
   Decades before the current ''Latin explosion'' of Anthony, Ricky
Martin and Jennifer Lopez, Puente -- a contemporary of the late Desi
Arnaz -- was driving audiences to the dance floor with his animated
style and influential music.
</P>
<P>
   He created his own jazz by blending Latin rhythm with the big
band stylings of Tommy Dorsey or Count Basie.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tito's life was like one of his finest solos -- he got all he
could out of it,'' said comedian Bill Cosby, a friend and admirer.
</P>
<P>
   Puente's star ascended across six decades. He earned five
Grammys and recorded more than 100 albums in a career that began at
age 13. His most recent Grammy, best tropical Latin performance for
''Mambo Birdland,'' came in February.
</P>
<P>
   Puente crossed over before anyone coined the expression,
collaborating with traditional jazz artists such as Dizzy Gillespie
and Lionel Hampton. He wrote the song ''Oye Como Va'' years before
it became an enormous rock hit for Santana.
</P>
<P>
   He performed with various symphonies, and brought his band to
the White House for Presidents Carter, Reagan and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But Puente transcended music to enter pop culture. Bill Murray's
character in ''Stripes'' worshipped Puente, as did television's
Lisa Simpson. Puente performed the theme song for ''The Cosby
Show,'' and even played himself in the 1992 movie ''Mambo Kings.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he received a National Medal of Arts from President
Clinton -- one of dozens of honors bestowed on Puente for both his
musical prowess and his ceaseless goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, traveling in Berlin Thursday, said Puente was ''more
than a musician -- he was a trailblazer.'' He said Puente's
''countless recordings are classics in the genre he helped
define.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore also paid tribute to the late bandleader.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Anthony Puente Jr. was born April 20, 1923, in Harlem
Hospital, the oldest child of a factory foreman and his wife.
Initially, Puente was a Fred Astaire-styled dancer; a serious ankle
injury in a bicycle accident refocused his attention on music.
</P>
<P>
   He started his career at age 13, playing in a local nightclub.
Fifty-six years later, Puente released his 100th album -- ''The
Mambo King 100th LP'' -- and earned a Grammy nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The inestimable influence of the Harlem-born national treasure
was reflected in tributes offered by a variety of musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tito was for me more than family,'' said Cuban-born singer
Celia Cruz, a longtime friend and collaborator. ''Our world is in
mourning because one of the souls of Latin music has died.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Estefan, in a statement with husband Emilio, praised
Puente as ''a pioneer in the music industry ... an inspiration for
artists and music lovers alike.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tito said to us recently that his music was not only the story
of who he was, but also the pride and the passion of a people
rejoicing in who they are,'' the Estefans said. ''There are no
better words with which to say goodbye.''

Japan Prime Minister Dissolves Parliament
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori dissolved the lower house of
Parliament on Friday, paving the way for national elections later this month.
Support for Mori has plummeted since his remark last month that Japan is a
''divine nation'' centered on the emperor -- suggesting to many the kind of
nationalistic rhetoric used by politicians before World War II. But while recent
polls suggest his administration is the least popular to face an election since
the end of the war, his Liberal Democrats were not expected to lose their
position as the country's ruling party.

Hormones Said Raising Breast Cancers
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Use of a hormone-replacement therapy with estrogen and
progestin can more than double the risk of a form of breast cancer, researchers
reported today in the journal Cancer. Scientists at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center studied 537 Seattle-area women at least 50 years old who had
breast cancer from 1988 to 1990. They were compared with 492 women who had not
had the disease. Scientists found a 2.6-fold higher incidence of lobular breast
cancer in women who took the combination therapy for at least six months and an
average of four years.

other bacteria that cause disease have evolved a strategy to scavage from the
blood of victims the iron that is essential to their survival. A report on the
study appears Friday in the journal Science. Lyme disease is caused by a microbe
that is spread to humans through a tick bite.

unanimous ruling from a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of

Court. Family lawyer Kendall Coffey said he hadn't decided on a course of

defense system. Washington's proposal to build the system -- a scaled-down

<HEADLINE> Ala. Executes Convicted Killer  </HEADLINE>
By ASHLEY ESTES
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATMORE, Ala. (AP) -- A man convicted in the 1983 stabbing deaths
of a disabled woman and her daughter was executed by electrocution
early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Pernell Ford, 35, was pronounced dead at 12:12 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy final statement, Ford told Warden Charlie Jones he
wanted to apologize to the family of his victims for the pain and
suffering he had caused. Awaiting execution, Ford recited biblical
passages, took deep breaths and at times closed his eyes and rested
his head on the back of the electric chair, said Alabama Department
of Corrections Commissioner Mike Haley.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was condemned for the murder of Willie C. Griffith, a
74-year-old disabled woman, and her daughter, 42-year-old Linda
Gail Griffith, during a burglary at their home in Jacksonville, in
northeast Alabama. Both were stabbed multiple times.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, then 18, was found in Illinois driving Gail Griffith's car
and wearing bloody clothes. Prosecutors said he confessed.
</P>
<P>
   During his trial, he wore a sheet during the penalty phase and
said he wanted the victims' bodies brought to court so God could
resurrect them.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun County District Attorney Joe Hubbard, the prosecutor in
the case, has said he believes Ford acted mentally ill in an
attempt to avoid execution.
</P>
<P>
   Ford dropped his appeals and fired defense attorney LaJuana
Davis in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Davis won a stay of execution for Ford last July after raising
questions about his sanity. But a federal appeals court ruled last
November that Ford was competent to drop his appeals and fire his
attorney.

<HEADLINE> Bush Attends Governors Gathering  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT LINDLAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Keeping the focus on international
affairs and making fresh overtures to Hispanic voters, George W.
Bush is sharing the stage with eight other U.S. and Mexican border
governors at a two-day conference.
</P>
<P>
   But the brightest spotlight shined on California Gov. Gray
Davis, chairman of the Border Governors Conference and a staunch
ally of Democrat Al Gore, Bush's presidential rival.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Republican governor of Texas, joined Davis and the
leaders of Arizona, New Mexico and five Mexican states to open the
18th gathering of border governors. They were to focus today on
border issues relating to the environment, education and the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush arrived here Thursday after an environmental policy address
in Nevada. His appearance at the conference's opening ceremony was
added to his schedule less than an hour before it began.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Tomas Yarrington Ruvalcaba, governor of the Mexican
state of Tamaulpas and conference vice chairman, addressed about
200 dignitaries. Bush and the others did not speak.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's presence was meant to remind voters of his
credentials as an international leader and to send a signal to
Hispanic voters, said Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This does highlight the fact that Governor Bush, as governor
of Texas, has had some foreign policy experience when it comes to
dealing with Mexico,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Governors Conference also was ''an opportunity to
remind all Americans that he's been an inclusive governor and has
reached out to Hispanics in our state,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was careful not to mention the White House race, but
indirectly referred to the politics of the California-Mexico
relationship, which strained under his predecessor, Republican Pete
Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, like Bush, fought for tougher border enforcement,
portraying the boundary as a porous wall that allowed Mexicans to
overrun the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he envisioned the U.S.-Mexico area as one region, not
two divided by a fence.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Davis announced that Blue Shield of California will
become the first U.S. health maintenance organization licensed by
the state to provide health services to workers on both sides of
the border. The plan is aimed at the estimated 40,000 Mexicans who
cross the border each day to work legally in the San Diego area.
</P>
<P>
   While the opening ceremony was upbeat, Yarrington raised one of
the ugliest border issues: vigilante justice by U.S. ranchers and
others, particularly in Arizona, against illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   He decried ''an increase in terms of violence on behalf of those
who have decided to take the law into their own hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Also attending the conference are Arizona Gov. Jane Hull; New
Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson; Alejandro Gonzalez Alcocer of Baja
California; Lic. Enrique Martinez y Martinez of Coahuila; Fernando
Canales Clariond of Nuevo Leon; and Patricio Martinez Garcia of
Chihuahua.

<HEADLINE> Ex-GSA Chief Denies Talking To Gore  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The former head of the General Services
Administration says he never talked to Vice President Al Gore or
anyone else in the Clinton administration about a proposed $400
million federal lease for a Democratic fund-raiser and long-time
friend of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-GSA administrator Roger Johnson made the comments Thursday
night in response to public disclosure of a memo suggesting that
''Gore has called or is ready to call'' Johnson in an attempt to
help Tennessee developer Franklin Haney on a planned building
called the Portals. Gore denies intervening on the Portals project.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department investigators got the undated, unsigned and
unaddressed memo pursuant to a grand jury subpoena, but have been
unable to learn who wrote the three-paragraph document, U.S. Rep.
Thomas Bliley, R-Va., revealed in a letter to Attorney General
Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said government investigators questioned him over a year
ago about the Portals.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were asking me was there any pressure on me from the
administration to do anything'' for ''a developer, I think it was
one of the vice president's people'' and ''my answer 'was
absolutely not,''' said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson emphasized that he didn't have a conversation about the
Portals with the vice president ''or anybody else in the
administration'' about the Portals. ... That's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's chief of staff, Barbara Silbey, met regarding the
Portals in Johnson's office with long-time Gore fund-raiser Peter
Knight, to whom Haney paid $1 million for work on that and other
real estate deals.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a meeting between GSA and Mr. Haney,'' Silbey said
in a statement. ''There were lawyers present and the meeting was
for the entirely legitimate purpose of discussing Mr. Haney's plans
in connection with the Portals. Every aspect of government
contracting law was complied with to the fullest.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo suggested a strategy for pushing the Portals deal that
included contacting Silbey.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let her know that you are also a major player in the
fund-raising arena'' and ''that Gore has called or is ready to call
Johnson and that he appreciates'' Silbey's ''help in resolving the
issue,'' the memo said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the House committee said lease changes obtained
by Haney cost taxpayers millions of dollars in rent for months
before government workers moved into the newly constructed
building. Besides the money to Knight, Haney also paid $1.8 million
in less than a year to former Sen. James Sasser for help on the
Portals and other real estate projects.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley is seeking a criminal investigation into why the memo
which identifies Gore by name three times wasn't turned over to the
House Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations in its
yearlong probe of the Portals deal in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The memo states: ''Whomever Gore designates to call Roger should
also call the Deputy Administrator and PBS Commissioner'' at GSA.
''They need strokes too. The problem is that they don't know anyone
anywhere. So a stroke is a little more difficult. This can be
played by ear.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Bliley said that ''of the 20 or so relevant
people the FBI interviewed on this subject (including Vice
President Gore), not one of them could offer any clues'' as to who
wrote the document.
</P>
<P>
   ''Apparently no one -- even including the person who produced it
to DOJ -- had ever seen this document before, no one had drafted it,
and no one knew who had drafted it,'' Bliley's letter added.
</P>
<P>
   Due to grand jury secrecy rules, the Justice Department has
declined to tell Congress who supplied the memo to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said that ''we've been
having discussions with the committee about this matter and are
reviewing'' Bliley's letter.

<HEADLINE> Army's Female 3-Star General Quits  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lt. Gen. Claudia Kennedy, who drew national
attention for accusing a fellow general of sexual harassment, is
saying farewell to the Army, 31 years after she joined as a second
lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   Although her formal retirement will come in August, today is
Kennedy's last day of work. She has been the Army's deputy chief of
staff for intelligence since May 1997 and is the Army's only female
three-star general.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's departure plans were set before her accusation of
sexual harassment became public in March.
</P>
<P>
   She was being honored today at a ceremony to be presided over by
Army Secretary Louis Caldera.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kennedy nor the man she accused of making an unwanted
sexual advance in her Pentagon office -- Maj. Gen. Larry G. Smith --
has spoken publicly about the case. Calls to Kennedy's office are
routinely referred to the Army's public affairs office, which says
it cannot discuss the substance of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Army investigators informed the service's leaders
that they had substantiated Kennedy's charge that Smith had touched
her in an inappropriate way during a meeting in her office in 1996.
Smith, who reportedly has denied making a sexual advance, has been
given a chance to challenge the findings.
</P>
<P>
   With Kennedy's retirement, the Army has no other female
three-star generals. The highest-ranking women in the Army after
Kennedy are two two-stars: Maj. Gen. Nancy R. Adams and Maj. Gen.
Patricia A. Hickerson.
</P>
<P>
   When Kennedy joined the Army on June 2, 1969, as a second
lieutenant, after getting a bachelor of arts degree in philosophy
from Southwestern at Memphis, there was still a Women's Army Corps.
Women were not allowed at West Point.
</P>
<P>
   Her career specialty was military intelligence; in the mid-1970s
she was a strategic intelligence officer with the 501st Military
Intelligence Group in South Korea, and later she commanded the
714th Military Intelligence Battalion in Germany. She also served
as a staff officer at the Pentagon's eavesdropping arm, the
National Security Agency, from 1977-80.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kennedy, 52, has not publicly discussed her sexual
harassment allegation, she alluded to the issue in a general way
during remarks May 12 at a ceremony at the memorial to Women in
Military Service to America, at Arlington National Cemetery. She
said women who are harassed should report it immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''If discrimination or misconduct is not reported at an
appropriate time, then public policy may never change,'' Kennedy
said at the event. She quoted French novelist Emile Zola as saying
he lived on Earth ''to live out loud.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Living out loud begins by telling a friend and then later
telling people in authority who care,'' Kennedy said. ''Our Army is
filled with women and men who care and are in a position to change
and improve the conditions in which we serve.''
</P>
<P>
   In her own case, Kennedy did not report Smith's alleged
harassment to her superiors at the time. She raised the matter
internally only last fall after the Army announced that Smith was
to become the Army's deputy inspector general. In that post he
would have overseen investigations of cases of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Army quietly rescinded Smith's assignment, and
his official status is ''on hold,'' according to Army personnel
records.

<HEADLINE> Russian Economy Rebounds  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID E. KALISH
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like more and more companies in Russia these days, Saint Springs
Water is flying high. Thirsty consumers are buying its distinctive
clear bottles, shaped like a Russian Orthodox church dome, twice as
fast as last year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Moscow bottled water maker itself is a tough sell --
attracting tepid demand from potential corporate buyers able to pay
top dollar for the company, its U.S. owners say.
</P>
<P>
   Saint Springs Water is hardly alone.
</P>
<P>
   Since Russia's ruble meltdown in August 1998, the economy has
staged an unexpected comeback, buoyed by soaring oil prices,
favorable currency rates, rising incomes and pent-up domestic
demand for consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of many outside observers, Russian businesses
are flourishing and foreign companies from Gillette razors to the
Ikea retailer are expanding.
</P>
<P>
   Russia attracted more than twice as much foreign capital in the
first five months of 2000 -- $10 billion -- as during all of last
year, the Russian government says. That's on top of a 27 percent
jump in foreign investment and loans in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many foreign companies and investors are holding back, still
smarting from the 1998 fiscal emergency. They're waiting to see if
the Russian recovery sticks and if President Vladimir Putin
institutes much-needed reforms of the nation's Soviet-era
regulatory systems.
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns form an uncertain backdrop to President Clinton's
first summit with Putin this weekend. Weapons talks top the agenda,
though the stage could be set for later economic discussions on
trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The perception is still that Russia is a difficult place, one
that could have many bumps in the road before you would turn a
profit, and one whose tax and legal systems are opaque,'' said
Douglas Lamont, a professor of international marketing at DePaul
University.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson is tough to forget. Following the ruble plunge,
foreign corporations and investors lost billions, Russia missed
debt payments, and accusations flew of government money laundering
and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Owing little thanks to its government, Russia's economy is
reviving.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the recent spurt in global oil prices -- which have
buoyed tax collections and monetary reserves for the big energy
exporter -- can't last.
</P>
<P>
   Another shaky economic foundation is the ruble's two-year
plunge, which helped domestic industry compete against imports that
soared in price compared with Russian-made goods.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, moreover, has yet to reveal plans to overhaul the
nation's confusing and -- some say -- cronyism-tainted systems for
regulating bankruptcy, banking and corporate accounting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The improvements in the economy are welcome, but not
sustainable,'' said Helena Hessel, an analyst for New York-based
Standard and Poor's, a credit-rating agency. ''We need to see more
structural reforms so we can be sure of real improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the skepticism, hardy investors are returning to a
Russian economy that grew 3.2 percent last year for its strongest
showing since the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, according to the
U.S. Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is a potentially lucrative market of 146 million
people, largely well educated, with scarce competition from other
foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based Gillette Co., for one, is investing $40 million in
a St. Petersburg factory that can turn out more than 600 million
razors and blades a year. The factory expansion will be unveiled
during Clinton's visit, which begins Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette says sales in Russia soared 40 percent in the first
quarter and represent the company's fastest-growing major market.
</P>
<P>
   Also bullish is the U.S. Russian Investment Fund, which invests
U.S. government money in Russian startups -- including $3.5 million
in Saint Springs in 1995 -- with the hope of profiting one day by
selling holdings.
</P>
<P>
   It expects to take stakes in eight Russian companies by summer's
end -- up from zero in 1999. They include $1 million in a major
Russian Internet portal, $5 million in a cable TV distribution
system and $20 million in a mortgage bank.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's commonly believed that the country is turning around,''
said David Jones, the fund's president. ''But we've seen it more at
the grass-roots level -- the little businesses doing better.''
</P>
<P>
   Individual investors outside Russia are starting to enjoy the
ride. The $75 million Lexington Troika Dialogue Russia Fund, a New
Jersey-based mutual fund that focuses on Russian companies, was the
No. 1 performing emerging market fund last year, racking up gains
of 160 percent -- in contrast to its 83 percent loss in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   One Russian company it's hot on is Gaz, maker of the once-boxy
Volga car that has since been streamlined and now comes in a
rainbow of colors and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economic conditions now are night and day compared to
1998,'' fund manager Richard Hisey says.
</P>
<P>
   Hope for a sustainable Russian recovery springs from Putin, who
paints himself as an energetic reformer and has appointed
pro-market economist German Gref as Minister for Economics and
Trade.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Putin disclosed plans to simplify taxes, boost
collections and crack down on massive tax evasion. Other reforms
ranging from banking to accounting regulation may be unveiled in an
upcoming strategy document from Gref's team.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts hope to find out then if the Putin administration will
try to shore up the battered ruble, a divisive move domestically
that is important for restoring Russia's credibility on the world
economic stage.

<HEADLINE> Cigarette Cos. Seek Suit Dismissal  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cigarette makers are asking a judge to dismiss
a lawsuit by the federal government that seeks billions of dollars
to repay the cost of treating smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The government has no claim under federal law in seeking to
recover money spent by Medicare and other federal health programs
to treat such illnesses, the tobacco industry's lawyers contend.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is urging the judge to keep the case
alive, arguing that the cigarette companies pose a continuing
threat to the American public's health.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler scheduled a three-hour court
session today to hear arguments from lawyers representing the
tobacco companies and the Justice Department. It was unclear when
she might rule on the cigarette makers' bid to fend off the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's lawsuit alleges the cigarette companies
conspired since the 1950s to defraud and mislead the public about
the dangers of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   When the lawsuit was filed last September, Attorney General
Janet Reno said federal health plans spend more than $20 billion a
year treating smoking-related illnesses, which take 400,000 lives a
year. She accused the industry of putting its own profits above the
public health by concealing data that showed nicotine is addictive
and that smoking causes disease.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials vowed last fall to fight the lawsuit rather
than settle like they did in 1998 by agreeing to pay the states
$246 billion over 25 years to cover the cost of treating sick
smokers in the Medicaid program, which serves the poor and
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers filed before today's argument, the tobacco
companies' lawyers said, ''The government is asserting causes of
action for Medicare recovery that have never been recognized by any
court before, that it has never asserted before, that it has
publicly stated it does not have, and that it has to this date
never asserted against anyone other than this group of
defendants.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco industry lawyers also argue that many of the federal
government's non-monetary demands are already required by the state
settlements, such as a ban on attempts to target children in
advertising and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department responded in legal papers that federal
law does authorize the federal government to recover Medicare
costs. The lawsuit also invoked a federal anti-racketeering law.
</P>
<P>
   ''What makes this suit unique is the conduct of these
corporations, which for decades have deliberately and successfully
addicted millions of citizens to a product that defendants have
long known causes suffering and death,'' Justice Department lawyers
said in court papers. The tobacco companies ''pose a continuing
threat to the health and well-being of the American public,'' they
added.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 4, Cardinals 0  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Matt Williams, Steve Finley and Luis Gonzalez
homered to end Arizona's power outage, and the Diamondbacks
salvaged a series split by beating the St. Louis Cardinals 4-0
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Reynoso (4-4) pitched seven strong innings for the win
and handled the Mark McGwire-less Cardinals with ease. He allowed
just four hits and struck out four before he was lifted for a pinch
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Benes (4-3), facing his former team for the first time,
allowed six hits in 6 1-3 innings. But three of those hits were
solo shots by Arizona's most consistent sluggers.
</P>
<P>
   After Reynoso hit Fernando Vina with one out in the third, he
retired the next 11 batters before giving up back-to-back singles
to Jim Edmonds and Ray Lankford in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso got out of the jam by getting Craig Paquette to fly out,
and J.D. Drew to hit into a fielder's choice at second.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Stinnett's RBI single in the seventh made it 4-0 and
chased Benes.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks hit just four homers in the first nine games of
their 10-game homestand, and had gone four games without one.
</P>
<P>
   But the Diamondbacks, who lost the first two of the four-game
series, made up for their power drought Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Williams led off the second with his first homer in seven games,
dating to last Sept. 27, against Colorado's Luther Hackney.
Williams broke his right foot in spring training and was on the
disabled list until May 23.
</P>
<P>
   Finley hit his 19th -- giving him an NL-leading 52 RBIs -- with
two outs in the fourth, and Gonzalez drove a 434-foot shot into the
right-field bleachers in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who hit his major league-leading 21st homer off Randy
Johnson Wednesday night, was rested for the 10th game of a 16-day
stretch in which the Cardinals play a game each day.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Padilla pitched the eighth, and Matt Mantei got the
final three outs.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Benes is 12-16 at Bank One Ballpark, where he threw the
first pitch as Arizona's starter in its 1998 inaugural season. ...
Williams' homer was the 335th of his career. ... Hand specialist
Don Sheridan performed arthroscopic surgery to repair torn
cartilage in Arizona 1B Erubiel Durazo's right wrist Thursday. The
rehabilitation is expected to take at least a month. ... The
Cardinals ended May in first place for the first time since 1992.
... McGwire's solo homer Wednesday night was St. Louis' 100th of
the year in its 52nd game, setting an NL record. The 1956
Cincinnati Reds set the previous record (64) for number of games
needed to reach 100.

<HEADLINE> Players Offer Own Realignment Plan  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   While baseball's owners can't get together on a realignment
plan, the players are offering their own proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Player representatives are circulating a union counterplan that
will move the Houston Astros from the NL Central to the AL West to
create two 15-team leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The players' plan is much simpler than the main one being
considered by owners. That proposal would have Tampa Bay and
Arizona switching leagues, the elimination of the wild card in the
NL, and a six-team AL Central to go along with six four-team
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I reviewed it, I thought it was definitely a better
plan,'' Tampa Bay representative Mike DiFelice said. ''You at least
have the leagues evenly spilt and have the wild card. I think the
wild card is good for the fans, I think it's good for the teams.''
</P>
<P>
   But the players' plan does create one major problem. With an odd
number of teams in each league, interleague games will need to be
played most days of the season.
</P>
<P>
   With two 15-team leagues, there would have to be at least one
interleague game scheduled for every Friday, Saturday, Sunday; most
Tuesdays and Wednesdays; and some Mondays and Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also does not address Texas' desire to leave the AL
West, where the Rangers play all of their division road games in
the Pacific time zone.
</P>
<P>
   This plan would solve that only slightly -- and by creating a
rivalry with the Astros, it presumably would guarantee sellouts
when the teams face each other.
</P>
<P>
   Because Texas has been in the AL West and Houston in the NL
Central, the teams have not met in interleague play.
</P>
<P>
   But a top Astros official, speaking on the condition he not be
identified, said the team had no desire to leave the National
League. Astros owner Drayton McLane has said many times he is happy
where the Astros are. McLane can veto any league switch.
</P>
<P>
   Owners had been expected to meet in Detroit on June 13-14 to
discuss realignment, but commissioner Bud Selig postponed that
meeting. A meeting is expected to take place in late June or early
July.
</P>
<P>
   ''Something has got to get done,'' Tampa Bay's Roberto Hernandez
said. ''We can't have one league with more teams than the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan most discussed, Arizona would move from the NL
West to the AL West, Texas would move from the AL West to the AL
Central and Tampa Bay would move from the AL East to the National
League, which would realign into four four-team divisions with no
wild card.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what they are talking about with a four-team division
in the NL and the elimination of the wild card, won't go through,''
Boston player rep Tim Wakefield said.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox, Twins and Royals, who would be part of the
six-team AL Central, have objected, saying it would be harder to
reach the postseason. In addition, Arizona wants to stay in the NL.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Neighborhoods Seek Tourists  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER ANDES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- District of Columbia officials want to draw
the estimated 21 million annual visitors to the nation's capital
away from the august statuary and into the city's neighborhoods,
where other, lesser known monuments can be found.
</P>
<P>
   Many tourists never see the mural dedicated to the Father of
Jazz and native Washingtonian Duke Ellington, the Byzantine-style
Franciscan Monastery with catacombs like those in Rome, and
hundreds of other historic and cultural sites because the don't
venture past the National Mall.
</P>
<P>
   The district government and partners, including the Metro System
and National Endowment for the Humanities, want to change that.
</P>
<P>
   They launched a ''Beyond the Monuments'' initiative Thursday to
help tourists ''find their way off the Mall and into the living
city ... and spend some money while they're at it,'' said Kathryn
Smith, executive director of the Heritage Tourism Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The partners created a map detailing cultural and historic sites
in nine of the city's neighborhoods in an effort to boost economic
revitalization throughout the city. Saturday, they're offering free
walking tours through five historic neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   That's just the beginning, Smith said. Walking tours, costumed
guides, and maps of historic trails in additional neighborhoods all
are on the horizon, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At $4.2 billion a year, tourism is the district's top
private-sector industry. City leaders estimate the initiative could
move $100 million of that into the neighborhoods and boost overall
tourism even more.
</P>
<P>
   A proposed City Museum, to be built by 2003 eight blocks north
of the Mall, would serve as a base for visitors who want to
experience the city, said Barbara Franco, executive director of the
Historical Society of Washington. ''Visitors want and need to know
more about the city beyond the monuments,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Home-Schoolers Sweep Spelling Bee  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George Abraham Thampy might not know all of
the geography of Denmark. But when it comes to spelling, he's the
champ.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-old Missouri boy won the 2000 Scripps Howard
National Spelling Bee on Thursday by correctly spelling
''demarche,'' which means a step or maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   And this came only one week after he placed second in a national
geography bee.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mom and dad taught me everything,'' the Maryland Heights,
Mo., boy said modestly after winning the two-day spelling contest.
</P>
<P>
   And he wasn't exaggerating. His mother, Bina, works full-time
teaching her four sons and three daughters.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, George became only the second home-schooler
ever to win the national spelling competition. ''What makes
home-schooling better is that Mom and Dad allow me to be
flexible,'' George said. ''I can do something else like Latin.''
</P>
<P>
   To win, he spelled ''fondu,'' ''waiver,'' ''serendipity,''
''ersatz,'' ''surfactant,'' ''vesicant,'' ''emmetropia,''
''annelid,'' ''trophobiosis,'' ''psilosis,'' ''quodlibet,''
''eudaemonic,'' ''ditokous,'' ''propaedeutic'' and ''demarche''
correctly over two days.
</P>
<P>
   George's knowledge earned him $10,000 in the spelling bee. The
money, he said, would go to his parents.
</P>
<P>
   His second place showing in the geography bee earned him
$15,000. He missed out on the top spot when he could name only one
of the three largest sections of Denmark. His opponent named all
three.
</P>
<P>
   George's final two spelling bee rivals also were taught at home:
</P>
<P>
   --In second was Sean Conley, 12, of Newark, Calif.
''Apotropaic,'' which means designed to avert evil, tripped him up;
he spelled it ''apotrypaic.'' He won $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   --Alison Miller, 14, from Niskayuna, N.Y., took third and $3,000.
Alison missed ''venire.'' She spelled the word for drawing
qualified people as jurors ''veniery.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is outstanding confirmation of the academic excellence of
home-schooling,'' said Michael Farris, president of the Home School
Legal Defense Association in Purcellville, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Sealfon on New York City became the first home-schooled
winner of the national competition in 1997. This year, 27 bee
contestants were taught at home, ahead of youngsters attending
private and parochial schools and second to public school students,
178.
</P>
<P>
   This was George's third try for the spelling championship. He
tied for fourth in 1998 and finished in a third-place tie last
year. But he said a thirst for knowledge, rather than a quest for
the $10,000 top prize, motivated him to return.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was really the words. And there were 400,000 of them, '' he
said, referring to the number of entries in the official dictionary
used at the 73rd annual bee.
</P>
<P>
   George also was popular among the other spellers, who rushed the
stage after his victory. ''He's kind of shy, but he's a good guy,''
said Kevin Davis, 14, of Richmond, Va., , who was eliminated in the
opening rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Contestants are usually sponsored by their local newspaper. The
St. Louis Post-Dispatch sponsored this year's winner.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Sending Albright to Mideast  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
will visit the Middle East next week to measure progress in
Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty talks and help President Clinton
decide whether he should get involved as a mediator.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's trip was announced by Clinton on Thursday despite
growing Israeli-Palestinian tensions and uncertainty over the
resumption of the negotiations that were interrupted two weeks ago
because of an outbreak of violence in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Little progress has been made in six months of talks on the
terms of Palestinian independence, including final borders and the
status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat accused each other Thursday of foot-dragging, saying the
other was not serious about reaching an agreement by a Sept. 13
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking after a meeting with Barak in Lisbon, Clinton
acknowledged that ''tough work'' was ahead for both sides, but said
an agreement was ''within view.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright is expected to arrive in the Middle East by the middle
of next week. She will consult with Arafat and Barak, and then
Arafat will visit Washington to see Clinton. Albright will have to
make at least one more trip to Israel and the Palestinian areas
before a Camp David-style summit can be convened in the last phase
of the negotiations, said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of his term drawing near, Clinton does not have
much time to make up his mind about whether to get personally
involved in the negotiations and try to secure a place in history
as a Mideast peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Israeli official, briefing reporters on Barak's plane,
suggested that the decision would be made by the end of the month.
''The leaders who sat in the room felt it was important to advance
the peace process during the month of June,'' said the official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the gaps remain wide.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials say they recently rejected an Israeli
offer to give up more than 90 percent of the West Bank. The
Palestinians want to establish a state in all of the West Bank,
Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem -- areas Israel captured in the 1967
Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
   The thorniest issue remains Jerusalem. Barak said Thursday that
he would never relinquish Israel's control over all the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only someone who does not understand the depth of feeling of
the Jewish people for Jerusalem ... can even consider the
possibility of an Israeli concession in part of Jerusalem,'' Barak
said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations were suspended May 21 after a Palestinian firebomb
attack seriously burned a 2-year-old Israeli girl. Talks were to
have resumed Wednesday, but by Thursday evening it was not clear
whether the negotiators had met.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, meanwhile, was guardedly optimistic that after Israel's
troop withdrawal from Lebanon last week, Syria will be encouraged
to resume peace talks with Israel, the Israeli official said,
adding that Barak did not have high hopes.
</P>
<P>
   However, Barak made a new overture to Syria on Thursday, saying
that ''we respect the dignity of Syria and its sovereignty'' and
that Israel is prepared to resume talks on the principle of trading
land for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Talks broke down in January after Israel rejected a Syrian
demand that it be given control of the northeastern shore of the
Sea of Galilee, Israel's main source of water. Barak has suggested
he will give up virtually all of the Golan Heights, captured in
1967, but that he will not give Syria access to the shore.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Names 12 To Drug Kingpin List  </HEADLINE>
By KEN GUGGENHEIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A dozen foreign nationals, including six
Mexicans, inaugurated a new White House list of suspected
international drug kingpins subject to asset seizure and other
financial penalties.
</P>
<P>
   All 12 of those on the list presented to Congress on Thursday
were familiar names in the war against drugs. Most, if not all,
already are under indictment and several of the Mexicans are in
jail in their home country. A copy of the list was obtained by The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., sponsor of the 1999 Foreign Drug
Kingpin Designation Act that required the White House to prepare
the list, said it was an important step even if those named don't
hold American assets.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this tool didn't exist, even if you were under indictment
you could do business with a bank. But you cannot now,'' he said.
The law required the White House to submit the names by June 1.
</P>
<P>
   The list consisted of six Mexicans, a Burmese warlord, a Chinese
national operating in Southeast Asia, two from St. Kitts-Nevis and
two from Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Those named -- and their business associates -- will have their
U.S. assets frozen and Americans will be barred from doing business
with them. It was unclear whether any of the 12 had assets in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The law has been criticized by civil libertarians and some
business groups concerned that innocent people could be named and
would have little opportunity to clear their reputations and free
up their assets.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has also expressed concern that the list could be
politicized by its critics in Congress and innocent people could be
unfairly tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   The names released Thursday are unlikely to generate much
controversy. ''It shows that this is not going to be some loose
operation that wraps its arms around people in an unexpected way,''
Coverdell said.
</P>
<P>
   But a second part of the list, to name people and businesses
that are believed to be tied to the kingpins, could be more
sensitive. That list is being prepared by the Treasury Department's
Office of Foreign Assets Control and it is not known when it will
be released.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the law note that under an executive order the
government has been listing Colombian drug kingpins and their
associates since 1995 and few objections have been raised.
</P>
<P>
   A commission has been set up to determine whether those affected
by the law will be assured of due process.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexicans include two sets of brothers: Tijuana-based Ramon
and Benjamin Arrellano Felix are said to be leaders of one of the
most violent drug trafficking groups in Mexico, and U.S.
authorities say Jose de Jesus and Luis Ignacio Amezcua are major
traffickers in methamphetamines.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Caro Quintero, who has been jailed by Mexican
authorities, reputedly operated out of the Sonora area, while
Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, a leader in the Juarez drug operation, is
the brother of the late Amado Carrillo Fuentes, at the time of his
death in 1997 one of Mexico's most powerful drug lords.
</P>
<P>
   Also listed were Chang Chi-Fu -- also known as Khun Sa -- of
Burma; Wei Hsueh-Kang, a Chinese national who operates in Southeast
Asia; Noel Timothy Heath and Glenroy Vingrove Matthews of St.
Kitts-Nevis; and Abeni and Oluwole Ogungbuyi of Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> New Rehab May Help Stroke Patients  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Doctors have had little to offer stroke
survivors who lost the use of an arm. Now Alabama scientists report
that patients can regain some movement with special intense
rehabilitation -- forcing them to use the bad arm by tying down the
good one -- that may help the stroke-damaged brain actually rewire
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, even patients who had strokes years ago improved.
''This offers hope that people can get better ... months and years
after the damage has occurred,'' said Harvard Medical School
neurologist Dr. Seth Finklestein.
</P>
<P>
   But the study, published Thursday in the journal Stroke, has
broader ramifications: It's another illustration of how the brain
adapts after injury better than scientists once thought, part of
doctors' ultimate quest to one day spur that repair process.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are on the brink of a revolution in rehabilitation,''
predicts study author Dr. Edward Taub of the University of Alabama
at Birmingham, whose brain tests measured an almost doubling of
active brain circuitry governing patients' stroke-weakened arms.
''We are, we believe, rewiring the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts cautioned that while the rehab did help patients,
more proof is needed of just what's happening in the brain. The
National Institutes of Health has a similar study under way to
answer that question.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors once believed the brain was basically hard-wired by
early childhood, with certain areas programmed to do certain
functions, functions forever lost if cells were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   But a series of recent discoveries uncovered that the adult
brain is remarkably more flexible. Now scientists know the brain
continually adapts and reorganizes itself, a condition called
''plasticity.'' For example, brain scans of blind Braille readers
show the brain region normally responsible for vision essentially
gets taken over by the sense of touch as their fingers race across
Braille text.
</P>
<P>
   The question becomes how well adaptation occurs after injury and
whether doctors might help spur it along.
</P>
<P>
   Many stroke victims do improve with time -- younger patients with
smaller strokes have the best chance. Yet for today's more than 4
million stroke survivors, if immediate treatment didn't help their
movement, ''the common knowledge is to think there's nothing that
can be done,'' said Dr. Leonardo Cohen, whose NIH laboratory is
conducting a similar rehab study.
</P>
<P>
   Taub's study suggests intense rehab of the weakened arm helped
the brain reorganize itself to compensate for stroke damage.
</P>
<P>
   Patients had to have some residual arm movement to try the
therapy. Taub tied down each patient's good arm. Then for six hours
a day for 12 days, patients repeated arm exercises, like picking up
objects or spooning food.
</P>
<P>
   At first, forcing the arm to move is terribly hard. ''I had to
really bear down to get it to do anything,'' said 65-year-old James
Faust of Calera, Ala., who tested Taub's therapy two years after a
stroke left his arm ''hanging like a rope.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, ''one day it just looked like somebody had flipped a
switch. My right arm was doing things I was not able to do prior.''
Today Faust eats, handles lawn equipment and does other everyday
activities with his once disabled arm.
</P>
<P>
   Taub's previous studies in more than 150 patients, including
Faust, suggested improved arm motion, but many stroke experts
remained skeptical. So his new study mapped the brain function of
13 additional patients. He used ''transcranial magnetic
stimulation,'' or TMS, a powerful magnet that induces neuronal
circuits to fire to measure their activity.
</P>
<P>
   Before rehab, the area of the cerebral cortex that controls hand
movement was much smaller on the brain's stroke-damaged side. After
treatment, active circuitry on the stroke-damaged side almost
doubled, an effect that lasted at least six months, Taub reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Did the area's surviving neurons form new circuits, or did
forcing arm movement merely reawaken stroke-numbed circuits?
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't really know,'' cautioned stroke expert Dr. Gregory
del Zoppo of the Scripps Research Institute. ''But what it implies
overall is there's a potential for recovery that's already present
and isn't being tapped.''

<HEADLINE> Stanford Big Winner in Second Day  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DROSCHAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- A Stanford runner fell in the men's 10,000
meters. It was the only stumble for the Cardinal on the second day
of the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships.
</P>
<P>
   A 1-2-4 finish in the final event of the day gave Stanford 31
points Thursday at Wallace Wade Stadium, while eight-time champion
Arkansas was reeling in 16th place with five.
</P>
<P>
   ''We decided we were going to make our own definition of what
success was going to be for us,'' Stanford coach Vin Lananna said
after watching Brad Hauser win the 10,000 meters in 30 minutes,
38.57 seconds and teammate Jason Balkman come in second.
</P>
<P>
   ''We weren't going to pay attention to what anybody else was
doing. The next question is, 'Does it make any difference that
Arkansas had a bad day? I don't have any idea what Arkansas did.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford was denied its second straight 1-2-3 finish in the
10,000 when Brent Hauser became dizzy and began pulling up with
about 40 meters left.
</P>
<P>
   He dove across the finish line, but Jason Lehmkuhle of Drake
beat him for third in the slowest 10,000 in the NCAAs since 1956.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have a twin brother and you run together every day,
you want to win together,'' Brad Hauser said of Brent.
</P>
<P>
   Both will have a full day to recover before running in the 5,000
meters on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''At 150 (meters) out, he was saying, 'Hold up, hold up,''' Brad
Hauser said of Brent. ''We were going to try to cross the finish
line together. He was saying hold up and the coach was yelling that
another guy was coming. We had to get the team points.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was sad for Brent, but we got 23 points. We're on our way
to a big meet,'' Lananna said.
</P>
<P>
   The Razorbacks' chances of winning a ninth consecutive title
were damaged when shot putter Marcus Clavelle, projected among the
top three, and 10,000 runner Adam Dailey, one of the favorites who
was bumped onto the inside of the track while running fourth, both
failed to score.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a long meet, it's a long way from being over,'' Brad
Hauser said. ''We're not going to concentrate on a team score now.
This is halfway over. We got the points we needed to get. We'll go
from there.''
</P>
<P>
   While Stanford stole the team show, individual accolades went to
UCLA's Seilala Sua, who won the discus for a record fourth straight
time.
</P>
<P>
   Sua's win made her the first woman to claim the same field event
four times. Wisconsin's Suzy Favor is the only other woman to win
the same event four times, the 1,500 meters from 1987-1990, with
her final victory also coming here.
</P>
<P>
   Sua, who hoped to defend her shot put title today, also tied
Favor for the most overall outdoor NCAA titles by a woman. Favor
also won the 800 in 1990. Indoors and outdoors, Sua has six NCAA
titles, including this year's indoor shot put crown. Favor finished
her career with nine.
</P>
<P>
   ''A great accomplishment,'' UCLA coach Art Venegas said of Sua's
four wins. ''She has to get ready for the shot put, so her job is
nowhere near over, but I'm very proud of her. She has been a dream
to work with the last four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite winning by 13 feet, Sua was disappointed with her throw
of 200 feet, 9 inches. She apologized to her coach after the win,
admitting she wasn't very motivated by a lack of competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first (title) was better than the last because I didn't
throw very far,'' she said. ''But I'm happy to put my name down in
the record books. UCLA is such a great throwing school I just want
to be known for the next 20, 30 or 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In other finals, Christi Smith became the first NCAA champion
from Akron, taking the heptathlon with 5,797 points; Texas' Erin
Aldrich won the women's high jump at 6-2}; and LSU's Russ Buller
took the men's pole vault at 18-4{.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Joachim Olsen of Idaho won the men's shot put at 66-5};
Houston's Jenny Adams took the women's long jump at 21-5{; and
SMU's Libor Charfreitag won the men's hammer throw at 253-4,
breaking the 25-year-old stadium record with a throw that qualified
him for the Olympics for Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   Brigham Young was atop the women's team scoring with 23 points,
while Arkansas and Nebraska are tied for second with 18. Houston is
fourth with 16.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn was second to Stanford on the men's side, 10 points back
with 21, while Southern Methodist was third with 18.

<HEADLINE> Cease-Fire Takes Effect in Aceh  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL COONEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A cease-fire took effect today in
Indonesia's Aceh province, ending 25 years of separatist violence,
but the historic step toward more autonomy was overshadowed by a
rebel leader's assassination.
</P>
<P>
   In Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur police said unidentified gunmen killed
Teuku Don Zulfahri, head of the Malaysian chapter of the Free Aceh
Movement, while he was having drinks in a restaurant Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The motive for the killing was not immediately clear, but a
spokesman for the rebels in Aceh accused the Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   ''About five days ago he went on Malaysian television voicing
his support for the cease-fire in Aceh,'' said Free Aceh Movement
spokesman Ismail Syahputra. ''This really upset the military, so
they killed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Tono Suratman, an Indonesian military spokesman in
Jakarta, rejected the accusations. ''The Indonesian military did
not do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's Minister for Human Rights Hasballah Saad said the
killing could be a result of a factional war among the rebels.
''But I am not going to speculate as to who killed him.
</P>
<P>
   Despite anger over the killing, both sides pledged to prevent
further bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Aceh was relatively calm during the first hours of the
cease-fire today. There were no reports of clashes between rebels
and security forces.
</P>
<P>
   However, police said separatists threw gasoline bombs into a
wooden building owned by police near the provincial capital, Banda
Aceh, soon after the truce took effect at midnight. The building
was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement today, Indonesian police Col. Ridhwan Karim
and rebel leader Nashiruddin Bin Ahmad promised to ''work together
in a spirit of cooperation and goodwill to provide humanitarian
assistance to those in need and to improve the security in Aceh.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men are the highest representatives for each side on a
joint cease-fire committee, tasked with monitoring the truce.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a lasting peace in Aceh is a major test for Indonesia,
which has embarked on a painful transition to democracy and
economic reform after years of corrupt authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
   The world's fourth most populous country is made up of hundreds
of different ethnic groups and languages spread over thousands of
islands. Aceh is rich in oil and gas and many residents support
independence
</P>
<P>
   President Abdurrahman Wahid, who came to power last October, had
direct involvement in the delicate negotiations that led to the
three-month cease-fire deal signed in Geneva, Switzerland, last
month.
</P>
<P>
   He has pledged to end years of human rights abuses by the
Indonesian military in Aceh and to deliver greater political and
economic autonomy to its 4.3 million people. But he has repeatedly
rejected full independence for the province.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised address on Thursday night, Wahid said an end to
the violence would allow Aceh to develop economically and to pursue
an Islamic way of life that is regarded as more devout than in
other parts of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Since the truce was signed on May 12, 32 people, including two
soldiers and two police officers, have been killed in clashes.
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented agreement is designed to break a cycle of
violence that has raged for more than two decades in Aceh, 1,100
miles northwest of Jakarta. More than 5,000 people have died in the
past decade, 345 this year alone.

<HEADLINE> Artists Reflect on Flag Controversy  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE SMITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- In the city where the Civil War began,
in a state that after much anguish and debate will lower the
Confederate flag from atop its Statehouse, a new exhibit gives
artists a chance to reflect on race, the South and the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the Shadow of the Flag'' features works inspired by the
flag controversy along with others created decades ago by artists
including Jasper Johns and Faith Ringgold.
</P>
<P>
   ''Charleston needs to bring in work that will make a difference
without saying anything,'' said Tippy Stern Brickman, president of
the Tippy Stern gallery, where the exhibit opens today.
</P>
<P>
   ''People will walk in and look and feel -- especially with this
Confederate flag issue,'' she said. ''It's not all flags by any
means.''
</P>
<P>
   Five of the 23 works on display do represent flags, including
Ringgold's famous oil painting ''Flag for the Moon: Die Nigger
1967-1969,'' an oil of the American flag in which the word ''DIE''
can be seen dimly against the stars and the silver stripes spell
out the slur.
</P>
<P>
   The Johns work, a lithograph from the 1960s featuring a white
map of the United States on black paper, is on loan for the
exhibit. The Ringgold work, the most expensive in the show, sells
for $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shadow of the Flag'' runs through June 30, the day before the
Confederate flag is scheduled to be lowered from the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The flag controversy drew national attention as the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People called for a
tourism boycott of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the flag call it a racist symbol that was raised
atop the Statehouse in defiance of the civil rights movement.
Supporters argue that it represents their Southern heritage and
honors Confederate dead.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina is the only state that flies the flag.
</P>
<P>
   After several demonstrations and months of debate, the
Legislature decided the flag would be lowered and a similar one
placed at a nearby Confederate soldiers monument. The NAACP said
the flag's display still is too prominent, and the boycott will
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the works in the exhibit reflect the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Whole World is Watching,'' by Charleston photographer John
Duckworth, shows four photographs of a pro-flag rally and two of
Confederate re-enactors.
</P>
<P>
   Other pieces are more abstract.
</P>
<P>
   New York artist Les LeVeque took D.W. Griffith's silent
three-hour film ''Birth of a Nation,'' recorded it backward and
condensed it to 13 minutes. Amid the video's flashing images,
viewers can make out impressions of the Ku Klux Klan and of slave
auctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of like unwinding history. Racism can function
subconsciously,'' said LeVeque. ''The signs of racism rise to the
surface freed of the narrative rationalization.''
</P>
<P>
   An oil painting by a local surgeon entitled ''We Are All
Americans,'' features the American flag and the faint impression of
the blue ''X'' of the Confederate banner. Small figures also carry
the tiny flags of other nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The challenge to us is to be Americans first and then
celebrate our ethnic differences,'' said Dr. Hagerty. As a final
touch, he fired a shotgun into the canvas to rip small holes -- a
comment on the long debate about the flag.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not a simply intellectual decision,'' he said. ''There
is so much emotion. And in the South we settle our emotional
problems with shotguns.''

<HEADLINE> CDC: AIDS In Gay Drug Users Lower  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Though AIDS cases among gay men who use
intravenous drugs has declined, the government said many of them
continue to share needles and have unprotected sex -- behaviors that
spread the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday
that 5 percent of men in that high-risk group had been diagnosed
with AIDS in 1998, down from 8 percent in 1990. The decline is due
in large part from increased use of antiretroviral therapies that
delay disease progression, the CDC said.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 513 men in the high-risk group who were diagnosed
with AIDS from 1996 to 1998, showed many are taking part in risky
behavior that can spread the disease to other groups.
</P>
<P>
   The survey showed that, in the past five years, 82 percent had
used drugs, 34 percent had used intravenous drugs and 15 percent
had shared needles. It also showed that 76 percent had sex with men
and 43 percent had sex with women. Nearly half of those who were
sexually active did not use condoms.
</P>
<P>
   Studying men in this high risk group, the CDC said, was
important because they have multiple risks for contracting and
spreading the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prevention measures that have an impact on that group could
possibly prevent transmission to several different groups,''
spokeswoman Pascal Wortley said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey indicated that 85 percent of the men in the high-risk
group were 30 to 49 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-two percent of the AIDS cases among the high-risk men were
in Southern states and 51 percent in the West.

<HEADLINE> Old affair still haunting Albert Pirro  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- It happened 17 years ago, but Albert
Pirro's extramarital fling is still haunting him as he tries to get
past federal tax-evasion charges and get on with his life as a
suburban mover and shaker.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he had his DNA tested and had to acknowledge he
was the father of an Indiana teen-ager, daughter of a woman he met
a few years after marrying Jeanine Pirro, now the Westchester
district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   In the early stages of his trial, he had to endure testimony
about the money he spent on lawyers and investigators as he tried
to discredit the woman, Jessica Marciano. Prosecutors say the funds
were among the personal expenses he claimed as business deductions.
</P>
<P>
   And on Thursday, he was confronted with questions about whether
he was responsible for the airport arrest that kept Marciano away
from the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's absolute nonsense,'' he said as he arrived at federal
court in White Plains. ''It was just a question of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Pirro, a lobbyist and real estate developer, said he wouldn't
have cared if Marciano had shown up as planned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Miss Marciano and that extremely unfortunate episode in my
life happened 17 years ago,'' he said. ''It is a personal matter
between my wife and myself.''
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, who attended the trial as
usual, would not comment on Marciano's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Pirro complained that by linking the woman's paternity
case against him to the tax evasion trial, federal prosecutors were
aiding ''all the geeks out there trying to look into our personal
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his brother Anthony are accused of claiming more than $1
million in personal spending as business deductions.
</P>
<P>
   Marciano spent Wednesday and Thursday nights in the Essex County
Jail's annex for women in Caldwell, N.J., after her arrest at
Newark International Airport, where she got off a flight from Great
Britain with Pirro's 17-year-old daughter en route to attend the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Essex County spokeswoman Joanna Noonan said Marciano went by
several names and was listed in the jail as Merri Farber.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Pitz, a U.S. Customs spokeswoman, said Marciano was
taken into custody on a warrant from Brevard County, Fla., where
she was wanted for failing to pay back her victims after a
grand-theft conviction. An extradition hearing is scheduled for
today in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro said he wanted to make sure his daughter was taken care
of.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rest of it is just theater,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In court on Thursday, the deputy chief investigator in Jeanine
Pirro's office, Patrick Spatafore, testified that he runs a private
investigation company on the side. He said he was hired by Albert
Pirro to check for wiretaps on phone lines at the Harrison and
Manhattan homes of Marvin Singer, a friend of Pirro.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had the work done by two contractors -- one of them
another district attorney's investigator -- and submitted a bill for
$1,077.50 to Baumeister Enterprises, one of Pirro's companies, as
Pirro directed. That company then sent him a check for the same
amount.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, prosecutors showed the jury an invoice from
Baumeister Enterprises to Singer's clothing company, Depeche Mode,
for an ''audio countermeasure survey'' for $2,693.75. Court papers
indicate they will claim that Pirro had the amount inflated,
possibly so Singer could claim a larger deduction.

<HEADLINE> Date Set For Fiji Hostages Release  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Armed rebels holding hostages in parliament
plan to release them this weekend, the leader of the group said
today -- adding that Fiji's tribal chiefs will then have final say
over ending the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   George Speight said his rebels and the military agreed to put
two options to the chiefs: let the military keep running Fiji until
a new constitution is drawn up and elections called or allow a
civilian government led by Speight to guide Fiji to elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Council of Chiefs is scheduled to meet Monday, and in
the most positive sign yet that the more than 30 hostages will soon
be released, Speight said he wants the meeting to be ''uninhibited
or untainted by ... issues,'' including the fate of the captives.
</P>
<P>
   ''All going well, my plan is to release them before the Great
Council of Chiefs meeting,'' Speight said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the chiefs hold little formal power, they command
considerable respect and influence among the indigenous majority in
this Pacific island nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have agreed the GCC decision will be binding and we will
both abide by the outcome,'' Speight said.
</P>
<P>
   The military has not said whether it will agree to let the
chiefs resolve the dispute, but Speight was meeting today with
Fiji's martial law ruler, Commodore Frank Bainimarama, for a second
time.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, at which a delegation from the chiefs also was
present, broke up briefly but was due to continue into the evening.
In a brief statement, the groups participating said their talks
were positive and they remained resolved to reaching a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's hostages include deposed Prime Minister Mahendra
Chaudhry, the first ethnic Indian elected to the position. Speight
says he is acting on behalf of the indigenous Fijian majority and
wants Fijians of Indian ancestry barred from leading the country.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier today, about 100 Speight supporters were involved in a
standoff with troops and police outside the gates of parliament. It
was the latest in a series of skirmishes since a roving mob killed
a policeman and ransacked state-owned Fiji TV on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Agreeing to put the civilian and military government options to
the chiefs was a key development in negotiations to free the
hostages, taken May 19 when Speight and six masked gunmen stormed
parliament in the capital, Suva.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough came late Thursday after Speight met with
Bainimarama, who declared martial law and took executive control of
the country on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After that meeting, the military said the hostages would likely
be freed within 24 to 36 hours, while a Speight spokesman suggested
they would be held until after the chiefs' meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking power, the army has accepted Speight's major
demands: scrapping the 1997 constitution blamed by indigenous
Fijians for giving too much power to the ethnic Indian minority,
deposing President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara and offering Speight and
his rebels amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   Speight claims he has the chiefs' backing for the formation of a
civilian government with himself at its head.
</P>
<P>
   What appears clear is that Fiji will become an international
outcast whichever option the chiefs back.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Australia and New Zealand have all threatened
sanctions if Fiji, 2,250 miles northeast of Sydney, Australia, is
not returned to democratic rule.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Senate Hopefuls Target Voters  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- While their Democratic counterparts are
capturing most of the headlines in the race for New Jersey's open
Senate seat, four Republicans are campaigning away in relative
obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, Republicans say, the attention focused on the
primary battle between former investment banker Jon Corzine and
former Gov. Jim Florio will work in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whoever our candidate is, I think the guy is going to do very
well because the other two guys on the other side are beating each
other up,'' said Republican State Committee Chairman Garabed
Haytaian. ''When all is said and done, we don't have to do a whole
lot of opposition research on those guys. They'll have done it for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The seat is being vacated by Democrat Frank Lautenberg, who is
retiring.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the GOP has offered nothing comparable to the
extravagant Corzine-Florio fight to grab the public's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has spent $2 million a week on glossy television ads
touting his ''bold ideas,'' while Florio has crisscrossed the
state, picking up newspaper endorsements, courting traditional
Democratic groups and defending the $2.8 billion tax increase that
sent him packing after one term.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Republicans -- William L. Gormley, a state
senator from the Atlantic City area; Essex County Executive Jim
Treffinger; Bob Franks, a central New Jersey congressman, and
Ramapo College professor Murray Sabrin -- are wooing voters with
direct mail and limited television advertising.
</P>
<P>
   They have appeared together in several uneventful debates, with
negative campaigning aimed at Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''There really are two different games being played,'' said
Charlie Smith, a spokesman for the Franks campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley, 54, has a financial edge, drawing on support from the
casino industry in his district. Franks, 48, is a former state
party chairman who portrays himself as a moderate Republican in the
mold of Gov. Christie Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   Treffinger, 49, touts fiscal responsibility, while Sabrin, 53, a
one-time Libertarian, ran for governor against Whitman in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Former Republican Gov. Tom Kean is hopeful about his party's
chances.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've got probably three candidates who could very easily go
up the middle of either Florio or Corzine,'' Kean said. ''As a
Republican, I'm very optimistic this fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's cash, however, could prove a big advantage over any of
the Republicans, said political analyst and Rider University
professor David Rebovich.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is almost a mindset in the state that this is a guy that
will spend twice as much in the general campaign,'' Rebovich said.
''If a former governor can't beat him, what can four lesser-known
guys do?''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Whitman first committed to run, then backed out,
also puts the Republican candidates at a disadvantage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately,'' said Rebovich, ''they have the look of
second-string about them.''

<HEADLINE> Clarke family seeks to interview witness to 8-year-old's slaying  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Attorneys representing the family of
8-year-old Leroy Brown and his mother, Karen Clark, in a civil
lawsuit are seeking to interview the woman who claims to have
witnessed their murders.
</P>
<P>
   The family wants to talk to Josephine Lee in connection with the
federal lawsuit they have filed against Bridgeport police, claiming
authorities failed to protect the boy.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. and his mother were shot to death in January, 1999.
Prosecutors claim Russell Peeler had his brother Adrian kill the
mother and son to prevent the boy from testifying against Russell
in the 1998 slaying of Clarke's boyfriend, Rudolph Snead Jr.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday Joseph Moniz, representing the family, asked U.S.
District Judge Christopher F. Droney to allow him to immediately
take a deposition from Lee, who has told authorities she played the
role of lookout during the shootings. Moniz said he was concerned
that Lee, who has AIDS, would not be healthy enough to testify
during the civil trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's a key witness, the only eyewitness to the crime,'' Moniz
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant State's Attorney Joseph Corradino told Droney that
a deposition could interfere with the prosecution of Russell
Peeler, now on trial in the double homicide, and the later trial of
Adrian.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Laske, a lawyer defending Bridgeport against the lawsuit,
said he could be cast in the awkward role of trying to impeach
Lee's credibility during a deposition, potentially giving
ammunition to the defense in future criminal prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to be in the position of tearing her apart in a
civil deposition,'' Laske said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's credibility has come under attack in Russell Peeler's
trial.
</P>
<P>
   In letters obtained by the defense, Lee repeatedly has said she
lied when implicating the Peelers, though on the witness stand she
has dismissed the letters as lies.
</P>
<P>
   Moniz told Droney that it is hard to believe Lee could further
harm her credibility in a deposition. ''You can't get a more
damaging statement than, 'What I told you about the murders is a
lie,''' Moniz said. ''It can't get any worse than it already is.''
</P>
<P>
   Droney made no immediate ruling.

<HEADLINE> Mosquito testing begins in southern Connecticut  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The state Department of Environmental
Protection has begun trapping mosquitoes to test for the West
Nile-like strain of the encephalitis virus.
</P>
<P>
   The virus, carried by house mosquitoes, touched off a scare last
fall after killing seven New Yorkers and infecting birds in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   But since November, the virus, which in rare cases can cause
deadly inflammation of the brain, has been found in only a single
hawk that died in Westchester County, N.Y., and in a small number
of mosquitoes trapped at a single location in Queens, New York.
</P>
<P>
   The state began its seasonal trapping program Thursday. It has
doubled the number of trapping stations from 36 last season to 73
this year, DEP Commissioner Arthur Rocque Jr. told The Advocate and
Greenwich Time during a meeting yesterday in Stamford.
</P>
<P>
   Three trapping sites will be set up in Stamford and Greenwich
and two in Norwalk. Traps also will be set at two sites each in
Darien, New Canaan and Westport.
</P>
<P>
   The first mosquito test results are expected June 12.
</P>
<P>
   Because the mosquito population does not build up until late
August and early September, larvicide, a pesticide used to
eradicate mosquito larvae, has not been spread, Rocque said.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquito larvicide programs will begin in the middle of this
month and continue through next month, he said.
</P>
<P>
   All of the new trapping sites the DEP established this year are
in lower Fairfield County and New Haven County, where infected
mosquitoes and dead crows were found last year.
</P>
<P>
   Two trap types will be used in Fairfield and New Haven counties,
Rocque said. The trap designed to capture host-seeking adult female
mosquitoes will be used throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   Another, designed to trap blood-fed adult female mosquitoes,
will be used in Fairfield and New Haven counties where evidence of
West Nile virus was detected last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquito trapping will be conducted daily through October. It
takes about 10 days from the time the mosquito is caught to
identify a virus.
</P>
<P>
   State officials will notify local officials whether the virus is
confirmed in birds or mosquitoes. They will notify the public the
next day. State and local officials will work together to determine
how to increase surveillance efforts and prevention of the disease
and what actions to direct the public to take.
</P>
<P>
   Based on recommendations from the U.S. Department of Agriculture
and the CDCP, the state DEP will initiate a program to evaluate
suspicious neurological disease in domestic animals and poultry for
the West Nile-like form of the virus, Rocque said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are remarkably well prepared,'' said DEP Deputy
Commissioner David Leff. ''Decisions will not be based on
supposition or fear but on science and field results.''

<HEADLINE> Holly Hunter Praised for 'Harlan'  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Holly Hunter responded to the idea of ''Harlan
County War'' the same way viewers might on first hearing about it:
What, again?
</P>
<P>
   Hunter was being asked to star in a drama about a Kentucky coal
miner's wife; a year-long labor strike; danger, poverty and pride.
</P>
<P>
   ''But Barbara Kopple had made that amazing documentary'' -- the
Oscar-winning ''Harlan County, U.S.A.'' about the real-life mining
strike of 1973-74 -- ''so I kind of went, 'What for? Kopple's done
it,''' Hunter says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then,'' she goes on, ''I read the script, and I wanted to say
the words out loud. That's always a signal that I'm very, very
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the many scripts she reads, too many are set in her native
South. ''And that Southern material is almost always lousy,'' she
says. ''It's almost always inauthentic to me. The dialogue sounds
canned and the people are stupid.
</P>
<P>
   ''But in this case,'' she happily reports, ''I thought the
writing had an incredible integrity and the dialogue was
impeccable.''
</P>
<P>
   So off she headed last fall to Toronto (Toronto!) to make the
film, which is set in the backwoods of Appalachian coal country a
quarter-century ago. Directed by Tony Bill from the screenplay by
Peter Silverman, it premieres Sunday at 8 p.m. Eastern on Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   A touching, human portrait of a hardscrabble life, ''Harlan
County War'' swallows Hunter whole as she becomes Ruby Kincaid, the
strong, devoted wife of Silas, played by Ted Levine, who similarly
vanishes into his character.
</P>
<P>
   As Hunter discovered when she first read the screenplay, the
part of Ruby -- spirited and wry of wit -- nearly leaps off the page.
Not so Silas, who in a lesser actor's hands would come across as
little more than a 'shine-swilling victim.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ted's part was not there in the script, man,'' says Hunter,
savoring how Levine turned a hirsute shell into flesh-and-blood.
''It was a beautiful thing to watch him work.''
</P>
<P>
   Completing the dramatic triangle is Stellan Skarsgard as Warren
Jakopovich, the union organizer who, with his quiet intensity,
arouses Ruby to the struggle, and (shades of ''Norma Rae'') other
things.
</P>
<P>
   Jakopovich first encounters Ruby knee-deep in chores -- and
suspicious of his call to arms.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're just gonna sit around,'' he presses her, ''and let the
company do what they want?''
</P>
<P>
   ''Sit around?'' Ruby snaps. ''I got tah clean a house that don't
never get clean, cook up for supper, keep my young-uns from fallin'
down a mine pit, and it'd tickle the heck outta me if you'd let me
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking back on scenes like that, Hunter marvels at the speech
patterns she was called upon to mimic. ''It's incredibly musical,''
she says over tea at her Manhattan hotel. ''And it was far harder
than I thought it was going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the character she plays, Hunter is a tangy brew.
</P>
<P>
   At 5-foot-2, she combines a pixieish frame with a towering
presence.
</P>
<P>
   She is winsome one moment (''Ah, you're making me blush,'' she
says when told she looks unglamorously lovely in the film).
</P>
<P>
   The next moment, she is suffer-no-fools direct: ''I don't work
nearly as much as I'd like. No way, man. My choice is not to do
pure, unadulterated (crap). I'd much rather be home, walking my
dog.''
</P>
<P>
   These opposing forces serve her well as Ruby, just as they have
throughout two decades of diverse roles. (Compare her TV producer
in ''Broadcast News'' to her Oscar-winning performance as a mute
Scotswoman of the 19th century in ''The Piano.'')
</P>
<P>
   But Hunter, who grew up on a farm outside Atlanta, has tapped
straight into her Southernness for numerous projects, from the
stage production and film of ''Miss Firecracker'' to the feature
''The Firm'' to the HBO cable movie ''The Positively True
Adventures of the Alleged Cheerleader-Murdering Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter left Georgia a quarter-century ago, but she has never
relinquished her stake (nor the tell-tale twang in her voice).
</P>
<P>
   ''The South carries a tremendous burden of heritage, and danger,
and drama, that a lot of places don't carry,'' she says.
''Southerners have a grand view of their lives, a way of looking at
their day with enormity.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter currently lives in Hollywood with her husband of five
years, Janusz Kaminski (a cinematographer who won an Academy Award
for ''Saving Private Ryan''), and their Belgian sheepdog, Larry.
But the place she misses most is New York City and she pledges,
''We'll live here again.''
</P>
<P>
   She first moved to Manhattan in 1980 and, even for a girl
steeped in Southern politesse, she never saw New Yorkers as
off-putting. ''I find them to be very accessible, incredibly alert,
and of the world,'' she declares.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, they're always ready to express their opinion. ''I kinda
like that,'' says Hunter, flashing an impish,
as-if-you-couldn't-tell kind of smile.
</P>

<P>
   CRYSTAL-CLEAR DIRECTION: Actor Billy Crystal will direct the HBO
Films production ''61,'' the true story of the pursuit of Babe
Ruth's home-run record by New York Yankees stars Roger Maris (Barry
Pepper) and Mickey Mantle (Thomas Jane). The film's title refers to
the year that baseball commissioner Ford Frick attached an asterisk
to Maris' single-season home run record. By 1961, the American
League had expanded its season from the 154 games played in Ruth's
day, adopting a 162-game schedule. Frick ruled that there would
have to be a ''distinctive mark'' to show that it had taken Maris
162 games to break the record that Ruth had set in 154 games during
the 1927 season. The film, starting production later this month,
will debut on HBO next year.

<HEADLINE> Owner of residential care home convicted in kickback scheme  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Employees of a state-funded home for
disabled and elderly residents who were forced to give part of
their salary to their boss will get that money back.
</P>
<P>
   Under a settlement reached with the state Thursday, Camille
Frosolone of Guilford will serve no prison time for her conviction
on larceny charges. But the former owner of Yorkshire Manor will
have to reimburse her employees $8,500.
</P>
<P>
   An audit by the state Department of Social Services and
investigations by the chief state's attorney and attorney general
revealed that Frosolone forced about a dozen Yorkshire Manor
employees to pay her a part of their salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people needed the jobs, and paying the kickbacks was how
they kept them,'' said state Attorney General Richard Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Frosolone will also be required to pay the state up to $200,000
in compensation for the schemes she ran at the East Haven facility,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, Frosolone and her chief bookkeeper,
Dawn Pascale, are banned from operating any state-funded facility
or program for the next eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The state is taking control of the facility, and will sell it to
a new owner, Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   The health and safety of the 20 elderly and disabled residents
at Yorkshire Manor were not jeopardized by the scams Frosolone ran
between 1995 and 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But state dollars were spent for kickbacks, for padded
payrolls, for concealment of expenses that simply didn't occur,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state probes also turned up evidence that people were being
paid for jobs that did not exist, Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Frosolone was charged in November with first-degree larceny by
defrauding a public community, lesser larceny charges and three
counts of receiving kickbacks. Under her settlement with the state,
Frosolone pleaded no contest to one charge of second-degree
larceny. She is scheduled to be sentenced June 21.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was financially impossible for Camille to fight the state
of Connecticut in a trial,'' Frosolone's lawyer, William Bloss
said. ''By pleading no contest, she maintains that she did nothing
wrong criminally.''
</P>
<P>
   Yorkshire Manor provides housing and care to elderly, disabled
and mentally handicapped people. It is reimbursed through monthly
payments its residents receive from Social Security and the state.
</P>
<P>
   Frosolone purchased the facility in 1991 from Dawn Pascale's
father, William. At the same time, Frosolone and Dawn Pascale had a
romantic relationship and co-owned the Haven Rest Home in New
Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Frosolone and Dawn Pascale hid their relationship from the state
in order to get a higher reimbursement rate from DSS. The agency
told William Pascale that if his facility were sold to a related or
connected party, the new owner would not be eligible for the higher
rate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're putting people on notice -- especially nursing homes who
are taking care of our loved ones, our elderly,'' said Chief
State's Attorney John Bailey. ''That if you try to do this --
defraud the state of Connecticut or not give proper care -- you're
going to be arrested.''

<HEADLINE> State says inmates set cell fire  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A day after a fire in a cell at the
maximum-security Northern Correctional Institution forced the
evacuation of dozens of inmates, state and community officials
praised the prison staff's response.
</P>
<P>
   An emergency pager system alerted Somers First Selectman Gordon
Mello to Wednesday's fire during a town meeting on funding for a
new $2.2 million firehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first thought that ran through my mind was 'Gee, I hope
this is a test,' '' he said Thursday. ''Then I heard the sirens.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the quick response from the Department of Correction
and the town's volunteer firefighters, Mello said the public was
never at risk and he remained at the town meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt very comfortable continuing my duties,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A DOC spokeswoman said the investigation into the fire at the
Somers prison, about 25 miles north of Hartford, shows two inmates
set items inside their cell ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Heather Ziemba said the department was investigating to
determine what the men used to start the fire and how they got the
materials. Smoking is not allowed in Connecticut prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The two inmates were injured in the fire. Alex Sostre, 25, who
is awaiting trial for the 1999 fatal shooting of East Hartford
police Officer Brian Aselton, was treated at Johnson Memorial
Hospital for smoke inhalation. His cellmate, Pedro Poupart, 18, a
New Haven man serving 17 months for assault on a police or fire
officer, was being treated for burns to his arm and back at the
MacDougall Correctional Institution in Suffield.
</P>
<P>
   Magazines, papers, boxes, mattresses and bedding were set ablaze
in the fire, which guards spotted during routine rounds about 7:45
p.m. in a unit housing about 50 inmates. The unit includes the six
men on Connecticut's death row.
</P>
<P>
   Six guards used extinguishers to douse the flames. When 30
firefighters arrived at the Somers prison about 10 minutes later,
the fire was smoldering and the inmates had been moved to another
area, Somers fire Chief Bill Meier said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The cell was fully involved, but the fire did not spread, Meier
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ziemba said that at no time was public safety threatened or the
security of the prison compromised. Guards doused the fire and
evacuated the inmates ''within minutes,'' she said. The evacuated
prisoners were held in other secure areas of the prison for about
four hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''The firefighters never felt threatened at all,'' Meier said.
</P>
<P>
   A third inmate, Julio Gomez, 29, was treated at Johnson Memorial
after he became unruly during the evacuation and was subdued with
pepper spray, Ziemba said. The Meriden man is serving three years
for violation of probation; his record includes burglary, larceny
and drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was being evacuated for his safety and he was
noncompliant,'' Ziemba said. ''In order to get him under control
and protect him, he was restrained with pepper spray.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire marked the first time the town's firefighters were
called to the prison since 1997, when the Department of Correction
disbanded its fire department. The prison houses more than 430 of
Connecticut's worst offenders.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were sharply higher in Friday's
early trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 134 points in the early
going. Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange held a
nearly 4-1 lead over decliners.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index was ahead 150 points and the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index was up 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported that the jobless rate rose
two-tenths of a percent in May to 4.1 percent. And payrolls grew by
just 231,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices soared on the news, as have the major stock market
averages in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been looking for signs that the Federal Reserve's
rate hikes are having the desired effect of slowing the economy to
a more sustainable pace of growth.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Soar in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks soared in early trading today as a report
of weakening in the tight labor market added to a belief that
economic growth is slowing to a more sustainable, less inflationary
pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 152.15, or 1.4 percent,
at 10,804.35 in the opening minutes of trading. That added to the
129.87-point rise on Thursday, when government and private reports
pointed to slower growth and raised hopes the Federal Reserve is
nearing an end to a series of inflation-fighting interest rate
increases.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index, which rose 5.3
percent Thursday on bargain-hunting, gained an additional 188.20,
or 5.3 percent, in the early going to 3,770.70. On Tuesday, as tech
stocks rallied sharply, the Nasdaq posted a record 7.9 percent
rise.
</P>
<P>
   Prices also rose sharply in the inflation-sensitive market for
government bonds, pushing down open-market interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The cheering on Wall Street reflects relief that the Fed's six
interest rate increases in less than a year finally appear to be
having an impact on the economy and that few, if any, additional
rate hikes are needed.
</P>
<P>
   The news driving stocks higher today was a Labor Department
report that the unemployment rate climbed back to 4.1 percent in
May from the 30-year low of 3.9 percent in April. The jobless rate
rose as American businesses lost 116,000 jobs, the worst showing in
nearly nine years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the weak jobs report, the Labor Department said
that average hourly earnings rose just 0.1 percent in May, a sharp
slowdown after a 0.4 percent increase in April.

<HEADLINE> Cigarette Cos. Seek Suit Dismissal  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cigarette-makers asked a judge today to
dismiss a lawsuit by the federal government that seeks billions of
dollars to repay the cost of treating smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The government's claims ''are entirely lacking in any foundation
in law,'' said attorney Herbert M. Wachtell, representing the
tobacco companies. He said that if the lawsuit ''is not the largest
lawsuit of all time, it certainly ranks high.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is urging U.S. District Judge Gladys
Kessler to keep the case alive, arguing that the cigarette
companies pose a continuing threat to the American public's health.
</P>
<P>
   Following today's argument, it is unclear when Kessler might
rule on the cigarette-makers' bid to fend off the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's lawsuit alleges the cigarette companies
conspired since the 1950s to defraud and mislead the public about
the dangers of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   When the lawsuit was filed last September, Attorney General
Janet Reno said federal health plans spend more than $20 billion a
year treating smoking-related illnesses, which take 400,000 lives a
year. She accused the industry of putting its own profits above the
public health by concealing data that showed nicotine is addictive
and that smoking causes disease.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials vowed last fall to fight the lawsuit rather
than settle like they did in 1998 by agreeing to pay the states
$246 billion over 25 years to cover the cost of treating sick
smokers in the Medicaid program, which serves the poor and
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers filed before today's argument, the tobacco
companies' lawyers said, ''The government is asserting causes of
action for Medicare recovery that have never been recognized by any
court before, that it has never asserted before, that it has
publicly stated it does not have, and that it has to this date
never asserted against anyone other than this group of
defendants.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco industry lawyers also argue that many of the federal
government's nonmonetary demands are already required by the state
settlements, such as a ban on attempts to target children in
advertising and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department responded in legal papers that federal
law does authorize the federal government to recover Medicare
costs. The lawsuit also invoked a federal anti-racketeering law.
</P>
<P>
   ''What makes this suit unique is the conduct of these
corporations, which for decades have deliberately and successfully
addicted millions of citizens to a product that defendants have
long known causes suffering and death,'' Justice Department lawyers
said in court papers. The tobacco companies ''pose a continuing
threat to the health and well-being of the American public,'' they
added.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Jumps 192; Dow Up 174  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks soared in early trading today as the
government's employment report raised hopes that economic growth is
slowing to a less inflationary pace.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 173.74 at 10,825.94.
</P>
<P>
   That added to the 129.87-point rise in the blue-chip index on
Thursday, when government and private reports pointed to slower
growth and raised hopes the Federal Reserve is nearing an end to a
series of inflation-fighting interest rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also sharply higher for the second
straight day. The Nasdaq composite index, which rose is now trading
about 17 percent higher this week, was up 191.73 at 3774.23. It
gained more than 206 points in early trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 32.22 at 1,481.03.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the market was growing more optimistic that the
Fed's six interest rate increases since last June might finally be
having an impact on the economy and that few, if any, additional
rate hikes will be needed.
</P>
<P>
   The news driving stocks higher today was a Labor Department

   In addition to the weak jobs report, the Labor Department said
average hourly earnings rose just 0.1 percent in May, a sharp
slowdown after a 0.4 percent increase in April.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the odds have now changed and there will not be
another rate hike soon,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of
market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ''I think
the Fed will be out of our face for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading today's rally were technology stocks, with investors
snapping up shares of market leaders that have been battered in the
past few weeks. Cisco Systems gained $3.844 to $64.78, JDS Uniphase
rose $11.56 to $109.81 and Intel jumped $3.50 to $133.188.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are vulnerable to rising interest rates,
were also higher. Citigroup was up $2.81 at $66.125 and Chase
Manhattan was up $4.50 at $81.375.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 198.38 million
shares, up from Thursday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 17.80 at 510.27.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.63 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 2.13 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 2.14 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up
2.10 percent.

   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean prices pushed higher in early
dealings today on the Chicago Board of Trade on expectations of dry

   Corn also was supported by the extended forecasts, although
gains were limited by short-term weather conditions deemed

<HEADLINE> EPA Restores Acid Rain Monitoring  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Funding will be restored for the only three
sites in the nation that monitor acid levels in clouds, the
Environmental Protection Agency announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''These sites provide a real picture of what's going on in the
atmosphere. That's very helpful in keeping a long-term record of
the acid rain (prevention) effort,'' said Bob Perciasepe, EPA's
assistant administrator.
</P>
<P>
   The monitoring site in New York's Adirondack Mountains should be
operating by late June, while details for restarting the site in
Virginia's Shenandoah Mountains still are being worked out, he
said. The third site -- in Tennessee's Great Smoky Mountains -- never
stopped running because other agencies kicked in money.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported last week that the EPA had let
funding lapse for the program, which costs about $200,000 and tests
for the presence of nitrogen and sulfur in clouds and fog. EPA
officials said the 15-year-old program was always meant to be
temporary and had served its purpose of producing data scientists
could use to track acid rain.
</P>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki said Thursday that if the federal
government would not pay to continue the cloud monitoring site on
Whiteface Mountain, the state would pick up the tab.
</P>
<P>
   Acid rain is created when sulfur dioxide, produced primarily by
coal-burning power plants, and nitrogen-bearing gases, primarily
from automobiles, combine with water vapor in the atmosphere. That
creates acidic sulfate and nitrate solutions.
</P>
<P>
   While calcium and other minerals in the soil can neutralize some
of the acid, the large amounts of acid rain over the last century
have resulted in acidic lakes and streams, harming plant and animal
life.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 200 sites across the nation that test
groundwater for levels of nitrogen and sulfur. But supporters of
cloud testing say high mountains frequently are shrouded in mist
and clouds and the monitoring is necessary to keep a comprehensive
record of acid damage.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Jumps 194; Dow Up 155  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks soared today, with the Nasdaq composite
index climbing more than 200 points, as the government's employment
report raised hopes that economic growth is slowing to a less
inflationary pace.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 155.24 at 10,807.44.
</P>
<P>
   That added to the 129.87-point rise in the blue-chip index on
Thursday, when government and private reports pointed to slower
growth and raised hopes the Federal Reserve is nearing an end to a
series of inflation-fighting interest rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which rose is now trading about 18
percent higher this week, was up 194.28 at 3,776.78. It gained more
than 207 points in early trading.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also sharply higher for the second
straight day. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 26.70 at
1,475.51.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is wild on Wall Street today,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior
vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ''We are now hearing talk again
of the Nasdaq going above 4,000 and the Dow through 11,000, which
we didn't think we'd hear so soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the market was growing more optimistic that the
Fed's six interest rate increases since last June might finally be
having an impact on the economy and that few, if any, additional
rate hikes will be needed.
</P>
<P>
   The news driving stocks higher today was a Labor Department
report that the unemployment rate climbed back to 4.1 percent in
May from a 30-year low of 3.9 percent in April. The jobless rate
rose as American businesses cut 116,000 jobs, the worst showing in
nearly nine years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the weak jobs report, the Labor Department said
average hourly earnings rose just 0.1 percent in May, a sharp
slowdown after a 0.4 percent increase in April.
</P>
<P>
   Separately today, the Commerce Department reported orders to
American factories fell by 4.3 percent in April, the biggest
decline since November 1990, when the country was mired in the last
recession.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the odds have now changed and there will not be
another rate hike soon,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of
market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ''I think
the Fed will be out of our face for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading today's rally were technology stocks, with investors
snapping up shares of market leaders that have been battered in the
past few weeks. JDS Uniphase rose $9.875 to $108.125 and Intel
jumped $3.438 to $133.125.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are vulnerable to rising interest rates,
were also higher. Citigroup rose $2.813 to $66.125, Morgan Stanley
gained $6.5 to $81.75 and Chase Manhattan jumped $4.438 to $81.563.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 575.58 million
shares, up from 424.73 million shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 17.17 at 509.64.

<HEADLINE> White House Names 12 to Drug List  </HEADLINE>
By KEN GUGGENHEIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A dozen foreign nationals, including six
Mexicans, have been named to a new White House list of suspected
international drug kingpins subject to asset seizure and other
financial penalties.
</P>
<P>
   All 12 of those on the list presented to Congress on Thursday
were familiar names in the fight against drugs. All were already
under indictment and several of the Mexicans are in jail in their
home country. A copy of the list was obtained by The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., sponsor of the 1999 law that
requires the White House to prepare the list, said it was an
important step even if those named don't hold American assets.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this tool didn't exist, even if you were under indictment
you could do business with a bank. But you cannot now,'' he said.
The law required the White House to submit the names by June 1.
</P>
<P>
   The list consisted of six Mexicans, a Burmese warlord, a Chinese
national operating in Southeast Asia, two from St. Kitts-Nevis and
two from Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Those named -- and their business associates -- will have their
U.S. assets frozen and Americans will be barred from doing business
with them.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Department officials said they doubt the alleged
kingpins kept assets in their names that could be frozen, and hope
the list will lay the groundwork for cutting off their financial
resources.
</P>
<P>
   The law has been criticized by civil libertarians and some
business groups concerned that innocent people could be named and
would have little opportunity to clear their reputations and
retrieve their assets.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has also expressed concern that the list could be
politicized by its critics in Congress and innocent people could be
unfairly tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   The names released Thursday are unlikely to generate much
controversy. ''It shows that this is not going to be some loose
operation that wraps its arms around people in an unexpected way,''
Coverdell said.
</P>
<P>
   But a second part of the list, to name people and businesses
that are believed to be tied to the kingpins, could be more
sensitive. That list is being prepared by the Treasury Department's
Office of Foreign Assets Control. The date of its release is
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the law note that under an executive order the
government has been listing Colombian drug kingpins and their
associates since 1995 and few objections have been raised. The
Colombian list now consists of seven suspected kingpins and 526
people and businesses believed to be tied to them.
</P>
<P>
   A commission has been set up to determine whether those affected
by the law will be assured due process.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexicans include two sets of brothers. Tijuana-based Ramon
and Benjamin Arrellano Felix are said to be leaders of one of the
most violent drug trafficking groups in Mexico. U.S. authorities
say Jose de Jesus and Luis Ignacio Amezcua are major traffickers in
methamphetamines. Mexican authorities have failed to convict the
Amezcuas on drug or money- laundering charges and they have won
court orders blocking deportation to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Caro Quintero, who has been jailed by Mexican
authorities, reputedly operated out of the Sonora area, while
Vincente Carrillo Fuentes, a leader in the Juarez drug operation,
is the brother of the late Amado Carrillo Fuentes, at the time of
his death in 1997 one of Mexico's most powerful drug lords.
</P>
<P>
   Also listed were Chang Chi-Fu -- also known as Khun Sa -- of
Burma; Wei Hsueh-Kang, a Chinese national who operates in Southeast
Asia; Noel Timothy Heath and Glenroy Vingrove Matthews of St.
Kitts-Nevis; and Abeni and Oluwole Ogungbuyi of Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> PBS Looks Behind the Scenes on B'way  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- On television screens in three small, dark
editing rooms, Broadway's most accomplished crafts workers are
explaining what they do and how they do it -- while examples from
their shows swirl around them.
</P>
<P>
   There's Tony Walton talking about the rambling, ramshackle
county house he has designed for a revival of Chekhov's ''Uncle
Vanya.''
</P>
<P>
   There's director and choreographer Susan Stroman revealing what
she looks for in a dancer, qualities needed to make such shows as
''Contact'' and ''The Music Man'' move.
</P>
<P>
   And there's composer and lyricist Michael John LaChiusa
discussing where he got the rhythms that musically bring ''The Wild
Party'' to life.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the bits and pieces that will make up ''The First 10
Awards: Tonys 2000,'' the other Tony Awards show, or rather, the
first hour of the Tony Awards show.
</P>
<P>
   The program is the classy PBS look at how people behind the
scenes -- all of them nominated for Tonys -- help create a Broadway
show. It will be interspersed with nearly half of the more than two
dozen awards that will be handed out Sunday at Radio City Music
Hall honoring the best of the Broadway season.
</P>
<P>
   The show, produced by Thirteen/WNET New York, raises the curtain
on the Tony ceremony. It begins at 8 p.m. EDT, before handing off
the festivities at 9 p.m. to CBS and the glitzy, star-stuffed
package presided over by Rosie O'Donnell and Nathan Lane.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier hour on PBS began in reaction to the 1996 Tony
Awards telecast. It was a year in which the 22 winners were
announced at warp speed in an effort to get all the awards on the
air in less than two hours. The pace left presenters breathless,
winners nervous and viewers exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the CBS two-hour segment allows for one hour and 27
minutes of entertainment. On PBS, the Tonys get a full 60 minutes,
according to producer Mark Mannucci.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's roughly split between the presentation of the awards
and the story of the season told through five short segments that
tell us about who made it happen: score, book and orchestration of
musicals, scenic design, lighting design, costume design and
directing,'' says Mannucci, a veteran of the three previous PBS
Tony shows.
</P>
<P>
   ''On CBS, they show you the numbers, who won how many awards. On
PBS, we tell you how they got there,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not making a documentary here. Our show is put together
as an entertainment show. Where CBS has a dance number, we take you
backstage, we take you into the story behind the dance number. We
also take you to the performances -- but through our point of
view.''
</P>
<P>
   Mannucci and crew begin shooting interviews in March, even
before the Tony nominations are announced, which doesn't happen
until early May. They make educated guesses, filming likely
nominees to get a head start on the rush to ''Tony Day,'' always
the first Sunday in June.
</P>
<P>
   There are nine Tony categories aired on the PBS show -- each with
four nominees. That's 36 stories to fit into our hour. Mannucci
admits some faces will get more air time than others.
</P>
<P>
   ''This year we have some amazing clustering: Susan Stroman
nominated twice in two categories -- for director-musical and for
choreography, while Michael Blakemore is nominated for best
director of a play and of a musical.
</P>
<P>
   ''We spend a lot of time shooting these stories so we can find
the right moment, the minute that best illuminates their show.''
</P>
<P>
   They also film short segments of each nominated play or musical.
</P>
<P>
   ''We shoot the shows to make them better illuminate what the
designer does, what the choreographer does, what the director does,
what the book writer does,'' Mannucci says.
</P>
<P>
   ''We try to have our cameras give you a really privileged view
that you won't normally get by sitting in the back of the house. If
you are going to do theater on television there has got to be a
reason -- and that reason is the way you shoot a show -- with
close-ups and details that are deliciously textural and beautiful
but also tell you the story of what went on.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to get you to viscerally enjoy the power that is
theater and, at the same time, learn about what these people do.
It's this visceral pleasure in enjoying their work that we want to
get across. And to find the images that do that best takes a lot of
time and a lot of shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a miracle that a musical can get on with the thousands of
elements that have to come together at the right time and the right
place. The creators of musicals make that look effortless and we
try to do the same.''

<HEADLINE> Hearing off, new sentencing date set for killer mom  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUBURN, N.Y. (AP) -- A prosecutor has persuaded a judge to
proceed with the sentencing for a mother who burned down her house
with her 13-year-old autistic son inside.
</P>
<P>
   Cayuga County Judge Peter Corning canceled a hearing set for
Tuesday at which defense lawyers were prepared to argue that
Michelle Davis killed her son to stop his physical abuse and rapes.
</P>
<P>
   Corning, reversing his earlier position, said the hearing would
have ''limited value'' and served no purpose but to ''vilify a
defenseless victim ... and vilify an entire mentally challenged
group.'' He scheduled Davis' sentencing for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney James Vargason filed a series of objections
with the court. Police and prosecutors have said there was no
evidence to support Davis' allegations against her son.
</P>
<P>
   ''Murdering him was not enough. She now wants to shame his
existence to save herself a few years behind bars,'' Vargason said.
</P>
<P>
   Although prosecutors at one time considered bringing death
penalty charges against the 37-year-old Davis, she was allowed to
plead guilty in March to first-degree manslaughter and use an
''affirmative defense,'' which holds that she suffered from
''extreme emotional disturbance'' the night of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Davis admitted using a candle and nail polish remover to start a
fire in her Fleming home last Sept. 4, killing her 13-year-old son,
Daniel Leubner, who was asleep on the second floor.
</P>
<P>
   When Davis appeared in court for sentencing April 27, her
lawyers said she wanted a hearing to explore whether sexual,
psychological and physical abuse of her by her son was a factor in
her causing his death. Corning granted that request.
</P>
<P>
   Proof of abuse would have given Corning the option of sentencing
Davis to a lesser prison term, possibly as little as three to six
years. Without that option, she faces up to 25 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Vargason opposed the hearing. In a May 4 letter, he argued that
Davis' request violated the plea agreement they had reached.
Vargason repeated his arguments in a May 16 letter to Corning.
</P>
<P>
   In a May 22 ruling, Corning rejected Vargason's motion. He said
there was no agreement on the record regarding a promise not to
bring up the rape issue as a condition of the plea.
</P>
<P>
   Vargason repeated his arguments to Corning May 26.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe a great injustice will be done by allowing this
acknowledged murderer to put this little boy on trial,'' Vargason
wrote.

<HEADLINE> CBN Relocates Lebanon TV Workers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- Some employees of a south Lebanon
television station owned by Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting
Network are coming to Virginia as refugees in the wake of Israel's
troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The studios of religious-oriented Middle Eastern Television in
Marjayoun were seized by Islamic fundamentalists in the chaos that
followed the Israeli army's sudden pullout May 24 from a long-held
security zone, CBN officials said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 55 Maronite Christian employees at station headquarters,
seven made it to Israel with family members before the border was
closed.
</P>
<P>
   CBN officials fear the others face arrest and persecution at the
hands of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Gwartney, the Virginia Beach-based vice president of
programming for Middle Eastern Television, was heading to Israel to
help those who fled there gain passports and visas.
</P>
<P>
   They cannot go back to Lebanon, he said: ''All our employees
have arrest warrants out for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Most probably would make the trip to the United States within
two weeks, he said, and CBN will help them find homes and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of an Israeli pullout in July, the station
already had moved a satellite uplink facility from Marjayoun to
Cyprus. From there, it continues to send religious programming and
American sports and entertainment shows to 16 nations, including
Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Iran and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   CBN acquired the station -- then merely a mobile van parked in an
olive grove -- as a gift from a California ministry in 1982. The
station was car-bombed in 1983 and 1984. Rebuilt and upgraded, it
became a 24-hour satellite network in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Hostages Grow Bitter  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Anguished hostages wept while
carpenters began building them a more permanent jungle shelter
Friday, saying they could not take the prospect of a more prolonged
stay in the hands of Muslim rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The government ordered the shelter to ease the suffering of the
21 mostly foreign hostages, many of whom have become ill during
their six weeks in captivity in the southern Philippines. But it
also was seen as a sign the standoff won't end soon.
</P>
<P>
   Several captives threatened suicide if the government doesn't
negotiate their freedom soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot face this anymore,'' said Monique Strydom, a South
African woman who says she is more than three months pregnant.
''Next week I'm going to stop eating.''
</P>
<P>
   The carpenters arrived Friday along with a medical team and
several journalists at the rebels' jungle camp on the island of
Jolo.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very bad sign,'' said Risto Vahanen of Finland. ''It
means we will be here for a longer time.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to get out of here as soon as possible and I hope the
means is not through suicide or harming oneself,'' Vahanen said.
''This is a severe warning to the government: mentally we are
getting weak.''
</P>
<P>
   The hostages were seized April 23 from a Malaysian resort island
and brought to the Philippines. They have been moved to a series of
jungle hide-outs by their captors, a small Muslim rebel group
called Abu Sayyaf. They are currently living under two large tarps
-- one for the European hostages and one for the Asians -- which
don't adequately protect them from heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages consist of three Germans, two French, two Finns,
two South Africans, a Lebanese, nine Malaysians and two Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
   A separate Abu Sayyaf band is holding six Filipino children and
two teachers hostage on the nearby island of Basilan.
</P>
<P>
   Chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado said Friday the
rebels want the government to fulfill one of their demands as a
show of good will before a second round of talks on freeing the
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   In the first negotiations a week ago, Aventajado rejected two of
the Abu Sayyaf's three formal demands -- an independent Islamic
state and a commission to investigate the treatment of Filipinos in
neighboring Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels also asked that foreign fishing boats be prevented
from poaching in nearby seas.
</P>
<P>
   Aventajado scheduled meetings with coast guard and fisheries
officials to see how that could be accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want a show of good faith,'' he said. ''We'll give them a
signal that we're doing something.''
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf, the smaller of two rebel groups fighting for an
independent Islamic state in the southern Philippines, has said it
will prepare a response to the government's stance before the
second round of negotiations, expected next week. The rebels are
also expected to seek a sizable cash payment.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting between government forces and a larger rebel group, the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front, has intensified in recent months.
Those rebels are considering an offer of expanded autonomy, instead
of independence, presented in three days of peace talks that ended
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, fighting persisted Friday, with more than 30 Moro rebels
and one government soldier killed in a village in North Cotabato
province, army spokesman Capt. Noel Detoyato said.

<HEADLINE> Blast Kills 11 in Kashmir  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAMMU, India (AP) -- An explosive device went off during Shiite
Muslim religious services in troubled Kashmir on Friday, killing at
least 11 people and wounding 16, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 500 people were gathered under a tent listening to
religious sermons when the explosion occurred in Gundqasim, a
village near Pattan, 15 miles north of Srinagar, the summer capital
of Jammu-Kashmir state.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded included a former state minister, Maulvi Iftikhar
Hussain Ansari, who is also a religious leader. Ansari received
minor head injuries, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Sringar said an improvised explosive device hidden
near the dais was triggered by remote control. Ansari appeared to
be the target, since the blast occurred while he was addressing the
congregation.
</P>
<P>
   No one claimed responsibility for the attack. Police couldn't
say whether a rival Sunni sect or an Islamic militant group set off
the blast.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion created tension between the Shiite and Sunni
communities as more than 15,000 protesting Shiites marched up to
Srinagar. They later dispersed after hearing that Ansari was only
slightly wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Police rushed reinforcements to Shiite-dominated towns and
villages in Kashmir and imposed a curfew.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a dozen rebel groups have been fighting for secession
from India since 1989. India accuses Pakistan of training and
arming the militants, a charge Islamabad denies.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Politician Standoff Persists  </HEADLINE>
By GILBERT DA COSTA
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- In a bizarre standoff between Nigerian
politicians, police surrounded the residence of Nigeria's Senate
president early Friday and demanded he return two missing
ceremonial staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Chuba Okadigbo refused to hand over the maces that symbolize the
authority of the Senate, saying he had rightful custody of them. He
later blamed President Olusegun Obasanjo for the incident and
accused the government of attempting to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they acted on unidentified senators' complaints that
members of Okadigbo's security staff removed the maces from the
Senate early Thursday. The arrival of dozens of officers in the
legislative residential compound was enough to send about 20
parliamentarians to the U.S. Embassy to seek refuge.
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentarians met with embassy officials for about an
hour before deciding it was safe to return home.
</P>
<P>
   ''People can say whatever they like, but as a reasonable human
being, when I saw the situation was out of control, I ran for my
dear life,'' Diko Mohammed Samaila, a member of the House of
Representatives, said outside the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The police eventually withdrew, reportedly after Okadigbo told
them the maces had been sent to his home village in southeastern
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   The bizarre standoff followed a series of political clashes
between Okadigbo and Obasanjo, as well as some senators.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, senators protested Okadigbo's decision to go into
recess Wednesday before all House bills had been considered.
Okadigbo also clashed with Obasanjo over the declaration of May 29
-- the first anniversary of the restoration of civilian rule -- as a
public holiday. Okadigbo claimed the president did not have the
authority to make that decision and boycotted Monday's festivities.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's standoff, Okadigbo accused the president of a
''desperate attempt'' to change the legislature's leadership. ''The
time has come to alert the nation and the world at large on the
dangers that face our nascent democracy,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The government, however, said it had nothing to do with the
police's presence at Okadigbo's home.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have absolutely no intention whatsoever of intimidating the
Senate or the Senate president,'' Information Minister Jerry Gana
said.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo's election last year brought to an end 15 years of
military rule.

<HEADLINE> Army's Female 3-Star General Leaves  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army's highest-ranking woman bade an
upbeat farewell Friday with praise for progress on women's issues
and not a word about a sexual harassment investigation she
triggered by accusing another general of making an unwanted sexual
advance.
</P>
<P>
   At a retirement ceremony held 31 years to the day after she
entered the Army as a second lieutenant, Lt. Gen. Claudia Kennedy
said the institution she grew up with has made ''measured and
steady'' progress toward fairer treatment of female soldiers. She
held out hope that a woman one day will become secretary of
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our Army is filled with women and men who care and who are in
a position to change and improve the conditions under which we
serve,'' Kennedy, 52, attired in her dark green dress uniform, told
an audience of hundreds of friends, colleagues and family members
in the sun-filled center courtyard of the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, more than ever, women are a powerful force'' in the
U.S. military, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kennedy nor Army Secretary Louis Caldera, host at the
ceremony, mentioned her sexual harassment case. Army investigators
have substantiated Kennedy's claim that Maj. Gen. Larry G. Smith
made an unwanted sexual advance in 1996, but Smith has been given
time to challenge the determination.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the Army quietly rescinded an assignment for Smith as
the service's deputy inspector general. It was the public
announcement of that assignment last August that spurred Kennedy to
tell superiors about the alleged 1996 incident. Smith has been held
in administrative limbo in the intervening months.
</P>
<P>
   Among senior officials at Friday's ceremony was Gen. John Keane,
the Army's vice chief of staff, who will decide whether to take
disciplinary action against Smith. Keane is expected to give Smith
a letter of reprimand, a move that would all but assure a quick end
to Smith's 34-year Army career.
</P>
<P>
   In her remarks, Kennedy said she had more than fulfilled the
aspirations she held when she was commissioned a second lieutenant
on June 2, 1969 -- at a time when women served in a separate Women's
Army Corps.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Army ad says, 'Be all you can be.' Today I can honestly
tell you I've been all I could be,'' she said. ''I've risen further
than I ever dared to hope. All I wanted to do was be a leader and
serve my country. I never dreamed there would be stars on my
shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had served since May 1997 as the Army's deputy chief of
staff for intelligence. With her departure, the Army has no
three-star female generals.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that since she entered the Army, thousands of
positions once held exclusively by men have been opened to women,
and she said of the Army's male-dominated culture: ''It is
responsive, it is changing, and it is highly accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The change has been measured and steady,'' she said. ''But all
of this occurs within the context of societal change. The position
of women in politics, sports, religion, academia and corporate
America is expanding. I am proud to have been the first woman in
the Army to have achieved lieutenant general, and I know I will not
be the last.''
</P>
<P>
   Caldera presented Kennedy with the Distinguished Service Medal
in honor of her accomplishments, and he praised her for ''steadfast
and faithful service.'' He called her an ''invaluable role model''
for young women.
</P>
<P>
   Although Friday was her last day at work, Kennedy's official
retirement date is Aug. 1. Her departure plans were set before her
sexual harassment case became public in March.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was born in Germany, the daughter of an Army colonel.
She gained her commission as a second lieutenant after graduating
from Southwestern at Memphis, now Rhodes College, with a bachelor
of arts degree in philosophy.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Jumps 181; Dow Up 125  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks soared today, at one point sending the
Nasdaq composite index shooting up more than 200 points, as the
government's employment report raised hopes that economic growth is
slowing to a less inflationary pace.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 125.43 at 10,777.63.
</P>
<P>
   That added to the 129.87-point rise in the blue-chip index on
Thursday, when government and private reports pointed to slower
growth and raised hopes the Federal Reserve is nearing an end to a
series of inflation-fighting interest rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which is now up nearly 18 percent
this week, was up 180.52 at 3,763.02. It gained more than 207
points in early trading.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also sharply higher for the second
straight day. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 23.11 at
1,471.92.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is wild on Wall Street today,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior
vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ''We are now hearing talk again
of the Nasdaq going above 4,000 and the Dow through 11,000, which
we didn't think we'd hear so soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the market was growing more optimistic that the
Fed's six interest rate increases since last June might finally be
having an impact on the economy and that few, if any, additional
rate hikes will be needed.
</P>
<P>
   The spark for today's rally was a Labor Department report that
the unemployment rate climbed back to 4.1 percent in May from a
30-year low of 3.9 percent in April. The jobless rate rose as
American businesses cut 116,000 jobs, the worst showing in nearly
nine years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the weak jobs report, the Labor Department said
average hourly earnings rose just 0.1 percent in May, a sharp
slowdown after a 0.4 percent increase in April.
</P>
<P>
   Separately today, the Commerce Department reported orders to
American factories fell by 4.3 percent in April, the biggest
decline since November 1990, when the country was mired in the last
recession.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the odds have now changed and there will not be
another rate hike soon,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of
market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ''I think
the Fed will be out of our face for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks led today's rally, with investors snapping up
shares of market leaders that have been battered in the past few
weeks. JDS Uniphase rose $10.188 to $108.438 and Intel jumped
$3.125 to $132.813.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are vulnerable to rising interest rates,
were also higher. Citigroup rose $2.50 to $65.813, J.P. Morgan
gained $6.563 to $138.50 and Chase Manhattan jumped $3.50 to
$80.625.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 806.84 million
shares, up from 621.22 million shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 16.30 at 508.77.

<HEADLINE> OAS Finds Flaws Haiti Vote Count  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- In the latest hitch in Haiti's
problem-plagued election, the Organization of American States
questioned Friday how the winners were determined.
</P>
<P>
   Joining opposition politicians who have cried foul, the OAS said
it found flaws in how the winning percentages in the May 21 local
and legislative elections were calculated.
</P>
<P>
   According to partial returns from the election, former President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide's Lavalas Family party seized control of
Haiti's Senate, sweeping 16 of 17 seats at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ''The percentages attributed to leading senate candidates
reveals a very serious error,'' Orlando Marville, chief of the OAS
election observer mission, said in a letter to Haiti's electoral
council. He asked officials to recalculate the percentage of votes
won by all candidates -- a procedure that could force several
declared Senate winners to run in a second round of voting.
</P>
<P>
   The request was the latest snag in the problem-plagued voting
process of an election that was widely seen as a last chance for
democracy in this impoverished Caribbean nation of 8 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   Marville did not deny that most voters cast their ballots for
Aristide candidates. But he questioned whether several Lavalas
winners obtained an absolute majority of votes needed to avoid a
runoff.
</P>
<P>
   The election council vice president, Debussy Damier, appeared to
agree.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems the council miscalculated the percentages,'' he said.
He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Lavalas militant Patrick Norzeus claimed the council was being
pressured to reduce the number of first-round Lavalas Senate
victories from 16 to six.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Christian Movement for a New Haiti party claimed
that the council declared winners in at least eight Senate races
where none of the candidates won more than 50 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Party spokesman Ernest Colon said the council apparently counted
the votes of only the top four contenders and not the others who
ran and may have gotten a few votes. Those missing votes would
create an erroneous winning percentage count.
</P>
<P>
   One of the declared Senate winners, Lavalas' Yvon Neptune, urged
Haitians in a radio interview Thursday ''to be vigilant, so that no
one will subtract a single one of the people's votes, so that no
one will try to say two and two make five.''
</P>
<P>
   Haiti hasn't had a Parliament since President Rene Preval shut
it down in January 1999 after an 18-month standoff with opposition
senators.
</P>
<P>
   Some 145 candidates contested 19 seats in the 27-seat Senate,
which has eight incumbent senators. The entire 83-seat lower house
was up for election. Partial results show more than 20 Lavalas
Family lower house candidates won in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Most opposition parties accuse Lavalas of working to establish a
totalitarian state, and they warn they will boycott the second
round of voting scheduled for June 25. The opposition says Lavalas
intimidated opposition candidates before the election, denying them
a level playing field.
</P>
<P>
   At least 15 people -- most opposition activists -- were slain in
political violence before the election, and about 34 opposition
candidates and activists were arrested afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide was elected in 1990 but was overthrown in a 1991
army-backed coup. U.S. troops restored him to power in 1994, but
Haitian law barred him from seeking a consecutive term in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide is expected to be a candidate again for president in
November and is expected to win easily.

<HEADLINE> US-German Custody Disputes Expedited  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Germany's justice minister said Friday a new
working group approved by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and
President Clinton should help speed up resolution of
German-American child custody disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The working group, comprised of officials from both countries,
will look into setting policies to deal with all cross-border
custody complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Herta Daeubler-Gmelin denied allegations from
some U.S. interest groups that German authorities illegally keep
German-American children from dissolved German-American marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's always terrible when a father and a mother use the child
as a weapon when they are fighting,'' she said on ARD television.
</P>
<P>
   The German Justice Ministry put the current number of custody
cases involving parents who have split up, with one living in
Germany and the other in the United States, at about 66.
</P>
<P>
   International child custody disputes recently got political
attention in the United States and elsewhere when the U.S. State
Department and Congress said Germany and several other signatory
countries of the 1980 Hague Convention on abducted children were
not abiding by the agreement, which requires they be returned to
the country they are accustomed to living in.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is seen as more acute in Germany because the
presence of U.S. troops here over decades led to thousands of
German-American marriages.

<HEADLINE> Census-Takers Seek the Final 8.6M  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Armed with stacks of blank questionnaires,
census-takers head back to big-city neighborhoods, gated
communities and isolated farm houses in their final attempt to find
people who still haven't been counted in Census 2000. Their
mission: Track down 8.6 million households by early July.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest tool for census-takers may be their persuasiveness --
how well they can convince the wary to answer their questions: What
is your race? Do you own or rent?
</P>
<P>
   It won't be easy, Census Director Kenneth Prewitt admits.
</P>
<P>
   ''The task of the Census Bureau is to knock on every door. The
good news is we have the resources to do that,'' Prewitt said at a
recent news conference promoting the count. A majority of the
remaining cases are in urban areas -- places with people harder to
track down, more high-rise apartment buildings and higher
concentrations of minority groups that have traditionally been
undercounted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tough job now is trying to get to those people,'' Prewitt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Neomi Thomas, a 30-year-old mother of four, says she is up to
the task. She works as a census-taker in neighborhoods close to her
Baltimore home and is the type of worker Census officials sought to
attract in urban areas-- determined and familiar with how to deal
with her big-city neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest challenge is to talk to people and get them to
realize how important it is to be counted,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Prewitt is pleased with how the once-a-decade count is
going. More than 93 percent, or about 111.4 million of country's
120 million households have now been accounted for, either through
a mailed-back form or through information gathered in person at the
front door.
</P>
<P>
   Some households may initially get counted more than once, either
because the family has more than one home, or answered enumerator
questions even after mailing back a form. In that case, the Census
Bureau considers the official form for that household the one with
the most complete information and discards the others.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the people in the missing 8.6 million households that
enumerators are now concentrating on. Their targets include
anti-government people, and those hesitant to cooperate out of
privacy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest push will be in certain urban areas like Chicago,
where Census officials will bring in more staff and put new radio
and TV ads on the air. Prewitt will visit Chicago, New York,
Milwaukee and Columbus, Ohio, to help boost efforts there.
</P>
<P>
   Some cities, like Los Angeles and Boston, are ahead of schedule
to the point where some Census Bureau offices are about to close a
month early. Others like Chicago and New York have a high number of
high-rise apartment buildings where enumerators may have a hard
time getting past the doorman, Census spokesman Steve Jost said.
</P>
<P>
   Urban areas also tend to have a higher concentration of
immigrant populations who may be wary of giving information to the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Throughout Chicago, many people have not been counted. They
live in our neighborhoods and downtown,'' Chicago Mayor Richard
Daley said at a news conference Thursday. For the next month, ''We
are pulling out all the stops,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though it will be up to people like Katania Hall, a
Census crew leader in Baltimore to finish the task. She's confident
she can in spite of the slammed doors and icy stares she might
encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ''Almost anything you can imagine, my enumerators have heard,''
Hall said. ''But we are confident we can reach everyone.''

<HEADLINE> Poland Honors Opposition Leader  </HEADLINE>
By MONIKA SCISLOWSKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Poland paid homage Friday to its postwar
opposition leader, Stanislaw Mikolajczyk, a symbol of
anti-communist resistance whose remains were returned from the
United States after a half-century in exile.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are back in Poland, where your steadfastness and courage
are in high esteem,'' Parliament Speaker Maciej Plazynski said
during a ceremony at Warsaw's Okecie airport after the wooden
coffin arrived from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Mikolajczyk, prime minister of Poland's government-in-exile
during World War II, returned after the war to lead the Polish
Peasant Party. It was the only political force in Poland not
controlled by the communists.
</P>
<P>
   He later fled to the United States to escape communist
persecution, and was active in Polish emigre politics until his
death in Washington in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   He was escorted home by a Peasant Party delegation and his son,
Marian. ''We are very grateful for the recognition of my father's
merits,'' the younger Mikolajczyk said.
</P>
<P>
   The coffin, which also contains the remains of Mikolajczyk's
wife, Cecylia, was taken to the Warsaw Royal Castle, where hundreds
of Poles came to pay their respects.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an important moment in the history of Poland's
democracy,'' said Jadwiga Styczkowa, 78, a retired farmer who laid
red flowers at the foot of the coffin.
</P>
<P>
   Mikolajczyk was the only senior Polish politician who dared
return to communist-controlled Poland in 1945. He revived the
Peasant Party and reluctantly became deputy prime minister and
agriculture minister.
</P>
<P>
   Many historians say communist officials tolerated him only as a
token they could use to counter charges they had instituted
single-party rule. He was forced to flee after the communists
rigged the 1947 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The return of his remains became possible after the communist
regime was toppled in 1989. Poland's parliament formally approved
his reburial in his hometown, Poznan, in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Mapping Lebanon Becomes Political  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   METULLA, Israel (AP) -- Sweat dripping from the end of his nose
as he labored under a blazing midday sun, Moshe Bar craned his neck
and squinted, trying to sight a straight line along the new fence
he was helping to build between Israel and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good fences, good neighbors,'' he shouted over the din of a
portable generator, sounding more like New England poet Robert
Frost than a rough-hewn Israeli building contractor.
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle East, though, neighbors have never found it a
simple matter to draw a dividing line between them.
</P>
<P>
   Since the last Israeli troops and tanks rolled out of southern
Lebanon on May 24, defining the new frontier between the two
countries has become an exercise not only in geography, but
geopolitics.
</P>
<P>
   Using yellowed maps and satellite technology, U.N. cartographers
have been redefining the colonial-era frontier that meanders from
the Mediterranean coast to the foothills of the Golan Heights,
slicing its way through stony hills, bisecting backyards, halving
orchards, even dividing a village.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. verification of Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon, expected
within a matter of days, hinges on agreement that the Israelis have
fallen back to the internationally recognized border -- drawn in
1923 by Britain, which administered then-Palestine, and France,
which had dominion over what are now Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   As the modern-day mapmakers have gone about their task, defining
the 50-mile frontier with splashes of paint and stone markers,
conflicting claims have bubbled to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Geographers say some ambiguities stem from the simple fact that
human beings leave their mark on the landscape -- they build roads,
change the direction of watersheds, fill in riverbeds, plow away
hilltops, eradicate landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It becomes a question of translating the map of then to the
reality of today -- a physical reality that in some areas has
changed,'' said Amnon Kartin, a professor of geography at Tel Aviv
University.
</P>
<P>
   Such questions involve mainly small parcels of land. But bigger
regional disputes also have come into play.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, which effectively runs Lebanon, has been a dominant force
in discussions about the border. The Syrians initially demanded
that the United Nations not verify Israel's withdrawal unless it
ceded to Lebanon a strip of land in the foothills of the Golan
Heights known as the Chebaa farms.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, backed by the United Nations, says the territory is
irrelevant to its border with Lebanon, because it was won from
Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
   This week, pressed by a U.N. envoy, Syria grudgingly agreed to
accept the U.N. position -- but the Damascus government made clear
it would continue to seek sovereignty over Chebaa either for itself
or Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Also unresolved is the fate of the Israeli border village of
Ghajar. Its 1,800 people, who are mainly Alawites, a fringe Muslim
sect, were dismayed to learn that according to the 1923 border,
part of their community apparently lies in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't make sense, my sister in one country and I in
another,'' said Adel Shimali, a 41-year-old Ghajar resident, who
showed the family's crumbling and creased original land deeds,
dating to Ottoman times.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, tensions have also surfaced between Lebanon and
the United Nations over the demarcation. Lebanon's state-run
National News Agency reported a charged atmosphere in closed-door
talks this week between Lebanese officials and U.N. cartographers,
with the Lebanese raising accusations of pro-Israel bias on the
United Nations' part.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's army is still grappling with the problem of how to
defend the new border. After its incursions into Lebanon in 1978
and 1982, Israel altered the border based on military
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   When Israeli troops occupied southern Lebanon, they could seize
strategic hilltops as they pleased. With the new demarcation line,
though, the army finds itself occupying low ground at some points
along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy Israeli troop reinforcements are in place, although mainly
staying out of sight to avoid inflaming tensions. At the Israeli
border community of Mishgav Am, a lone 20-year-old soldier named
Amir patrolled the frontier fence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, I'm all alone, but if anything happens, my friends will
be here in a minute,'' he said, waving his hand-held radio.
</P>
<P>
   The new fence -- nearly finished in some areas, still under
construction in others -- will have an array of high-tech defenses,
including motion sensors.
</P>
<P>
   That's not enough to satisfy some residents, who pressed for
Israel to keep a narrow buffer zone of a few hundred yards after
the withdrawal rather than reverting to the international border.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very, very vulnerable to infiltration attacks,'' said
Ron Hazan, a former security chief for the northern communities'
regional council.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli leaders, though, said keeping even a small slice of
Lebanese territory would have scuttled any chances for U.N.
verification of the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   In the days immediately following Israel's pullout, there was a
free-for-all on both sides of the frontier, with people from either
side -- some armed, many angry -- able to walk right up to the border
fence.
</P>
<P>
   After a few flare-ups of violence, both sides -- Israeli troops
on the one side, Hezbollah guerrillas and Lebanese police on the
other -- are now restricting movement along the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   That may bring an end to the daily reunions of Palestinians in
Israel with relatives in Lebanon. Separated by a pair of fences and
a narrow strip of no man's land, relatives who have not seen one
another for years toss fruit and flowers back and forth and
exchange shouted greetings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm so happy,'' said Omar Khassem, who lives in Israel. On the
other side of the fence, pressing against the barbed wire, were his
uncle and aunt, who live in a refugee camp in Lebanon. Both were
crying.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't touch them,'' said Khassem, holding up his small son,
Said, for his relatives to see. ''But I can hold them in my
heart.''

<HEADLINE> Putin Defends Central Gov't Plan  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Trying to reassure wary regional leaders,
President Vladimir Putin promised Friday that his efforts to
strengthen the central government wouldn't infringe on their
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Putin met with regional governors at the Kremlin and assured
them that his newly appointed regional envoys wouldn't try to
control all local affairs.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was ''thinking with concern'' about his
representatives getting too much power and offered to open up
discussion on ways to balance their power. He added that his moves
''wouldn't infringe on the regions' rights.''
</P>
<P>
   But he gave no indication that he was backing away from his plan
to rein in provincial governments.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has divided Russia into seven administrative zones, each
of which would be supervised by a presidential representative. The
system replaces an arrangement under which the Kremlin had a
representative in each of the 89 regions, which Putin called
ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main function of the presidential representatives would be
to streamline the action of the federal authorities in the
region,'' Putin said. ''The regional level of government must not
be weakened.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who was elected president in March, has made
strengthening federal control over Russia's independent-minded
provinces a top priority. He says the plan is necessary to fix the
ailing economy and keep Russia from breaking up.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would strip governors and heads of regional
legislatures from being members of the Russian upper house;
representation in the house would instead be given to full-time,
appointed legislators. It also provides for the president to
dismiss elected governors and dissolve local legislatures that
violate federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctant to confront Putin openly, most governors and
legislators have praised the plan and only a few dared to complain.
The strongest criticism so far has come from tycoon Boris
Berezovsky, a member of the lower house of parliament, who
denounced Putin's plan as a step toward dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Some news media reports suggested that Berezovsky is trying to
protect his business interests in the regions and preserve the
clout he enjoyed under Russia's former president, Boris Yeltsin.

<HEADLINE> State hopes to lure new anglers with free fishing day  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Using free tackle and lessons as bait,
the state hopes to reel in new anglers during Free Fishing Day on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The requirement that people over 16 buy a license to fish will
be suspended statewide and, at nearly a dozen sites, instructors
and equipment will be provided.
</P>
<P>
   Devoted anglers say such programs are the surest way to attract
new fans to a sport that has seen waning interest in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't have someone telling you where to go, how to get
started, you get frustrated,'' said Pete DeGregorio, who runs Dee's
Bait Shop in New Haven. ''What makes the population of fishermen
grow is when you get that novice come in, you teach him and he's
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's events are part of the 14th annual National Fishing
Week, sponsored by a nonprofit coalition of state and federal
agencies and the sportfishing industry. More than 2,000 clinics,
derbies, festivals and open houses are planned this weekend and
next in 41 states and the District of Columbia, organizers say.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Environmental Protection, which has been
participating in the program since its inception, estimates a few
thousand would-be anglers and others just looking for a day
outdoors will take part.
</P>
<P>
   ''The program's designed to bring families out,'' said George
Babey, a fisheries biologist with the DEP.
</P>
<P>
   There will be lessons on flycasting, prizes for large catches
and tours of state fish hatcheries. The state has stocked 300
rivers and streams and 80 lakes with some 476,000 fish this spring,
and because of high-running waters early in the season, there are
still plenty of big ones still out there.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers have tried to improve the odds for the rookies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We pick sites where we know there are a lot of fish that are
pretty hungry,'' Babey said.
</P>
<P>
   The state is just beginning to bounce back from a decline in the
number of fishing licenses sold. In 1995, the state issued 189,000
licenses; by 1997, that number had dropped to 175,000. This year,
185,000 of the $15 licenses have been sold, Babey said.
</P>
<P>
   Babey attributes the decline to the lingering effects of the
recession of the early 1990s, when the state lost many
manufacturing jobs and residents. But children who attended years
of DEP programs are now coming of age and fueling the resurgence in
fishing licenses, Babey said.
</P>
<P>
   Others say that the scores of other activities available to
children and adults has taken some people away from fishing. But
the state has won some fans back by releasing bigger fish, and more
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Devotees say that while fishing may seem old fashioned, it's a
sport that should be promoted because it transcends the barriers of
age and economic means.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can pay $2 for worms and $10 for a rod or you can buy a
$5,000 outfit,'' DeGregorio said. ''And whether you're young or
old, a fish doesn't care.''

<HEADLINE> Port Authority approves Maersk lease, study for rail, toll increases </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A giant shipping line can begin expanding its
East Coast superport. The World Trade Center can open its doors to
private developers. And, down the line, commuters may pay more in
rail fares and bridge tolls.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey cleared its table
of old business Friday, approving a $200 million lease with the
Maersk shipping line, creating a $250 million fund for New York
transportation projects and allowing privatization of the World
Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   The bistate agency also agreed to begin a six-month review of
fares on the PATH commuter rail line, the tolls for the six
interstate bridges and tunnels linking New Jersey and New York and
the fees that commuter buses are charged to park at the authority's
Manhattan bus terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation officials predicted the review would likely lead
to an increase of the $1, one-way PATH fare and the $4 toll at the
Hudson River crossings.
</P>
<P>
   After months of largely unproductive board meetings, the
authority's commissioners unanimously approved 18 items of business
in a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've reached a level of fairness between the two states,''
said Charles Gargano, the authority's vice chairman and appointee
of Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting came one day after the governors of both states
settled a 17-month feud believed to be the worst in the history of
the 79-year-old bistate agency, which controls the New York City
region's three airports, interstate crossings, shipping piers and
properties such as the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki had said that New Jersey benefited more from Port
Authority revenues, especially with the Maersk lease at Port
Newark-Elizabeth and the low fares on the money-losing PATH line.
Whitman countered that any project on either side of the river
benefited both states.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki initially voiced objections to the Maersk lease, and
Whitman retaliated by refusing to approve the World Trade Center
privatization and leasing of development rights above the Manhattan
bus terminal, both projects sought by New York.
</P>
<P>
   Authority Chairman Lewis Eisenberg, a Whitman appointee,
disputed reports that the agency completed no business during the
standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no item was more important than the 30-year lease with
Maersk, the world's largest shipping carrier that last year courted
bids to relocate its East Coast hub in Baltimore before deciding to
stay at the Port of New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Officials had said the future of the port, with 1,000 jobs and
billions in business for both states, was at stake if Maersk took
business elsewhere. The Madison-based company had held off on
improvements it had pledged to pay for at the terminals until the
lease was approved.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will now move forward quickly in partnership with the Port
Authority to construct the premier gateway to world trade for the
Northeast market sector,'' Maersk President and CEO Tommy Thomsen
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioners also agreed to develop a five-year capital
plan as part of its study of commuter fares and tolls. Eisenberg
said increased revenue could fund projects like an underground
freight tunnel that would help reduce truck traffic on increasingly
crowded roads.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation advocates appeared to agree that it was a time
for a fare increase. PATH fares have not gone up since 1987, and
bridge tolls have not been raised in nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Such increases are reasonable but should occur together, said
John Orcutt, associate director of the Tri-State Transportation
Campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you increase the PATH fare by 50 cents, you wouldn't bring
in a whole lot of dough in Port Authority terms,'' said Orcutt, who
said that the tolls would be much more lucrative for the authority.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that the agency pair the PATH increases to make the
fares compatible with the New York City transit system's MetroCards
or NJ Transit's new light rail line.

<HEADLINE> Horn of Africa Peace Talks Tesume  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLAS MARMIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- Talks on finding a peaceful end for the
Horn of Africa's two-year border war resumed Friday as Ethiopia and
Eritrea continued to trade allegations of fighting on the eastern
front.
</P>
<P>
   Algerian Justice Minister Ahmed Ouyahia, the chief mediator, had
convened discussions Thursday in the Algerian capital, handing both
teams an offer on ways to prevent new military clashes during
Ethiopia's proposed pullout from Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   Ouyahia met Friday afternoon with Ethiopian Foreign Minister
Seyoum Mesfin and later held talks with Eritrean Foreign Minister
Haile Weldensae. The current talks are focusing on the need for
security guarantees to keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Eritrean Radio reported Friday that Ethiopian war
planes bombed the main water depot at Assab port on the Red Sea,
according to the Eritrean Visafric news agency. It also said the
Eritrean army had repulsed an Ethiopian attack near Ksad Ika in
southern Eritrea, ''putting 2,500 Ethiopian soldiers out of
action.''
</P>
<P>
   Selome Taddesse, the Ethiopian government spokeswoman, denied
the allegations. ''There has been no bombing today,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Selome said an Eritrean division had attacked
Ethiopian positions at Ailagundet and Ksad-Ika but had been
repulsed.
</P>
<P>
   The two impoverished countries' war over disputed lands near
their 620-mile border has cost hundreds of millions of dollars and
tens of thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
   The warring sides had long been in agreement on a peace deal,
but not on the mechanics of implementing it. With the deal still up
in the air, Ethiopia sent its forces into Eritrea on May 12, saying
they would stay there until they had reclaimed all land it claimed
along the border and broken the Eritrean army's ability to contest
the matter further.
</P>
<P>
   In the days that followed, Ethiopia broke through Eritrea's
western and southern borders with surprising ease, pushing miles
deep into the country. Eritrea then pulled out of territory claimed
by its neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia has said it is ready to withdraw from undisputed
Eritrean land captured during the 19-day offensive if its neighbor
joins in a cease-fire. Ethiopia also said Thursday that it was
ready for direct talks -- a key step forward. But Eritrea was
holding out.
</P>
<P>
   The two delegations have not met face-to-face. Their remarks
have been mediated by the Organization of African Unity, whose
presidency is currently headed by Algeria. The group also presided
over a first round of talks that collapsed May 4.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration special envoy Anthony Lake, the former
U.S. national security adviser, and Italian Undersecretary of State
Rino Seri, the European Union representative, also played key roles
in the discussions.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Jumps 224; Dow Up 138  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks soared today, sending the Nasdaq
composite index up more than 200 points, as the government's
employment report raised hopes that economic growth is slowing to a
less inflationary pace.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was up 138.10 at 10,790.30.
</P>
<P>
   That added to the 129.87-point rise in the blue-chip index on
Thursday, when government and private reports pointed to slower
growth and raised hopes the Federal Reserve is nearing an end to a
series of inflation-fighting interest rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which has gained roughly 18 percent
this week, was up 223.68 at 3,806.18.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also sharply higher for the second
straight day. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 24.00 at
1,477.81.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is wild on Wall Street today,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior
vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ''We are now hearing talk again
of the Nasdaq going above 4,000 and the Dow through 11,000, which
we didn't think we'd hear so soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the market was growing more optimistic that the
Fed's six interest rate increases since last June might finally be
having an impact on the economy and that few, if any, additional
rate hikes will be needed.
</P>
<P>
   The spark for today's rally was a Labor Department report that
the unemployment rate climbed back to 4.1 percent in May from a
30-year low of 3.9 percent in April. The jobless rate rose as
American businesses cut 116,000 jobs, the worst showing in nearly
nine years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the weak jobs report, the Labor Department said
average hourly earnings rose just 0.1 percent in May, a sharp
slowdown after a 0.4 percent increase in April.
</P>
<P>
   Separately today, the Commerce Department reported orders to
American factories fell by 4.3 percent in April, the biggest
decline since November 1990, when the country was mired in the last
recession.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the odds have now changed and there will not be
another rate hike soon,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of
market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ''I think
the Fed will be out of our face for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks led today's rally, with investors snapping up
shares of market leaders that have been battered in the past few
weeks. JDS Uniphase rose $13.438 to $108.438 and Intel jumped
$4.375 to $134.063.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are vulnerable to rising interest rates,
were also higher. Citigroup rose $2.813 to $66.125, J.P. Morgan
gained $6 to $137.938 and Chase Manhattan jumped $3.813 to $80.938.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 935.39 million
shares, up from 734.80 million shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 18.48 at 510.95.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Decries 'Obedience' to US  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic urged
Europe on Friday to stop blindly following the United States and
its ''insane ideas to rule the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting with former Greek Foreign Minister Carolos
Papoulias, Milosevic also counseled European states that going
along with the policies of the United States damages the whole
continent, particularly the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting with Papoulias, which was reported by Serbia's
official television, was a rare opportunity for Milosevic to
receive a foreign dignitary. The Yugoslav president and his
government have been isolated from the West because of his
indictment by the United Nations war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The blind obedience which the governments of the European
Union show toward the dictate of the American administration is
causing great damage to the whole European continent, and
particularly to the Balkans,'' Milosevic said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be logical that the governments of the European
states above all take care of the interests of their own nations
rather than the interest of the American administration and its
insane ideas to rule the whole world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's comments Friday were the second time this week that
the Yugoslav president has called on Europe to resist what he
termed U.S. domination. His remarks were an apparent attempt to
soften the blockade of his country, imposed at the urging of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, as he inaugurated a new bridge over the Danube to
replace one of the three destroyed by NATO during last year's
bombing of Yugoslavia, Milosevic said Europe should be proud of
Serbia's achievements in rebuilding the country. He then called
Serbia ''the most European country in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO bombed Yugoslavia last year to force Milosevic into
accepting a peace plan for Kosovo and ending his crackdown against
ethnic Albanian rebels there.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav province has been ruled by an international
administration since last June. Milosevic and his four aides were
indicted last year by the war crimes court in The Hague for
atrocities committed by Serb forces in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Killer gets 70 years for shooting bystander who intervened  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAYS LANDING, N.J. (AP) -- A man who gunned down a bystander in a
parking lot shooting was sentenced to 70 years in prison Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Carnell Gibbs, 24, of Pleasantville will have to serve at least
59{ years before becoming eligible for parole.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 22, 1998, Gibbs confronted a man who had allegedly been
bullying and threatening him and drew a 9 mm pistol, shooting him
more than a dozen times.
</P>
<P>
   As Gibbs was emptying his gun into the man, bystander Alex
Crawford rushed up to Gibbs to stop him. With that, Gibbs shot
Crawford twice, killing him. The original target, John Byrd, 27,
survived.
</P>
<P>
   ''Alex Crawford was an innocent bystander, a Good Samaritan,
somebody who was trying to stop things when they'd gone out of
control,'' said Assistant Atlantic County Prosecutor Cary Shill.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, a jury convicted Gibbs of murder, attempted murder,
conspiracy to commit aggravated assault and weapons charges in the
attacks, which occurred outside Wash's Inn, a bar on Route 9 in
Pleasantville.
</P>
<P>
   In court Friday, his lawyer urged Superior Court Judge Robert
Neustadter to grant Gibbs a new trial because of jury misconduct.
Two jurors in the trial were distant relatives of Gibbs' and may
have voted to convict him to settle an old grudge, lawyer Scott
Becker told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Neustadter rejected the request, saying the jurors were polled
before being seated, and none mentioned any prior relationship with
Gibbs.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs himself was unaware of any relation to jurors, and his
lawyer only found out after the trial, when Gibbs supporters wrote
letters to the judge to complain about the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Neustadter called the misconduct allegations ''scatter-gun
assertions'' that were not substantive enough to call the jury back
for questioning. The evidence against Gibbs was overwhelming, but
there was no indication the jury did anything improper, Neustadter
said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge likewise ignored in-court mercy pleas by Gibbs' mother
and a preacher who has known his family for years.
</P>
<P>
   ''This young man's gotten a bad deal,'' said the Rev. Willie
Williams, of Easton, Pa. ''He was raised right, but he was put in
an awkward situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Shill said Gibbs deserved stiff, consecutive sentences because
there were two victims who were shot independently of each other.
Byrd, who suffered a broken leg, broken arm, fractured sternum and
other injuries, is still undergoing rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   As Gibbs' mother sat sobbing in the gallery, Neustadter imposed
a 50-year term for Crawford's death and a 20-year term for wounding
Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Crawford, poor thing, is dead from trying to stop it
all,'' Neustadter said.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford's mother, Katherine Crawford, 50, was satisfied with
the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wanted justice to be served, and it was. But it's not
going to bring back my son. And it's not going to give my grandson
his father back,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Official Urges American Visits  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- A senior Cuban official told three visiting black
U.S congressmen on Friday that Americans with questions about
Cuba's human rights record should demand that their government let
them visit the island to see for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not hiding anything,'' Government Minister Ricardo
Cabrisas said. ''People should come to see if they have questions.
Why don't you demand your right to freely travel to Cuba as
guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution?''
</P>
<P>
   Americans are barred under U.S. law from going to Cuba as
tourists but visits of a professional nature are permitted. Tens of
thousands of Americans visit Cuba every year.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrisas spoke after Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., said he was
anticipating questions other House members would ask next week when
they take up a measure to partially lift the 38-year-old U.S.
embargo against the communist country. A provision in an
agricultural bill would license American sales of food and medicine
to Cuba as long as they aren't subsidized by U.S. taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Meeks said he had seen no evidence of abuse, but that Fidel
Castro's critics in the House would undoubtedly raise images of the
island as ''a place where political prisoners are treated in an
inhumane manner.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They will talk of Cuba as a place where there is no freedom of
speech, where there is no freedom of information,'' Meeks said.
''So they feel we should not reward Cuba by lifting the blockade.
How do we respond?''
</P>
<P>
   Cabrisas said most of the negative press Cuba gets comes from
the island's exile community in Miami, which has been particularly
vocal during the custody dispute over 6-year-old Cuban boy Elian
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our population is aware how reality is distorted there,''
Cabrisas said. ''All we can say is people need to make up their own
minds.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations Human Rights Commission in April censured
Cuba for denying citizens basic political and civil rights such as
freedom of expression and assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba was enraged that its former socialist allies, Poland and
the Czech Republic, submitted the motion that passed by a 21-18
vote.
</P>
<P>
   In May, however, Cuba released three high-profiled political
dissidents convicted for ''incitement to sedition.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Rene Gomez Manzano and engineer Felix Bonne Carcasses,
both sentenced to four years, were released early. Economist Marta
Beatriz got out of prison after serving most of her 3{-year
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Caucus, comprised of 36 black U.S. representatives,
support ending the embargo. They have been joined in recent months
by business and farm groups interested in Cuba as a new market for
their goods.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., drew distinctions between his
organization and the business groups, saying the caucus'
long-standing opposition to the sanctions is based on humanitarian
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't say that for the other groups who have come here in
the name of trade,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cabinet Member Discloses Bisexuality  </HEADLINE>
By CANDICE HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- An Italian Cabinet member has shattered a taboo by
publicly declaring himself bisexual amid the growing furor over
World Gay Pride week.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Minister Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio revealed his sexual
orientation in this week's issue of Panorama news magazine, which
hit the newsstands Friday. ''Courageous,'' said the caption under
his photo.
</P>
<P>
   Very few public figures in Italy outside the fashion world are
openly anything but heterosexual. Pecoraro Scanio's announcement
won quick praise in some circles.
</P>
<P>
   ''He broke a taboo,'' the daily newspaper La Repubblica said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The only openly gay member of parliament, Niki Vendola, also
praised Pecoraro Scanio.
</P>
<P>
   ''A double morality is in force in our country in which some
things can be done, but they can't be spoken about,'' Vendola said
in a television interview. ''I think a lot of colleagues are afraid
to come out of the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alessandra Mussolini, granddaughter of dictator Benito
Mussolini, was quick to criticize Pecoraro Scanio for going public.
Mussolini is a member of parliament from the National Alliance, a
party born out of the ashes of her grandfather's political
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sexuality should remain a private matter,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In its interview, Panorama asked Pecoraro Scanio if he is gay.
The 41-year-old lawyer replied that he is bisexual.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm against choosing just homosexuality or heterosexuality in
a rigid, old-fashioned style,'' he said. ''Me, I choose absolute
sexual liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Pecoraro Scanio, a member of the Green Party from the southern
city of Salerno, joined the Cabinet last month when Giuliano Amato
became premier.
</P>
<P>
   Amato's opposition to World Gay Pride week has divided his
center-left coalition and helped stoke a controversy ignited by the
Roman Catholic Church's attempts to get the event canceled or
postponed.
</P>
<P>
   World Gay Pride is a weeklong celebration in July that is
expected to draw tens of thousands of people to Rome. The Vatican
says Catholic pilgrims visiting Rome for the Holy Year would be
offended by the sight of gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   The church teaches that homosexual behavior is a sin. Rightist
politicians also want the event canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Pecoraro Scanio said in the Panorama interview that the church
is wrong to oppose the event.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see where the offense to religion is,'' he said. ''The
church, instead, is trying to portray Gay Pride as some sort of
'sex' show.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Rome's leftist mayor buckled under Vatican pressure
and withdrew the city's official sponsorship of World Gay Pride
week. Amato ordered his equal rights minister to do the same thing
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   World Gay Pride organizers say the event will go ahead anyway.

<HEADLINE> Defense Highlights US-Russia Summit  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- At a Kremlin summit held in the twilight of one
man's presidency and the beginning of the other's, Bill Clinton and
Vladimir Putin will be measuring one another on issues that will
outlast them both.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flies to Moscow on Saturday after five days of
conferences and ceremonies with western European allies, who are
restive about at least one proposal he'll take to Putin: the idea
of amending an arms control treaty so the United States can build a
limited anti-missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   On less contentious ground, Clinton on Friday called for
European unity that reaches to Moscow, and said, ''America must not
listen to those who say we should go it alone.''
</P>
<P>
   He summoned western Europeans ''to build a partnership with
Russia'' for stability and democracy, part of his own agenda for
the summit with President Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Putin have met twice before at international
conferences prior to Putin's election. The White House does not
expect the meeting to yield major agreements, certainly not on the
disputed idea of an American missile shield against rogue states,
which would require changes in the 1972 Anti-ballistic Missile
Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Clinton is seeking a sense of Putin's
priorities as he discusses his own with the new man in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder agreed when they
conferred in Berlin that Putin will be a key player in world
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''They both see Putin as likely to be president of Russia for
the next four years and therefore, an extraordinarily important
figure ... in the evolution of relations between Russia and Europe,
Russia and the United States,'' said Sandy Berger, Clinton's
national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has fewer than eight months remaining in his presidency
as he confers with Putin on issues that also are expected to
include a new nuclear arms reduction treaty, the ethnic conflict
raging in Chechnya and the ravaged Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said Putin seems committed to modernizing the Russian
economy, struggling since the disintegration of the old Soviet
Union a decade ago. That recovery would put democracy there on a
more stable footing.
</P>
<P>
   But the missile defense system Clinton is considering, designed
to guard America against strikes by outlaw nations -- Iraq and North
Korea are the two cited as potential threats -- raises what might be
the most contentious point of the summit.
</P>
<P>
   The system is still being tested and Clinton won't decide
whether to go ahead with it until fall, a move he will then
bequeath to Congress and the president elected to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the administration wants room to make the
decision without breaching the 1972 treaty, although Berger did say
that abrogating it would be within Clinton's rights.
</P>
<P>
   But that would roil western relations and risk steps by Russia
and China to make sure their nuclear missiles are not vulnerable to
a U.S. shield. And Schroeder said the national missile defense plan
must not be allowed to ''trigger a new arms race.''
</P>
<P>
   The ABM treaty was written so that the superpowers could count
on their mutual nuclear deterrence, with each side agreeing not to
build systems to render the other's impotent. The Russians have
rebuffed administration suggestions that they agree to changes.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans are concerned about a plan they fear could shake
past arms accords and leave them more vulnerable than before.
</P>
<P>
   ''This issue could have an impact far beyond the U.S.A.,''
Schroeder reminded Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also intends to urge Putin that the rebellion in
Chechnya be settled politically rather than militarily. Moscow has
insisted the conflict is an internal issue.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton and Putin also will discuss the broader question of
strategic nuclear arms reduction. There too, they differ. The
Russians have talked of far deeper mutual arms cuts than the
Pentagon is willing to accept in a new strategic arms treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The summit could produce some sort of understanding, or effort,
to arrange an early warning system that would share data on
possible missile launches. Berger said some of the technology of a
missile defense system might also be shared.
</P>
<P>
   There is one nuclear agreement in prospect: Clinton and Putin
are expected to sign a deal in which each of their nations will
destroy 34 tons of weapons grade plutonium, enough to produce tens
of thousands of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the diplomatic results, summits are also about
symbolism -- a U.S. president conferring in the Kremlin with a
democratically elected president of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Putin seems less the politician than the burly, backslapping
Boris Yeltsin, who sat opposite Clinton at prior Russia summits,
sometimes in first name friendship, sometimes in explosive tirades.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, the former KGB officer who became Yeltsin's prime
minister, is reserved and cautious, not one to tip a hand of
diplomatic poker. ''I think the United States can do business with
this man,'' Clinton said earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Putin Calms Russian Politics  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- In the first months of Vladimir Putin's
presidency, Russia seems eerily calm after years of political and
economic chaos. The nation's problems remain, but its politics no
longer resemble a barroom brawl.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Putin's administration contrasts with the turbulent days
of his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin. At the end of Yeltsin's
scandal-tainted administration, the unpredictable president fired
ministers, battled the opposition and stood by as the economy fell
apart. Ill with heart disease, Yeltsin disappeared for weeks at a
time or made gaffes when he did appear in public.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is Putin's call for a stronger state, his tough
handling of militant rebels in breakaway Chechnya, or simply his
relative youth, the 47-year-old ex-KGB officer has so much support
that few of the country's politicians dare challenge him.
</P>
<P>
   But while Putin, who has never before held an elected office, is
popular, his aims remain unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's moves ''create the feeling that the gathering of all
higher power in the hands of the president ... is not a means for
carrying out some political plan, but is a goal in itself,'' said
the liberal newspaper Obshchaya Gazeta.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say many Russians are just happy to have a strong
president -- one they hope will end the chaos, cronyism and
widespread corruption that ensnared the government under Yeltsin.
Even Communists, who were Yeltsin's bitter foes and remain the main
opposition party, have taken Putin's side.
</P>
<P>
   ''The majority of people who ache for the soul of their homeland
think that this step is for the better,'' said lawmaker Alexander
Kravets, the Communist Party's chief of ideology. ''Because without
strong power ... the government cannot live.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin says his goals are building democracy and a strong economy
that will ensure prosperity for ordinary people while restoring
Russia as a great power. He wants to rebuild the crumbling military
and promises to root out corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would hate to see my country, Russia, lose its identity, its
face,'' Putin told ''NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw'' in an
interview broadcast Thursday. ''I would like to see that the
cultural roots of Russia, that we are so proud of, and we so love
... be preserved with all due respect to the common values of our
world. I would like to see my children see themselves as
Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   Since winning election in March, Putin has focused on increasing
the power of the presidency while his Cabinet tackles an ailing
economy, which has been in decline for years. The government
promises to continue market reforms, but has yet to outline a
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest threat to Russia is ineffective economic policy,''
Putin told NBC.
</P>
<P>
   There also has been no major move against corruption, despite
Putin's tough election talk. Many controversial figures from the
Yeltsin years have been held over.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Putin's first major move was to increase federal
control over Russia's 89 regions and curb powerful regional
governors. The governors gained huge, sometime autocratic power,
under Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Putin says greater control is essential to ensure that the
country's problems are tackled, but some liberals worry that it
could undermine local democracy and is a first step in restoring
Soviet-style controls.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question is how far our president and his partners in the
administration will go,'' said political analyst Igor Vagin. ''The
principle danger is whether those in power will stop listening to
the people.''
</P>
<P>
   While there has been no sign of such moves, Putin's decision to
retain many of Yeltsin's ministers and top aides further worry
liberals and reformers.
</P>
<P>
   Under Yeltsin, Kremlin aides and tycoons amassed enormous wealth
and power, often through the rigged privatization of state
property. To see these people retained shows that Putin is just a
carry-over of the old administration, say some analysts, pointing
out that he was named acting president by Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Others disagree, saying that Putin is a cautious politician
still finding his way. His aim appears to be establishing strong
control over the government, after which he will replace Yeltsin
holdovers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Putin just needs about six months, and then he'll start
getting rid of the traces of Yeltsin's presidency,'' said Andrei
Ryabov of the Moscow Carnegie Center.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Entrepreneurs to Visit U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Cuban government will allow some private
entrepreneurs who run restaurants and small farms to visit the
United States this fall as part of an exchange program, a senior
U.S. Chamber of Commerce official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Johnstone, vice president of the chamber, outlined the
plan to a reporter after returning from a visit to Cuba that
included talks with officials from Cuba's Chamber of Commerce, a
state entity. Membership in the Cuban chamber is limited to
government-run firms and foreign firms with Cuban government
partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   When U.S. chamber officials broached the possibility of
exchanges involving private sector representatives from Cuba last
year, Cuba rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a substantially different atmosphere now,'' Johnstone
said, adding that he expects the Cuban entrepreneurs to visit the
United States in September.
</P>
<P>
   For years, private businesses were forbidden in Cuba but faced
with a steep economic decline earlier this decade, the government
began to allow self-employment in specified areas under strict
controls. There are an estimated 150,000 such enterprises nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the U.S. embargo against Cuba, representatives of
American businesses have been visiting Cuba for years. This coming
week, the fourth US-Cuba Business Summit, to be held in Cancun,
Mexico, and Havana, is expected to attract dozens of U.S. business
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Johnstone, on an unrelated issue, said Cuban officials also
agreed to begin a dialogue with the chamber on compensation for the
thousands of U.S. businesses and other properties that were
nationalized by Cuba during the early stages of the revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Johnstone, a former foreign service officer, said companies
interested in obtaining compensation can explore that possibility,
using the chamber as a go-between with the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government has certified 5,911 U.S. claims for
compensation from Cuba. There has been virtually no headway on the
issue since the claims were certified 30 years ago. Cuba has
expressed a willingness to deal with the compensation issue as part
of a broader settlement with the United States, but Washington has
ruled out such talks so long as the island is under authoritarian
control.
</P>
<P>
   The original combined value of the confiscated properties was
$1.8 billion but that figure has grown several fold over the years
because of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has its own claims against the United States. Last
November, a Cuban court found the U.S. government liable for deaths
and damage to the island during 40 years of economic sanctions and
other ''aggressive policies.'' It ordered the United States to pay
about $181 billion in reparations but has no way of enforcing the
ruling.

   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) -- City cleanup crews can hardly keep
up with the graffiti and messages of love and grief left at a
statue of Selena, the Grammy-winning Tejano singer slain in 1995.

   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The artist formerly known as an
unpronounceable symbol is holding a weeklong party to celebrate his
switch back to the name Prince.

<HEADLINE> Hartford hockey team in championship series has core of fans  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- He's still emblazoned with a Hartford
Whalers tattoo, continues to wear their jerseys and refuses to take
down the National Hockey League paraphernalia from the walls of his
New Britain home.
</P>
<P>
   The Whalers are gone, long since moved to North Carolina and
renamed the Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop Paul Adamowich from buying tickets to Game
5 of the Hartford Wolf Pack's Calder Cup championship series
against the Rochester Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still hockey fans,'' Adamowich said Friday as he waited
in line at the Hartford Civic Center box office. ''We're still
here. We've got to support the hometown team.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Wolf Pack, of the American Hockey League, has not
found the support that bandwagons a University of Connecticut
basketball team, it has its share of fans.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of them, in fact, said Kevin Kavanagh, director of
public relations for Hartford Sports. The Wolf Pack drew 11,000
people to Game 2 of the championship series last week, Kavanagh
said, and expected close to 12,000 at Friday's game.
</P>
<P>
   The team's all-time attendance record is 14,115 people during a
January 1998 game, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolf Pack came to Hartford in 1997. Their increasing
popularity has meant more business for downtown restaurants, bars
and retail shops, said Harry Freeman, executive director of the
Hartford Economic Development Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a very real impact,'' Freeman said.
</P>
<P>
   And the fans are flocking, says John Pettit, senior vice
president of Hartford Sports, owners of the Wolf Pack and New
England Sea Wolves arena football team.
</P>
<P>
   During the past three seasons, the Wolf Pack has acquired its
own fans, many of them families with small children, he said. But
now that the team has reached a championship level, some die-hard
Whaler watchers -- whose hearts were broken by the 1997 defection --
are coming back to their beloved sport.
</P>
<P>
   The Calder Cup series, which was tied at 2-2 before Friday's
game, is ''doing a great job putting us on the map with
credibility,'' Kavanagh said. ''We are in the public's eye.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged with a chuckle that it's unusual for a market
such as Hartford to focus on hockey while the temperature hovers
near 90 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a nice problem to have if you're worrying about ice
conditions in June,'' Kavanagh said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Whalers left, Hartford has flirted with several pro
sports franchises, including two abortive efforts to lure the New
England Patriots away from Foxboro, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Major league action may get more attention than minor league
sports, but Hartford loves a winner, said Dean Pagani, spokesman
for Gov. John G. Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   ''While the attention may not be comparable to a UConn game, I'm
sure the excitement will flow into next season,'' Pagani said.
''It's the kind of thing that builds on year to year. It takes time
to build a franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn's basketball teams have claimed national championships for
the last two years running -- the men in 1999, the women this year.
Pettit said he thinks UConn's winning ways have whetted appetites
for another championship team.
</P>
<P>
   But not far from the Civic Center ticket window, Nathan Miller
and Steve Pinto, both 16, had a different opinion of the Wolf
Pack's success.
</P>
<P>
   ''Minor league hockey doesn't really excite people,'' said
Pinto, an Ellington High School student in Hartford on a field
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Because the games don't have widespread TV coverage, it's hard
for fans to get to know the players, the teens said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's annoying,'' added Miller, a student at Hartford
High School. ''I don't think people do care. Honestly, I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Damon Scott, a disc jockey with WTIC-FM radio is probably the
Pack's most visible uber-fan. Dressed in full team uniform and
sporting a head of dyed blue hair, Scott does crowd motivation at
the games.
</P>
<P>
   The team's success is ''the blessed rebirth of hockey in
Hartford,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Wolf Pack brings home the Calder Cup? Scott said
he'll paint his entire body blue.

<HEADLINE> Tallest Building Up for Grabs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Get your checkbook ready, Donald Trump.
</P>
<P>
   A developer who wanted to build the world's tallest building in
downtown Chicago has run into financial problems, so the $500
million project may be up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Trump had offered to join the $500 million project last October,
but developer Scott Toberman rebuffed him.
</P>
<P>
   Then Toberman stumbled on the financing for the
residential-office building, and he finally had to return the
property deed to his lender, the Chicago Tribune reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The site is a few blocks from the Sears Tower, which held
world's-tallest honors from 1973 to 1996, when it was topped by the
Petronas Towers in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the New York-based Trump Organization were not
immediately returned Friday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets With Kohl  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- In a show of loyalty for an old pal, President
Clinton met Friday evening with former German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, whose legacy was recently tarnished by a campaign financing
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the first foreign leader to meet with Kohl since the
former chancellor's reputation was shattered following his
admission last December of accepting illegal campaign contributions
while in office.
</P>
<P>
   The two last met in April 1999 in Washington where Clinton
awarded Kohl the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States'
highest civilian award, saluting his 16 years as German chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl was in the Clinton's hotel for about an hour before
leaving, brushing past reporters saying only, ''It was a meeting
among friends.''

<HEADLINE> Big donor admits funneling $53,700 to Torricelli campaign  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A political donor who gained White House
access pleaded guilty on Friday to breaking election laws by
funneling $53,700 into the successful 1996 Senate campaign of
then-Rep. Robert Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
   David Chang, who operates several trading companies in the
Democrat's former district, has agreed to cooperate with the
Justice Department's investigation into fund-raising abuses in the
1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Chang is among 25 people charged by the Campaign Financing Task
Force and the sixth to admit wrongdoing regarding Torricelli
fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   None of the six has implicated the New Jersey Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Chang was the second international businessman from Bergen
County to plead guilty in as many days regarding the 1996
Torricelli campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Chang, who served on the campaign's finance committee, was to go
on trial Tuesday from indictments returned in December, January and
March.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, David Schertler, declined to say what information
Chang could offer the task force.
</P>
<P>
   In its plea bargain with Chang, prosecutors said they anticipate
filing additional charges against him regarding ''payments made to
a certain former government employee.'' They declined to identify
that person.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli, who has described Chang as a friend, is not accused
of any wrongdoing. He has maintained he was unaware of the improper
donations. All such money is donated to charity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Torricelli lawyer Abbe David Lowell said ''the
senator and campaign officials are concerned to learn that David
Chang and people with whom he was working reimbursed some
contributions in the 1996 campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The ''improper acts remain just a handful,'' Lowell said.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli raised $9.2 million to defeat Rep. Richard A. Zimmer
in 1996. His fund-raising ability led to his appointment as
chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell said the ''Justice Department has confirmed that neither
the senator nor anyone in the campaign are the focus of any
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The head of the campaign task force, Robert J. Conrad, declined
to comment on whether Torricelli was aware of straw donations.
</P>
<P>
   Chang, 57, of Cresskill, pleaded guilty to five misdemeanor
election law violations and a felony obstruction charge -- telling a
potential grand jury witness to lie.
</P>
<P>
   He faces about two years in prison when sentenced Sept. 7, but
the deal calls for prosecutors to request a lesser term if he
provides ''substantial cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 and 1999, Chang made soft-money contributions ranging
from $30,000 to $100,000 to the Democratic Party, which were
interspersed with three White House visits.
</P>
<P>
   He was listed by Mother Jones magazine as one of the nation's
top 400 donors during the 1997-98 election cycle with contributions
of $41,586.
</P>
<P>
   Chang did not speak to reporters after his plea. He remains
under house arrest pending a hearing Monday to reconsider his bail
status.
</P>
<P>
   Chang operates several international trading companies based in
Englewood Cliffs, including Bright &AMP; Bright, Nikko Enterprises Inc.
and Panacom Inc.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged conspiring to break donation laws with Cha-Kuek
''Charles'' Koo, an executive with a South Korean conglomerate;
Berek Paul Don, a former Bergen County Republican leader; and Don's
former law partner, Carmine Alampi, a Democratic leader in Bergen
County who served on a Torricelli campaign committee; and unnamed
others.
</P>
<P>
   Federal rules bar corporate contributions. Individuals can
contribute up to $2,000 to a candidate during an election cycle --
primary and general election. Reimbursements are not permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Chang and Koo admitted to roles in ''conduit'' donations, which
are designed to evade restrictions by secretly repaying ''straw
donors'' -- those who supposedly made the contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Don and Alampi pleaded guilty last year to charges related to
soliciting $11,000 worth of donations to the Torricelli campaign,
which Chang admitted he reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   Chang also admitted he collected $21,000 for the Torricelli
campaign in December 1996, improperly reimbursing donors with
Bright &AMP; Bright money.
</P>
<P>
   Chang also admitted arranging 19 flights for Torricelli in late
1996, using Bright &AMP; Bright funds, even though he knew corporations
were barred from making ''in-kind contributions'' to campaigns.
Chang had the campaign report that Bright &AMP; Bright employees had
made the contributions, totaling $1,700, for the travel expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli spokesman Richard McGrath said the campaign rejected
the $1,700 because it did not cover the cost of the trips. The
campaign reimbursed Bright &AMP; Bright $9,280.75, he said. That sum is
the equivalent of first-class airfare for the trips, which campaign
rules set as the benchmark, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Koo pleaded guilty on Thursday to recruiting eight ''straw''
donors at Chang's behest, and Chang on Friday admitted that he gave
Koo $20,000 in cash to reimburse those donors.
</P>
<P>
   Koo, 54, of Alpine, a South Korean citizen, is president of LG
Group's executive office for the Americas in Englewood Cliffs. The
LG Group is one of South Korea's largest conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   Chang may yet face charges ''arising from his failure to
disclose the involvement of LG Group in his trade with North
Korea,'' according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   In court on Thursday, Koo acknowledged that in late 1995 Chang's
companies owed LG Group more than $50 million used by Chang to
finance the shipment of goods to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea had failed to pay Chang's companies in full, so
Chang was unable to repay LG Group, Koo said.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Ambassador Criticized  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- A Canadian political party leader says Ottawa
should consider bringing its ambassador to the United States home
until the U.S. election is over because of comments he made
appearing to favor Al Gore in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Leader Joe Clark said remarks by Ambassador Raymond
Chretien, nephew of Liberal Prime Minister Jean Chretien, ''could
cause serious implications for Canada down the line in our
relations with the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador, in a speech broadcast Wednesday to officials
back in Ottawa, said of the Democratic presidential candidate: ''We
know Vice President Gore. He knows us. He's a friend of Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush, on the other hand, doesn't know us as much.
Seems to have forgotten the name of our prime minister.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a reference to a prank played on George W. Bush in
March by a Canadian TV comic, posing as a reporter, who told Bush
that prime minister ''Jean Poutine'' was endorsing him. Bush, the
likely Republican nominee, did not catch the fake name and
expressed appreciation for the support.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Chretien said in his speech that when the Texas governor
''thinks of borders, he thinks of Mexico, not Canada. Obviously we
have to work on him.'' He also said ''We will deal with whomever is
elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Herb Gray defended the ambassador, saying
his intent was not to declare a preference but to emphasize Canada
will maintain strong relations with the United States no matter who
wins.
</P>
<P>
   But Clark, a former prime minister, said any Canadian ambassador
other than Chretien's nephew would have been reprimanded for
talking like that.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may be a good thing to remove him from temptation and to
keep him home for briefings here,'' Clark told The Canadian Press.
</P>
<P>
   Poutine is a fast food meal of french fries, gravy and cheese
curd popular in French-speaking Quebec.

<HEADLINE> Smoking Banned on Flights  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Effective Sunday, smoking will be banned on
all scheduled airline flights between the United States and other
countries, the Transportation Department announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The regulation bans smoking in the cabin or cockpit of flights
by U.S. or foreign airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration estimated that 97.7 percent
of flights between the United States and other countries are
already smoke free -- including all U.S.-carrier flights -- due to
voluntary decisions by the airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking has been banned on domestic U.S. flights since 1990, but
that rule did not cover international flights arriving in or
leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
   The government has been encouraging voluntary action by the
airlines. The ban taking effect Sunday implements a part of an
aviation-overhaul act President Clinton signed April 5.

<HEADLINE> Fired top trooper's personal injury claim dismissed, discrimination lawsuit remains </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A state Superior Court judge Friday
dismissed an attempt by an ousted State Police superintendent to
collect $21 million in a personal injury lawsuit, but kept alive
his claims of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Williams alleges that he was emotionally damaged after Gov.
Christie Whitman ordered his resignation at the height of the
state's racial profiling controversy in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman ordered then Attorney General Peter Verniero to call
Williams at his Mount Laurel home and ask for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   That request came after a newspaper interview quoted Williams
linking minority groups to drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Williams subsequently filed a lawsuit. However, Superior Court
Judge Judith A. Yaskin ruled Friday that Williams did not file the
required notice of his lawsuit to the state until October, well
beyond the 90-day deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Yaskin rejected Williams' argument that he was too emotionally
disturbed to find a lawyer and that he relied on Verniero for legal
advice.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' personal injury lawsuit alleged that he and his wife
suffered severe emotional trauma from the abrupt resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The discrimination charge contends that Whitman wanted Williams
removed so she could replace him with a younger, black man.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Clifford Van Syoc argued that Williams was so emotionally
troubled that he could not seek legal guidance for months.
</P>
<P>
   A psychiatrist hired by Williams reported that the career state
trooper suffered ''adjustment disorder'' until sometime before
meeting with Van Syoc in mid-August that year.
</P>
<P>
   Yaskin said she believes Williams and his claims, but they do
not rise to the standards set by the law for waiving the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ''Carl Williams knew he was injured by his termination and he
knew it was unfair from the outset,'' Yaskin said.
</P>
<P>
   Van Syoc said he would appeal Yaskin's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Yaskin gave Van Syoc two weeks to provide further legal
arguments on why the discrimination lawsuit should continue. No new
hearing date was scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for both Whitman and Verniero argued that Williams can
make no claim of discrimination since he served as a political
appointee.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter what you do in this case, you can't get around the
fact the man resigned,'' said Wayne Positan, Verniero's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman can appoint a minority to head a council of minority
affairs and an elderly resident to lead a senior citizen
commission, lawyer Rosemary Alito said. That is a matter of public
policy for the executive branch to decide, not for the government's
judicial wing to approve, Alito said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor has an absolute right to make her appointments in
accordance with those considerations,'' Alito said.
</P>
<P>
   Yaskin agreed, saying that the courts could intervene when a
chief operating officer makes such appointments in private
industry, but not when a chief executive does that in government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because there is a difference in making widgets or making
money and making policy in a democracy,'' Yaskin said.
</P>
<P>
   After the 90-minute hearing, Van Syoc said he will proceed with
plans to ask the state for documents and evidence to bolster the
discrimination claims.
</P>
<P>
   Van Syoc said he wants a copy of a photograph of Whitman with a
black man during a State Police patrol of Camden in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   According to those who have seen the photograph, Whitman is
wearing a white nylon jumpsuit, a baseball cap and black gloves
similar to those used by police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The governor appears to be ''arresting and/or frisking a young
black male'' according to another subpoena filed May 2 in state
Superior Court on an unrelated case. Sources familiar with the
operation said the suspect was not charged with any crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe it will demonstrate the clear involvement of race
politics in her decision,'' Van Syoc said of the photograph.

<HEADLINE> Food Stamp Enrollment Up in March  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More people were on food stamps in March, but
enrollment in the program was still more than 1 million below the
year before, the government reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Enrollment in the program is off about 30 percent over the past
4 years for a variety of reasons, including the strong economy and
tighter eligibility requirements, federal officials say. Some 17.3
million people were on food stamps nationwide in March, an increase
of 98,000 from February.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 37 percent of people eligible for food stamps
aren't getting them, and the Agriculture Department plans a series
of public meetings this summer in seven cities to find what the
government can do to get more of them into the program.
</P>
<P>
   USDA officials say some states have discouraged participation,
and some potential recipients are declining to take food stamps
because of the stigma.
</P>
<P>
   ''As people go to work there is still some confusion about
whether they know they are eligible for benefits,'' said Shirley
Watkins, USDA's undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer
services. ''One of the things we don't want to see continued is a
continued spiraling down in food stamps when demand for food banks
is going up dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   The meetings will be in New York, Washington, Atlanta, Chicago,
Dallas, Kansas City and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Seven states have recorded enrollment declines of at least 10
percent since March 1999, led by Maryland with a drop of 17.2
percent and Colorado and Nebraska at 15.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Enrollment in the program peaked at more than 27 million
nationwide in 1994. At the time, 72 percent of the eligible people
were participating.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton relaxed eligibility rules last July and
announced a public education campaign to stem enrollment declines
in the program. USDA also is asking Congress for $10 million in the
department's 2001 budget to pay for outreach programs.
</P>
<P>
   States could help the working poor by limiting paperwork and
keeping their offices open longer hours so families who need food
stamps can get them, said Ellen Vollinger of the Food Research and
Action Center, an advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ''If people are doing so much better that they don't need the
program, that's fine and perfect. But too many of the people
dropping off the program are still eligible and still in need,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   A family of four that earns up to $1,810 a month is eligible for
the program in most states. Limits in Alaska and Hawaii are higher.

<HEADLINE> Pipeline Overseers Seek Record Fine  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Olympic Pipeline Co. should be fined $3.05
million for failing to test and monitor a pipeline that gave way
last year and caused three deaths in Bellingham, Wash., federal
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The fine is the largest ever sought by the Transportation
Department's Research and Special Programs Administration and the
maximum the agency can recommend. The previous record was more than
$600,000 sought against Koch Industries in 1991, a case that was
later settled.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bellingham episode, ''There were sustained and multiple
violations of our safety standards,'' Kelley Coyner, the agency
administrator, said at a news conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Last June 10, two 10-year-old boys and an 18-year-old fisherman
died after a pipeline broke and spewed 229,000 gallons of gasoline
into a Bellingham park. The spilled gasoline ignited into an
enormous fireball that raced more than a mile down a creek.
</P>
<P>
   Research and Special Programs Administration officials detailed
eight proposed fines in the case, including $500,000 each for
failing to have properly trained employees on duty when the pipe
broke, failing to test relief valves at a terminal 15 miles south
of Bellingham and not keeping records of discharge pressure and
abnormal events at pump stations.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic Vice President Carl Gast would not comment on the
proposed penalties but defended his company's actions since the
rupture and explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to point out that during the past several months,
Olympic has worked very hard to comply with all of the safety
directives issued by the Office of Pipeline Safety, and even now is
engaged in a comprehensive internal inspections program of its
entire 400-mile network,'' Gast said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline runs from refineries in northwestern Washington
southward to Portland, Ore. A 37-mile segment has been closed since
the blast.
</P>
<P>
   The company contends its pipeline ruptured because of damage
from work on nearby water-carrying pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic has 30 days to request a hearing with the officials of
the agency's chief counsel's office. Those officials would
determine whether grounds exist to sustain the fines.
</P>
<P>
   Either side could ask for a rehearing, and appeals could move
the case into the federal court system. Either side also could
instigate talks to reach a settlement, agency officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Jason King, 26, a brother of 10-year-old victim Wade King, said
even a $3 million penalty was insufficient punishment for the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that a company is able to, in so many words, deny
responsibility for their own actions and try to place blame on
third parties, ... and then be allowed to continue to operate, is
the real tragedy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic is owned by a consortium of the oil companies Arco,
Equilon Enterprises and GATX. Houston-based Equilon, a joint
venture of Texaco and Shell, operates the line.
</P>
<P>
   The company is seeking to restore full service on the Washington
state line and is conducting comprehensive internal tests of the
pipeline system.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Office of Pipeline Safety, a part of the
Research and Special Programs Administration, are overseeing the
internal testing. Coyner said she could not say when the agency
will decide whether to allow Olympic to reopen the 37-mile section
of pipe.

<HEADLINE> FDA To Block Chinese Herb  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is preparing to stop the import
of a Chinese herb that caused kidney failure in Britain and
Belgium. It has also alerted doctors to be on the lookout for the
herb.
</P>
<P>
   The herb family is called Aristolochia, and the kidney-toxic
ingredient is called aristolochic acid. The ingredient also is
suspected of causing cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration warned doctors that a list of
botanical products is suspected of containing or being contaminated
with aristolochic acid.
</P>
<P>
   No American is known to have been injured. Nor does the FDA know
how many such products are sold here. Federal law severely
restricts oversight of dietary supplements unless the government
proves there's a health concern.
</P>
<P>
   But the FDA decided to crack down on the possible threat after
Britain last summer reported two cases of kidney failure in people
taking aristolochic-containing Chinese herbs to treat a skin
condition. One needed a kidney transplant; the other is on dialysis
awaiting a transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Belgian doctors have reported at least 70 people who
needed dialysis or a transplant after taking a
aristolochic-containing Chinese herb to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   ''This one is extremely dangerous. It destroys your kidneys,''
said FDA dietary supplement chief Christine Lewis. ''We're trying
to head it off at the pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, the FDA will stop at the docks all imports of
herbs suspected to contain aristolochic acid, Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA wrote dietary supplement manufacturers this week urging
that they test certain botanical products for the ingredient, and
wrote thousands of physicians to alert them about the concern. The
hope is that doctors check patients with unexplained kidney
failure, and that they educate patients to avoid the suspected
products.
</P>
<P>
   For a list of plants under concern, check the FDA's Internet
site at http://www.fda.gov/opacom/hpwhats.html, and click on
''dietary supplements.''

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Land Mine Kills 2 Serbs  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb villagers traveling on a back
road drove over a land mine Friday, triggering an explosion that
killed two men and injured a mother and her two young children.
</P>
<P>
   The blast just south of the regional capital, Pristina, prompted
Serb leaders to criticize the Western officials who run Kosovo,
claiming too little is being done to safeguard Serb lives.
</P>
<P>
   The killings -- bringing to eight the number of Serbs killed in
the province this week -- came just weeks before the peacekeepers
mark their first year in the province.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basic security for the Serbs does not exist, they are still
being killed. That has even been intensified,'' said Olivier
Ivanovic, leader of the Serbs in the divided northern town of
Kosovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanovic said the attacks were aimed at driving the remaining
Serb population out.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials have been trying to persuade the tens of
thousands of Serbs who fled this Albanian-dominated province after
NATO airstrikes last year to return home.
</P>
<P>
   NATO-led peacekeepers said the two men, who were killed, were
driving from their village of Batuse toward Gracanica, five miles
south of Pristina, when their vehicle drove over the mine.
</P>
<P>
   Natasa Ristic, 32, and her daughters, 5 and 2, were in the back
seat of the car, but escaped with cuts and scratches, said Capt.
Kath Hurley, a spokeswoman for the British forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was just a big bang all of a sudden. I do not remember
anything else,'' Ristic told Belgrade television. ''I pulled my
children out.''
</P>
<P>
   The independent news agency Beta reported that Serbs from Kosovo
Polje and the surrounding villages demanded Friday that the
commander of the peacekeepers in Kosovo visit them next week and
promise to ''stop violence and terror against Serbs and find and
punish those responsible for terrorist acts against Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Polje Serbs threatened to block a major road between
the cities of Pristina and Pec unless their demands are fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   Even before this week's attacks, Serbs were fleeing the
province, fearing retaliation for Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's 18-month crackdown on ethnic Albanian militants.
</P>
<P>
   The exodus has been the most marked in the American sector,
where the greatest number of Serb enclaves remained after the war,
said Peter Kessler of the U.N. refugee agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''In some communities, every single Serb property is for sale,''
Kessler said. ''In some communities, if the pace of departures
continues, there will be no Serbs left by the end of the year.''

<HEADLINE> Three dead in I-95 crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DARIEN, Conn. (AP) -- Three people died in a fiery crash on
Interstate 95 that shut down the highway for several hours Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred just before 6 a.m. and involved a
tractor-trailer rig and two other vehicles, state police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said a tractor trailer lost control, collided with two
cars and forced them into the center barrier. Alll three vehicles
burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses and emergency crews tried to free three people trapped
inside one of the burning cars. Those three people died.
</P>
<P>
   Two people in the other passenger vehicle and the truck driver
were treated at Norwalk Hospital for minor injuries, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident between exit 9 and 10 shut down the highway
northbound at that point, snarling traffic for miles.
</P>
<P>
   Police had not released the names of the dead Friday evening.

<HEADLINE> Buffalo school bus aide shot while helping children off bus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- A 17-year-old male is under arrest after a
Buffalo bus aide was shot in the right ankle while helping school
children off the bus Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Police said a young male on a bicycle rode by the
stopped school bus and fired off four or five shots. It happened on
Buffalo's east side at around 4 p.m. with as many as 26 students
from Buffalo's Southside Elementary School still on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   Police have not released the named of the injured aide, but they
said the she was listed in good condition at the hospital. She had
been off the bus, helping children, when she was struck by one
bullet.
</P>
<P>
   No one else was hurt, although a pregnant mother, meeting her
child, went into labor during the commotion and was also taken to
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the suspect faces numerous charges, including
assault, reckless endangerment and criminal use of a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I seen him from coming over, and when I got off the bus I saw
(the pregnant woman) dropped to the floor begging for help and the
bus aide lady bleeding,'' an unidentified child told WIVB-TV.

<HEADLINE> Closing arguments delivered in Russell Peeler trial  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Prosecutors admit their case against a
Bridgeport man accused of plotting the murders of an 8 year-old boy
and his mother consists largely of the tangled testimony of drug
addicts, criminals and an admitted liar.
</P>
<P>
   But in closing arguments Friday, they asked jurors to believe
that testimony, saying the horrific killings of Leroy ''B.J.''
Brown and his mother, Karen Clarke, compelled Russell Peeler's drug
associates and jailhouse buddies to testify against him.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers argued that those witnesses knew they could get
lighter treatment from the state if they implicated Peeler.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler is accused of masterminding the murders to prevent the
boy from testifying against him in the 1998 slaying of Clarke's
boyfriend, Rudolph Snead Jr.
</P>
<P>
   His brother, Adrian Peeler, is accused of being the actual
triggerman who killed the mother and son in January 1999 in their
Bridgeport home. Adrian Peeler is awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Peeler's case is scheduled to go to the jury Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In more than 100 minutes of arguments, Bridgeport State's
Attorney Jonathan Benedict reviewed how carefully they prosecutors
believe the killings were planned out and how the Peeler brothers'
alibis were crafted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who in the entire world would have anything to gain from the
killing of this little boy, other than Russell Peeler?'' Benedict
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Peeler was required to be home by 9 p.m. and was wearing
an electronic monitor that kept track of his whereabouts. In the
weeks leading up to the killing, he was home a little after 9 p.m.
each day, but on the day of the killing, he was home by 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A record of cellular telephone calls showed Adrian was talking
on the telephone at about the time of the killings, and he checked
into a Milford motel no later than 6:35 p.m. that night. Witnesses
testified the shooting happened at around 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous witnesses, including the Peelers' drug associates and
people Russell met in prison, testified they heard allusions to the
killings, before and after the alleged plan was carried out.
</P>
<P>
   But the state's star witness, Josephine Lee, also was their most
problematic.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who lived across the street from Clarke and B.J., testified
she agreed to be a lookout for Adrian Peeler in exchange for a
handful of crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said she waited for Clarke and B.J. to get home, then rang
their doorbell. When Clarke opened the door, Adrian Peeler started
shooting, Lee testified.
</P>
<P>
   She recanted these statements in letters to her landlord,
writing: ''I was scared when the police came to the house to get me
so I told them that I had something to do with the murder. But I do
not know anything.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lee was called back on the stand, she said the letters were
lies.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer John Walkley said Lee's story did not match the
forensic evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Lee testified Clarke was shot in an upstairs bedroom, where she
fled to use the phone, but no bullet was found there. She said the
shooting started when Clarke and B.J. were running up the stairs,
but blood was found near the door and people who heard the gunshots
said they were loud, as if they happened outside.
</P>
<P>
   No forensic evidence was found to show that Lee or Adrian Peeler
were ever in the house, Walkley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Adrian Peeler was never there. Josephine Lee was never
there,'' Walkley said.
</P>
<P>
   Judge G. Sarsfield Ford denied a defense request to add two
other letters to evidence. In the letters, Lee states that she was
in bed with her landlord's son at the time and does not know
anything about the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish that somebody will come fort and tell the truth,'' she
wrote.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Up 231; Dow Up 143  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index wrapped up its best
week in history Friday as investors poured money back into the
technology stocks they had abandoned amid fears of rising interest
rates. Stocks soared after the government's employment report
raised hopes that economic growth is slowing to a less inflationary
pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq rose 230.88 points, or by 6.4 percent, to close at
3,813.38. The index rose 608.27 points for the week -- a stunning 19
percent gain that easily eclipsed the previous record of 9.7
percent from April 17-21.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's dramatic recovery was just part of a broad-based
advance that saw every major market index post sharp gains. The Dow
Jones industrial average rose 142.56 points to close at 10,794.76.
For the week, the Dow shot up 495.52 points, or 4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also sharply higher. The Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 rose 28.45 to 1,477.26.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is wild on Wall Street today,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior
vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ''We are now hearing talk again
of the Nasdaq going above 4,000 and the Dow through 11,000, which
we didn't think we'd hear so soon.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with the gains, the Nasdaq index remains 24.5 percent,
or more than 1,200 points below the record 5,048.62 set March 10,
less than three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks zoomed Friday after Wall Street received exactly the news
traders had hoped for: a clear sign of moderation in the red-hot
growth rate of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate climbed
back to 4.1 percent in May from a 30-year low of 3.9 percent in
April. The jobless rate rose as American businesses cut 116,000
jobs, the worst showing in nearly nine years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the weak jobs report, the Labor Department said
average hourly earnings rose just 0.1 percent in May, a sharp
slowdown after a 0.4 percent increase in April.
</P>
<P>
   That still left labor markets tight, but eased many fears of an
inflationary spike in wages that could bring down the longest
economic expansion in U.S. history. The figures delighted investors
who gave in to growing optimism that the Fed's six interest rate
increases since last June might finally be having an impact on the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The most optimistic said that few, if any, additional rate hikes
will be needed to keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the odds have now changed and there will not be
another rate hike soon,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of
market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ''I think
the Fed will be out of our face for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Added ammunition came from the Commerce Department, which
reported orders to American factories fell by 4.3 percent in April,
the biggest decline since November 1990, when the country was mired
in the last recession.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks led the rally, with investors snapping up
shares of market leaders that have been battered in the past few
weeks. JDS Uniphase rose $12.125 to $110.375 and Intel jumped $4.50
to $134.188.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are vulnerable to rising interest rates,
were also higher. Citigroup rose $2.75 to $66.063, J.P. Morgan
gained $6.625 to $138.563 and Chase Manhattan rose $3.50 to
$80.625.
</P>
<P>
   Online brokerages, which have slumped in recent weeks as trading
volume has weakened, were also significantly higher. Schwab Corp.
rose $4.50 to $32.938.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, volume was brisk as investors who had stepped to the
sidelines to await the jobless report eagerly jumped back into the
market. On every major index, advancing stocks easily outnumbered
decliners.
</P>
<P>
   ''Volume and breadth have really improved,'' said Tony Dwyer,
chief market strategist with Kirlin Holdings. ''You put that
together with the weak economic reports and a washed-out market and
it looks pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 1.39
billion shares, compared with 1.15 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, advancers led by a 7-to-2 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 20.57 to
513.03.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.6 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index rose 2.3 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
gained 2.4 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 1.1 percent higher.

<HEADLINE> UN Won't Probe Charges Against NATO  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The chief U.N. war crimes prosecutor on
Friday rejected claims that NATO committed war crimes during last
year's bombing of Yugoslavia, and said the accusations merit no
further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although some mistakes were made by NATO, I am very satisfied
that there was no deliberate targeting of civilians or unlawful
military targets by NATO during the bombing campaign,'' Carla del
Ponte told the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year's 78-day air campaign, lawyers working on behalf
of Yugoslavia and a separate Russian parliamentary commission have
given prosecutors complaints and evidence they say supports their
charge that NATO forces committed war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations included the strike against a bridge as a
passenger train was crossing it, the bombing of a refugee convoy
near Djakovica, and the targeting of the Serbian television
building in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson applauded the
announcement by del Ponte, saying it came as no surprise since the
alliance acted entirely in accordance with international law.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, he said in a statement, ''should help ensure that
the world's attention is focused exactly where it belongs -- on
bringing the real war criminals of the Balkans to face justice in
The Hague.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbian officials have said NATO bombings killed more than 300
people, but that number has not been independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte told council ambassadors that the tribunal had
conducted a thorough examination of all the facts and evidence
presented, as well as a detailed legal analysis and concluded
''there is no basis for opening an investigation into any of these
allegations or into other incidents related to the NATO bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision is likely to further damage relations between the
tribunal and Yugoslavia, which has accused U.N. prosecutors of bias
and essentially cut off all cooperation with them.
</P>
<P>
   In her briefing to the council, del Ponte noted that she herself
had been denied a visa to visit Yugoslavia and listed other
obstacles the Belgrade government has mounted to the tribunal's
work since the bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Russian Ambassador Gennadi Gatilov backed the Yugoslav
position, saying del Ponte's decision to terminate any
investigation was premature. He mounted a stinging attack on the
tribunal, accusing it of being ''politicized'' and biased against
the Serbs -- a charge del Ponte said she was ''stupified'' to even
hear.
</P>
<P>
   ''I completely reject that accusation,'' del Ponte said, adding
that she had consistently sought meetings with the Russians to
explain the work of the court and been ignored.
</P>
<P>
   David Scheffer, the U.S. ambassador at large for war crimes,
applauded del Ponte's decision, adding the investigators were
''bending over backwards to be as fair and equitable as possible
with respect to such allegations.''

<HEADLINE> Probe Caused FBI-Justice Tensions  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Quarrels between the Justice Department and
the FBI over appointment of an independent campaign finance
investigator had a ''devastating impact'' on relations among those
investigating fund-raising abuses, officials acknowledged in a
report obtained Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The differences -- Justice's determination that no special
prosecutor was warranted and the FBI's support for one -- have
surfaced before. But the General Accounting Office report, based on
interviews with several key players, described the disagreements
and their impact in detail.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Radek, chief of the Justice Department's public integrity
section, spoke to congressional investigators as did FBI officials
about the bitterness that has enveloped the department's Campaign
Finance Task Force, created in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno has kept the investigation under
Justice Department control, unswayed by arguments by Republican
lawmakers, FBI Director Louis Freeh and former task force chief
Charles LaBella.
</P>
<P>
   The animosity became so severe that Freeh, seeking an expansive
probe, ordered his agents to strike out on their own to interview
White House and Democratic Party officials. Cautious prosecutors
not only opposed the move but told the GAO that the agents
virtually paralyzed the task force's operations for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the prosecutors and agents had to be separated on
separate floors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Radek said that he believed that the FBI was too anxious
to recommend the need for an Independent Counsel and that in his
opinion the information gathered did not justify seeking the
appointment of an independent counsel,'' the report said. ''He
added that their disagreement over this issue had a devastating
impact on the relationship between the FBI and PI (the Public
Integrity section).''
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department statement said Friday that ''it is not news
that there were fundamental disagreements in 1997 between
prosecutors and FBI investigators'' but contended that Reno and
Freeh ''moved decisively'' to bring in new leadership and address
the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing in the report suggests that the frictions continued
beyond that time, and one only need look at the task force's
success record to see that any personal disagreements that may have
existed three years ago did not affect the task force's work
product,'' the department said.
</P>
<P>
   Radek's comments referred to the period in 1997 when he was
directly in control of the investigation, but even after he
relinquished the direct role, he remained a key player in opposing
an independent investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Gallagher, an FBI assistant director, ''believed that Mr.
Radek's criteria for what information was needed to trigger the
seeking of an independent counsel were too stringent,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh recommended to Reno in a November 1997 memo that she seek
an independent investigation, and in July 1998, LaBella made the
same recommendation. Reno refused on grounds evidence was
insufficient to trigger the independent counsel law, which since
has expired.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreements encompassed other matters, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials also accused the attorneys of ''excessive
participation in traditional investigative functions, especially
interviews of witnesses where agents felt they were being used
mainly as note takers.''
</P>
<P>
   There were severe differences in the investigative approach,
with the Justice prosecutors seeking to build the investigation
methodically, ''from the ground up,'' and the FBI agents trying
''to pursue several investigative tracks simultaneously.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice officials wanted ''to avoid prematurely tipping off
potential witnesses and investigative targets,'' the report said.
It added that Radek ''did not believe specific predication existed
... to justify all the investigative tracks proposed by the
investigators.'' He also ''believed the press created expectations
for a major scandal, rather than allowing the investigative process
to make that determination.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher said that on the basis of news reports about White
House coffees for campaign contributors, ''The FBI wanted to
investigate ... whether the White House had violated campaign
finance laws.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1997, Freeh directed investigators to interview more
than 100 individuals including White House and Democratic National
Committee employees who were not yet the focus of the task force
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the task force at the time, Laura Ingersoll, said as
a result of the interviews, 90 percent of the investigative
resources were unavailable for two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The task force has charged 25 individuals and one corporation
for violations of campaign finance laws.

<HEADLINE> School construction bill faces uphill political, legal battles  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A day after an Assembly committee
unenthusiastically released a multibillion dollar school
construction bill to the full House, two questions emerged Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Will the measure pass? And is it constitutional?
</P>
<P>
   The first question will be answered Monday, when the Assembly
considers the legislation that pumps no more than $6 billion into
30 poor school districts and $2.5 billion into all other New Jersey
districts to repair or replace crumbling and overcrowded school
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the second question is not so clear. Critics,
though, say the bill does not comply with the state Supreme Court's
order that the state pay full freight for building projects in the
poor schools, no matter how much they cost.
</P>
<P>
   But fiscal controls, including final legislative oversight over
spending, are needed to rein in escalating costs in what amounts to
the state's largest building program in history, according to
Assemblyman Joseph Malone, R-Burlington, the bill co-sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing in there that's onerous,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Venetis, of the Constitutional Litigation Clinic at
Rutgers University School of Law, said she believes a clause
inserted by Assembly Republicans granting the Legislature veto
power over special needs spending runs afoul of court rulings.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's ridiculous. That wasn't contemplated by the court,''
she said. ''It completely politicizes the process.''
</P>
<P>
   All bill backers will accomplish is to force the issue back into
court, Venetis said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tremendous waste of resources, if people have to run
back to the Supreme Court every few weeks,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   David Sciarra of the Education Law Center, the group that sued
the state more than 25 years ago on behalf of poor school children,
agreed with Venetis that the Assembly is usurping the court's
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Sciarra said he would rather see lawmakers exercise control over
the state agency that will ultimately be charged with managing
construction in the poor schools. The state has never taken on such
a huge task.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last thing we want is to launch this and then six months
later have the newspapers report that the program is mired in
delay,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said such direct control over the poor schools is
necessary because voters in those districts will have no say over
local projects. He said he wants to prevent local abuse of the
state funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like, this good old boy talking to that good old boy about a
project he really likes, and nobody can do anything about it,'' the
assemblyman said.
</P>
<P>
   Malone answered that critics have selective memories. Democrats
have clamored for more state oversight of the state's embattled
auto emissions system, for example, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They harped about no oversight on Parsons, now here we are
spending the largest amount of money in state history and no one
wants oversight? On the stupid scale, that goes to about a 12,''
the assemblyman said.
</P>
<P>
   Sciarra also took issue with the addition of spending caps in
the Assembly bill. Both the Assembly version and a competing Senate
version that passed two weeks ago assume about the same level of
spending; only the Assembly bill caps those amounts.
</P>
<P>
   He said special needs districts' spending needs actually top $7
billion, and that does not include extra space for court-ordered
preschool programs. The numbers could still grow depending on the
outcome of a review of the Department of Education, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''To cap the program now when we don't have a handle on the full
universe of needs is deeply problematic,'' he said. ''That would
violate the court decree. The court wanted a needs-driven
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said he has no idea whether the bill will pass Monday. It
was released from the Assembly Appropriations Committee Thursday on
a party line vote. Committee members released it ''without
recommendation,'' meaning they are leaving it up to their
colleagues in the full House to make the final call.
</P>
<P>
   ''Monday's going to be interesting. Whatever happens, happens,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed concerns that the Legislature may miss the Supreme
Court's spring 2000 deadline to make the money available to the
special needs schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing sacred about that deadline,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Malone placed on Assembly Democrats, who comprise the minority
in the House, the responsibility of passing the bill. He noted that
most special needs districts are located in Democratic strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want the benefit, they'll have to do the heavy lifting,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Assemblyman Joseph Suliga, D-Union, pointed out that Malone
ignores the fact that the Senate version of the school construction
bill, which contains no caps or lawmaker oversight, passed with
bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   Suliga was not sure whether Democrats will take a party position
Monday opposing the bill. Of the 11 members he spoke to Friday, out
of 35, all said they will vote no, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the bill passes, though, Suliga said it may face an
uphill battle in the Senate, where it would have to go next because
differences between the bills remain.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Congressman Pays Property Tax  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYLVA, N.C. (AP) -- U.S. Rep. Charles Taylor has paid, under
protest, $3,800 in back property taxes owed on forest land he owns
in his home district, his congressional office said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A tax collector sent Taylor and the congressional pay office a
garnishment notice May 1 for the unpaid taxes. Jackson County
officials said Taylor did not submit the proper paperwork to keep
the acreage in a land-use management program, where it was taxed at
a reduced rate. Taylor paid the reduced rate, but owed the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign leaders accused Taylor's Democratic opponent,
attorney Sam Neill, of persuading county tax officials to pursue
the claim -- charges Neill has denied.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has a hearing pending before the Jackson County Tax
Appeals Board. He is confident the payment ''will be returned once
the appeal process moves beyond the control of the Democrat
Party-dominated Jackson County board,'' spokesman Roger France
said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Loan to Indonesia  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund on Friday gave
approval for a $372 million loan to support economic reform efforts
in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the IMF's 24-member executive board came after a
review of the country's recent actions to meet IMF-imposed economic
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, IMF First Deputy Managing Director Stanley
Fischer said the international lending agency ''welcomed
Indonesia's recent progress in implementing fiscal and structural
reform measures.''
</P>
<P>
   IMF support for Indonesia had been suspended after the
government failed in March to meet a deadline set by the agency to
achieve various targets designed to restore growth and stability to
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The loan suspension put on hold further disbursements from a $5
billion assistance package the IMF has offered to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid fired two key
financial ministers after receiving a warning from Fischer that the
country should guard against backsliding in its reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia was one of the hardest-hit countries during the
1997-98 Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The $372 million loan approved Friday would bring to $715
million the total loans the IMF has extended out of the $5 billion
package.
</P>
<P>
   New IMF Managing Director Horst Koehler is currently on a
five-nation tour in Asia and is scheduled to meet on Sunday with
Wahid.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer said in his statement that recent market turmoil in
Indonesia and declines in the value of the rupiah, the nation's
currency, ''underscore the need for clear and consistent
implementation'' of economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ''Critical priorities are the restoration of a sound banking
system and resolution of the overhang of corporate debt,'' Fischer
said.

<HEADLINE> Key Chavez Ally Says He's Innocent  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA HERNANDEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- The leader of Venezuela's legislature,
a key ally of President Hugo Chavez, told the country's highest
court Friday that he was innocent of the corruption charges against
him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have done nothing but fight in the trenches of the people
for my entire life, spending the best years of my youth in jail
defending the interests of the democracy we enjoy today,'' Luis
Miquilena, who was imprisoned a half century ago for opposing a
military dictatorship, told the Supreme Tribunal of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Miquilena comes at a politically charged moment
for Chavez, a former paratrooper who took office on an
anti-corruption platform but whose administration is now plagued by
allegations of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez remains popular among the poor majority of the South
American nation's 23 million people. However, critics blame him for
an economic recession and accuse him of amassing too much power.
</P>
<P>
   Miquilena's lawyers on Friday asked the Supreme Tribunal to drop
the investigation, saying the attorney general failed to present
any real evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of pro-Chavez demonstrators gathered outside the high
court Friday, and about 20 policemen arrived at the scene to head
off street violence.
</P>
<P>
   The case against the congressional head is likely to add to
Chavez's political woes because it follows the suspension of last
Sunday's general elections due to technical glitches and the
resignation on Monday of the entire electoral board.
</P>
<P>
   Miquilena was the president of an assembly that rewrote
Venezuela's constitution, and is currently the president of the
temporary legislature. He was also instrumental in selecting the
electoral council members who were forced to resign this week.
</P>
<P>
   Miquilena faces charges stemming from a state contract awarded
to a printing company in which he holds shares. He is also accused
of giving a lucrative Justice Ministry contract to an insurance
company owned by a business partner.
</P>
<P>
   His attorneys dismissed the allegations. Attorney General Javier
Elechiguerra said Friday he wasn't ''accusing'' Miquilena, but
instead sought to open an investigation and reach a conclusion of
innocence or guilt.
</P>
<P>
   The court now has five days to decide whether to continue with
an investigation against Miquilena or drop the charges.

<HEADLINE> A fast moving storm fells trees and power lines, some homes damaged </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A fast-moving storm thundered through
eastern and central New York on Friday, felling trees and power
lines and leaving thousands of residents without electricity.
</P>
<P>
   In Syracuse, there were as many as 6,000 people without power.
In eastern New York, Columbia and Saratoga County were hit
particularly hard. Officials from Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.
reported that as many as 25,000 people were without power.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're expecting to have power restored to the majority of our
customers in eastern New York by midnight,'' Nick Lyman, a
spokesman for NiMo, said. ''But we expect to work throughout the
night and for much of Saturday to restore power for the rest of
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Saratoga County Sheriff's Department,
significant damage was reported in the town of Milton, were as many
as ten homes were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had multiple houses with trees on them and road closures,''
Saratoga County Undersheriff Michael Woodcock said. ''No injuries
were reported as a result of the storm.''
</P>
<P>
   In central New York, thunder, lightning and high winds also
brought down trees and caused power outages.
</P>
<P>
   In parts of Syracuse, winds moved as fast as 55 mph. In East
Syracuse, Wal-Mart shoppers got quite a scare when lightning struck
the building. Merchandise outside the store was also damaged.
</P>
<P>
   High winds knocked over swing sets, trashed bicycles and brought
down tents. Some of the hardest hit areas in central New York were
Lysander, Manlius and DeWitt, according to NiMo officials.
</P>
<P>
   The New York State Electric and Gas Corporation says the storm
knocked out power for about 3,500 of their customers, most of them
in the Town of Owasco, the Village of Cayuga, and the City of
Auburn.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Rebels Issue Warning  </HEADLINE>
By CESAR GARCIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A guerrilla group announced Friday it
would arrest corrupt officials and businessmen, making it the
latest in a series of controversial rebel ''laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement follows previous rebel edicts including one
vowing to kidnap millionaires who refuse to pay rebel ''peace
taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas have long kidnapped the wealthy for ransom and
executed or subjected local officials to ''revolutionary trials''
for alleged corruption.
</P>
<P>
   But by issuing ''laws'' formalizing these practices, the FARC is
apparently trying to claim status as a parallel government.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy seeks to stem ''the systematic sacking of public
finances,'' Raul Reyes of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, said in a telephone interview with The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Officials found to have stolen public funds or facilitated their
theft may be arrested, fined, and forced to return the money -- with
interest. Those offering bribes will face the same punishment those
who pocket them.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC's latest ''law'' comes after months of political
turmoil following President Andres Pastrana's March 30 proposal to
dissolve congress through a popular anti-corruption referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The plan resonated with Colombians fed up with the Andean
country's daily diet of corruption scandals, including revelations
earlier this year of $2.7 million in phony contracts by the
congress.
</P>
<P>
   However, Pastrana withdrew his plan a week ago after opposition
legislators threatened to force new presidential elections in the
same referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides demonstrated they are only interested in protecting
their shares of the public ''cake'', the FARC said.

<HEADLINE> Canada's E. Coli Still a Mystery  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- An investigation of the water supply in the
southern Ontario town where North America's worst E. coli outbreak
occurred last month has eliminated some possible causes but failed
to determine exactly what happened, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At least seven people have died and hundreds have been sickened
by the intestinal bacteria that turned up in Walkerton's drinking
water more than two weeks ago. Four more deaths possibly linked to
the E. coli contamination also are being investigated by the
Ontario coroner.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Burns, a construction consultant assisting the
investigation of Walkerton's water, said Friday the focus had been
narrowed to the town's three wells and its aquifers -- the natural
water basins that serve as the main source for the wells.
</P>
<P>
   Burns said testing of the entire water supply that began last
week appeared to rule out other suspected causes. In particular, he
said a May 12 storm that flooded Walkerton no longer was considered
the cause of the contamination.
</P>
<P>
   The flooding could have overloaded one of the wells, Burns said,
but officials believe the source of the widespread contamination
involved the wells or aquifers.
</P>
<P>
   ''All three wells have possible pathways that would allow
contamination to enter,'' he said. One of the wells tested positive
for E. coli bacteria until recently, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the town of 5,000 located 90 miles west of Toronto
must wait at least six to eight more weeks before the water is safe
to drink, municipal officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Walkerton has been under a boil order for its water since May
21, days after the first cases of bloody diarrhea alerted health
officials to a possible contamination. Residents depend on bottled
water donated by other communities, businesses and charities, and
also either bleach or boil the water to treat it. Some have left
town, or visit friends and relatives in other communities for a
bath or shower.
</P>
<P>
   The contamination is the subject of four investigations -- by
Ontario police, the Ontario coroner, health and environment
officials, and a public inquiry being set up by the Ontario
government.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials have reported seven E. coli-related deaths --
six adults and a 2-year-old girl. The Ontario coroner is
investigating those seven victims and four other deaths that could
be linked to E. coli.

<HEADLINE> Putin: Fight Rogue States Together  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian political and military officials lined up
Friday behind President Vladimir Putin's proposal that Russia and
the United States work jointly on a nuclear defense against
so-called rogue nations.
</P>
<P>
   Putin aired the proposal in an interview with NBC television,
which was broadcast on Thursday night -- two days before U.S.
President Clinton was due to arrive in Moscow for talks with the
new Russian leader.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the agenda at the summit will be the U.S. proposal to
modify the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The United States
wants to construct a national missile defense against possible
nuclear strikes by states such as North Korea and Iran, which it
fears may acquire nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has adamantly objected to any modifications of the
treaty, arguing that any changes would upset the strategic balance
and spark a new arms race.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin's comments indicated that Russia might be moving
toward compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such mechanisms are possible if we pool our efforts and direct
them toward neutralizing the threats against the United States,
Russia, our allies or Europe in general,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have such proposals and we intend to discuss them with
President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials including Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov have
floated the idea of jointly working to counter any threats, which
they say would not require amending the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Gennady Seleznyov, the Communist speaker of the lower house of
parliament, lauded Putin's initiative Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything that is aimed at guaranteeing security is
positive,'' he said. ''The main possible threats to Russia, the
United States and other countries could be reduced to a minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Ivanenko, a lawmaker with the reform-oriented Yabloko
party, said that a joint defense could be a boon to the Russian
defense industry ''because it is common knowledge that our missile
system is the best in the world,'' the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The military also signaled support, with the commander of
Russia's Strategic Missile Forces suggesting that Russia and the
United States combine their ABM knowledge.

<HEADLINE> Verdict Given in O'Hair Case  </HEADLINE>
By JIM VERTUNO
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- An ex-convict was acquitted Friday of
conspiring to kidnap atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair and her family
but found guilty of extorting money from them.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair, her son Jon Garth Murray and granddaughter Robin Murray
O'Hair disappeared in 1995 along with $500,000 in gold coins.
Authorities believe they were killed and dismembered, though their
bodies were never found.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Paul Karr, 52, convicted on four counts involving extortion
but acquitted on a fifth count, conspiracy to kidnap, faces life in
prison under the so-called federal three strikes law because of his
prior convictions. Sentencing was set for Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were a lot of missing pieces to the puzzle ... bodies
for one, a smoking gun,'' juror Jeff Sloan said after the verdicts
were read.
</P>
<P>
   During the two-week trial, prison inmates testified that Karr
told them he was involved in the slayings, and federal agents
presented hundreds of telephone calls, car rentals, airplane trips
and other financial transactions they said implicated Karr and
showed he extorted money from the family.
</P>
<P>
   However, two defense witnesses testified that they saw O'Hair
alive during the time prosecutors say she was kidnapped or killed --
during the summer or fall of 1995 in a San Antonio bar and in a
restaurant in Romania in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Karr's attorney, Tom Mills, questioned the consistency of the
verdict and suggested Karr would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems like their theory was kidnapping and murder,'' Mills
said. ''It seems now we have no kidnapping and murder.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair, an outspoken atheist, reveled in calling herself the
most hated woman in America and was involved in successful court
battles in the 1960s to remove prayer and Bible-reading from the
nation's public schools. Suffering from diabetes and heart disease,
she was America's most prominent unbeliever -- a combative foe of
all organized religion -- when she vanished at age 77.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair wasn't reported missing for a year, not until her
estranged son, William Murray, called Austin police.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities questioned whether all three were victims of foul
play or merely ran off with the money from their atheist
organization, United Secularists of America.
</P>
<P>
   Some suggested that O'Hair, who was ailing, had gone off to die
quietly so Christians wouldn't pray over her. Prosecutors ridiculed
the suggestion that an ailing, elderly woman would flee to Eastern
Europe, and they said the witnesses who testified to seeing O'Hair
were mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors argued during the trial that O'Hair and her family
were held against their will and forced to transfer $600,000 from a
bank account to a San Antonio coin dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Karr, who didn't testify, gave authorities a statement in which
he acknowledged acting as an errand boy and bodyguard for the
family during the last few weeks they were known to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors presented evidence showing Karr traveled under an
assumed name to New Jersey with O'Hair's son to transfer $600,000
from a bank account to a San Antonio coin dealer. While all the
cash was converted to gold coins, only $500,000 worth was picked
up. The family disappeared soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors showed Karr was also with the O'Hairs in San Antonio
shortly before their disappearance when the family was making cash
withdrawals on credit cards and that he was sending large checks to
his own family and friends in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators suggested the mastermind behind the disappearance
was David Waters, the O'Hairs' former office manager and a former
cellmate of Karr. A convicted murderer, Waters pleaded guilty to
stealing $54,000 from O'Hair's organizations and is now serving 60
years in prison on weapons charges.
</P>
<P>
   Waters' attorney has denied that Waters was involved in the
disappearances, and he has not been charged. Danny Fry, the other
alleged co-conspirator, was found dead in Texas in 1995 with his
head and hands cut off.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Gerald Carruth said an investigation was
continuing into Karr's alleged accomplices.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Karr's ex-wife and his former boss both said
he told them he was going from Florida to Texas to play in a
high-stakes poker game in 1995. He allegedly returned with $15,000
worth of fine clothing and three Rolex watches he tried to give to
ex-wife, Charlene Karr.
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Karr testified that she refused to take the watches and
that Karr told her ''they were won in a card game and came off the
bodies of the O'Hairs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He told me David had killed them. He told me it was Madalyn
O'Hair, that she had taken the prayer out of schools and David
Waters hated her,'' Charlene Karr said.
</P>
<P>
   Karr also told his ex-wife he drove Waters to a rural area so
Waters could examine where the bodies were buried. He told her in a
taped telephone call from jail, however, that he didn't see any
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   When confronted in March 1999, Karr drew authorities a map to a
ranch near San Antonio where about 100 officers conducted a 72-hour
search without finding any bodies. Authorities think the bodies may
have been washed away in floods or even eaten by wild hogs and
coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair's estranged son, William Murray, said he felt vindicated
by the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ''We dogged this thing for years while authorities were laughing
at us telling us there was no case,'' he said. ''I understand there
was a lack of physical evidence. That's a direct result of the
police not doing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Johnson, president of American Atheists Inc., founded by
O'Hair, said the verdict would help bring closure, adding, ''There
was no doubt in our mind the man was guilty.''

<HEADLINE> Police Diver Dies in Accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A veteran police department diver died Friday
after experiencing problems during a practice deep-water dive in
Lake Michigan, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Alane Stoffregen, 50, a diver for the police marine
division, reported trouble at around 12:30 p.m., police spokesman
Pat Camden said. Her partner took her back to their boat about a
mile from shore and began administering CPR, Camden said.
</P>
<P>
   She died less than an hour later at Northwestern Memorial
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death is being investigated, Camden said.
Stoffregen was rated as a master diver and dove frequently on her
own time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stoffregen's partner, a 50-year-old man whose name was not
released, was also taken to the hospital and was in good condition.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Britain, France Issue Iraq Proposals  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Britain and France circulated dueling
proposals Friday to improve the humanitarian situation in Iraq,
which the United Nations reported was still dire despite some
recent improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The draft resolutions were designed to extend the U.N.
oil-for-food program, which lets Baghdad sell its oil to buy food
and medicine for its 22 million people living under U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   But they also contained controversial suggestions for other
changes to the program -- such as the French call to use
oil-for-food proceeds to pay Iraq's OPEC dues -- that merely served
to reinforce the divisions in the council.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan, meanwhile, issued a report Friday
on the overall humanitarian situation in Iraq, saying the
nutritional and health status of Iraq's people continues to be a
''major concern.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged Iraq to use excess proceeds from the oil-for-food
program to reduce malnutrition levels and called for the council to
speed up its approval of contracts for vital equipment to repair
Iraq's oil sector.
</P>
<P>
   Annan issued a separate report Friday from the new arms
inspection agency, saying it had made a ''good start'' in
recruiting new arms experts but noting that Iraq would have to
start cooperating in order for them to resume weapons searches.
</P>
<P>
   The British draft proposes a one-year extension for the program,
compared to the regular six-month phases that have defined
oil-for-food since its inception in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Britain and the United States have argued that the yearlong
extension would enable U.N. agencies and companies doing business
with Iraq through the program to better plan and coordinate aid
deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little indication Iraq would agree to a modified
extension since it would imply at least symbolically that sanctions
would remain in place for another year, council diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   France, one of Iraq's allies on the council, circulated a rival
draft resolution that calls for a regular six-month extension and
proposes other amendments that drew immediate opposition from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The French draft, for example, suggested that the council agree
to a longtime Iraqi demand to let the government use money from its
oil sales to pay the dlrs 34 million Baghdad owes the United
Nations and OPEC in back dues.
</P>
<P>
   The United States ruled out such a proposal, saying aid money
shouldn't be used to finance Iraq's diplomatic budget.
</P>
<P>
   Washington also criticized a key proposal in the rival British
draft resolution that was intended to speed up delivery to Iraq of
badly needed water and sanitation equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has placed about $1.6 billion worth of
contracts for such equipment on ''hold'' out of concern that they
might be used for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   While Washington has objected to the British call for speedier
deliveries, the United States has released $720 million worth of
contracts since March 1 that have been on hold, U.S. diplomats
said.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Friday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressINTERLEAGUE:
Tigers-Cubs:
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT: Juan Gonzalez was back in the starting lineup after
missing three games because of a sore foot but may be sidelined
after aggravating it while running the bases when he hit a triple.
A bone scan and MRI done Thursday were negative. ''It's a relief
for the player to know (there's no break),'' manager Phil Garner
said. ... Someone posted a newspaper clipping from a Chicago paper
in the Detroit clubhouse which implied the Tigers were pushovers.
Garner claimed innocence.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: INF Julio Zuleta was sent to Triple-A Iowa and
switch-hitting OF Gary Matthews Jr., son of the former Cubs
outfielder, was recalled. Zuleta was told to play some third base
as well as first in the minors. ... Scott Downs posted his second
career win Friday with Rick Aguilera's 300th save. When Downs
recorded his first major league victory on April 15, Aguilera ended
that game with his 1,000th career strikeout.
Orioles-Expos:
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: The Orioles have lost 17 straight games in Canada
since their last win in Toronto on June 12, 1998. The Expos swept a
three-game set from Baltimore in Montreal from June 26-28, 1998 in
the Orioles' only previous appearance at Olympic Stadium. Baltimore
has lost its last 14 games at Toronto's SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: The Expos wore a black No. 9 on the right sleeve of
their jerseys Friday night in honor of Montreal Canadiens hockey
great Maurice ''Rocket'' Richard, who died last Saturday. The
tribute, which will also appear on the team's road jerseys, will
continue for the rest of the season. It's the first time in major
league history that an individual from another sport has been so
honored. A moment of silence was observed prior to Friday night's
game against Baltimore. ... C Charlie O'Brien has changed his
number from 2 to 21.
Blue Jays-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   BLUE JAYS: Toronto has outhomered opponents 61-32 at SkyDome,
but the Blue Jays have been outhomered 32-26 on the road. ...
Friday's game was the first of a seven-day road trip. Toronto will
travel to Atlanta for three games next week and then play an
exhibition game June 8 against the Tennessee Smokies, their
Southern League Double-A affiliate. ... Overall since May 23,
Toronto is in a stretch where it will play 31 of 43 games on the
road before the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   MARLINS: Florida has the best record of any team in interleague
play, notching a 31-18 record against the American League entering
this weekend's series. The Houston Astros at 26-18 are next best,
followed by the New York Mets and Cleveland Indians at 28-21. ''The
last two years, I think in some ways teams looked past us,'' OF
Mark Kotsay said. ''They see us a young club they can come in and
take advantage of, take a couple of games from. But it also seems
like we elevate our game against the good teams. I don't have an
explanation.'' ... In an effort to attract more young fans, the
Marlins are launching a television show for children on FOX Sports
Net. The half-hour program, Marlins Strike Zone, will air for 16
Saturday mornings beginning this weekend. ... Top prospect Josh
Beckett, 19, returned to the mound earlier this week after a 48-day
absence due to shoulder tendinitis. He pitched two innings to notch
his first professional victory for Single-A Kane County. The No. 2
overall pick in last year's draft, Beckett allowed an unearned run
on two singles and no walks.
Royals-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: 3B Joe Randa's contract has been extended through
2001. He would have been eligible for salary arbitration following
this season. Randa started his career with Kansas City, spent the
1997 season with Pittsburgh, played for Detroit in 1998 and then
was traded back to the Royals. He took a .326 average in Friday's
game with seven home runs and 34 RBIs. ... DH Dave McCarty lost his
position because Friday's game was played in a National League
park. McCarty has a nine-game hitting streak and is coming off a
series in Boston in which he was 6-for-13 with a home run and five
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Reserve OF Adrian Brown has literally built himself
into a useful player. He has spent plenty of time in the weight
room bulking up and hits the ball with more authority. Brown is an
asset to the Pirates because he switch hits, can be used as a pinch
runner and plays all three outfield positions well. ... Manager
Gene Lamont admitted he and the staff have discussed the idea of
moving Jose Silva into the starting rotation. The fifth spot could
be open because Jimmy Anderson has struggled (1-3, 6.39 ERA) in his
rookie season. The Pirates pushed back Anderson's turn this time
through the rotation because of Thursday's open date. Anderson's
next start will be Tuesday against Detroit.
Devil Rays-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: Trying to win their third straight game for the first
time this season, the Devil Rays returned to the city where they
last won three in a row although not to the same stadium. Tampa Bay
won its final three games of a series at Yankee Stadium last Sept.
25-27, 1999, and have not won three straight since. ... The Devil
Rays have had 14 games decided in the last inning, tied with Los
Angeles for the most in the majors. They are 5-9 in those 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Manager Bobby Valentine reshuffled his lineup Friday
night after C Mike Piazza was sent to a Manhattan hospital for an
MRI as a result of being hit by Gary Sheffield's bat Wednesday
night in Los Angeles. Robin Ventura moved into the cleanup spot and
Todd Pratt took over at catcher, hitting sixth. ... Pre-game roster
moves also left the Mets short personnel with two players reporting
from Norfolk (OF Ryan McGuire and C Vance Wilson), OF Jon Nunnally
designated for assignment and utilityman Lenny Harris not yet
arrived from Arizona after the trade with the Diamondbacks for P
Bill Pulsipher.
Red Sox-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: Knuckleballer Tim Wakefield will start for the Red Sox
on Saturday night in place of Pedro Martinez. Wakefield has made
two starts this season allowing four runs in 8 2-3 innings. He
leads the bullpen with 33 2-3 innings, with a 1-3, 4.28 era. ...
Reliever Rod Beck, who has been on the DL since March 19 with a
nerve problem in his neck, has been assigned on injury-rehab to
Pawtucket of the International league.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Paul Byrd, who was on the 1999 NL All-Star team,
was optioned to Scranton Wilkes-Barre on Friday had no excuses in
regards to his demotion. ''I just haven't been able to keep the
ball down,'' said Byrd, who is 1-5 with a 7.86 ERA. ''I'm going to
try to make some radical changes in my delivery and hopefully
things will work out.''
Twins-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: Twins pitchers went 1-for-18 without an RBI or a run
scored in interleague games last season, striking out eight times.
... In Minnesota's last seven games, their starters had gone 5-2
with a 2.61 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: 1B Sean Casey is confident he'll pull out of his
.227 season slump. ''There's no way I would ever hit .220 for the
year,'' he said. ''If I do, I'll be the first to get on a flight
home. I believe in my ability. I know I'll put things together.
It's just a matter of when.''
Yankees-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Orlando Hernandez was back in the rotation after
missing one start with tightness in his back. El Duque started the
season 4-0, then lost his next four decisions. ... Yankees owner
George Steinbrenner was not in Atlanta for the series opener.
Instead, The Boss watched the Class A Tampa Yankees play the Fort
Myers Miracle with team vice president of player personnel Billy
Connors. ... Derek Jeter had three hits in three of his first five
games after being coming off the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: The Braves have the best home record in the majors, but
they haven't fared well at Turner Field in interleague games. Prior
to Friday night's game, Atlanta was 9-14 at home when facing AL
teams, compared with a 17-9 mark on the road since the format was
instituted in 1997. ... Bruce Chen failed to capitalize on two
chances to earn a spot in the Braves rotation, but he had been one
of the most effective members of the bullpen since being recalled
from the minors. The 22-year-old left-hander was 4-0 with a 1.93
ERA in 12 relief appearances before Friday.
White Sox-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Kip Wells, Chicago's starter on Saturday, grew up in
nearby Missouri City, Texas, and he wonders what all the flap is
about with realignment. He likes it just the way it is with the
White Sox playing the Astros every year. ''As long as we keep
coming here, it's fine,'' he said. ''It's nice to get a few nights'
sleep in your own bed. I've still got a couple of days to relax,
see my friends and eat some of that good Houston food.''
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Manager Larry Dierker expects his team's bad fortunes
to change. ''We've got to find some kind of streak somewhere when
we go for 10 or more days of playing good baseball and we begin to
believe we're going to play good baseball and begin to expect a
positive outcome,'' he said. ''We're not getting killed. I just
feel like we're not far away from starting to play better and
moving back toward .500.''
Indians-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: The Indians have placed 12 players on the disabled
list, with OF Manny Ramirez the latest addition on Friday due to a
leg injury. Since May 18, the Indians have made a total of 26
player transactions. ... The Indians had already used 18 pitchers,
five of them rookies. The team record is 26 in 1993 and they used
25 last year. ... Bartolo Colon, 5-2 with a 4.66 ERA, makes his
eighth start on Saturday. He was on the disabled list from April 16
to May 12 with a pulled left oblique muscle. ... Manager Charlie
Manuel is trying hard to conserve closer Steve Karsay, who has 10
saves in 12 chances. All but six of his 23 appearances have lasted
one inning. ''Our biggest goal is to get to Karsay in the ninth,''
Manuel said. ''I don't want to burn him out.''
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Garrett Stephenson, the first Cardinals pitcher to
start 8-0 since Bob Gibson in 1965, will go for his ninth straight
victory Saturday night. He says he pitched better in 1997, when he
finished 8-6 with the Phillies in his first full season, but didn't
get the run support. ''I don't think Randy Johnson goes in and
envisions he's going to be 9-0 or 10-0,'' Stephenson said.
''Because he knows he needs the rest of his team. He's not alone,
and he's an awesome pitcher.'' ... The Cardinals entered the game
19-24 in interleague play. Manager Tony La Russa used to be a big
fan. ''It's interesting,'' he said. ''It'd be more interesting if
we were seeing different divisions.''
Diamondbacks-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: When Mike Morgan takes Randy Johnson's spot in the
Arizona rotation for Monday's game at the Chicago Cubs, the
40-year-old pitcher will be facing one of his 11 former teams.
Morgan played for the Cubs from 1992-95 and then again in 1998
before playing last season in Texas. Johnson (9-1) is skipping his
next start because of pain in his pitching shoulder. ... Arizona's
interleague opener at Texas on Friday night began a 16-game stretch
in which the Diamondbacks will play 13 games on the road. After
playing three games each at Arlington and the Chicago Cubs, Arizona
returns to Bank One Ballpark for three games against Anaheim before
seven more games away.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: P Darren Oliver, who has complained of having a tired arm
in his last two starts, will likely miss his next scheduled start
for the Rangers. Manager Johnny Oates said he won't make a final
decision until consulting with the team's doctor, but anticipates
that someone will be called up from Triple-A Oklahoma to make
Oliver's start Monday against Los Angeles. Oliver (2-3 in his 11
starts) should return to the rotation June 11 vs. Colorado.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Rockies-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Jeff Cirillo, in his first season with the Rockies
after five-plus years with Milwaukee, likes playing at Coors Field,
where the Rockies are 19-6 this season. ''It's a great place to
hit. You go up to the plate with confidence,'' said Cirillo, who is
hitting. 324. ... Cirillo doesn't remember ever being six games
above .500 in the major leagues. ... Although appearing in 21
games, reliever Mike Myers has pitched only 8 2-3 innings. He has a
0.00 ERA. ... The Rockies started this weekend's series in
Milwaukee with a five-game winning streak, their longest since
winning seven straight in September 1998. Their 28-22 record is the
team's best after 50 games.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: C Henry Blanco is returning home to Venezuela to be
with his father, who has cancer. Blanco dressed Friday, but manager
Davey Lopes said he wouldn't play against the Rockies. ''He's very
close to his father,'' Lopes said. ''He's too distraught to play.
It's not good. He can stay as long as he has to.'' ... The Brewers
are 10-3 in games started by former Colorado pitchers Jimmy Haynes
(6-3, 4.20 ERA) and Jamey Wright (1-0, 6.35 ERA). Wright will start
Saturday and Haynes goes Sunday against their ex-teammates. ... C
Tyler Houston was activated from the 15-day DL. To make room for
Houston, the Brewers placed OF Lyle Mouton on the DL (strained
hamstring) retroactive to May 27. ... P Hector Ramirez, outrighted
to Triple-A Indianapolis on May 30, opted for free agency. ... Mark
Loretta leads NL shortstops with a .991 fielding percentage (2
errors in 224 chances).

<HEADLINE> Xerox Shootings Trial Delayed  </HEADLINE>
By JEAN CHRISTENSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- Jurors in the murder trial of a Xerox copier
repairman who gunned down seven co-workers were forced to take a
10-day break beginning Friday so the judge could teach a legal
course on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said the intermission was unusual, particularly
since last November's rampage was one of the nation's deadliest
workplace shootings and the worst mass killing in Hawaii history.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts said the break raises the prospect that jurors will
be exposed to news coverage of the case, but defense attorney Jerel
Fonseca said he does not consider that a problem. Prosecutor Peter
Carlisle declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if it's going to be problem, but it obviously is
a concern,'' said Honolulu attorney Keith Shigetomi, who is not
connected to the case. ''If you're the defense, you're always
concerned about the impact of delay.''
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Judge Marie Milks informed both sides before the trial
began May 15 that she was teaching a course on legal ethics at the
National Judicial College in Minneapolis next week. Closing
arguments will be held when the trial resumes on June 12.
</P>
<P>
   The defense does not dispute that the defendant, Byran Uyseugi,
40, shot and killed the seven Xerox employees, but he has pleaded
innocent by reason of insanity. He would face up to life in prison
if convicted. Hawaii does not have the death penalty.

Putin: Fight Rogue Missiles Together

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian political and military officials lined up Friday
behind President Vladimir Putin's proposal that Russia and the United States
work jointly on a nuclear defense against so-called rogue nations. President
Clinton was due to arrive in Moscow on Saturday for talks with the new Russian
leader. Topping the agenda at the summit will be the U.S. proposal to modify the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The United States wants to construct a
national missile defense against possible nuclear strikes by states such as
North Korea and Iran, which it fears may acquire nuclear weapons. Russia objects
to ABM Treaty changes.

<HEADLINE> UN Wants Money for Women's Issues  </HEADLINE>
By HARMONIE TOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Five years after most of the world's
nations pledged in Beijing to push for women's equality, a lack of
money and political will have largely thwarted progress toward the
goal, the president of the U.N. General Assembly said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Theo-Ben Gurirab spoke ahead of Monday's opening of a five-day
conference to review progress on the platform for action adopted at
the 1995 U.N. women's conference in Beijing, which laid out a
roadmap for achieving equality for women.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there had been political will we would have gone a long way
toward meeting the goals and objectives set in Beijing,'' said
Gurirab, who is expected to be elected president of next week's
special session of the General Assembly to assess progress since
the Beijing conference.
</P>
<P>
   The platform of action, adopted by consensus by 189 countries,
called on governments to revise laws to ensure equal rights for
women, equal education for girls, and to ensure the right of women
to decide matters of sexual and reproductive health.
</P>
<P>
   It also urged governments and businesses to put women in top
decision-making positions and called for the elimination of
violence against women.
</P>
<P>
   Gurirab, who is also Namibia's foreign minister, said that a
''failure to provide the necessary financial resources to implement
the agreed commitments'' also contributed to the failure to reach
the Beijing goals.
</P>
<P>
   At next week's conference, ministers from 188 countries are
expected to debate, and possibly adopt, a new action plan to speed
up implementation of the Beijing platform. U.N. officials are
expecting 10,000 men and women to attend the conference.
</P>
<P>
   In two reports published this week, the United Nations said that
although progress could be noted in several fields -- including
education, health, and the participation of women in politics --
there remains much to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ''Women still are among the most illiterate, they are certainly
the largest proportion of the poor and the hungry, they suffer from
dislocation, violence, poor nutrition and ill-health,'' said Angela
King, special adviser to the U.N. Secretary-General on gender
issues and the advancement of women.
</P>
<P>
   ''They still lag behind men in virtually all aspects of life,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   There is still serious disagreement over the final document to
be adopted when the conference ends next Friday, especially on
issues of health and family, said Christine Kapalata, chairwoman of
the conference preparatory committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have different social systems, you have different
religious dispensations, and to have a common position on these
issues at first sight is not very easy,'' Kapalata said.

<HEADLINE> Cuban To Debut with Yankees  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The New York Yankees already have ''El Duque.''
Now, they have ''El Duquecito.''
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Hernandez, who defected from Cuba by sneaking aboard a
plane to Costa Rica, will formally sign with the Yankees on
Saturday, according to a baseball official, speaking on the
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez will make U.S. pro debut Saturday night when he starts
at home for Class A Tampa against Fort Myers in the Florida State
League.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez defected Jan. 2 and has been pitching for the Yankees'
extended spring training team in Florida. The 25-year-old
right-hander said in early April that he had agreed to a four-year
contract with New York, but the team refused to confirm the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said I would play for any team that wanted to sign me and
the best team in baseball came here with a contract,'' Hernandez
said in April. ''New York is now the city for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez is nicknamed ''El Duquecito'' because his pitching
motion is similar to that of Orlando ''El Duque'' Hernandez,
another Cuban defector who started for the Yankees on Friday night
against the Atlanta Braves. The two are not related but both
pitched for Cuba's top team, the Havana Industriales.
</P>
<P>
   Several major league teams sent scouts to watch Adrian Hernandez
work out in Guatemala after he defected. He throws 93 mph and has
been impressive since arriving at extended spring training in
Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   In one game, he struck out seven and allowed only one hit while
pitching four shutout innings. In another, he had nine strikeouts
in four innings.

<HEADLINE> Stars Hope Ice Slows Devils  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The slushy, bumpy ice at Reunion Arena might be
exactly what the Dallas Stars need to gain control of the Stanley
Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   With an 'N Sync concert forcing the ice to be covered Friday
night, the Stars know the playing surface will be in its usual
less-than-frigid condition for Game 3 Saturday night against the
New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like anywhere else in a lot of multipurpose buildings,
it's a matter of when does it get choppy and are you willing to
adjust your game because of it,'' Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock said.
''You can't play the same game the last five minutes of periods.
You have to play a territorial game, and we're very good at that.''
</P>
<P>
   The defending champion Stars took over home-ice advantage in the
finals by splitting the first two games in New Jersey. Dallas would
keep the Cup if it wins all games at Reunion, regardless of what it
does on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils have shown more speed and more lines of skill
players. The melting ice, then, could be more of a problem for them
than the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been fighting that all year,'' rookie forward Brenden
Morrow said. ''It's really hot in Dallas now, so the ice won't be
much better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars will continue to be without forward Jamie
Langenbrunner. He's missed the last four games with a knee injury
and isn't sure when he'll be able to return.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do believe I'll be back,'' he said. ''I'm doing everything
in power to be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Because hockey rinks don't vary as much as baseball stadiums and
fans are loud everywhere, some people question the benefits of
being at home. It could be argued that the road is more peaceful
because there's not the hassle of family and friends trying to get
tickets to the hottest event in town.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock, though, is convinced there's no place like home for
his team. The Stars are 9-1 in Reunion this postseason and have won
11 of the last 12 playoff games there dating to last season.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it is a loyal fan base. They shower goalie Ed Belfour
with chants of ''Ed-die!'' before the national anthem, and they've
done their best to rattle opponents. They had a field day with
Colorado's Patrick Roy, even weighing in on the Belfour vs. Roy
debate by screaming ''Eddie's better'' during Game 7 of the Western
Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very emotional building for our players,'' Hitchcock
said. ''It's a different crowd here. They stick with us for a long
time. It's a very significant advantage for us, we feel. And we
feel we're going to need it the way Jersey played in Philadelphia,
which is a loud building.''
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage the home team has is the last shift change,
which will allow Hitchcock to pick the best matchups once he sees
which players Devils coach Larry Robinson sends out.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock, though, isn't sure how much that will help.
</P>
<P>
   ''Larry really doesn't care about line matchups,'' Hitchcock
said. ''He pretty much lets 'em fly. He's got three lines that are
freewheeling and he can roll them whenever he wants. We have more
definitive checking lines.''

<HEADLINE> Court Rules on Saipan Workers  </HEADLINE>
By BOB EGELKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court ruled Friday that
garment workers on Saipan can sue their employers over alleged
sweatshop conditions anonymously because they fear disclosing their
names could get them fired or deported.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a ruling by a
judge on the island who had required that 23 women suing factories
on the island must reveal their names or their lawsuit would be
dismissed. The suit seeks damages for 25,000 garment workers.
</P>
<P>
   Saipan, part of the U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas
in the western Pacific, is home to numerous garment factories where
workers, mostly immigrant women, are not protected by U.S. minimum
wage laws but where goods can be stamped ''Made in U.S.A.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit accuses 21 manufacturers on Saipan of failing to pay
overtime and forcing them to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week
in unclean and unsafe conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The 23 plaintiffs, nearly all from China, say they were warned
by Chinese recruiters not to complain about working conditions,
speak to Americans or criticize the Chinese government. Some said
they were threatened with arrest for filing labor complaints or
that complaints prompted fines against their relatives in China.
</P>
<P>
   Factory owners challenged the anonymous suit, submitting
statements by the Chinese government and other Chinese workers on
Saipan denying retaliation for labor complaints.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Alex Munson, on Saipan, sided with the
factory owners, finding insufficient evidence of threats and saying
he had no power to protect workers from the retaliation the women
alleged.
</P>
<P>
   But in Friday's appellate court ruling, Judge Harry Pregerson
wrote that federal courts can conceal plaintiffs' identities to
protect their privacy or safety from non-parties to a suit,
including a foreign government.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissal of the lawsuit without a ruling on the merits would be
against the public interest, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling means Saipan's garment workers ''can utilize the
American courts without fear of retaliation,'' said Al Meyerhoff, a
lawyer for the women.
</P>
<P>
   E. Patrick Swan, a lawyer for the owners of two factories being
sued, said knowing the plaintiffs' names would have enabled him to
interview potential witnesses and do other necessary research.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a basic principal in our jurisprudence, that if you are
sued by someone you should have the right to know who they are so
you can properly investigate their claims. We have been deprived of
the opportunity to defend ourselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his clients are considering an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Owners Worry About Expos' Future  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Some of the partners of new Expos controlling
owner Jeffrey Loria are concerned about the team's future.
</P>
<P>
   Local investors own 76 percent of the Expos, while Loria, a New
York art dealer Jeffrey Loria, controls the team after investing
about $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Henri Masse, president of the Quebec Federation of Labour, said
Friday the end of NL baseball in Montreal ''seems to be getting
near.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Bachand, head of the Solidarity Fund, suggested Thursday
the club's survival is at stake. ''There's always hope until it's
over, but it's difficult,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reports said the rift between the local owners and Loria grew
May 18 when he demanded they invest an extra $20 million this year
and $26 million next year.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Delage Roberge, head of Boutiques San Francisco, said this
week that he and other local owners are getting ready to go public
with their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think all the stakeholders are a bit worried now,'' Roberge
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other local owners include BCE, Canadian Pacific, Le Groupe
Jean-Coutu, the Montreal and western Quebec federation of credit
unions and the City of Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, work on a new downtown ballpark hasn't started even
though construction was to have begun this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, plans called for an open-air stadium that would cost
$133 million and be ready for the 2002 season. But reports say
Loria now wants a $180 million stadium with a roof.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Expos don't have local TV or English radio
contracts.

<HEADLINE> Belize Families Bury Victims  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   PUNTA GORDA, Belize (AP) -- Families on Friday buried two victims
of a high-seas hijacking this week that left five dead, three
others injured and one still missing.
</P>
<P>
   Belize's Alice Ireheta and Juan Choc were buried in this port
village where the palm trees outnumber the people.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am trying to be strong and I'm trying to ask my family to be
strong,'' said Evelyn Ireheta, whose mother owned a grocery store
here and was headed home after doing charity work in Puerto
Barrios, Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   The daily commuter boat, Mariestela, was 20 minutes into the
75-mile trip between Puerto Barrios and this coastal village
Tuesday afternoon when three of the passengers pulled out machine
guns and began firing. The gunmen then threw the surviving women
and children overboard.
</P>
<P>
   Five people were shot to death. Three others were rescued
Wednesday morning, after spending 17-hours huddled together,
floating in the sea. Two of them, including American Larry Smith,
suffered gunshot wounds. Smith, who has lived in Belize for 27
years, was the assistant captain on the boat. He is the only one
who remains hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   The captain, Julio Requena Jr., who jumped into the water after
being shot, is still missing.
</P>
<P>
   Belizean authorities on Friday recovered the 35-passenger skiff
found in Guatemalan waters but the assailants were nowhere to be
found. Officials still do not know the motive for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, a Belizean tour cruiser recovered the bodies of
two Belizeans, a Honduran man and two Guatemalans.
</P>
<P>
   The assailants are believed to be Guatemalans but a motive is
still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point there really is no evidence as to why this
happened,'' said Bernard Lino, Belize's top investigator.

<HEADLINE> Ramsey Investigator Quits Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- A Denver private investigator working for John and
Patsy Ramsey to help solve their daughter's slaying announced
Friday that he has left the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, H. Ellis Armistead said he ended his
work on the JonBenet Ramsey case because of ''the events that are
taking place in the media.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not elaborate and could not be reached for further
comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   L. Lin Wood, an Atlanta-based attorney who represents the
Ramseys, said Friday he was not surprised that someone who worked
as hard as Armistead did ''might find that it's time to move on to
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been extremely active over the course of the three years
and has done and absolutely spectacular job for John and Patsy,''
Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 6-year-old JonBenet was found beaten and strangled in the
basement of her family's Boulder home on Dec. 26, 1996, the Ramseys
have hired legal and criminal experts to investigate the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests have been made in slaying, and Boulder police have
said the Ramseys remain under an ''umbrella of suspicion.''

<HEADLINE> Pacers Make NBA Finals  </HEADLINE>
By HAL BOCK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- For the Indiana Pacers, that last step has
always been the most difficult of all -- a roadblock to the NBA
Finals they never managed to get around.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller reminded them of just how tough the New York
Knicks could be when they were cornered in the playoffs. ''We've
got to kill the dog,'' Miller said after the Pacers won the pivotal
fifth game of the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 6, he did away with the dog, almost singlehandedly in
Indiana's 93-80 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana opened a nine-point lead at halftime, saw it evaporate
and then methodically reconstructed the edge on Miller's long-range
shooting in the fourth quarter to eliminate the Knicks, who had
beaten the Pacers three times in previous sixth games.
</P>
<P>
   After the Pacers managed an all-time playoff low of 12 points in
the third quarter and fell behind early in the fourth, Miller
brought them back. Stepping gingerly back from the 3-point line
time after time, Miller nailed long-range shots from both sides of
the court, ignoring frantic New York defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Miller scored 17 of his 34 points in the fourth quarter as the
Pacers charged from behind to finish off New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had to exorcise some demons,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he did.
</P>
<P>
   He also got under the skin of the Knicks. On one sequence he was
followed up the court by the usually placid Patrick Ewing who
marched behind Miller, shouting at him.
</P>
<P>
   Miller never looked back. Instead, he was looking ahead, to his
first NBA Finals, the last of 32 NBA players with 20,000 points to
reach the championship round.
</P>
<P>
   This was a major mountain for the Pacers to climb. They had been
disappointed four times in the Eastern Conference Finals since
1994, beaten each time in seven games,
</P>
<P>
   First, they lost to the Knicks in 1994, then to Orlando in 1995,
then in the last gasp of the Michael Jordan Chicago Bulls in 1998
and then again by the Knicks last year.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they made sure there would be no seventh game.

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted in Shelter I. Murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVERHEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- In the first recorded murder on Shelter
Island since it was settled 348 years ago, a man was found guilty
Friday of fatally shooting his neighbor and longtime friend.
</P>
<P>
   A Suffolk County jury convicted Kenneth Payne, 44, of
second-degree murder for the April 1998 death of Curtis Cook. Payne
faces 25 years to life in prison when he is sentenced June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The men had known each other for 20 years, and after Cook was
charged with sexually abusing an 8-year-old girl, Payne refused to
believe he was guilty, police said.
</P>
<P>
   But authorities said an answering machine greeting in which Cook
expressed certainty he would beat the molestation charges
apparently angered Payne. He took a 12-gauge shotgun from his
trailer home to Cook's nearby house and shot Cook in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   The killing shocked the community of about 2,500 year-round
residents. The 12-square-mile island is off the eastern end of Long
Island and accessible only by ferry.

<HEADLINE> Date Set For Fiji Hostage Release  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- The leader of the armed rebels holding much of
Fiji's government hostage said Friday he will ask the country's
tribal chiefs to make him prime minister and that he may free his
captives this weekend to ''set the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebel leader George Speight set no firm timetable for releasing
the more than 30 hostages still held in the parliament complex --
his final card in the two-week power play for control of tiny Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Fiji's new martial law regime, Capt. Howard
Politini, said discussions had moved to the fine points of a deal
for releasing the captives and a surrender of arms by Speight and
his rebels who stormed the government May 19.
</P>
<P>
   ''These have been agreed in principle -- it's just a matter of
the details,'' Politini said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to elaborate as talks resumed between the military,
the rebels and representatives of the chiefs, who hold no formal
power but wield considerable influence in tiny Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   Speight said Fiji's influential tribal chiefs will decide what
the next step should be in this Pacific nation, where the military
responded to the hostage crisis by declaring martial law Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He said rebels and the military agreed to put two options to the
Great Council of Chiefs: let the military run Fiji until a new
constitution is drawn up and elections called or allow a civilian
government led by Speight to guide the country to elections.
</P>
<P>
   Speight said he is confident most of the chiefs from Fiji's 14
provinces support him, and that he will be installed as prime
minister after the council meets on Monday. Although Fiji's chiefs
hold little formal power, they command considerable respect and
influence among the indigenous majority here.
</P>
<P>
   The new military regime's leaders have not publicly said whether
they will honor the wishes of the chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis is rooted in simmering tensions between the country's
large ethnic Indian minority and the Fijian majority, many of whom
are angry that the Indians have gained power.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are indigenous Fijians, while Prime Minister Mahendra
Chaudhry and other hostages are ethnic Indian. The rebels want
Chaudhry, Fiji's first prime minister from the minority, removed
from power and Fijians of Indian ancestry barred from leading the
country again.
</P>
<P>
   Since the crisis began, gangs have attacked ethnic Indian homes
and businesses, in some cases looting and burning the homes and
beating residents.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the parliament, more violent skirmishes erupted on
Friday. One Speight supporter was shot, apparently by another, in
circumstances that were not clear, local radio reported. Earlier,
about 10 rebel supporters were beaten and detained by police.
</P>
<P>
   In the most positive sign yet that the hostages will soon be
released, Speight said he wants Monday's meeting with the tribal
chiefs to be ''uninhibited or untainted by ... issues,'' including
the fate of the captives.
</P>
<P>
   ''All going well, my plan is to release them before the Great
Council of Chiefs meeting,'' Speight told a news conference. He
later told British Broadcasting Corp. that he would release the
hostages ''probably on Sunday because it is a church day -- it is
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Australia and New Zealand have all threatened
sanctions if Fiji is not returned to democratic rule.

<HEADLINE> Gretzky To Lead Coyotes' Operations  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky returned to hockey
Friday, not as a general manager or coach, but as the man with the
final say on all on-ice decisions for the Phoenix Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   He will decide the fate of GM Bobby Smith, coach Bob Francis and
others left dangling since owner Richard Burke agreed to sell the
franchise to Phoenix developer Steve Ellman.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any decision regarding hockey operations is the decision of
Wayne Gretzky,'' Ellman said during a news conference that felt
more like a public celebration of Gretzky joining the team as
managing partner in charge of hockey operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no reason to believe that Bobby won't be with our
organization for a long time, but that decision isn't mine, it's
Wayne's,'' Ellman said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to say what Gretzky's share of the team would be.
</P>
<P>
   Ellman said team president Shawn Hunter, whose contract expires
June 30, will run all business aspects of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky joked that his mother-in-law told him everyone needs to
be employed, but he said he did not take a day-to-day job.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see myself as a sounding board,'' said Gretzky, the most
prolific scorer in NHL history. ''Hopefully, I have some knowledge
and expertise about hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   The Great One joined Ellman's ownership group on May 26, the day
the developer had to come up with a $10 million down payment on the
team, which the group is buying for $87 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ellman originally was to pay another $17 million and transfer
Burke's debt on a $60 million loan to himself by June 30, but he
and Burke reset the deadline. Ellman now has to make a $6.5 million
payment this month, with the rest due Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Ellman was confident he would be able to raise another $100
million to complete the sale and erase the team's debt months in
advance of the revised deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, the Coyotes have the highest debt level in the NHL,
and we need to get rid of that,'' Ellman said.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky's entry into the partnership kept the Coyotes in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Had Ellman defaulted on the down payment, Burke has said he
would have sold to Microsoft billionaire Paul Allen, who wanted to
acquire an NHL team to share Portland's Rose Garden with the Trail
Blazers, his NBA team.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank you for saving our hockey team,'' one fan yelled out
during Gretzky's introduction.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't think I was going to be back into this quickly, quite
honestly,'' said Gretzky, who retired from the New York Rangers
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ellman is the principal of a company redeveloping a run-down
mall in Scottsdale. The $535 million project includes a new arena
for the Coyotes, who are tied to the America West Arena in Phoenix
the next two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hadn't decided whether to rename the team Arizona
Coyotes or keep Phoenix in the name.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the city's request for a reduced silhouette of the
arena, the playing area will need to be about 70 feet below ground,
and Ellman said architects only recently came up with a way to
allow trucks and buses to drive into the basement without a steep
climb. Having resolved that, the company will soon present a site
plan to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Burke's operating losses in America West Arena were $7 million
for the 1996-97 season, the team's first in Phoenix, but they have
doubled because of obstructed-view seats and limited revenue
streams.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Coyotes' $31 million payroll ranks in the
bottom dozen in the NHL, and Gretzky was impressed with what Smith
did to acquire players.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had a pretty remarkable year considering that (holdout
goalie Nikolai) Khabibulin wasn't in there,'' Gretzky said.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes captain Keith Tkachuk said having Gretzky in Phoenix
might assure his own future in Arizona. Tkachuk was the subject of
trade rumors this season.

<HEADLINE> Pacers 93, Knicks 80  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Reggie Miller saved his best for last, shooting
the Indiana Pacers into the NBA Finals for the first time ever with
a vintage barrage of Knicks-killing 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Madison Square Garden, the scene of some of his
greatest performances, Miller played the villain again and came
through in the clutch.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring 34 points and making five 3-pointers -- four in a span of
6{ minutes late in the game, Miller led the Pacers past New York
93-80 Friday night in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, whose Garden resume includes 25 points in the fourth
quarter of a game in 1994, eight points in 8.9 seconds of a game in
1995 and a series-turning 3-pointer from in front of Spike Lee's
courtside seat in 1998, can call this episode Chapter Four.
</P>
<P>
   In an outburst that took the life out of the no longer resilient
Knicks, Miller started his shooting spree with a 3-pointer late in
the third quarter to send the game into the fourth tied at 62.
</P>
<P>
   His next 3 gave the Pacers the lead for good, his next made it a
seven-point game and his last restored a seven-point lead with 6:08
left. He added eight more points on free throws the rest of the way
for what was by far his best game of the series.
</P>
<P>
   This was the fifth time in seven years that the Pacers had an
opportunity to get to the finals with just one victory, all five
chances coming on the road. And after losing all those games --
twice to the Knicks in 1994, once each to Orlando in 1995 and
Chicago in 1998 -- the Pacers finally won one.
</P>
<P>
   Miller handled the clinching moment with class, hugging teammate
Dale Davis at the final buzzer and then jumping into the arms of
Jalen Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Some 50 feet away, Lee stood on his feet and joined the Garden
crowd in a polite applause.
</P>
<P>
   There was no fight left in the Knicks at the end after so many
episodes of playing their best when things looked their worst.
</P>
<P>
   After Miller made his final 3-pointer with 6:08 left, the Knicks
never got closer than seven again. As the clock ticked inside 20
seconds, the Knicks permitted Miller to dribble out the 24-second
clock as he stood near midcourt.
</P>
<P>
   Anticlimactic, maybe, but another unique Miller moment anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Jalen Rose added 11 points and Travis Best 10 for the Pacers,
who will play either the Los Angeles Lakers or the Portland Trail
Blazers beginning on the road Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell had 32 points and Patrick Ewing 18 for the
Knicks, whose quest for a return trip to the finals came up short
as they were outscored 31-18 over the final 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Miller finished 10-for-19 from the field, including 5-for-7 from
3-point range, and 9-for-9 from the line. His teammates combined to
make just 19 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana led by nine at halftime but started the second half by
missing 11 of its first 12 shots. Miller broke the string with a
3-pointer, and from there it got harder and harder for the teams to
put points on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing gave the Knicks their first lead since the first quarter
on two foul shots with 2:41 left, making it 58-57, and the Pacers
finished with just 12 points in the third quarter -- the
lowest-scoring quarter in their playoff history.
</P>
<P>
   Miller hit a 3-pointer with 10:34 left for a 67-65 lead, then
another almost two minutes later to complete a 10-0 run that made
it 72-65. Miller's fifth 3-pointer made it 75-68, and a pair of
foul shots made it 77-68 with 5:25 left.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Charlie Ward hit a high-arching jumper as the 24-
second clock expired with 65:11 left, but the Knicks would not
score from the field again until 1:35 remained. By then, it was
much too late.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers led for most of the first quarter as they looked to
run a bit more than usual and drove the ball to the basket. Indiana
went to the line eight times in the quarter to none for New York
and led 30-25 after 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks pulled within one midway through the second quarter
as Allan Houston hit a jumper over Miller, but Miller came right
back with a 19-footer to start Indiana on a 14-6 run that made it
50-41 at the break.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell started the third quarter with two pull-up jumpers on
the break and a scoop shot from the lane, and a three-point play by
Ewing with 8:17 left tied it at 52.
</P>
<P>
   With Sprewell and Ewing combining for 19 of their 21 points, the
Knicks outscored Indiana 21-12 in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy's first substitution was Camby
for Ward, leaving New York without a point guard. One minute later,
with the team looking awful on offense, backup Chris Childs checked
in. Van Gundy went back to the big backcourt for the final 1:28 of
the first half, and again it was ineffective. ... Camby, who had a
terrible series, finished with no points, six rebounds and two
fouls in 20 minutes. ... The Knicks fell to 1-5 in the postseason
against the Pacers over the past two years with Ewing in the
lineup. They were 5-1 without him.

<P>
   DUNKIRK, France (AP) -- Scores of boats crossed the English
Channel to France on Friday, as part of the 60th anniversary
celebration of the rescue hundreds of thousands of Allied troops
from Dunkirk during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Pushed back by the Germans in May 1940, British and French
troops were rescued from the encircling enemy by a British flotilla
of hundreds ships and boats manned by the military and civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Braving attack by German submarines and dive-bombers, the
flotilla managed to bring 338,000 troops to Britain between May 27
and June 4.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the older ships took just under eight hours Friday to
complete the 24-mile journey. The largest vessel was a 123-foot
luxury yacht; the smallest was 27-foot-long boat.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pat Meares and Warren Morris homered as the
Pittsburgh Pirates extended their winning streak to a season-best
four games by beating the Kansas City Royals 9-3 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jermaine Dye hit his 15th home run and Gregg Zaun also connected
as Kansas City took a 3-1 lead in the second inning against Todd
Ritchie (3-3).
</P>
<P>
   Meares hit a two-run homer in the fourth off Miguel Batista
(1-4) after Kevin Young drew a leadoff walk.
</P>
<P>
   Morris led off the fourth with his second home run and first
since April 29 for a 4-3 lead. He had gone 99 at-bats without one.
</P>
<P>
   Meares and Morris hit RBI singles and John Vander Wal doubled
home two runs in a five-run eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Royals designated hitter Dave McCarty, batting .342 and coming
off a 6-for-13 series in Boston, did not play. The DH is not used
in interleague games played at NL parks.
</P>
<P>
   Bench coach Rick Renick managed the Pirates in the absence of
Gene Lamont, who was in Sarasota, Fla., for his daughter's high
school graduation.
</P>
<P>
   The start of the game was delayed by rain for 62 minutes. The
crowd of 23,527 was slightly above the Pirates' average of 22,121
for Friday night games at Three Rivers Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates hadn't won four consecutive games since July 31-Aug.
4 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie, pitching for the first time since signing a two-year,
$5.25 million contract extension, worked seven innings and allowed
four hits and three runs.
</P>
<P>
   It was just the second time in his last five starts that Ritchie
was charged with fewer than five earned runs.
</P>
<P>
   Batista, who previously pitched for Montreal, has lost three
consecutive starts and is 0-4 lifetime against Pittsburgh. He gave
up a single to Jason Kendall in the first and walked three
consecutive batters to give the Pirates their first run.
Notes: In eight starts with the Royals, Batista has allowed at
least four earned runs seven times. ... Kansas City pitchers have
given up 95 home runs in 53 games, most in the major leagues. ...
Kendall had two singles and been held without a hit just once in
the last 17 games.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Girds for Anti-OAS Protest  </HEADLINE>
By GERALDA MILLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) -- Officials in Detroit and the neighboring
Canadian city of Windsor are shuttering windows, closing courts and
beefing up police presence in anticipation of protests against a
meeting by the Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit police Friday night arrested 20 protesters carrying
anti-OAS signs and using bicycles to block traffic heading into the
Detroit-Windsor tunnel, Police Chief Benny Napoleon said. He said
the protesters were charged with misdemeanors for interfering with
traffic and could face up to 90 days in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to be as nice and kind and friendly and gentle as
possible,'' Napoleon said. But ''we are not going to allow this
city to be taken over by anybody. Anybody who disagrees with any
action, we take can take it to court.''
</P>
<P>
   The OAS, which represents more than 30 Western Hemisphere
nations, is meeting Sunday through Tuesday in Windsor, a
middle-class city of 262,000 across the Detroit River from the
Motor City.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of the 52-year-old OAS say it fails to link trade
with workers rights, environmental protection and human rights.
Others say it threatens North American jobs.
</P>
<P>
   A group called the Coalition to Shut Down the OAS held a
workshop Friday at the University of Windsor on Friday, discussing
issues such as protesters' legal rights and dealing with pepper
spray. They also painted signs for Sunday's demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ''My concern is that we have precious little left of a public
arena, of a public space where the citizens have any voice at all
in how they will be governed,'' said Jean Grossholtz, a 71-year-old
professor at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts who spoke at
the workshop Friday. ''We want to have some kind of voice ... Shut
down the meeting so that they listen and hear as they listened and
heard in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators hampered the World Trade Organization meeting in
Seattle last year and clogged downtown streets. A small number of
people smashed windows and looted stores, resulting in an estimated
$3 million in damage. More than 500 people were arrested, and
police have said they had not prepared properly.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Windsor and Detroit said they learned a lesson from
Seattle and are ready for any problems. Officers in both cities are
being issued riot gear; Windsor police also will be equipped with
gas masks.
</P>
<P>
   On the Michigan side, Wayne County Circuit Courts will be closed
Monday and Tuesday because of confidential information provided by
police, Chief Judge Michael Sapala said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a miserably difficult decision,'' Sapala said.
''Hopefully it will turn out that it was unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   With some protests planned near the Renaissance Center along the
Detroit River, tenants in the complex are being urged to come to
work in casual clothes, out of the belief that demonstrators often
approach people wearing suits.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Corp., the largest tenant in the center, sent a
memo to its employees telling them to check in before coming to
work Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from the OAS conference site in Windsor, the
CIBC Bank covered its windows on the advice of police. The bank
will remain open Monday and Tuesday, however.

<HEADLINE> Hewlett-Packard CEO Addresses Grads  </HEADLINE>
By THEO EMERY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Carleton ''Carly'' Fiorina is the
nation's top woman in the computer industry, but she still plays by
what she calls ''the rules of the garage'' -- never put your tools
away, know when to collaborate and, above all, invent.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorina, chief executive officer of Hewlett-Packard Co., shared
that advice Friday with graduates of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, where she earned her master's degree in business
management in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   She also sealed a deal Friday for Hewlett-Packard to give MIT
$25 million over the next five years for research.
</P>
<P>
   In the entrepreneurial world of high-tech the most innovative
ideas are often born in the most humble workshops, Fiorina told the
commencement audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''Leadership comes in small acts, and not just bold strokes,''
she said. ''The only limits that really matter are the ones you
impose on yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Limits are not something Fiorina succumbs to, judging by a
career path that led her last year to become the head of the
world's second-largest computer manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Now widely hailed as a role model for women in business,
Fiorina, 45, majored in philosophy and medieval history at Stanford
University. She started law school but dropped out, and once worked
as shipping clerk at the company she now heads.
</P>
<P>
   ''Engage your whole self in everything you do ... trust your
whole self and don't blink,'' she told the 2,139 graduating
students and an audience of thousands at the MIT campus.
</P>
<P>
   The $25 million research grant will go toward programs such as
the Laboratory for Computer Science, the Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory, and the Sloan School Center for eBusiness@MIT.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 5, Braves 2  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The New York Yankees picked up where they left
off in October.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee homered and drove in four runs for the second game
in a row, Orlando Hernandez pitched seven strong innings and the
Yankees defeated the Atlanta Braves 5-2 Friday night in a rematch
of last year's World Series.
</P>
<P>
   New York, which began the three-game series at Turner Field
trailing Boston by 1 game in the AL East, used a familiar formula
to beat the team with baseball's best record: dominating pitching
and timely hitting.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it was last fall, when the Yankees swept Atlanta
for their third championship in four years. They won the Series
opener 4-1, as Hernandez allowed just one hit in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   El Duque was nearly as dominating Friday, surrendering only four
hits and striking out seven. He retired 10 of the last 11 hitters
he faced, the streak broken when Brian Jordan reached on an error
by Scott Brosius.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez (5-4) snapped a four-game losing streak after skipping
his previous start because of a sore back. Jeff Nelson surrendered
Chipper Jones' 12th homer in the eighth before Mariano Rivera got
the final four outs for his 13th save in 15 chances.
</P>
<P>
   New York has the upper hand in the rivalry between the most
dominant franchises in each league, having also defeated Atlanta in
the 1996 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are seeking their sixth consecutive postseason
appearance, while Atlanta, which has lost its last two games,
appears headed toward its ninth straight trip to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves scored their other run in the third. Quilvio Veras
singled with one out, stole second and came home on Andruw Jones'
single to left-center.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees bounced back in the next inning against Kevin
Millwood (4-4). With one out, Tino Martinez doubled over Andruw
Jones' head in center, Jorge Posada walked and Ledee lined a
fastball into the second row of the right-field stands for his
fifth homer, a three-run shot.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee struck again in the eighth off reliever Bruce Chen,
doubling against the center-field wall to bring in another run. The
Yankees outfielder also had a three-run homer and four RBIs in New
York's previous game, an 8-7 loss to Oakland on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee, who has struggled much of the season, now has 11 hits in
his last 33 at-bats to raise his average to .246.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood went seven innings, giving up seven hits with three
walks and six strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter had an RBI double in the ninth against Kerry
Ligtenberg.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Rivera struck out Galarraga on three pitches to end the
eighth. First batters are 1-for-19 against the New York closer. ...
The Yankees are expected to formally announce the signing of
pitcher Adrian ''El Duquecito'' Hernandez on Saturday. The Cuban
defector will make his U.S. pro debut that night when he starts at
home for Class A Tampa against Fort Myers in the Florida State
League. ... Ho hum: Gold Glover Andruw Jones made another
sensational catch, leaping in the seventh inning to snare Paul
O'Neill's liner to the gap in left-center. ... The game attracted
the third sellout of the year at Turner Field, 48,524. ... Braves
reliever Greg McMichael has a slight tear in his right rotator
cuff, a similar injury to the one that required surgery in October.
Surgery is not an option for now. McMichael will rest his arm for
the next two weeks, then begin a ''conservative'' rehab program.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Preston Wilson homered, doubled and drove in four
runs as the Florida Marlins kept up their interleague success,
beating the Toronto Blue Jays 11-10 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins improved to a major-league best 32-18 since the
start of interleague play in 1997. They are 8-2 overall against
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Floyd and Mike Lowell each had three hits for the Marlins,
who led 9-2 after three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Stewart, who led off the game with a home run and tied a
career high with four RBIs, helped the Blue Jays rally within 10-9
in the seventh. He finished 4-for-4 with two walks.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Bones (1-0) got his first major league win since Sept. 14,
1998. He pitched 2 1-3 innings and also hit a sacrifice fly in the
fourth that made it 10-6.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Alfonseca pitched the ninth for his 16th save in 18
chances. He gave up a sacrifice fly by Craig Grebeck.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi, who began the night hitting .204 with no home runs
in his last 13 games, hit a three-run homer in the Toronto fourth
off Brad Penny.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, the Blue Jays closed to 10-9 when Stewart
doubled home two runs and scored on a single by Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Jays starter Peter Munro (1-1) allowed the first five
hitters to reach base, with Wilson's two-run double making it 3-1.
Alex Gonzalez added an RBI double later in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins, who entered having lost 11 of their prior 13,
chased Munro in the second following a two-run double by Mike
Lowell that made it 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson hit a two-run homer in the third.
Notes: Both Toronto and Florida had shortstops named Alex Gonzalez
batting seventh. The players, who both doubled to virtually the
same place in center in their first at-bats, are not related. They
both finished with two hits. ... The Marlins promoted RHP Joe
Strong, who earlier this year at age 37 became the oldest rookie in
the majors in almost 40 years, from Triple-A Calgary. ... Stewart
hit his seventh career leadoff homer.

<HEADLINE> Another Knicks Season With No Title  </HEADLINE>
By JIM O'CONNELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Despite the guarantees, there will not be a
return to the NBA Finals for the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   The latest season to end without a title finished Friday night
when the Indiana Pacers pulled away in the fourth quarter for a
93-80 victory in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   The loss in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference finals means no
repeat trip to the NBA Finals for the Knicks, who won their last
championship in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   It also added a non-title year to the Patrick Ewing era. New
York's center since the 1985-86 season was one of the players who
guaranteed a win that would send the series back to Indiana for a
Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very proud of my teammates,'' Ewing said. ''I think we
worked extremely hard. The outcome doesn't show all the work and
effort and the energy we put to get back to the championship. I
thought we worked hard. We deserve to be there, but I guess it
wasn't our turn again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing and Latrell Sprewell had the sellout crowd at Madison
Square Garden thinking there would be that deciding game when they
combined to score all but two of New York's 21 points in the third
quarter when the Knicks turned a 50-41 halftime deficit into a
62-62 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell, who had nine points in the third quarter, opened the
fourth with a 3-pointer that gave the Knicks a 65-62 lead, their
last as Reggie Miller led the Pacers on a 10-0 run. New York was
never closer than four points the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if we ran out of gas,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van
Gundy said. ''I think we played extremely hard. I just think we got
outplayed. I think it is very simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Ewing and Sprewell fought through injuries in the series as
did teammates Marcus Camby and Larry Johnson, but that wasn't
enough as Miller scored 17 of his 34 points in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be difficult to accept for a couple of weeks
while others are still playing games,'' Sprewell said.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell finished with 32 points, while Ewing had 18 points and
12 rebounds. Only Allan Houston, with 10 points, was also in double
figures for the Knicks, who had won Games 6 and 7 against Miami to
advance to the conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're going to face elimination games as you go along in the
playoffs unless you're a dominant team,'' Van Gundy said. ''Indiana
faced theirs against Milwaukee and got through it. We faced two
against Miami and got through it. Certainly you would rather play
with a cushion and be ahead. Playoff basketball is about responding
to whatever situation you're in. This isn't about anything except
they outplayed us tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell said the elimination games did make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Miami series took a lot out of us,'' he said. ''It took a
game or two to switch gears and get ready for Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year, in every game I can think of at least two guys were
playing well. This year, minus Game 3, it seemed only one guy was
carrying us.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the Knicks' team-record 13th consecutive postseason
appearance. In that span there have been four trips to the
conference finals and two to the in the NBA Finals -- a seven-game
loss to Houston in 1994 and last season's five-game loss to San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The sellout crowd was the 347th in a row at the Garden and the
usual array of celebrities was on hand. All those people and the
Knicks left again without a title.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy was asked what his message was to the team after the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not after the game. It's not the appropriate time,'' he said.
''We will get together Sunday, talk briefly and move on.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Labor Department said today the nation's unemployment
rate rose to 4.1 percent in May as businesses cut 116,000 jobs, the biggest
reduction in nine years. The report showed the jobless rate rose by 0.2
percentage point from a 30-year low of 3.9 percent reached in April. While
private sector jobs declined, this was offset by government hiring of temporary
Census workers.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After finding nearly 150 cases where aircraft maintenance
could not be documented, the Federal Aviation Administration proposed to strip
Alaska Airlines of the right to perform maintenance on its planes. The step
could eventually force the airline to park its planes and stop flying. ''We have
serious concerns about critical processes, including management effectiveness,''
Nick Lacey, director of Flight Standards Service for the FAA, said today. The
FAA's investigation is proceeding and enforcement actions -- usually civil fines
-- could be announced in coming weeks, Lacey said.

To accommodate those allies' concerns, the Democratic presidential contender
added a domestic-violence-prevention component to his ''pro-fatherhood''

<P>
   PECOS, N.M. (AP) -- Firefighters tackled a 25,000-acre wildfire head-on
today, seizing a break in the hot, dry weather as a chance to surround the fire.
''We are attacking with all our might today,'' fire information officer Tom Mott
said. ''When it's safe, it's time to strike.'' The blaze was 60 percent
contained. Thunderstorms yesterday and today gave firefighters a chance to
bolster their efforts against the blaze, which had been burning since Monday.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index wrapped up its best week in

<HEADLINE> Reds 4, Twins 3  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Michael Tucker and Dante Bichette each homered
and had three hits Friday night, leading the Cincinnati Reds over
the Minnesota Twins 4-3 in their interleague opener.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Bell (4-3) settled in after giving up Jacque Jones'
game-opening homer, allowing only three more hits during seven
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins rallied in the ninth by loading the bases off Scott
Williamson and getting a two-run single by pinch-hitter Midre
Cummings with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Graves relieved and got Jones on a disputed strikeout --
Jones claimed catcher Benito Santiago's mitt hit his bat on the
final swing, but plate umpire Jerry Layne declined to change his
call. Cristian Guzman hit into a force out, giving Graves his ninth
save in as many chances.
</P>
<P>
   Slumping Ken Griffey Jr. returned to the Reds' lineup after an
unwanted day off and went 0-for-3 with a walk in his return to
American League pitching. Griffey, acquired from Seattle during the
offseason, is hitless in his last 17 at-bats, dropping his average
to .209.
</P>
<P>
   By winning their interleague version of home run derby, the Reds
improved to 3-4 on a 12-game homestand. Minnesota lost for only the
second time in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker's solo homer and Bichette's two-run shot came off Joe
Mays (2-7), who gave up seven hits in five-plus innings and took
the loss because of his two glaring mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Bichette fouled off two 0-2 pitches before hitting his
tiebreaking homer in the fourth, his second in two games. Since
returning from a three-day benching, Bichette has been the Reds'
hottest hitter, going 22-for-48 (.458) in the last 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey made the best defensive play of the game, sprinting into
right-center field to make a backhand catch of Brian Buchanan's
sinking liner in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker, who took over for Griffey in center on Thursday and had
three hits, extended his surge by hitting Mays' second pitch over
the 404-foot marker in center in the second inning, tying the game
at 1.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker also singled twice and flew out, leaving him with 12 hits
in his last 18 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Casey drove in Cincinnati's final run with a sacrifice fly
following consecutive singles by Bichette and Tucker in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Bell ended two dismal days of pitching by the Reds, who gave up
19 runs and 33 hits in consecutive losses to Montreal. Jones hit
the rookie's second pitch for his eighth homer, but the Twins
couldn't do much more.
</P>
<P>
   Bell pitched out of a two-on, one-out threat in the sixth by
striking out Corey Koskie and Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Mays, who throws right-handed but is a switch-hitter, had an
infield single for his first career hit in the third inning. Casey,
at first, and Bell both went for his high-hop grounder, leaving
Bell late covering first on the play. Mays ran hard down the line
for his first hit in four career at-bats.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The start was delayed 17 minutes by rain. ... The Twins are
24-25 in interleague play since 1997, including 5-5 against the
Reds. Cincinnati is 24-20 overall in interleague play. ... With his
infield single, Mays matched last year's hit total by Twins
pitchers in interleague games. They were 1-for-18 without an RBI or
a run scored, striking out eight times. ... It was the fifth time
in his career and the third time this season that Jones has led off
a game with a homer. ... Bichette is 7-for-9 in his last two games.
... Slumping Reds 2B Pokey Reese (3-for-22) was out of the lineup,
but came in for defense in the eighth.

<HEADLINE> SLA Fugitive's Attorneys Seek Order  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Attorneys for former Symbionese Liberation
Army fugitive Sara Jane Olson asked a judge Friday to hold
newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst in contempt of court for giving a
magazine interview in apparent violation of the judge's gag order.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys J. Tony Serra and Shawn Chapman also asked that
District Attorney Gil Garcetti, his deputy Michael Latin and
witness James Bryan be cited for gag order violations.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge James Ideman gave prosecutors 10 days to
reply to the motion.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's request was an unusual twist for Olson's lawyers, who
have been trying to overturn the gag order on the grounds that it
infringes on their constitutional rights of free speech. In the
past, the prosecution has sought sanctions against the defense for
violating the order.
</P>
<P>
   Olson, 53, formerly known as Kathleen Ann Soliah, is charged
with planting pipe bombs under police cars 25 years ago as an act
of revenge for the deaths of six SLA members. She remained a
fugitive until last year when she was arrested in St. Paul, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   In its papers, the defense said Hearst gave an interview to Talk
Magazine, which is owned by the Hearst media empire. Hearst, who
was kidnapped by the SLA and later joined their cause, has made it
clear she resents being dragged back into the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers said she told Talk Magazine ''a story purporting
to be a history of how she met Sara Jane Olson; what participation
Mrs. Olson had with the SLA; Mrs. Olson's political and emotional
motivations regarding the SLA and its individual members; and
crimes which Hearst claimed were committed by Mrs. Olson.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Hearst should be ordered by this court to present herself for
testimony regarding her illegal tantrum,'' the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The motion accused Latin of failing to inform Hearst of her
obligation not to talk to the press, and it said Garcetti violated
the gag order in an interview with National Public Radio. It cited
former police officer James Bryan for filing and publicizing a
slander suit against Olson in advance of his testimony.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 5, Indians 1  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Darryl Kile ended a string of forgettable
interleague performances by allowing two hits in eight innings as
the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Cleveland Indians 5-1 Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Kile (8-3) had been 0-6 with a 5.97 ERA in nine starts against
American League teams. He walked the first two batters of the game
but escaped by retiring the heart of the Indians' order and allowed
only one hit -- Jim Thome's 15th home run in the fourth -- in the
first five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Kile struck out nine and walked three to tie Garrett Stephenson,
scheduled to pitch Saturday against Bartolo Colon, for the team
lead in victories. He also raised his career record to 100-98.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland, which placed All-Star right fielder Manny Ramirez on
the 15-day disabled list Friday, managed only one other hit --
Roberto Alomar's one-out single in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Lankford's two-run, two-out triple in the fifth off Mark
Watson gave the Cardinals a 4-1 lead. The hit was only Lankford's
fourth in 24 at-bats against left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   Indians starter Jaret Wright (3-4) lasted 4 2-3 innings,
allowing four runs on four hits.
</P>
<P>
   Wright escaped damage in the first and third by striking out
Mark McGwire -- who was 0-for-3 for the game -- and Jim Edmonds with
two men on. But he walked Lankford and J.D. Drew to start the
fourth. Placido Polanco followed with an RBI single and a second
run scored on a double play as the Cardinals took a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In two starts since coming off the disabled list from a strained
shoulder, Wright has given up 11 earned runs in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Vina added an RBI single in the sixth for St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ramirez, batting .322 with 47 RBIs, injured his leg while
running out a grounder during Monday's game against the Anaheim
Angels. ... Vina has been hit by a pitch a major league-leading 13
times after getting plunked to open the bottom of the first. ...
Polanco (85 at-bats) and Shawon Dunston (72) have yet to walk. ...
The Indians entered the game 28-21 in the four years of interleague
play, best of any AL team. ... The teams met for the first time
since 1998, when the Indians swept a two-game series at Jacobs
Field. ... Thome's homer tied Ramirez for sixth on the Indians'
career list at 211. ... The Indians and Devil Rays are the only AL
teams who haven't been shut out.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 7, Astros 4  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Frank Thomas hit a three-run homer over the cozy
left-field wall and the Chicago White Sox beat the Houston Astros
7-4 Friday night in the first interleague game at Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   Houston was 14-6 in interleague play at the Astrodome before
moving into its new park this season. The game drew 39,028 to put
the Astros over 1 million in attendance this season, the quickest
they've reached the mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros failed to hit a home run for the first time in 18
games, stopping their franchise record streak. There have been 96
homers in 26 games at Enron, just 22 short of the entire 1999 total
in the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox scored five unearned runs in the second inning off
Shane Reynolds (5-2), highlighted by Thomas' homer and helped by
rookie shortstop Julio Lugo's fielding error. Lugo also ended the
sixth by flying out with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Parque (5-2) allowed three earned run and five hits in 5 1-3
innings. He retired his first 10 batters before Craig Biggio
singled, but Biggio was out trying to stretch it to a double.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Foulke got the final four outs for his 11th save in 12
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago went ahead in the big second, starting with singles by
Carlos Lee and Greg Norton, the latter bouncing off Lugo's glove.
Two outs later, Ray Durham's grounder got through Lugo into center
field for an error that allowed bother runners to score.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Valentin singled and Thomas followed with his 11th home
run.
</P>
<P>
   Norton's sacrifice fly made it 6-0 in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Houston chased Parque with a four-run sixth inning that included
run-scoring singles by Ken Caminiti and Richard Hidalgo and a
two-run single by pinch-hitter Matt Mieske.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago scored its final run on an RBI double by Herbert Perry
in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Thomas needs to score one run to become the sixth active
player with 300 home runs, 1,000 runs scored, 1,000 RBIs and 1,000
walks. ... Lugo led off for the first time this season. ''I led off
in the minor leagues most of the time,'' he said. ''I'm comfortable
there but I'm just grateful to be in the lineup in any spot. I know
I need to get on base.''

   SAUGUS, Mass. (AP) -- One is a venerable broadcasting
organization. The other is a disco with 3-D murals of dancing
aliens. Both are called BBC.
</P>
<P>
   That's a problem in the eyes of the British Broadcasting

<HEADLINE> Mets 5, Devil Rays 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Todd Zeile hit a three-run homer in the sixth
inning as the New York Mets overcame Fred McGriff's 400th home run
and beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 5-3 Friday night in their
interleague opener.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff hit a two-run homer in the sixth off Glendon Rusch
(3-4), becoming the 31st player to reach 400 and giving the Devil
Rays a 3-2 lead. He drove in Tampa Bay's other run with an RBI
single in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff has career 10 home runs at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile, who has four home runs in his last six games, connected
off Rick White (1-4) in the bottom half for his 10th homer of the
season, helping New York improve to 5-2 against Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch allowed three runs and six hits in six-plus innings,
striking out six and walking none. Pat Mahomes relieved after Mike
DiFelice's leadoff single in the seventh and later escaped a
bases-loaded jam when Gerald Williams flied out.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Benitez, the Mets' fourth pitcher, got three outs for
his 14th save in 15 chances. After a pair of walks, Benitez struck
out pinch-hitter Greg Vaughn -- normally Tampa Bay's designated
hitter -- on a 3-2 pitch for the final out.
</P>
<P>
   Devil Rays starter Albie Lopez allowed two runs and three hits
in five inning. He gave up a double to Edgardo Alfonzo and a walk
to Robin Ventura before Zeile's homer.
</P>
<P>
   Rain delayed the game 1 hour, 22 minutes in the middle of the
third inning. When play resumed, Jay Payton homered on the second
pitch from Lopez for a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After McGriff's RBI single tied it in the fourth, Todd Pratt put
New York ahead 2-1 in the fifth with an opposite-field homer, his
sixth of the season and fourth in five games.
</P>
<P>
Notes: After Zeile's homer, White hit Pratt with the next pitch.
Pratt went straight to first base. ... Mike Piazza was sent to a
Manhattan hospital prior to the game when he said he felt
''sluggish''. Piazza, hit by Gary Sheffield's bat on a backswing
Wednesday night at Los Angeles, had a CAT scan, then was cleared to
play. He did not appear in the game.

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Mateo Injured  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Texas center fielder Ruben Mateo, one of
the American League's top rookies, was carried off the field on a
cart Friday night after he tripped over first base while trying to
beat out a grounder.
</P>
<P>
   When Arizona second baseman Craig Counsell briefly bobbled the
grounder, Mateo made an extra effort to get to the base. His right
foot landed awkwardly on a corner of the bag and he went tumbling
to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo, who was out on the play that ended the seventh inning,
was on the field for about 10 minutes before he was put on a
stretcher and lifted onto the cart after his right leg was
stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   Texas said the injury appeared to be to the upper right leg or
right knee. Mateo was taken to a Fort Worth hospital for X-rays and
evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo, who has started 52 of the Rangers' 53 games in center
field, is hitting .291 with seven home runs and 19 RBIs. He leads
AL rookies in average, multihit games (18), hits (60), runs (32)
and total bases (92), while ranking second among first-year players
in stolen bases (s) and doubles (11).

<HEADLINE> Report: 49ers, Rice in Agreement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Jerry Rice and the San Francisco
49ers reportedly reached a tentative agreement that would keep the
receiver with the team for the next two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Steve Mariucci said the team and Rice were very close, but
have not yet finalized the deal. The NFL has to approve the
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Examiner said the agreement restructures the
2000 and 2001 seasons of Rice's contract, which runs through 2004.
The deal saves the team more than $1 million against the salary
cap.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, 37, the leading receiver and touchdown scorer in NFL
history, has been willing to reduce his salary and bonuses. Jim
Steiner, Rice's agent, said the only snag was finalizing the
incentives Rice will receive in exchange for the new contract.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers have said quarterback Steve Young, out for 13 games
last season after a series of concussions, will make an
announcement about his future by June 10.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Rebels: Military Backed Out  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Rebels who have seized control of Parliament
charged Saturday that Fiji's military has backed out of an
agreement that would have led to the quick release of 30 hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel leader George Speight had earlier said he might release
his captives this weekend, following an agreement with the military
to let Fiji's influential tribal chiefs determine the next form of
government -- military or civilian.
</P>
<P>
   But the rebels said Saturday that the military had changed its
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been a breach of faith,'' said Speight spokesman Joe
Nata. He said the military had signed off on a plan to let the
chiefs resolve the dispute, but later insisted Fiji would remain
under military control.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came after rebels met with representatives of
new martial law leader, Commodore Frank Bainimarama.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from the military, or comment
from Speight on how the deadlock would affect the fate of the
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, a spokesman for the military, Capt. Howard Politini,
said discussions had moved to the fine points of a deal for
releasing the captives and a surrender of arms by Speight and his
rebels who stormed the government May 19.
</P>
<P>
   Speight has maintained that he's confident most of the chiefs
from Fiji's 14 provinces support him, and that he will be installed
as prime minister after the council meets on Monday. Although
Fiji's chiefs hold little formal power, they command considerable
respect and influence among the indigenous majority here.
</P>
<P>
   Speight threw Fiji into crisis on May 19 by seizing Prime
Minister Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and 30 other members of
the government. The crisis eventually prompted the military to
declare martial law and throw out the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis is rooted in simmering tensions between the country's
large ethnic Indian minority and the Fijian majority, many of whom
are angry that the Indians have gained power.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are indigenous Fijians, while Chaudhry and other
hostages are ethnic Indian. The rebels want Chaudhry, Fiji's first
prime minister from the minority, removed from power and Fijians of
Indian ancestry barred from leading the country again.
</P>
<P>
   Since the crisis began, gangs have attacked ethnic Indian homes
and businesses, in some cases looting and burning the homes and
beating residents.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the parliament, more violent skirmishes erupted on
Friday. One Speight supporter was shot, apparently by another, in
circumstances that were not clear, local radio reported. Earlier,
about 10 rebel supporters were beaten and detained by police.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Australia and New Zealand have all threatened
sanctions if Fiji is not returned to democratic rule.

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Slumping Alex Arias doubled home the winning
run with one out in the 11th inning Friday night and the
Philadelphia Phillies defeated the Boston Red Sox 2-1 to end their

</P>
<P>
   Brian Hunter drew a one-out walk off reliever John Wasdin (0-2)
