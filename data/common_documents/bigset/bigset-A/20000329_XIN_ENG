<HEADLINE> Late Israeli PM's Grandson Confirmed Dead in F-16 Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel Air Force Major Yonatan
Begin, grandson of late Prime Minister Menachem Begin, was
confirmed dead by pathology officials Wednesday night after the F-
16 fighter he piloted crashed into the sea two days ago.
</P>
<P>
The body remains of Yonatan Begin, a married airmen with a
seven-month-old daughter, and his navigator Lieutenant Lior Harari,
a 23-year-old young officer, was finally identified, according to
Israel wire reports.
</P>
<P>
Yonatan, 30, was a grandson of Menachem Begin, who was Israel's
prime minister from 1977 to 1983 and won a Nobel Peace prize for
signing a historic peace treaty with Egypt in 1979. Menachem Begin
died in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Yonatan's father Benny Begin was a former Knesset (parliament)
member and held a post in Benjamin Netanyahu's government. He
resigned following Israel's signing of the Hebron Accord allowing
more Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank in 1997.
</P>
<P>
As an extreme right-wing politician, Benny Begin ran an
unsuccessful campaign for prime minister in the 1999 general
election and resign from politics then.
</P>
<P>
Yonatan Begin and Harari took off from the force base in Ramat
David Monday night for a routine training flight with their two-
seat F-16 fighter.
</P>
<P>
About 8 p.m. local time (1800 GMT), the plane lost contacts with
the control tower and disappeared from the radar screen about 20
kilometers off the coast of Atlit, a town 70 kilometers north of
Tel Aviv. As such it is believed that the plane had plunged into
the Mediterranean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency procedures were immediately implemented and navy and
air force search teams carried out an extensive search to locate
the plane and its crew.
</P>
<P>
However, little hope is held out that the two officers will be
found alive at the late stage of the search.
</P>
<P>
Major General Eitan Ben Eliahu, commander of air force,
appointed a commission Monday night to investigate the reason for
the accident, which remains a mystery according to air force
officials. 
</P>
<P>
The last contact about 10-15 seconds prior to disappearance of
the place showed no problems on the jet and the weather conditions
and visibility were good at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, something occurred too quickly for the crew to give
a report or gain control of the plane, and even left no time for
the airmen to eject themselves from the aircraft, these officials
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although senior air force officials refused to jump to
conclusions over the cause, some experienced fighter pilots
indicated that it may be due to "spatial disorientation", commonly
known as vertigo.
</P>
<P>
According to these pilots, vertigo is one of the most difficult
areas to train for. Local media even quoted one officer involved
with flight safety as saying:" There are two types of pilots: those
who have had vertigo and those who are going to get it."
</P>
<P>
It cannot be determined exactly what took place until the
aircraft is located, as there are also possibilities that the crash
was due to engine or mechanical failure. 
</P>
<P>
There had been a series of crashes involving the U.S.-made
multi-purpose F-16 fighter jets. An F-16 crashed in the Negev
desert on February 2 during a routine training mission, apparently
due to the failure of its engine.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Forces Bombed South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli forces continued attacks in
south Lebanon Wednesday morning, damaging two civilian houses.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese News Agency reported that the Israeli troops cannoned
the city of Hadath on the edge of the "security zone" after
Lebanese guerrillas attacked Israeli positions nearby.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday noon Israeli fighter jets circled over Nabatiye and
Iglem Tufaah, creating fearful blare over the regions, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-styled 15-kilometer-deep security zone
in 1985 in south Lebanon with a claimed aim of protecting its
northern border from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or party of God, is
spearheading a guerrilla war in the zone to oust the Israeli troops
and their ally South Lebanon Army from south Lebanon, the last
active Arab-Israeli battlefront.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Minister Urges Expatriates to Invest in Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Minister of Economy and
Foreign Trade Mohammed al-Imadi on Wednesday urged Syrian
expatriates to invest in their motherland.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian government has been striving to improve the
investment environment in the country to woo more investments, said
Imadi at a joint press conference with visiting Chairman of the
Islamic Development Bank (IMB) Ahmed Mohammed Ali who arrived here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the draft amendment of the Investment Act No. 10 met the
various needs of investors and removed the defects of the old law.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that his ministry has adopted measures
to upgrade state-owned banks and their operational mechanism as
well as to set up a personnel training centre.
</P>
<P>
A large number of Syrian banking personnel were sent abroad to
get further training, Amadi said, noting that a project on the
working system of free trade zones had been worked out pending
approval by relevant agencies.
</P>
<P>
He added that a number of projects would be tabled to the IDB
during the chairman's stay here. However, he did not go into
details of the projects.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ahmed Mohammed Ali expressed the IDB's desire to
further contribute to Syria's economic development programs.
</P>
<P>
The Jiddah-based IDB, formally opened in October 1975, has
invested 303 million U.S. dollars in Syria's productive sectors,
infrastructure and imports of production equipment.

<HEADLINE> Virgin Atlantic Moves to Pudong Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 29 (Xinhua) - British airline, Virgin Atlantic,
announced Wednesday that it moved its Shanghai operations from
Hongqiao Airport to the newly opened Shanghai Pudong International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
Pudong Airport has been under construction since the end of
1997 with the first commercial flight arriving there in the autumn
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The new airport has been built to enable Shanghai to handle the
increased air traffic and passengers resulting from the city's
economic expansion and growing popularity of China as a tourist
destination.
</P>
<P>
The first flight arriving at the new facility was Virgin
Atlantic VS250, which left Heathrow on March 25, arriving in
Shanghai March 26.
</P>
<P>
Mark Siladi, Head of Asia-Pacific for Virgin Atlantic, said "
The new airport is fantastic news for Virgin Atlantic and all of
the airlines flying into Shanghai."
</P>
<P>
"Pudong airport has a capacity for 20 million passengers a year
at present and this number could quadruple over the next few years
with the expansion plans that have been put in place," he added.

<HEADLINE> Mexico to Increase Oil Exports By 150,000 BPD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Mexico will increase its oil
exports by 150,000 barrels per day ( bpd) starting April 1, Energy
Minister Luis Tellez announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tellez said that the 4.6 percent increase over the present
output is the answer to the agreement announced by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
He told the press that this is a "moderate" figure that will
permit to maintain the consensus among the producing countries,
with which Mexico contributes to the oil market stability.
</P>
<P>
He said that the figure corresponds in the first place to
Mexico's trade interests, and in the second place, to the
producing countries consensus to maintain crude prices stable.
</P>
<P>
Mexico is not OPEC member but it was one of the main world oil
output reduction promoters in March of 1998, to achieve a price
increase. For maintaining the stable oil prices, Mexico have cut
its oil- put to 2.9 million bpd so far from that date.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela to Boost Oil Output by 125,000 BPD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela will increase is oil
output by 125,000 barrels per day (bpd) up to 2.84 million, Mines
and Energy Minister Ali Rodriguez said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nine of the 11 Organizations of Petroleum Producing Countries (
OPEC) agreed in the Vienna meeting Tuesday night on a 6.3 percent
increase, a total of 1.45 million bpd in their production
starting April 1.
</P>
<P>
The decision was welcomed in Venezuela, where the producing
countries accord was called "correct." "It is going to have an
effect, but the market can bear it," said former Energy minister
Humberto Calderon.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC and other producing countries like Mexico, decided in
March of 1998 to reduce the production to maintain the
international price level, causing the steady rise in the prices,
that reached their highest level of the last nine years in
February of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC will hold an extraordinary meeting on June 21 in
Vienna to study the market situation, and has scheduled a summit
of chiefs of state and of government for September in Caracas, the
Venezuelan capital.
</P>
<P>
OPEC member Venezuela is the largest oil exporter in the
Western Hemisphere.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Withdraws All International Staff From Southern Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations had
withdrew all its international staff form Kandahar, Afghanistan,
after its offices were raided twice by armed Teliban soldiers, U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations had been compelled to stop work in the area
in the interests and safety of United Nations staff, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
On March 26, armed Teliban, the biggest warring party in
Afghanistan, entered a number of United Nations premises,
allegedly in search of escapees.
</P>
<P>
On March 27, armed Taliban again forced their way into U.N.
premises, and property was damaged and staff were intimidated.
</P>
<P>
These actions are clear violations of United Nations immunity
and of formal agreements between the United Nations and
Afghanistan signed in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
After withdrawing from Afghanistan in August 1998 following
the killing of a U.N. staff member in Kabul, the United Nations
began to re-engage starting in March 1999. Since that time, the
scale of humanitarian assistance in southern Afghanistan has
steadily increased due to the vulnerability of the population.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations remains committed to providing humanitarian
assistance to the people in southern Afghanistan, the United
Nations said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Presidential Amendment Gets Simple Majority in Parliament Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A constitutional amendment bill
that would allow President Suleyman to stay on for a second, five-
year term got a simple majority vote in parliament on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The outcome -- 303 for, 202 against and 11 abstentions -- was
the first step towards final passage of the proposal, put forward
by Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit to clear the way for Demirel to
continue as president.
</P>
<P>
Demirel was elected in 1993 for a single seven-year term as
stipulated by the current constitution. His tenure ends in May.
Enabling him to stay on would strengthen Turkey's image of
stability, as Ecevit believed.
</P>
<P>
According to Turkey's Constitution, for a constitutional
amendment to be legislated, the bill must be voted on twice. The
second vote is set on April 4.
</P>
<P>
During the second vote, the proposal must secure 367 votes to be
passed. If it gets over 330, or three-fifths of the votes, but less
than 367, it can be enacted only after being approved in a national
referendum.
</P>
<P>
But if it failed to solicit 330 votes, the bill is rejected.
</P>
<P>
Although the ruling parties and the prime minister expect around
400 deputies to support the amendment drive during the second vote,
political analysts warn that no one can estimate how deputies would
vote in a secret ballot. Casting votes in secret may enable some
deputies not to toe party's line.
</P>
<P>
Thus the final result depends on whether leaders of the
coalition government can convince their deputies to support the
move.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Ecevit said he was "hopeful" that
proposal for the constitutional change will pass the parliamentary
general assembly.

<HEADLINE> Barak Tells Clinton of Possible Unilateral Exit from Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak has
sent a message to U.S. President Bill Clinton regarding a possible
unilateral Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon, sources in
Barak's office said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But the sources did not say when the message was sent.
</P>
<P>
Barak also made his intention clear in the past few days to
Jordan king Abdullah Bin Hussein and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, who met with Clinton in Washington on Tuesday, according
to the sources.
</P>
<P>
During his phone talks with Russian President-elect Vladimir
Putin Wednesday afternoon, Barak reaffirmed his determination to
quit Lebanon by July as he had pledged.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk also
implicitly endorsed Israel's stands on the withdrawal issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy, Indyk said that his country supports Israeli troop withdrawal
from south Lebanon on the basis of United Nations Security Council
Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, passed in 1978 after Israel launched a large-
scale aggression against Lebanon in the name of wiping out
Palestinian guerrillas there, calls for an immediate and
unconditional Israeli pullout from all Lebanese territory and for a
return of full sovereignty of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Indyk was quoted by Israel Radio as saying that the U.S. just
cannot stop Israel from pulling out of the "security zone" in south
Lebanon, as it means the implementation of Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
The 15-kilometer-deep security zone was set up by Israel in 1985
with a self-proclaimed aim of preventing cross-border guerrilla
attacks on its north. But mounting Israeli casualties have spurred
a growing public pressure for a pullout. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet on March 5 gave backing to a key pledge made
by Barak to withdraw from the buffer zone by July, with or without
a peace deal with Syria, the major power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Some strategy experts pointed out that Israel hopes the
announcement of possible unilateral withdrawal would made the
Syrians lose the last bargaining chip and force them to return to
the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Their talks, which resumed last December after a 45-month break,
broke off again in January over a dispute on the fate of the Golan
Heights, a strategic Syrian plateau seized by Israel in the 1967
Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel's wishful thinking was damped by Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad, whose summit meeting with Clinton in
Geneva last Sunday failed to produce any progress as expected. The
summit was once regarded as the last chance for reviving the talks.
</P>
<P>
To face this reality, Israel leaders had to mull more seriously
than before about their plans to carry out the redeployment
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
Israel Defense Forces have been simultaneously preparing a plan
code-named "Morning Twilight" and a plan called "New Horizon" in
case of withdrawal without or with security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, Morning Twilight would keep some
military outposts in areas about 500 meters north of the Israeli
borderlines.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak prefer another proposal submitted by his
confidant and coordinator of activities in Lebanon, Uri Lubrani, in
which Israel should withdraw completely to the international border
to wrap its moves in international legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
Barak believed such a redeployment would leave the
responsibility for keeping peace along the border on the shoulders
of Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, he added, it will make it hard for Lebanese to rally
international support should Israel be forced to respond to
Lebanese Hezbollah guerrilla's attacks on its soldiers or northern
towns.
</P>
<P>
Some experts predicted that Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim
militant group fighting to end Israeli occupation since 1980s,
would escalate its activities against Israeli soldiers and even
launch cross-border attacks from south Lebanon in the case of a
pullout without agreements.
</P>
<P>
To fill the security vacuum, Israel has been promoting the idea
in the past few weeks of a multinational peacekeeping force in the
zone as its troops leave.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the European Union has
expressed interest in the idea and France has agreed to send
soldiers during French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's visit here
last month.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry David Levy is expected to meet with
Annan in New York to discuss Israel's unilateral withdrawal from
Lebanon and the deployment U.N. forces in the area.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Middle East special coordinator Dennis Ross is also
scheduled to travel to New York to discuss with Annan about
international efforts that would be required in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which has
been in the region since Israel's first invasion of Lebanon in
1978, currently deployed in the parts of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel hoped the force would be expanded to fill in areas of the
security zone vacated by its occupation troops.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Al-Hashemi-II: Kuwait's Maritime Legacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaitis on Wednesday
presented a belated "gift to the new millennium" by unveiling Al-
Hashemi-II, a newly-built huge wooden dhow which reminds people of
Kuwait's maritime legend before the discovery of oil in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
The land-based boat, located at the seaside about 20 kilometers
southeast of capital Kuwait City, was officially opened Wednesday
to dignitaries and the press only, after three years of
construction.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sabah
Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, along with over 1,000 ministers,
parliamentarians, foreign diplomats and special guests, attended
the inaugurational ceremony for the Grand Ballroom of the ship.
</P>
<P>
Shipbuilder and one of the owners, Hussain Marafie, expressed
hope that the traditional craft could be listed as the largest
wooden boat in the Guineas Book of World Records.
</P>
<P>
Al-Hashemi-II, Marafie's third and most ambitious ship-building
project, weighs about 2,500 tons, with a length of 83.75 meters and
a breadth of 18.5 meters. The main mast is 50 meters high.
</P>
<P>
Over 170 workers and professionals took part in the project,
incorporating traditional expertise and advanced technology. A
total of 3,000 cubic meters of imported African timber, six tons of
copper sheet, and about 80 tons of nails, nuts and bolts were used.
</P>
<P>
There are about 5,500 bulbs and light fittings in the double-
decked vessel. The interior decoration of the main ballroom,
capable of holding 1,000 people, is made from 24-karat Italian gold
leaf.
</P>
<P>
The dhow complex is affiliated to Radisson SAS Hotel, a five-
star hotel beside it. Once it is open to the public, facilities are
available for traditional Arab wedding ceremonies, banquets and
conferences.
</P>
<P>
On his motivation, Marafie said "my primary aim is to link the
solemn past with the glorious present to leave a monumental legend
for an ardent future."
</P>
<P>
Shipbuilding is no longer a major industry in Kuwait nowadays,
he said. However, building such a boat is to "show youngsters today
what their forefathers did."
</P>
<P>
Building Al-Hashemi-II is also "for upholding my family
tradition," he added. Marafie's great-grandfather built a dhow
named Al-Hasehmi more than a century ago.
</P>
<P>
Dhow is a ship with one large sail, used especially by Arab
sailors for trade round the coasts.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has been proud of its maritime past. Dhow and sea are in
fact the symbol of the country's maritime tradition. The emblem of
the Gulf state is a falcon with outspread wings embracing a dhow
sailing on sea waves.
</P>
<P>
Exquisite dhow models are erected in front of many luxury hotels
and government buildings. Small and big dhow models are also sold
in almost all gift shops.
</P>
<P>
Before the discovery of oil reserves in 1930s', Kuwait relied on
a class of seafarers who used dhows to carry cargo around the Gulf
or as far as to and from South Asia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
Other Kuwaitis, meanwhile, supported their families by using
dhows for fishing and pearl-diving in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Al-Maskati, 76, a former sea captain of working dhows
and Marafie's project advisor, said he was glad to see dhows are
now being outnumbered by fibre glass and iron boats. There were
once up to 150 big dhows plying the Gulf trade, he added.
</P>
<P>
But what has actually made Kuwaitis bid farewell to the dhow
days is the flourishing oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Abundant oil revenues have helped change the lives of modern
Kuwaitis by allowing them to replace dhows with cars, tents with
villas, hard outdoor work with comfortable indoor jobs.
</P>
<P>
However, while enjoying a modern life brought about by rich oil
resources, most Kuwaitis still feel deeply addicted to the sea.
Various sea clubs and recreational gardens along the seaside are
favorite resorts for families and students during holidays.
</P>
<P>
As a way to let the younger generations remember the country's
maritime tradition, Kuwait's sea clubs have also been organizing
pearl-diving summer camps for volunteer youngsters since 1986.
</P>
<P>
The activities usually last one week or 10 days, with youngsters
setting sail their dhows in the daytime, tracing their forefathers'
footsteps. Then they return to the seashore for camping before
sunset and cook dinner by themselves.
</P>
<P>
Last year more than 100 students took part in a pearl-diving
camping. Kuwaiti Emir Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah financed the purchase
of the 10 dhows for the activity.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Meets British Official on Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
on Wednesday met visiting British Minister of State for Foreign
Affairs Peter Hain mainly on the Middle East situation after a U.S.
-Syrian summit failed to revive the Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The talks mainly touched upon the latest developments of the
peace process in the region after U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, during their Sunday summit meeting
in Geneva, failed to agree on a timetable to resume the Syrian-
Israeli negotiations which were suspended in January.
</P>
<P>
Syria has insisted that Israel make a written commitment to a
full pullout from the Golan Heights it captured in the 1967 Middle
East war before the talks could be resumed, while Israel wants
Syria to make concessions on border issues and demands that
security arrangements, Israel's access to water be discussed first.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Abdullah and Hain reviewed efforts made by
parties concerned to make tangible progress in bringing the peace
process back on track, Jordan's official news agency Petra reported
without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also attended by Jordanian Royal Court Chief
Fayez Tarawneh and Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah al-Khatib.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Hain praised King Abdullah's efforts to help the
parties involved in the peace process overcome the difficulties
impeding the peacemaking, Petra said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been a major peace broker between Israel and its Arab
neighbors since it signed a peace treaty with the Jewish state in
1994.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom takes peace and cooperation as the corner stone of
its foreign policies, and said it supports all efforts by all
parties which would help usher in a just, durable and comprehensive
peace in the region.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Seizes 138 Kilograms of Smuggled Ivory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian police have seized 138
kilograms of smuggled ivory in the southern region of Aswan, the
country's Environment Affairs Agency said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 78 pieces of raw tusks, with a market value of about 850,000
Egyptian pounds (246,000 U.S. dollars), were recovered on Tuesday
in a raid on a tourist bazaar warehouse, a statement released by
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The uncarved tusks have been smuggled from central Africa and
collected by the unidentified warehouse owner for distribution to
carved ivory traders in Egypt, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Environment Affairs Nadia Makram Ebeid
said the seizure, a record haul for Africa, proved that Egypt was
not indifferent to wildlife preservation.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, 1,000 tons of ivory were sold every year. The
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species banned
ivory trading worldwide in 1989 to save a declining elephant
population, but smuggling of African ivory remains a problem.

<HEADLINE> Peaceful Guinea-Bissau Meets With Worrying Economic Situation, U.N. Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The overall situation in
Guinea-Bissau is peaceful, but the West African country's economic
situation remains worrying, a senior U.N. official said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The overall situation in Guinea-Bissau is peaceful and the
humanitarian situation has noticeably improved," said Kieran
Prendergast, U.N. under-secretary-general for political affairs.
</P>
<P>
Prendergast made the statement at the open Security Council
meeting on Guinea-Bissau, the former Portuguese colony currently
in the process of peace building and security restoration.
</P>
<P>
"More political detainees have been provisionally released and
the trials of some of them have already begun, despite the severe
logistical and human constraints facing the judiciary," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Regrettably, the economic situation remains worrying," he
said. "The Government still does not have resources to pay the
long overdue salaries to civil servants and the soldiers."
</P>
<P>
"Concerns continue to linger over the difficulties encountered
in redefining the relationship between the new government and the
military establishment in the post-electoral period," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is encouraging to note that negotiations between the
government of the former Military Junta are continuing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has urged members
of the international community to provide urgent assistance for
the government's 100-day transitional program.
</P>
<P>
"This program is critical for the credibility of the new
government as it faces mounting pressures from ordinary citizens
demanding basic services in areas such as water and electricity,"
Prendergast said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council held the open meeting a few days after
Guinea-Bissau's former rebel leaders, who overthrew the nation's
president almost one year ago, have been named ministers of the
new democratically-elected government.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the coup, Guinea-Bissau has elected a new
president and government in presidential and legislative elections
which were deemed free and fair.

bednet will be unveiled with hundreds of African school children.
The Guinness Book of Records will be present to record the event.
</P>
<P>
WHO hopes that the event will draw attention to the urgent need
to provide more insecticide treated bednets in Africa, adding that
insecticide treated nets are one of the most effective tools for
the prevention and control of malaria.

<HEADLINE> 26 Political Parties to Contest Greece's April 9 Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A total of 26 political parties,
including the five ones that held seats in the recently dissolved
Greek parliament, will participate in the country's April 9
legislature elections.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four political parties initially submitted their
applications for taking part in the elections, but eight of them
had failed to fulfill the criteria for running in the elections,
the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
ANA quoted Greek Supreme Court sources as saying that two
parties had submitted their applications past the deadline expiry
while the six others had failed to submit candidate lists.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming elections, the 10th since the restoration of
democracy in Greece in 1974, is expected to be held mainly between
the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) and the main
opposition New Democracy (ND).
</P>
<P>
The ruling party-led by incumbent Prime Minister Costas
Simitis won the 1996 parliamentary elections by obtaining 41.49
percent of the votes, followed by ND with 38.12 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ruling PASOK is expected to be re-elected in the elections
although the two largest political parties may run neck-and-neck
in the elections, according to the results of recent nationwide
polls.

ATHENS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis Wednesday expressed once again his concern over the
escalating violence in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, saying
that he did not expect the spread of violence into the area
between Kosovo and southern Serbia.
</P>

<HEADLINE> World Education Forum to be Held in Senegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The World Education Forum is
scheduled to be held in Dakar, Senegal, on April 26-28, it was
announced at a meeting here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The forum will be sponsored by the World Bank, the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP), to mark the 10th anniversary
of the World Conference on Education for All.
</P>
<P>
At that conference, over 155 governments promised at Jomtien,
Thailand, to ensure that children all over the world would, by the
end of the decade, have the opportunity to receive a good quality
basic education.
</P>
<P>
But this promise has been broken, according to the pre-Dakar
meeting held here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A document released in the meeting, which was organized by the
UNESCO and some non-governmental organizations, said as the world
approaches the new millennium, over 40 million children in
sub-Saharan Africa alone are denied their right to basic
education.
</P>
<P>
In fact sub-Saharan Africa is scarcely any closer to achieving
education for all than it was a decade ago, it said.
</P>
<P>
Enrolment rates are lower than they were in 1982 and illiteracy
is increasing. In countries such as Mozambique and Burkina Faso,
boys can expect to receive three years of education, and girls one
year less.
</P>
<P>
A recent study covering 10 countries found that one-third of
all children were being taught in a classroom without a
blackboard, and more than 70 percent were attending schools
without access to clean water.
</P>
<P>
In countries such as Chad, Mozambique and Ethiopia, fewer than
half of the children who enter schools complete the final grade.
In 14 countries, more than one-third of the children who start
schools drop out before completion.
</P>
<P>
The document pointed out that if current enrolment trends
continue, the number of children out of school will rise to
51million by 2005 and 57 million by 2015, and unless these trends
can be reversed, Africa will account for over three-quarters of
all children out of school by 2015.
</P>
<P>
It said under-investment by African governments, coupled with
poor targeting, has been the major factor behind the deteriorating
quality of education and the increasing costs of education to
households.
</P>
<P>
In many countries households now meet more than half of the
costs of basic education directly from their pockets. The
combination of high cost but low quality basic education is at the
heart of the crisis in sub- Saharan Africa's public school
systems.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the two-day pre-Dakar meeting, UNESCO representative
Cheikh Ndiaye said although governments carry the primary
responsibility for education, extended partnership between
government and non-governmental organizations, the private sector,
local communities and religious groups are necessary to help
achieve the goal of education for all in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the formation of partnerships has become a central
concept in planning and managing education, especially in
situations where significant numbers of children are deprived of
education, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called for increased aid to primary education in
Africa from the current level of 277 million U.S. dollars to 1.5
billion U.S. dollars over the next five years, and mobilizing at
least one billion U.S. dollars per annum through debt relief under
the World Bank's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Currency Suffers 13 Percent Devaluation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The value of the Mozambican
currency, the metical, is still falling despite hopes that it
would stabilize at about 15,000 meticais to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
For a few days in mid-March, the currency seemed to have
settled at about that rate. But the slow slide has now resumed: in
the legal foreign exchange houses called "secondary market", the
exchange rate has slipped to 15,600 meticais to the U.S. dollar
while on the illegal, parallel exchange market, the rate has gone
up to 15,800 meticais to the U. S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
This means that the metical has suffered a 13 percent
devaluation since the start of the year. According to the
independent newsheet "Metical", the exchange rate on the parallel
market on December 31 last year was 13,900 meticais to the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The official Bank of Mozambique rate on Tuesday was 14,500
meticais to the U.S. dollar. Thus the official and the parallel
rates are drifting further apart from around two percent to nine
percent.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks seem to have decided to compete with the
secondary and parallel markets. According to "Metical", some banks
would offer 15,800 meticais per U.S. dollar last Friday.
</P>
<P>
This is bad news for those wishing to purchase imported goods,
and for industries reliant on imported raw materials and spare
parts.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the devaluation will make Mozambican exports
more competitive. It will certainly do something to assist cotton
producers, who have been complaining about the low prices they
receive.
</P>
<P>
The basic calculation is that the peasant producer should
receive 55 percent of the FOB (free on board) cotton price, which
is about 45 U.S. cents per pound. This works out at 2,850 meticais
a kilo, which is by no means negligible.
</P>
<P>
Falling prices of cotton over the past two years have led many
farmers to switch to other crops.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Angolan rebels led by Jonas
Savimbi have recently killed three traditional tribal chiefs in
the central highland, the official news agency Angop said here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The murders of the "sobas", the Portuguese word for the tribal
chiefs, took place in the villages of Tundatchivava, Tchissala and
Epanda, all of them located in the central Bie Province, where
there are still many rebel guerrillas although the rebel
conventional troops have been repelled out of the major cities.

<HEADLINE> Italy Supports Reduction of Africa's Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRETORIA, March 29 (Xinhua) --Visiting Italian Deputy Foreign
Minister Senator Rino Serri said here on Wednesday that his
country supports the reduction of Africa's debt burden.
</P>
<P>
"A decision is coming together in Italy of a total cancellation
of debt for countries which qualify according to the Highly
Indebted Poor Countries Organization (HIPC) by the World Bank," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Italy would play a "more pivotal role not only
with regard to the government's attitude, but also with regard to
the mobilization of Italian public opinion" on debt relief.
</P>
<P>
"With the opportunity of the jubilee year, we will ask for the
withdrawal of debt," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, Serri met his South African counterpart
Aziz Pahad to discuss various international and African issues,
including conflicts and debts.
</P>
<P>
Pahad voiced hope that other members of the G-8 would listen to
Italy's plea for the cancellation of debts. "We hope their voice
will be heard strongly in G-8 forums," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a need to help Africa out of this situation where we
have the greatest number of least developed countries in the
world," Pahad said.
</P>
<P>
The Organization for African Unity has charged South African
President Thabo Mbeki and his Algerian counterpart Abdelaziz
Bouteflika to look at ways of reducing Africa's debt.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders have made a joint written submission to the
leaders of G-8 countries, which comprise the world's leading
economies including Italy.

<P>
According to recommendations made by the Parliamentary Reform
Committee, the Fifth Parliament will hold hearing on a daily basis
to give more time to members of Parliament to ask Cabinet
ministers questions.
</P>
<P>
At present, the question-and-answer is only held every
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The question and answer session will change from being held
once a week and will now be on a daily basis to give members of
Parliament more time to ask questions," Parliament Deputy Clerk
Helen Dingani told a lunch- hour discussion on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
She said the issue of non-attendance, especially by Cabinet
ministers, has repeatedly irked the back-benchers who accuse the
executive of arrogance.
</P>
<P>
Some ministers have continually failed to attend Parliament to
respond to questions raised by the back-benchers during the oral
answer session and the Speaker has on several occasions had to
force some ministers to make their representations, she said.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Members Urged to Develop Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 29 (Xinhua) --The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) has urged its member states to pool their
resources together and negotiate common positions in matters
relating to agriculture.
</P>
<P>
This would avoid duplication of efforts and under
representation at meetings of the World Trade Organization (WTO),
said COMESA Assistant Secretary General Sindiso Ngwenya here on
Wednesday when officiating at a COMESA regional workshop on WTO
Agriculture negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said the third WTO ministerial meeting held in Seattle late
last year clearly demonstrated that developing countries could
achieve what they wanted if they spoke with one voice.
</P>
<P>
The importance of the agriculture sector to COMESA countries
could not be over emphasized as it contributes a significant share
to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of most COMESA member states,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said in some instances, agriculture is a source of
livelihood for not less than 80 percent of the population in the
COMESA region.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is central to the interests of both the rich
industrialized countries in which it is heavily subsidized and in
developing countries in which it is often the backbone of their
economies and the principal source of their earnings, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ngwenya said that African countries constitute the majority of
WTO members and it is therefore in their interest to play an
active role in the deliberations of the world body.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, recent economic policy changes in developing
countries, emphasizing openness and market orientation, have given
them a much greater stake in the outcome of trade talks," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"This, together with the emergence of global markets in the
different sectors, has held out the prospect of productive
participation in world trade as a viable path to development," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the restrictive practices of the developed
countries made it impossible for agricultural products from
developing countries to enter their markets under the guise of not
meeting the required sanitary standards.

<HEADLINE> Poor Nutrition Blamed for AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Poor nutrition may be
contributing substantially to the heavy burden of HIV/AIDS
afflicting Sub-Saharan African countries.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth Regional Health Community (CRHC) Secretariat
for East, Central and Southern Africa, which is holding a meeting
in Tanzania's north town of Arusha on Wednesday, underscored the
urgent need of improving the nutritional status of people in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"Poor nutrition increases the susceptibility of HIV infected
people to illness and secondary infection. On the other hand,
improved nutrition slows the progression of HIV to AIDS and the
transmission of HIV," said CRHC coordinator for the food and
nutrition program Boitshepo Giyose in a statement.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that it is important to consider nutrition in
dealing with HIV/AIDS since nutrition is the first defense line
against infections and diseases.
</P>
<P>
Giyose noted that the main causes of malnutrition in people
with HIV/ AIDS include reduced food intake, increased nutrient
requirements and impaired nutrient absorption.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the rate of malnutrition in the
CRHC member countries is more than 40 percent, a situation which
poses great risk of HIV infection to people in these countries.
</P>
<P>
With over 10 percent of the adults already infected, the region
has the highest rate of HIV infections in the world.
</P>
<P>
The situation is becoming more dangerous as more people are put
at a risk of severe malnutrition and starvation by war, famine,
and other emergencies such as floods, read the statement.
</P>
<P>
CRHC member countries include Botswana, Lesotho, Kenya, Malawi,
Uganda, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa,
Zambia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Shelter SLA after Withdrawal: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel will provide shelter to
the South Lebanon Army (SLA) and find ways to protect them and
their families after Israel's troop withdrawal from south Lebanon,
said a senior Israel official Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"SLA people and civilian aid workers, who are Lebanese citizens
whose place is, of course, in the villages of south Lebanon, will
decide whether they are staying in south Lebanon," Danny Yatom,
chief of staff of Prime Minister's Office, told the Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
"If they request it, we will help them find a different place of
residence...in Israel, or in lands across the sea," Yatom said,
adding that "those SLA choose to live in Israel would be allowed to
do so."
</P>
<P>
The SLA militiamen, armed and paid by Israel to help it patrol
the self-styled "security zone" in south Lebanon, was seen by the
Lebanese government as traitors. Some of the leaders have been
condemned to death in absentia by Lebanese courts, and officials
are facing criminal charges punishable by death.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen also fear that they could fall victim to deadly
revenge once the Israeli army pulls out of south lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak met SLA leader General Antoine
Lahad here on Tuesday to discuss the withdrawal, which Israel
wanted to undertake within a peace agreement with Syria, the main
power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But the chances of reaching this peace deal soon receded as U.S.
President Bill Clinton failed on Sunday in Geneva to convince
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad to resume peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syria refused to go back to the negotiating table until Israel
made a prior commitment to a full withdrawal from Golan Heights,
which Israel captured during the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy reiterated Wednesday that
Israel would make good its pledge to redeploy its troops on the
international border with Lebanon by July, with or without the
peace deal with Syria.
</P>
<P>
But Syria has cautioned that violence could follow Israel's
unilateral withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 850-square-kilometer border strip in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the self-proclaimed aim of protecting its
northern security. Since then, Lebanese resistance movement
spearheaded by Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to end
Israeli occupation there.
</P>
<P>
Israel trains and arms the SLA, totalling 2,500 to 3,000
members, to back their presence in south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> SMEs Urged to Transform Themselves under New Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Speakers at the forum of World
Summit on Small Business 2000 which opened here Wednesday urged
small and medium-sized enterprises to transform themselves in
order to survive, develop and prosper under the new circumstances
featuring globalization and rapid technological advances.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting is hosted by the Association of Small and
Medium Enterprises of Singapore (ASME) under the auspices of the
World Association for Small and Medium Enterprises (WASME), a
global non-governmental organization of small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs), to seek practical solutions to the challenges
and problems faced by SMEs in the global market place.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the forum which focuses on "
Enterprise Development and Global Networking," WASME President Ki-
Jung Ryu told more than 500 participants that the most practical
solution to help people suffering dire poverty and famine in the
least developed and developing countries is to nurture, promote
and develop SMEs.
</P>
<P>
He also said the best way to meet threats, dangers and problems
brought about by globalization and free competition is to foster
the SME sector which is the backbone of a dynamic middle class and
has the proven capability to create jobs.
</P>
<P>
He urged governments to create appropriate business environment
and positively support SMEs with legal, social, economic and
institutional backup so that they may cope with various
difficulties such as lack of capital, out-of-date technology,
shortage of skilled manpower and inexperienced management.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote address, Singapore Minister for Trade and
Industry George Yeo said rapid technological advances and
globalization have transformed the economic scene presenting new
threats and opportunities and those who do not adapt to the new
environment will be left behind.
</P>
<P>
He said those SMEs that are able to transform themselves will
prosper, adding SMEs will have to be e-connected and think like
bigger companies.
</P>
<P>
SMEs will have to find new niches, develop their own strengths,
harness the technologies, be much more innovative and link up with
partners from other sectors, he added.
</P>
<P>
Other presentations by internationally well-known speakers also
highlighted new and severe global economic seniors which require
SMEs to evolve for survival and development.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, WASME conferred the Legion of Honor
Award and Special Honor Award on 11 personalities and institutions
including the Municipal government of Changzhou, China, in
recognition of their outstanding contributions to the development
and promotion of SMEs.
</P>
<P>
It was also reaffirmed that World Summit on Small Business 2002
will be held in the Chinese city of Changzhou.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Urges Transport Group to Drop Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada appealed Wednesday to transport groups not to push through
with their planned strike on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Estrada said there is no reason for the
groups to hold the strike, especially as prices of petroleum
products may go down soon.
</P>
<P>
"I hope they will not push through with the strike since the
issue of rising fuel cost may be resolved soon," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, leaders of transport groups reportedly said that there
will be no retreat in Thursday's nationwide strike against oil
price increases.
</P>
<P>
The strikers will come from drivers' groups as well as militant
youth and labor organizations. Their plan is to paralyze the
transport system in Metro Manila starting at 6:00 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also assured tricycle drivers who are going to join the
strike that his administration would not implement the phase-out
of leaded fuel immediately.
</P>
<P>
The phase-out of leaded fuel was reportedly one reason why some
tricycle drivers are joining the strike. They said unleaded fuel
would harm their motorcycles' engines.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, reports said leaded gasoline will be phased out on
April 1 as part of the implementation of the Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also assured the public that the government is prepared
to assist commuters who might be affected by Thursday's action.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Dane Lantin of the Land Transportation Franchising and
Regulatory Board said that at least 525 buses will be ready to
assist passengers who might be stranded by the planned strike.
</P>
<P>
Lantin said government trucks and vehicles will also be fielded
while military trucks will be on standby.
</P>
<P>
As part of the contingency plan, bus terminals will be secured
by the police.

<HEADLINE> India Welcomes OPEC's Decision to Raise Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 29 (Xinhua) -- India welcomed on Wednesday the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' (OPEC) decision to
increase crude oil production this year, saying that oil import
prices might come down due to the decision, the Press Trust of
India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
"This is good news. I feel, with this, the rise in import
prices of crude might halt and subsequently come down to a
desirable level," Indian Petroleum Minister Ram Naik told the PTI
in Mumbai on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the OPEC decision would relieve the
developing countries of the burden of high oil prices, under which
they were "reeling" for the last one year.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that before the OPEC meeting, India had
written to the body to ask it to consider the interests of the
developing nations while taking a decision on the issue.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day OPEC meeting that ended in Vienna early
Wednesday, nine of the 11 members agreed to restore production as
of April 1 to the level that existed prior to the cuts of 1.7
million barrels per day (BPD) imposed in March 1999, which means
an increase of 1.452 million BPD.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts expect the oil price to fall by one to two
dollars per barrel on account of the OPEC decision, while a one-
dollar-per-barrel fall in international crude oil prices is likely
to reduce India's annual oil bill by over 25 billion rupees (581.4
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A major importer of crude oil, India spent an estimated 570
billion rupees (13.26 billion U.S. dollars) on oil imports in the
1999-2000 financial year. It is likely to import a total of over
100 million tons of crude and petroleum products during 2000-01.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure of surging crude prices in the international
market, the Indian government last week announced price hikes for
Liquefied Petroleum Gas and Kerosene, both major cooking fuels for
Indians, causing great controversy across the country.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan Rebels Overrun Military Base as Peace Talks Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Colombo, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebels on
Wednesday overran a key military base in the northernmost Jaffna
peninsula as the government continued another round of talks here
aimed at resolving the long-running conflict.
</P>
<P>
The separatist rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (
LTTE) said they took the Thalaiyadi-Maruthankerni-Chempianpattu
army complex after an intense 12-hour battle ending around noon
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement sent here from their office in London, the LTTE
said more than 100 government soldiers and 25 guerrillas were
killed in the fighting that followed a rebel offensive on Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the Ministry of Defense said only 13 soldiers were
killed and 146 others injured in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also hinted that government troops had lost ground
to the advancing LTTE rebels in the eastern Vadamarachchy sector
of the Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"Considering the ground situation, troops deployed in
Maruthankerni area were tactically withdrawn to southwest of the
lagoon and consolidated along the lagoon front," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Government troops captured the Jaffna peninsula from the rebels
in 1996, but since then the LTTE rebels have been trying to retake
their former stronghold.
</P>
<P>
The upsurge in fighting came as President Chandrika Kumaratunga
met her major political rival to seek a political settlement of
the conflict between government troops and the LTTE rebels who
have been fighting for a separate homeland for minority Tamils in
Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga on Wednesday held her fourth round of talks with
the main opposition United National Party (UNP) leader Ranil
Wickremesinghe at a meeting that was interrupted because of heavy
fighting between government troops and LTTE rebels, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Wickremesinghe is expected to meet the president again on
Thursday to pursue the talks aimed at agreeing on the
constitutional reform proposals to resolve the conflict.

<HEADLINE> Indian Govt Signs Ceasefire Deal With Underground Outfit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The central government of India
and the Bodo Liberation Tigers (BLT), an armed underground outfit
in northeast India's Assam state, Wednesday agreed to a ceasefire
and framed ground rules for suspension of operations, the Press
Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
During two days of talks between India's Home Ministry and the
BLT, both sides agreed to set up a Joint Monitoring Group
consisting of representatives from the central government, the
Assam government and the BLT to oversee the suspension of
operations by both sides, which has been in force since March 15
and would last for six months, the PTI reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the ground rules, the BLT would completely abjure the
path of violence and not indulge in killings, kidnappings,
extortion, intimidation, carrying of arms in public, and agree to
abide by the Constitution and laws of the country.
</P>
<P>
The government security forces, which include the army,
paramilitary and state police would also not launch operations
against the BLT, said the ground rules.
</P>
<P>
According to the Indian Home Ministry, the BLT had been held
responsible for 250 violent incidents since 1997, in which 14
security personnel and 200 civilians were killed and 26 weapons
were looted. The underground outfit was also accused of blowing up
bridges, oil pipelines and other strategic installations in Assam.
</P>
<P>
At least 63 members of the BLT have been killed and 297
arrested since 1997, while 140 others surrendered during the
period, the PTI said.
</P>
<P>
The BLT suspended its operations against security forces in
July 1999. Indian Home Minister L K Advani told parliament earlier
this month that the central government had decided to suspend
operations by the security forces against the BLT.

SINGAPORE, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government said
Wednesday that it has suspended import of beef from Japan as a
result of an outbreak of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) in that

</P>
<P>
The Department of Primary Production (PPD) under the Ministry

the decision on suspension of beef imports from Japan took effect
immediately, short of giving an exact time.
</P>
<P>
PPD said the suspension will have no impact on the supply of
beef in Singapore except that a few specialty restaurants will not
be able to serve Kobe beef.
</P>
<P>
This is because the quantity of imported Kobe beef is very
small and a dozen of other countries including China remain
accredited and approved by PPD to export beef to Singapore, PPD
added.
</P>
<P>
Kobe beef, the sole variety of beef Japan exports to Singapore,
is a very expensive beef produced only in Japan. Singapore imports
16,500 tons of Kobe beef from Japan annually valued at 77.2
million Singapore dollars (45 million U.S. dollars), averaging
about 500 kg per month.

<P>
Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) is a virus-caused acute and
serious animal disease affecting cloven-hoof animals such as
cattle, pigs, sheep and goats. FMD spreads very quickly and is
highly contagious to susceptible animals.
</P>
<P>
The FMD infection is air-borne and animals are usually infected
through contaminated infected livestock products and contact with
the infected animals.
</P>
<P>
Although the FMD disease virus does not infect humans it causes
serious economic losses to the farmers.

<HEADLINE> Russia Closes 46 Local Airports in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The number of airports functioning
in Russia went down by 46 last year from 533 a year ago, due to
slimmer traffic, higher fuel prices and poor management, a top
aviation official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of passengers traveling by air dropped 4 percent to
21.5 million and fuel prices jumped 3.8 times to 5,000-8,000
rubles (177-283 U.S. dollars) a metric ton last year, said Karl
Ruppel, deputy director of the Federal Air Transport Service.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the industry was also hurt by the 8-20 percent hike
in airport dues and the almost doubling of air tickets, the Itar-
Tass news agency quoted Ruppel as saying.
</P>
<P>
He urged the federal authorities to strengthen the regulation
of the airports to boost their effectiveness and to streamline the
airports' practices to be closer to western standards.
</P>
<P>
Russia spent some 2 billion rubles (70.75 million dollars)
developing airports around the country last year, 80 percent of
which came from individual enterprises, Tass said.

<HEADLINE> Schewardnadse: the West should not isolate Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Before German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's visit to Georgia on Thursday Georgian President Eduard
Schewardnadse warned the West not to isolate Russia. In his
interview with a German pictorial news magazine "Stern" he said: "
We want that Russia to be brought deeply into the European and
global process. The country should not be isolated in any case."
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Schroeder will make an official visit to
Georgia from March 30 to 31 and hold talks with Georgian President
Edurd Schewardnadse. The top theme of talks will be the situation
in Caucasia and Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
In the interview with "Stern" Schewardnadse expressed his hope
for an immediate end of the Chechen war: "Every armed conflict
threatens peace and stability of a whole region." Although Georgia
recognizes "completely the territorial integrity of Russia," it is
willing to mediate.
</P>
<P>
Georgia is striving for joining in the European Union and the
NATO before 2005 according to Schewardnadse. He thought there are
"no contradictory" between good relations with Russia and an
integration in western alliance. "We want to cooperate with a
stable, democratic and economic prosperous Russia," he said .
</P>
<P>
Schewardnadse hopes that Germany can continue its economic
aids for his country. It was reported that Chancellor Schroeder
would bring Georgia a package aid of 50 million marks for year
2000 and 2001 this time.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Economy Expected to Grow by 4.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Canada's economy will advance by 4.
4 percent in terms of gross domestic product this year,
outperforming all other G-7 countries except the U.S., the country
's National Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the Bank of Nova Scotia as forecasting a "
very upbeat" rise resulting "from the austerity and all the
restructuring we went through in the 1990s."
</P>
<P>
The amount varies, from just under 3 percent in central
provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba to 6 percent in the western
province of Alberta. The country's richest and most populous
province Ontario will see a growth rate of 5.4 percent, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's another leading bank, the Toronto-
Dominion Bank, predicts a jobless rate at 6.2 percent by the end
of next year, which would be even lower than the current 6.8
percent and the lowest since 1976.
</P>
<P>
Peter Drake, the bank's deputy chief economist was quoted as
saying that Canadians "are now beginning to enjoy the good times
that their U.S. counterparts have been enjoying for some years."
</P>
<P>
Rising incomes, falling tax rates, very low inflation and
strong corporate profits will spur the economy while pulling
unemployment down through 2001, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New-Home Sales Fall in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The country's new-home sales
fell by 0.5 percent in February as rising mortgage rates cut into
demand, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sales of new single-family homes declined to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 919,000 last month, the lowest since
November but still at a healthy level.
</P>
<P>
In January, new-home sales rose a revised 0.3 percent to a rate
of 924,000, the highest level since July. That was much stronger
showing than the 4.2 percent decline the government previously
reported.
</P>
<P>
In February, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage
was 8.33 percent, up from 8.21 percent the month before. In
February 1999, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage was 6.81
percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists expect home sales to slow this year but still remain
at healthy levels.
</P>
<P>
By region, the West posted the biggest loss. Sales there fell
by 10.7 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
234,000 units. Sales in the South fell by 0.2 percent to a rate of
429,000.
</P>
<P>
However, sales rose a strong 15.6 percent in the Midwest last
month to a rate of 170,000 and sales in the Northeast grew by 1.2
percent to a rate of 86,000.
</P>
<P>
The median price of a new home, meaning half sold for more and
half sold for less, rose to 162,000 U.S. dollars in February, up 2.
5 percent from January's price of 158,000 dollars.

<HEADLINE> China to Launch Nationwide Giant Panda Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- China will launch its third
national giant panda survey starting in April, said Ma Fu, deputy
director of the State Forestry Administration.
</P>
<P>
The survey will determine the number of giant pandas living in
the wild, in zoos and their habitats. This information will
facilitate in setting up a giant panda monitoring system and
information management system, said Ma.
</P>
<P>
The survey will include 55 counties in southwest China's
Sichuan Province and northwestern Shaanxi and Gansu provinces,
covering an area of more than 22 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that only 1,000 giant pandas survive in the
mountainous regions of Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. To
protect the endangered animal, China has set up 33 nature reserves,
covering a total area of 1.6 million hectares. Artificial
breeding programs have been successful. About 220 giant panda cubs
have been bred artificially and more than 60 have survived.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that China's drive to develop its western regions has
brought unprecedented opportunities to save the giant panda from
extinction. The government plans to ban cutting natural forest and
turn farmland into forests." In this way, giant panda reserves
will eventually be connected and allow the animal to roam freely
from one reserve to another and find suitable mates," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for this survey began last June. The World
Wildlife Fund (WWF) providing strong financial and technical
support. The survey is scheduled to be completed by June, 2002.

<HEADLINE> Grain-for-Green Project Takes off in West China (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The grain-for-green project is aimed to help restore ecological
balance in China's western regions. Local analysts say that this
project marks a fundamentally change in the style of economic
growth in China and will have a profound influence on the
sustainable development of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Western region has suffered severe soil erosion because of
excessive logging and cultivation over the past decades.
Deforestation and desertification were major causes of severe
flooding in China in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, local governments in the backward western areas cannot
afford to subsidize farmers livelihood after turning grain fields
back into the forest. The central government therefore came in and
launched its grain-for-green project.
</P>
<P>
The central government will pay 1.40 yuan for every kg. of
grain that local governments give to farmers for reforestation.
</P>
<P>
Local economists say that the project is totally feasible
because China has huge stockpiles of grain after several
consecutive bumper harvests. Since 1996, annual grain output has
exceeded 500 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Economists say that the grain-for-green project not only will
reduce stockpiles of grain in the short term, but also help
increase grain output in the long term by improving the
environment. It will also help optimize the agricultural industry
and increase farmers income in the western region. The forestation
project will eventually eliminate the threat of flooding in China'
s longest rivers.

The government will also give 300 yuan to farmers for re-
developing every hectare of forest and pasture every year to help
cover medical and educational expenses.
</P>
<P>
While the government provides seedlings, farmers are allowed to
retain all profits from planting trees and grass on cultivated
land. In return, they will be responsible for taking care of
forests and pastures.
</P>
<P>
The level of grain aid will depend on the area of forest and
pasture that each farming household redevelops and on the output
of grain in different specific regions.
</P>
<P>
The grain-for-green project will be carried out in vast areas
including 174 counties in Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Hubei, Shaanxi,
Gansu, Qinghai Shanxi and Henan provinces, Chongqing, Ningxia Hui
Autonomous region, Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
The project will turn more than 340,000 hectares of cultivated
land back to forest and more than 430,000 hectares of bare
mountains and lands in western China.

<HEADLINE> Iran Considers Treating Wounded Reformist in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Tehran is considering sending the
wounded prominent reformist Saeed Hajjarian to Germany for
treatment, a source close to him announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the official Islamic Republic News Agency, the
source said that three countries, including Germany, have the
proper facilities to treat Hajjarian. But he did not mention the
other two.
</P>
<P>
Describing Hajjarian's general condition as "good," he said that
groups of people, associations and various social institutions have
expressed readiness to pay for the medicare services for the
reformist, a close advisor of President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, deputy chairman of the Tehran Municipal Council, was
shot and severely wounded in front of the council building on March
12 as tensions ran high following the landslide victory of
reformers over their conservative opponents in last month's
parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
Doctors treating Hajjarian said on Saturday that he had almost
regained full consciousness after being in a coma for days. The
reformer can now recognize his relatives and communicate with
people at his bedside by eye movement and also by nodding.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hajjarian's son, Mohsen Hajjarian, said that his
father can be transferred to Germany if his fever subsides which
has been running at 38.7 degrees Celsius.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Supports Israeli Withdrawal from Lebanon: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin
Indyk said Wednesday his country supports Israeli troop withdrawal
from south Lebanon under United Nations Security Council Resolution
425, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy,
Indyk added the resolution, which calls for an immediate and
unconditional Israeli pullout from all Lebanese territories and for
a return of full sovereignty to Lebanon, should serve as the basis
of the withdrawal before July.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was passed in 1978 after Israel waged a large-
scale aggression to Lebanon in the name of wiping out Palestinian
guerrillas in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the ambassador stopped short of supporting a unilateral
Israeli withdrawal, saying the U.S. prefers to see the withdrawal
in the context of agreements with Lebanon and Syria, the major
foreign power broker in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Indyk's remarks, some experts believed, was reflecting his
government's stand that as long as the chance of renewing the
Israeli-Syrian peace talks is in existence, the U.S. will be
reluctant to irk the Syrians, who oppose such a unilateral action.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks, which resumed last December after a
45-month break, broke off again in January over a dispute on the
fate of the Golan Heights, a strategic Syrian plateau seized by
Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
The latest effort to end the deadlock in the track, a summit
meeting in Geneva last Sunday between U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, failed to make progress as
expected.
</P>
<P>
U.S. media reports suggested the Clinton administration, which
is disappointed with al-Assad's attitude to peacemaking at the
Geneva summit, will possibly push forward Israeli-Palestinian talks
and support unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon instead in
order to increase pressure on Syria.
</P>
<P>
However, such reports are not well founded as Washington still
wants to wait and see what happen in the next two months before
making final decisions on its policy toward unilateral Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel seems to be more serious about a possible
unilateral pullback. During his meeting with Indyk, Levy said
Israel knows how to defend itself against cross-border attacks,
which are possible after an Israeli withdrawal without agreements.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 15-kilometer-deep "security zone" in south
Lebanon in 1985 with a self-claimed aim of preventing cross-border
guerrilla attacks on its north. But mounting Israeli casualties
have spurred a growing public pressure for a pullout. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet on March 5 gave backing to a key pledge made
by Barak to withdraw from the buffer zone by July, with or without
a peace deal with Syria or Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Some experts predicted that Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas, the
Shiite Muslim militant group fighting to end the Israeli occupation
since 1980s, will launch cross-border attacks from south Lebanon in
the case of a pullout without agreements.
</P>
<P>
To fill the security vacuum, Israel has been promoting for the
past few weeks of a multinational peacekeeping force to be
stationed in the zone after its troops leave.
</P>
<P>
Levy said Wednesday that Israel army will fully cooperate with
an international peacekeeping force in the zone, if such a force
will be deployed.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the European Union has
expressed interest in the idea and France has agreed to send
soldiers during French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's visit here
last month.
</P>
<P>
Levy is expected to meet with Annan in New York to discuss
Israel's unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon and the deployment of
U.N. forces in the area.

TEHRAN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Eleven people were killed and 14
others severely injured in a road accident in Iran on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The accident was caused by a collision Wednesday morning between
a bus and a minibus on the road linking northeastern cities of
Semnan and Damghan, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ten passengers of the minibus and the driver of the bus, which
had no passengers, were killed on the spot and the injured were

</P>
<P>
It indicated that the death toll of the disaster might increase
as some of the injured are in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
Traffic experts said the bus driver should be responsible for
the collision because he suddenly swerved his vehicle to the left.

NEW DELHI, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Indian security forces
Wednesday shot dead six more people, suspected to be involved in
the massacre of 36 Sikhs in south Kashmir on the night of March 20,
the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.

battle in the same area.
</P>

PTI said the search-and-kill operation was launched following
specific information regarding the movement of the so-called
militants.
</P>
<P>
"The militants were part of the same gang that had masterminded
the gory massacre of innocents at Chattisinghpura," said the
defense ministry spokesman.
</P>

Meanwhile, a local militant and a security officer were killed
and two Indian soldiers were wounded Wednesday in South Kashmir,

<HEADLINE> Manila Cites Its Major Concern in Dealing With MILF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Defense Secretary
Orlando Mercado said Wednesday that protecting Mindanao residents
will be the government's main consideration in dealing with the
rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).
</P>
<P>
Mercado said in a radio speech that the government will
continue to pursue peace efforts with the MILF.
</P>
<P>
"We don't turn our backs on the peace talks but neither will we
give in to their threats. The protection of the people remains our
main concern," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mercado dismissed as "a press release" the recent claim of the
MILF that they can use surface-to-air missiles against government
troops.
</P>
<P>
He said this is part of the two-pronged war waged by the MILF --
the ground war involving military tactics, and the propaganda war.
</P>
<P>
"The propaganda war includes demands and press releases," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, MILF Chairman Hashim Salamat claimed that they have
surface-to-air missiles capable of shooting down aircraft.
</P>
<P>
As an immediate response, military spokesman Rafael Romero said
that if the MILF indeed had such missiles in their arsenal, many
helicopters and planes of the Philippine Air Force (PAF) could
have been shot down already.
</P>
<P>
But there is no record in the MILF's 22-year insurgency war
with the government that a PAF helicopter or warplane was shot
down by a missile. "They (MILF) are bragging," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Mercado said that while the government does not take the
MILF's threats lightly, it still works to protect the people in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The government and the MILF are scheduled to resume formal
peace talks on May 2.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada has ordered the government panel to
finish peace negotiations with the MILF before the end of June
this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
SIEM REAP, Cambodia, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Restoration work for
the ruined Chau Say Tevoda in Angkor Wat got underway Wednesday
with assistance from the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Princess Norodom Bopha Devi, minister of Culture and Fine Arts
Ministry and the Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Yan Tingai
attended the ground-breaking ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Also present were Zhang Bo, deputy director of the Department
of Cultural Relics of China, Vann Molyvann, president executive-
director of the APSARA Authority, Nam Tum, first deputy governor
of Siem Reap Province, and representatives of UNESCO (United

</P>
<P>
The China Cultural Relics Research Institute was entrusted with
the task of preserving and renovating the Chau Say Tevoda of
Angkor Wat on behalf of the Chinese Government. And the team
leader, Jiang Huaiying, is a noted expert in protecting ancient
buildings.
</P>
<P>
The restoration work for the temple, with a donation of 10
million yuan (over 1.2 million U.S. dollars) from China, is
scheduled to be completed within five years.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Yan said that it is the first time for the Chinese
government to take part in the restoration of cultural relics in a
foreign country. He believes that the restoration work will help
promote the traditional friendship between the peoples of the two
countries and enhance the friendly cooperation and exchanges in
culture and cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
Princess Bopha Devi expressed her heartfelt thanks to the
Chinese government for its assistance and spoke highly of the
hard work done by Chinese experts.
</P>
<P>
The temples in the Angkor area have been seriously damaged due
to heavy rains, looting and lack of protection.
</P>
<P>
The temples of Angkor, built between the 9th and the 13th
centuries, have already been registered as a world heritage site.
</P>
<P>
So far, several countries, including Japan, France, Italy,
India and China, have taken part in the conservation and
restoration work of Angkor Wat.

<P>
DHAKA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina Wednesday informed the parliament that her government has
allocated 3.358 billion taka (64.6 million U.S. dollars) for the
Ministry of Women and Children Affairs for the fifth five-year
plan period.
</P>
<P>
The allocation during the fourth five-year plan for the
Ministry of Women and Children was only 550 million taka (10.6
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Citing the various measures for the development of women and
enhancement of their status in society, she said a revolving loan
of 37.7 million taka (720,000 dollars) was provided to 11,500
distressed women in 64 districts in 1997-1998 from the prime
minister's relief fund for the rehabilitation and welfare of these
women.
</P>
<P>
She said another project for the distressed women is under way,
giving 184.3 million taka (3.54 million dollars) as loans to 1,551,
000 women.
</P>
<P>
During U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Bangladesh on

workplace standards for women and prevent the trafficking in women
and children.
</P>
<P>
The grants will be combined with the allocation to protect
women and children's rights and improve their conditions.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 29 (Xinhua) -- South African police

Association reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Two men believed to have robbed a Johannesburg High Court judge
and his wife were among the arrested.
</P>
<P>
Superintendent Chris Wilken said the two men aged 18 and 25,
arrested in Alexandra, a black township in Johannesburg, had been
linked to the robbery of Judge Max Bernard Labe and his wife Rayma
Labe on March 16.
</P>
<P>
Wilken said police arrested 31 people in swoops in the
Johannesburg's northern and western suburbs between 6 a.m. on

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- In the 11 days since at least 330 members of a doomsday cult
perished in an explosion fire, what appeared to be an inexplicable
case of mass suicide in an isolated Ugandan town has been
transformed by a stream of fresh horrors into what authorities now
describe as mass murder on an extraordinary scale.
</P>
<P>
-- Acting President Vladimir Putin, elected to a full four-year
term on Sunday, signaled Tuesday that he does not intend a major
shake-up in the Russian government, at least not before his
inauguration in early May.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton, commenting publicly for the
first time on the failure of his talks with the Syrian leader,
Hafez Assad, said Tuesday that it is up to Mr. Assad to make the
next move for the peace talks between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
-- After two days of disputes, OPEC decided Tuesday to increase
oil production without the participation of its second-largest
producer, Iran. But the increase was not what the United States
had pressed for, and was not expected to bring down gasoline
prices any time soon.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Amid calls by U.S. lawmakers for radical reforms and tighter
controls at the International Monetary Fund, the lender's new head
says he would prefer milder changes and more independence from the
politics of the U.S. and other rich governments.
</P>
<P>
-- Uncertainty about the impact of recent stock-market
volatility, rising interest rates and soaring energy prices
rattled U.S. households this month, pushing U.S. consumer
confidence down to a five-month low, the Conference Board reported
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Passes Resolution to Close Chernobyl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian government Wednesday
passed a resolution to close the Chernobyl nuclear plant before
the end of 2000, but the exact date for the closure is to be set
after the settlement of the fund issue, the Ukrainian Interfax
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the closure, the Ukrainian Ministry of Power and
Energy must work out the detailed plans in several months to close
the Number 3 reactor and provide social security for workers and
the local residents, it reported.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Ukrainian government will negotiate with
Western countries to ensure the complete fulfillment of the
agreement reached in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Group of Seven leading industrialized nations and the
European Union (EU) agreed in December, 1995, to offer Ukraine two
billion U.S. dollars to construct two new reactors to compensate
the loss of Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the Western countries did not provide the promised funds
for the closure of Chernobyl, one of whose reactors is still
functioning.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine itself can not afford the closure of Chernobyl, an
aging plant built by the former Soviet Union, which accounts for 5
percent of the former Soviet republic's total electrical capacity.
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union decided to close down Chernobyl before 1993
after the world's worst civil nuclear disaster occurred in April,
1986, when one of its reactors exploded. But the decision was
vetoed by Ukraine in October, 1993.

<HEADLINE> Local Japanese Residents Evacuate Volcano Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Some 8,000 residents and travelers
staying near Mt. Usu in Japan's northernmost prefecture of
Hokkaido began to evacuate the area after scientists warned of a
possible volcanic eruption during the next few days, Kyodo News
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As seismic tremors in the area continued to grow in frequency
and strength, an observatory of the Meteorological Agency in
Muroran, southeast of Mt. Usu, released an emergency bulletin,
while the local municipalities of three towns -- Date, Sobetsu and
Abuta, directed most residents to evacuate the area.
</P>
<P>
Public facilities in the three towns were turned into
evacuation shelters.
</P>
<P>
Fairly strong quakes have hit Date and Sobetsu at the foot of
the mountain several times since 5 p.m. Wednesday. Between 6 and
7 p.m.there were 53 quakes which could be felt in the area, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Volcanic eruptions are often preceded by heightened seismic
activity, it said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,523 tremors related to volcanic activities have
been recorded between Monday and 5 p.m. Wednesday, with 324 of
them strong enough to be perceptible, the Muroran observatory said.
</P>
<P>
The Health and Welfare Ministry decided to apply the Disaster
Relief Law to the three municipalities to help them better deal
with emergencies.
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the Japanese government mobilized various ministries
and agencies and set up an emergency task force at Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi's official residence to tackle problems stemming from
a possible eruption, while some 3,000 Ground Self-Defense Force
officials, police and firefighters have been put on alert.
</P>
<P>
The last eruption of the 732-meter Usu Mountain occurred in
1977.

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui Reaps What He Has Sown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- China's Xinhua News Agency today
publishes an article by its commentator, entitled "Lifting a Rock
Only to Drop it on One's Own Feet."
</P>
<P>
Whoever advocates "Taiwan Independence" will come to no good.
Taiwan leader Lee Teng-hui's stepping down from his position of
chairman of the Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, is a case in
point, the article says.
</P>
<P>
During Lee's 12 years in power, he took advantage of his
position to plot "independence" surreptitiously and destroy
relations across the Taiwan Straits. At the very beginning, Lee
maintained his support for the "one China" and "reunification."
But it did not take too long for Lee to reveal his true colors and
announce to all and sundry in his "two Chinas," "one China, one
Taiwan" and "two states" policies.
</P>
<P>
He supported separatist forces which have become rampant
destructive forces in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui's bad deeds have deeply hurt the feelings of both
Taiwanese compatriots and mainland Chinese.
</P>
<P>
There is an old Chinese saying that he who plays with fire will
get burnt. It is not surprising to see the Taiwanese people take
to the streets in protest. Their outrage finally forced Lee to
resign.

<HEADLINE> HK Seeks Closer Trade Ties with Republic of Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will work together
with the Republic of Congo in many aspects to improve the
bilateral trade and economic ties, Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region of China Tung Chee Hwa said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tung made the remarks during a luncheon in honor of President
of the Republic of Congo Denis Sassou-Nguesso at the Government
House.
</P>
<P>
Tung said the president's visit to Hong Kong comes at an
important time in Hong Kong's development.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that this ongoing process is a good thing," Tung
said. "Your visit to Hong Kong provides us both with an
opportunity to sit down and talk about areas in which our two
economies may have a common interest. And that is surely the best
way to begin."
</P>
<P>
Led by strong export and import growth, activities of financial
services, tourist arrivals, consumer spending, and strong economic
expansion on China's mainland, Hong Kong is emerging strongly from
the worst recession in living history, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Hong Kong has been laying the foundations for
the knowledge-based economy in the 21st century by making the most
of advances in information technology and communications, Tung
added.
</P>
<P>
With strong support of the Central Government and the
commitment of the people of Hong Kong since its return to the
motherland in 1997, the unique concept of "One Country, Two
Systems" has been successfully implemented, and the entire
community is moving forward into the 21st century with confidence,
Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Tung said the Republic of Congo has been a wonderful friend for
the People's Republic of China, and for Chinese people everywhere.
It also occupies a most important leadership position in Central
and West Africa, and the relationship with the Congo is something
that all Chinese people will treasure, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tung noted that globalization is changing the world. The oil,
the natural gas, the agricultural products, cocoa, diamond and
gold the Congo produces are fueling industrial development and
needs of people around the world, and global integration of trade
in goods and services will continue at a great pace this century,
Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Sassou-Nguesso and his delegation were making a brief stay in
Hong Kong after visiting a couple of big cities on China's
mainland. This was the first time that he paid a visit to Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Tung expressed his hope that Sassou-Nguesso during his stay
would be able to sense the energy and optimism of Hong Kong, the
most cosmopolitan city in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Macao SAR Chief Executive Delivers 1st Policy Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Edmund Ho Hau Wah, chief executive
of China's Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR), said here
Wednesday that the administrative policy this year is aimed at
laying good foundations and seeking potentials for a steady
development.
</P>
<P>
The policy will remain to be the orientation for the Macao SAR
government in the next few years, he said while delivering his
first policy address at the Macao Legislative Council after he was
sworn in as chief executive last December.
</P>
<P>
Copies of the administrative policy of the SAR government had
been distributed among the legislators for examination.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive administrative policy embodies the practical
implementation of "one country, two systems" in Macao and shows
that "we are launching the long-term cause of 'Macao people
governing Macao' and a high degree of autonomy in Macao in a
pragmatic and prospective manner and in a well-planned way," the
chief executive said.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the reason for such an orientation of steady
development, Edmund Ho said the SAR's current financial strength
does not allow new large-scale infrastructure projects, and the
SAR needs time to regain its vitality and decide on the new
starting point for future advance.
</P>
<P>
"The most pressing matter for the SAR government at present is
to revitalize the economy," he said. "The government will strive
to create an environment for open and fair competition, so that
the interests of investors will be better protected."
</P>
<P>
The government will encourage the application of advanced
technology to make enterprises more competitive, and will improve
infrastructure so as to ensure sustainable development of the
region, he said.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government will strive to achieve modern administration
through the assessment of human resources, the professional
training of civil servants, the optimization of government
departments, and the enactment of regulations.
</P>
<P>
"In particular, the government pays attention to the formation
of a novel public service mode, with which the appeal of residents
are responded to and the responsibility of civil servants is
enhanced," he said.
</P>
<P>
By means of restructuring security departments, a more
efficient public security management system will be established,
he said. The SAR government will strengthen contacts with
neighboring areas to carry out rapid, effective and severe
crackdowns on crimes.
</P>
<P>
He also said the SAR government will fight against corruption,
enhance contacts between executive authorities and the legislature,
safeguard judicial independence, ensure the economical and
efficient use of public resources, and improve health care and
education.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his policy address, Edmund Ho said the policies
of the SAR government are open to the public. In the course of
their implementation, the policies will be readjusted in
accordance with the demand of the residents.
</P>
<P>
"Only the participation and support of all residents can enable
the government to carry out its policies well and enable the SAR
to witness successes in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
After making his half-hour speech, the chief executive answered
questions raised by legislators in the ensuing two and a half
hours.
</P>
<P>
In the coming two weeks, members of the Legislative Council
will examine various parts of the administration policy for the
year 2000, and raise questions to the respective principal
officials of the SAR government.

HONG KONG, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong recorded a decrease

</P>
<P>
The amount of gross new loans made in February fell by 5.2
percent to 10 billion HK dollars (1.28 billion U.S. dollars)
compared with the flat growth in January, and the average size of
new loans increased to 1.45 million HK dollars (185,900 U.S.
dollars) in February.
</P>
<P>
New loans approved during the month decreased by 21.5 percent
compared with that of January, and refinancing loans fell in
absolute terms for the second consecutive month, and accounted for
46.5 percent of new loans approved (52.6 percent in January).
</P>
<P>
The average loan-to-value ratio of new loans approved stayed
unchanged at 57.0 percent in February. The average contractual
life increased to 195 months from 187 months. Of these loans, 97.1
percent were related to owner-occupied properties.
</P>
<P>
On the pricing front, 65.5 percent of the new loans were
granted at the best lending rate, down from 75.3 percent in
January. Loans granted at below the best lending rate for the
whole term of the mortgage rose to 29.5 percent of the new loans
approved, up from 20.4 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the fall in the ratio of refinancing loans,
competition for new mortgage business remains intense and margins
are continuing to be squeezed." said David Carse, deputy chief
executive of the HKMA.
</P>
<P>
Gross loans made for the purchase of properties on the Chinese
mainland decreased to 15 million HK dollars (1.92 million U.S.
dollars) in February from 167 million HK dollars (21.4 million U.S.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji Meets U.S. National Security Adviser (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji today
told Samuel Berger, adviser to the U.S. President for National
Security Affairs, that whoever comes to power in Taiwan, must not
advocate "Taiwan independence."
</P>
<P>
"Any form of Taiwan independence will not be allowed," Zhu
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Zhu urged the U.S. side to fully understand the "importance
and sensitivity" of the Taiwan issue after elaborating China's
stance on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-U.S. relations, Zhu said that the Chinese government
highly values its ties with the U.S. and will continue to make
efforts to improve and develop Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
However, "We have our principles," Zhu said, adding that the
growth of Sino-U.S. relations must be firmly grounded on the three
Sino-U.S. joint communiques and basic norms in international
relations, especially, mutual respect for each other's
sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in each
other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton
have already set forth the direction and framework for the Sino-U.
S. relations in the 21st century and both sides should continue to
maintain these relations, Zhu said.

</P>
<P>
He also said that the U.S. will keep its commitment on the "

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Special Commentator's Article on Fighting Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- China's Xinhua news agency
published its special commentator's article today entitled "Be
Fully Confident in Pushing Forward the Anti-Corruption Campaign."
</P>
<P>
The article says the Communist Party of China (CPC) has adopted
a correct line, guiding principles and policies for combating
corruption in China.
</P>
<P>
Corruption has been a major concern for the Party and
government in the new historical period of reform and opening up.
The Party and government have strictly adhered to Deng Xiaoping's
theory on fighting against corruption and building a clean and
honest government.
</P>
<P>
The anti-corruption campaign should be carried out in line with
the general goals of reform, development and stability.
</P>
<P>
The majority of Party members and officials should be educated
to avoid engaging in corrupt practices. Party officials who do
engage in corruption will be severely punished. Education should
be strengthened and legal and management systems improved through
on-going reforms.
</P>
<P>
Since the 15th CPC Congress, held in 1997, the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee has continued its anti-
corruption campaign by implementing a series of important measures
which include forbidding the army, armed police and law-
enforcement departments from engaging in commercial activities,
formulating new regulations, handling a number of major criminal
cases, and launching special campaigns against rampant crimes such
as smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Efforts have paid off. A number of corruption cases have been
cracked and offenders have been brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
The article quotes Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC
Central Committee, as saying that the Party will be able to
overcome corruption with the support of the Chinese people.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Can Return Home: Israeli Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The High Court of Justice of
Israel decided Wednesday that hundreds of Palestinians expelled by
Israel near the West Bank city of Hebron can return to their homes
and graze their herds on their land there.
</P>
<P>
The court also decided that the above decision will remain in
force until an investigation is conducted into the case.
</P>
<P>
The court made the decisions after hearing a petition against
the expulsion of about 700 Palestinians from their homes in the
hill areas south of Hebron. These Palestinians were expelled by the
Israeli Civil Administration during the last three months of 1999,
which termed the area as "a military firing zone."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied
Territories (B'tselem) said in its case study that the real reason
for the expulsion is Israel's desire to annex the area as Israel
seeks to create territorial continuity in the region, which is not
populated by Palestinian residents.
</P>
<P>
The B'tselem, which filed the petition in the court on behalf of
the Palestinians, welcomed the court's decisions, hoping that the
abuse of the innocent Palestinians by the Civil Administration
officials and local Israeli settlers will cease.

<HEADLINE> UK Banks Vote for System Against Double Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain's banks have voted
unanimously in favor of introducing a system to ensure that
customers are not charged twice for withdrawing money from a cash
machine.
</P>
<P>
The vote was taken at a meeting on Tuesday in Harrogate,
Northern England, by the 34 members of Link, Britain's cash
machine network, and it will become effective on July 1.
</P>
<P>
The decision lifts the threat of double-charging, which means
that when the customer's own bank charges him with a "disloyalty
fee," the bank owning the cash machine also levies a "surcharge"
on him.
</P>
<P>
Link had promised to hold the vote earlier this month at a
meeting with Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers, who had
written to Link saying he could "scarcely believe" some customers
might be double-charged.
</P>
<P>
After Link's new decision, Byers said: "Ruling out double-
charging is a step in the right direction, but the banks and
building societies need to go further if they are to meet the
concerns of their customers."
</P>
<P>
The banks must now decide whether they want to impose
surcharges on non-customers. Some Link members, such as the
Yorkshire Building Society, have already made it clear that they
will not.

MOSCOW, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Russia threatened to boycott the
session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (
PACE) scheduled for April in Strasbourg, France, if Chechnya again
becomes the main discussion subject.
</P>
<P>
At a previous PACE session, the organization strongly
criticized Russia's actions in Chechnya and even raised the
question of suspending Russia's membership in the Council of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We are now thinking whether the Russian delegation should go
to Strasbourg or not. Maybe it would be better to ignore the
session once, and let them discuss all that without us," said
Mikhail Prusak, deputy head of Russia's PACE delegation, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Russian PACE delegation, said on
Tuesday that Moscow would respond firmly if the organization
approves sanctions against his delegation.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has prepared rigorous and even radical response
measures" that have been "fully coordinated with all the state
agencies concerned, including the Foreign Ministry," said Rogozin,
who is also chairman of International Affairs Committee of the
State Duma (lower house of parliament).
</P>

"Territorial integrity is more important to Russia than
complying with demands coming from the West," he told the Trud
newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Report: Chechen Rebel Still Holding 872 Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Chechen rebels are currently
holding 872 hostages, including eight foreigners, a top Russian
Interior Ministry official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the anti-terrorist operation in Chechnya,
the Russian Interior Ministry's Chief Anti-Organized Crime Board (
GUBOP) has conducted 42 special operations to free the captives,
GUBOP Deputy Chief Nikolai Morozov said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the operations, 33 organized rebel bands
specializing in taking hostages were smashed. The bands had a
total of 136 members, the Interfax news agency quoted Morozov as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,812 people rebel groups have abducted since 1992, 940
have been set free, including 41 released in March in the
breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
Among the hostages still in captivity are 15 servicemen, 13
minors, and eight foreigners from France, India, Israel, Saudi
Arabia and Turkey, Interfax said, citing GUBOP data.
</P>
<P>
"We know the approximate whereabouts of each of them and the
necessary measures are being taken," Morozov said, noting that the
foreign citizens are being held mainly by small bands in the
Shatoi district in southern Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> HK Initiates Postal Remittance Service to Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Post announced on
Wednesday that it will join hands with China Post to introduce the
reciprocal Postal Remittance Service with the mainland as from
March 30, offering customers a direct and convenient way of
sending money.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong customers can remit money to the mainland at any of
the post offices throughout the territory, according to a
spokesman for Hong Kong Post.
</P>
<P>
Under the new service, the recipients in the mainland can
receive the remittance in either Renminbi at over 50,000 post
offices or U.S. dollars at the designated 232 post offices on the
mainland. The maximum remittance amount per money order is 1,000 U.
S. dollars, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
With over 50,000 post offices providing postal remittance
service on the mainland, the service can reach very remote places
and allow recipients to cash their money orders conveniently at
nearby designated local post offices, he added.
</P>
<P>
The cooperative relations between Hong Kong Post and postal
services on China's mainland were described as "brotherly" which
began long before the 1997 handover.
</P>
<P>
Express Mail Services (EMS) is the number one postal exchange
between Hong Kong and the mainland in terms of volume, followed by
ordinary mail.
</P>
<P>
Mainland customs have greatly supported and assisted the relay
of mail to and from Hong Kong, and the volume of EMS between the
two has increased by 15 percent after 1997 with delivery time of
EMS dropping to two days.

<HEADLINE> Gap Wide Between Israel, Palestinians: Erekat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb
Erekat said that there is still a wide gap over all issues
discussed in the Washington negotiations with the Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published in Palestinian daily Al Ayam on
Wednesday, Erekat said the gap between Palestinian and Israeli
sides over the final-status issues and the last-stage Israeli
pullout is still "very deep."
</P>
<P>
The stage under interim agreements is referred to Israeli
withdrawal from all of the West Bank land except for military areas
and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian team headed by Yasser Abed Rabbo and Israeli
team headed by Oded Eran ended their week-long talks Tuesday in
Bolling Air Force Base in southeastern Washington without making
any progress, but the two sides agreed to resume talks on April 6.
</P>
<P>
The sides agreed on March 21 to resume the peace talks in
Washington after a month-long break to pave the way for the
conclusion of a framework agreement on permanent peace by May. The
two sides have missed the first deadline on February 13.
</P>
<P>
Erekat voiced the hope that Israel will be "more committed to
the international resolutions" in the next round, adding that "our
stances during the past round of talks were based on the
international resolutions included in the signed accords."
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the negotiations said the Israeli side pledged
to carry out the last phase of redeployment next June as scheduled
no matter whether the two sides can reach a framework final-status
agreement by then.
</P>
<P>
However, these sources pointed out that the Israeli side did not
reveal details of the implementation, such as determining the
military areas, adding that "differences in this respect are
profound."
</P>
<P>
Such is the case with the talks over the framework agreement on
permanent status of Jerusalem and Jewish settlements since Israel
still rejects the return of the Palestinian refugees and the
application of the United Nations resolution 242 over Jerusalem,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Israel also opposed the application of the U.N. resolutions
related to the Jewish settlements or Israel's withdrawal to the
border lines of June 4, 1967 held by Israel before the Mideast War.

Chairman Yasser Arafat reiterated here Wednesday that he will
declare an independent Palestinian state this year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon his return from Germany, Arafat said
he is sending a message to the Palestinian people on the occasion

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Repulses Rebel Offensive in North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's government troops on
Wednesday beat back an offensive launched by separatist rebels of
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) around Elephant Pass,
the entrance to the northernmost Jaffna peninsula, a military
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"LTTE terrorists continued to land their cadres south of
Vathirayan and attacked the forward defense line, while firing a
high volume of mortars," said Spokesman J.D.A. Gunasekara.
</P>
<P>
He said ground troops successfully repulsed the attack with the
support of the navy and air force.
</P>
<P>
Troops on Wednesday also destroyed three rebel boats moving
towards Vathirayan, some 320 km north of Colombo, the spokesman
said, adding that air force jets had bombed a convoy of rebel
vehicles moving towards the area.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE attempts to land in Kilali on Tuesday had also been
foiled, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman did not give a death toll for Wednesday's
fighting, but the Ministry of Defense said on Tuesday that more
than 150 LTTE rebels and more than 50 government troops were
killed since last Sunday when the rebels launched an overnight
massive sea and land attack near Elephant Pass.
</P>
<P>
However, the LTTE's Voice of Tigers radio said on Wednesday
that fighting was continuing in Jaffna peninsula and 19 guerrillas
had been killed in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Government troops captured the Jaffna peninsula from the rebels
in 1996, but since then the LTTE rebels have been trying to seize
control of the military base at Elephant Pass as the first step to
retake their former stronghold of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
The latest fighting came as the government of the ruling People
's Alliance is trying to find a consensus with the main opposition
United National Party (UNP) over constitutional reform proposals
aimed at ending the country's protracted ethnic war.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday President Chandrika Kumaratunga met UNP leader
Ranil Wickremesinghe for a fourth round of talks on constitutional
reforms which must be agreed upon before the LTTE is approached
for talks.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting for a separate homeland for
minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's price of aviation fuel
has shot up by about 50 percent recently, generating fears of a
possible increase in air fares.
</P>
<P>
A litre of fuel for jet planes had jumped from 21 naira to
between 31 and 35.40 naira (100 naira = one U.S. dollar), the News
Agency of Nigeria reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, petroleum price also seemed to be rising when
 motorists formed lines at gas stations across the country.
</P>
<P>
It quoted its own sources as saying that President Olusegun
Obasanjo on Tuesday summoned Pipeline Products Marketing Company
(PPMC) Managing Director Dan Nzelu on the resurgence of fuel
scarcity nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Abuja, capital of the Africa's most populous country, is among
the worst- hit in the current fuel scarcity, as filling stations
either do not have fuel or have long queues.
</P>
<P>
The price rise was partly due to world-wide oil price hike and
wide spread pipelines vandalization in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
Fifty people were burnt to death last week in the country's
oil- producing Niger delta in a pipeline fire caused by such
vandalization.

OTTAWA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister
Lloyd Axworthy announced Tuesday that Tung Chee-hwa, Chief
Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)
of China, will visit Canada from April 1-5.
</P>
<P>
"While historic changes have taken place in Hong Kong over the
past two and a half years, they have not changed the warm
relations that we share with the people," said Axworthy in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
"Our ties -- economic and social -- remain strong, and we look
forward to enhancing them during the course of Tung's visit,"
added the minister.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome this official visit to Canada by Tung in his
capacity as Chief Executive of Hong Kong," said Secretary of State
for Asia-Pacific Raymond Chan.
</P>
<P>
"During Tung's visit, we intend to showcase many Canadian goods
and services, especially those related to the information
technology sector, an area in which Canada and Hong Kong can
cooperate in new developments."
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Tung Chee-hwa will meet with Prime Minister
Jean Chretien, Axworthy, Finance Minister Paul Martin, and Chan.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Russia Says OPEC Output Rise to Impact Revenue, Ruble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian officials said Wednesday
that the OPEC decision to raise oil output would mean less foreign
exchange earnings for Russia and could shake the ruble, but it is
unlikely to impose any major impact on the budget.
</P>
<P>
Oil is Russia's top foreign exchange earner and "every dollar
drop in the price of a metric ton of oil means the loss of 10
million U.S. dollars per month in hard-currency revenues" for
Russia, Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Khristenko said.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to the decision made by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) earlier this week in Vienna,
where the organization is headquartered.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, Russian Central Bank Governor Viktor
Geraschenko said a drop in world oil prices could lead to
temporary fluctuations in the ruble's exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
The national currency, which has seen a steady rise over the
past month, stood at 28.27 to the U.S. dollar Wednesday under the
exchange rate set by the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
However, the problem will be a temporary one, because the
decline in oil export revenues will be offset by other export
revenues, Geraschenko said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the State Duma (lower house of parliament) to approve
a Central Bank proposal to require Russian exporters to convert
all of their foreign exchange earnings into rubles.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma has already raised the percentage from 50
percent to 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite the adverse effects of the expected drop in world oil
prices, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said the
change would not effect the country's budget, which is based on
oil priced at 19 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
"The basic part of our budget will not suffer, but
supplementary budget revenues will need revision," the Interfax
news agency quoted Klebanov as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If the price of oil (per barrel) does not drop below 25
dollars, then we won't feel any effects," he said.

instability in the future.

He said "the international terrorist and bandit formations will

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Strengthen Corporate Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korea is expected to
strengthen the reform of family-controlled chaebols, or family
businesses, in a bid to make its corporate restructuring
successful after the selection of Hyundai's heir became a focus of
international media.
</P>
<P>
Hyungai Group founder Chung Ju-yung on Monday handpicked his
fifth son Chung Mong-hun as the sole chairman of the largest
business group of South Korea 13 days after a dispute between his
two sons over control of the group.
</P>
<P>
Although the boards of directors are the legal decision-making
bodies, South Korea's chaebols are governed by one man -- the
group chairman -- even if his stake in subsidiaries does not
exceed 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Hyundai case has brought the problems of chaebol's
governance structures to the fore, casting doubts on the success
of corporate restructuring by the Kim Dae-jung government as one
of its achievements in two years of reform.
</P>
<P>
The government has accused Hyundai of choosing its chairperson
by an "outdated" way, saying stern sanctions may be imposed on
Hyundai for ignoring due legal procedures in making key corporate
decisions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Seoul foreign business community has strongly called
for separation of management from ownership in South Korean
conglomerates by improving their corporate governance structure.
</P>
<P>
"The government has worked on improving the system in the last
two years. Now regulators, along with the media, should continue
monitoring to make sure laws and regulations on corporate
governance are properly addressed," said Sri-Ram Aiyer, director
of World Bank Seoul Office.
</P>
<P>
The foreign bank community in Seoul was disappointed to see the
case, saying it may affect their credit decisions for affiliates
of the Hyundai Group.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the South Korean government has done a lot to
improve the business environment, but the corporate governance
structure still remains backward," said a foreign banker.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the government plans to conduct a large-scale
check on the chaebol's efforts to improve their governance
structures and will launch special probes into chaebol's financial
subsidiaries to see whether they have adopted new legal mechanisms
aimed at corporate governance structures.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government will also tightens laws and
regulations to strengthen the rights of minority shareholders and
boards of directors and take other measures to stop family members
of chaebol founders from wielding absolute control over their
business empires.
</P>
<P>
However, observers said the government is unlikely to impose
financial sanctions on the Hyundai Group despite its threat to
impose harsh penalties, out of fear that such an action may
compromise South Korea's international credibility.
</P>
<P>
If creditor banks stops providing new loans to Hyundai and
begins to collect existing loans, it will deal a lethal blow to
the conglomerate. Hyundai's shares will then fall, which will in
turn eat into foreign investors' confidence in the country, they
said.

<HEADLINE> Psychological Conflict Likely in Long Space Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Ground tests show that astronauts
on long space missions might develop conflicts among themselves,
the Interfax news agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At least two serious incidents occurred at a test module since
the experiments began on July 2 last year, said Vadim Guschin, a
psychologist and chief expert at the Moscow Institute of
Biological Problems.
</P>
<P>
Two candidate spacemen failed to get along and "used force in
the clash," Interfax quoted Guschin as saying. The two men were
not identified.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a Canadian female volunteer considered a Russian
male colleague's attempt to kiss her on New Year's Eve as sexual
harassment, Guschin said.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian, Judith Lapierre, spoke out about this incident
after the 110-day test mission was over, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another volunteer, a Japanese man, asked for a termination of
his role in the experiment, a request that was accommodated.
</P>
<P>
All these incidents happened while the crews were adjusting to
isolation, the psychologist said. "They displayed excessive
irritability, briefly lost self-control, were overly emotional and
too categorical in assessments," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russian, Canadian and Japanese scientists are analyzing the
test results before they are discussed in international scientific
forums, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
During the tests that involved 12 people from six countries,
the volunteers spent up to eight months breathing an artificial
atmosphere, eating space rations, working together, and simulating
space walks and dockings.
</P>
<P>
The subjects were not completely cut off. They could watch
television, browse the Internet and communicate via e-mail and
telephone with their loved ones.

District.
</P>
<P>
Some 41 stone niches, 154 Buddhist statues, and 148 stone lions
were discovered in the grotto.

<HEADLINE> China Cracks Down on Video-Audio Products Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- China has made remarkable
progress in cracking down on the piracy of video-audio products
since last October when the Ministry of Culture launched a
nationwide anti-piracy campaign.
</P>
<P>
Local anti-piracy task forces have targeted over 30 "brands" of
pirated video compact discs (VCD), and so far 6.02 million illegal
video-audio products, including 3.16 million VCDs, have been
confiscated, dealing a heavy blow against rampant piracy in China.
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, 4,000 illegal video-audio shops were
shut down, and 1,700 dealers had their licenses canceled,
according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to this effective crackdown, the sales of legal video-
audio products have been increasing.

<HEADLINE> 45,000 University Graduates to Go to Countryside in 3 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- China will send 15,000 university
graduates to work in rural areas this year as part of the plan to
send 45,000 of them to help rural development at the grassroots
level in three years beginning 1999.
</P>
<P>
It is also an effort to broaden the areas for the employment of
university graduates and allow the countryside to have more
talented people, according to the Ministry of Personnel.
</P>
<P>
The candidates must be ideologically qualified, have good work
capabilities, love to work in rural areas, and be physically
healthy, ministry official Hou Jianliang said at a national
conference on selecting university graduates for rural work.
</P>
<P>
They will be selected through a series of examinations on a
transparent and fair basis, the official told the meeting, which
opened here today.
</P>
<P>
A large number of university students have applied for the
assignment, and so far, 15,284 graduates have been chosen, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are only 630,000 agricultural scientists and
technicians in rural China, less than seven out of every 10,000
rural residents. Also, 70 percent of the public servants working
in rural areas lack a university education.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Government Faces First Test on Presidency Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The first vote on the presidency
amendment package of the Turkish ruling parties will be held in the
parliament Wednesday to decide if President Suleyman Demirel can
have a second term in office.
</P>
<P>
The package bill, put forward by Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit,
asks for reducing the presidential term from the current seven
years to five years, but allowing the president to run for a second
term.
</P>
<P>
President Demirel's seven-year tenure expires in May.
</P>
<P>
The secret ballot is a test for the leaders of the tripartite
coalition government as it will demonstrate to what extent they
have succeeded in convincing their deputies in the parliament to
support the move.
</P>
<P>
To rally more support from the opposition legislators, the
government attached two articles to the bill. One would make it
more difficult for the government to close political parties, and
the other is to raise the salary and pensions of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Islamist Virtue Party (FP), which is facing
a closure case due to its anti-secular activities, has voiced
willingness to support the bill if it includes the article granting
more freedom to political parties.
</P>
<P>
However, it wants an additional amendment to lift the ban on
Necmettin Erbakan, former leader of the banned Islamist Welfare
party who was pressured out of power in 1997 by the powerful pro-
secular military.
</P>
<P>
Some FP legislators have also expressed objection to Demirel's
re-election.
</P>
<P>
Former Transport Minister Yasar Topcu, a confidant of President
Demirel, met on Tuesday with Oguzhan Asilturk, a prominent member
of the FP, in a last-ditch effort to convince the Islamist party to
vote in favor of the ruling parties' proposal.
</P>
<P>
According to the Constitution, a constitutional amendment
proposal should be voted on twice in the parliament to be ratified.
</P>
<P>
A simple majority in Wednesday's first vote is sufficient to
send the package to a second vote, which in this case is scheduled
for April 4.
</P>
<P>
If the package is approved by 367 deputies, or a two-thirds
majority in the 550-seat parliament, in the second vote, it becomes
law immediately after endorsement by the president.
</P>
<P>
If it gets over 330 favorable votes but less than 367 votes, it
can come into force only after being approved in a national
referendum.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government holds 352 seats in the Grand National
Assembly (parliament), but some deputies of the coalition were not
in favor of Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Although the ruling parties anticipate that around 400 deputies
will support the amendment drive during the second vote, political
analysts warn that no one can estimate what deputies would vote in
a secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
Some 65 deputies from the ruling partner Motherland Party (ANAP)
of Mesut Yilmaz signed the amendment proposal, but analysts expect
only half of them would vote for the amendment.
</P>
<P>
Most ANAP deputies want Yilmaz to be elected president and to
become their second party leader, after the late President Turgut
Ozal, to be elected head of state.
</P>
<P>
Although the center-right True Path Party (DYP) has announced
its support to the bill, some deputies of the party, which was once
headed by Demirel, are also expected to vote against Demirel in the
secret ballot.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Expects IMF to Continue Its Loan Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Amid worry over possible loan
suspension, an Indonesian government official expected the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) not to delay again its aid to
the country, saying such a move will damage the on-going economic
recovery program.
</P>
<P>
"The IMF has an interest in the process of economic recovery
program in Indonesia. If the IMF does not support Indonesia, it (
the IMF) will shatter," Minister of Finance Bambang Sudibyo told
reporters here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Indonesia will face trouble if the IMF along
with the World Bank (WB) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and
the Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI) cease their (financial)
assistance.
</P>
<P>
"But currently, we have no problem with our funds," the
minister added.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has delayed a scheduled meeting of its executive board
which is set to vote on an additional 400 million U.S. dollars
loan disbursement for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The executive board of the group had originally been due to
meet on April 4 to approve a new loan disbursement to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
But Senior IMF Representative in Jakarta John Dodsworth
indicated the IMF has been upset over sluggish process of the
Indonesian economic reforms particularly on corporate debt
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
In its January deal with the IMF, Indonesia pledged to tackle
the debt burden through aggressive action by the Indonesian Bank
Restructuring Agency (IBRA), the Attorney General's Office and the
Jakarta Initiative, a body set up to promote debt restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and
Industry Kwik Kian Gie Wednesday admitted that "many points of the
agreement with the IMF have not been implemented by the government
based on the schedule in the letter of intent (LoI)."
</P>
<P>
He added that the points will be discussed by the government
and officials of the IMF following the arrival of the IMF
technical team from Washington.
</P>
<P>
The IMF team will also assess the implementation of the LoI, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Following the economic crisis, the IMF has been organizing a
bailout cash package worth 46 billion U.S. dollars for Indonesia,
of which the IMF is committed to providing some 12.3 billion
dollars. It has so far disbursed more than 9.5 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> New Loans Approved in Malaysia Increase in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Bank Negara Malaysia (
Malaysia's State Bank) said Wednesday that new loans approved in
the country's banking system increased by nearly two-fold in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The approved new loans amounted to 104.8 billion ringgit (27.
578 billion U.S. dollars) in 1999 against 65.1 billion ringgit (17.
131 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998, the central bank said in its
1999 annual report released here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Disbursement of approved credit facilities improved by 28.7
percent from 251.1 billion ringgit (about 66.078 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1998 to 323.2 billion ringgit (85.052 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1999, it said, adding loan repayments increased by 24
percent to 335.6 billion ringgit (88.315 billion U.S. dollars) in
1999 from 270.5 billion ringgit (71.184 billion U.S. dollars) in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The encouraging rate of turnover of loans clearly reflected the
improvement in the business environment brought about by a low
interest rate environment, ample liquidity situation and rising
investor's confidence, which translated into a strong GDP growth
of 5.4 percent for the overall Malaysian economy in 1999, the
central bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that for 1999, over 33 percent of new loans
approved in the banking system were channeled to the manufacturing
sector and the purchase of residential properties, the largest
proportion of new financing.
</P>
<P>
According to the central bank, the asset quality of the banking
system improved in 1999 after being adversely affected by the
financial crisis in the previous year, with non performing loans (
NPLs) net of provisions of the banking system declining from 9.0
percent to 7.8 percent of total loans.
</P>
<P>
By December 31, 1999, NPLs of 34 billion ringgit (8.947 billion
U.S. dollars) had been sold to Danaharta (National Asset
Management Company) of which 21 billion ringgit (5.526 billion U.S.
dollars) was sold in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said the activities of Danaharta in removing
NPLs from the banking system played a pivotal role in improving
the liquidity of banking institutions in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Local banking institutions have been asked to seek new sources
of income as increased competition would narrow intermediation
margins and reduce traditional interest incomes.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Financial Market Mixed in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's financial market
turned out mixed in 1999 with higher trading volumes in the stock,
bond and interest rate futures markets but lower volumes in the
money, foreign exchange and stock index futures markets.
</P>
<P>
The volume of funds traded in the money market declined by 23.1
percent to 1,412.6 billion ringgit (371.736 billion U.S. dollars)
in 1999, Bank Negara (State Bank) said in its 1999 Annual Report
released here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A notable development in 1999 was the significantly higher
trading volume in the Islamic interbank money market which
increased to 435.7 billion ringgit (114.657 billion U.S. dollars)
in 1999 from 158.1 billion ringgit (41.605 billion U.S. dollars)
in 1998, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
On the foreign exchange market, the average daily volume of
interbank foreign exchange transactions through eight foreign
exchange brokers in the Kuala Lumpur foreign exchange market
declined by 61.3 percent to 1.4 billion ringgit (368.421 million U.
S. dollars) in 1999 from 3.7 billion ringgit (937.684 million U.S.
dollars) in 1998, it said, adding the decline followed the
imposition of selective exchange controls and the pegging of the
exchange rate to the US dollar in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
The bank said activity in the foreign exchange market in 1999
continued to be dominated by transactions of the US dollar against
the ringgit although its share of total transactions declined to
63.2 percent from 77.9 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Funds raised in the capital market were marginally lower in
1999 amounting to 17.2 billion ringgit (4.526 billion U.S. dollars)
against 17.8 billion ringgit (about 4.684 billion U.S. dollars) in
1998.
</P>
<P>
It said that in the equity market, the bulk of the 6.1 billion
ringgit (1.605 billion U.S. dollars) raised was through rights
issues, accounting for 70 percent of the total, with the banking
system's exposure to equity at the end of 1999 being not
significant, amounting to 0.1 percent of total assets.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Reserves Adequate to Finance Short-Term External Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's central bank said
Wednesday that the country's external reserves are adequate to
finance its short-term external debts.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in the overall balance of payments, large at 17.8
billion ringgit (4.684 billion U.S. dollars) despite larger
outflows of short-term capital in 1999, has led to higher external
reserves of 117.2 billion ringgit or 30.9 billion U.S. dollars,
Bank Negara Malaysia said in its 1999 Annual Report released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This level of reserves, sufficient to finance 5.9 months of
retained imports, was much larger than the short-term external
debts which declined for the second consecutive year by 29 percent
to 28.8 billion ringgit (7.578 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of
1999, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the central bank, Malaysia's total external debts
outstanding declined by 1.4 percent to 159.7 billion ringgit (42
billion U.S. dollars) at the end of 1999, reflecting the reduction
in short-term debts as well as longer-term private sector external
debts. In U.S. dollar terms, total debt was equivalent to 42
billion U.S. dollars as against 42.6 billion U.S. dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
It said the improvement in the debt situation in 1999 was
reflected in the decline in the ratio of external debt to gross
national product (GNP) and to exports, to 57 percent and 43
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the trade surplus expanded further to 72.3 billion (19.
026 billion U.S. dollars) exceeding the previous record of 58.4
billion ringgit (15.368 billion U.S. dollars) set in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the value of Malaysia's total trade in 1999 increased
by 10.8 percent to 570 billion ringgit (150 billion U.S. dollars)
and accounted for 203 percent of GNP compared with 191 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said the country's current account emerged
fundamentally stronger in 1999, reflecting an increase in the
trade balance which emanated from a stronger export performance
partly due to the fact that imports had increased to service
higher export demand.

<HEADLINE> Resigned Thai Minister Remains Secretary-General  of Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Sanan Kachornprasart, who has
just resigned as Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister, Interior
Minister and member of the House of Representatives, will remain
secretary-general of the ruling Democratic Party, Government
Spokesman Akapol Sorasuchart said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Akapol said that Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai has received Sanan's resignation letter and the
resignation went into effect from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, Sanan's position as secretary-general of the
Democratic Party will not be affected, Akapol said.
</P>
<P>
Sanan's resignation came one day after the National Counter
Corruption Committee (NCCC) ruled Tuesday that Sanan filed false
statements to back his claims to have received a fictional 45
million baht (1.18 million U.S. dollars) loan.
</P>
<P>
Sanan has played a major role in coordinating political parties
within the ruling coalition during the previous government
reshuffles.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that he is also a key figure preparing the
government for Thailand's next general election, which must be
called by November this year.
</P>
<P>
Akapol said that part of Sanan's duties as deputy prime
minister will be shouldered by prime minister Chuan himself and
part will be shared by the other five deputy prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
The government will not consider finding a replacement to fill
in the empty interior portfolio in the short term, while the
deputies will look after the work in the ministry, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
The NCCC made the announcement after a three-month
investigation following the opposition's allegation that Sanan is
"unusually wealthy" and made false statements about his assets and
liabilities.
</P>
<P>
NCCC has pledged to sue Sanan over the false statement of his
assets and liabilities and the final verdict will be made by the
Constitution Court.
</P>
<P>
Under Thailand's new constitution, Thai government ministers
must submit their declaration of assets and liabilities to the
NCCC when they take office.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that a government minister has resigned
over assets scandal after the new constitution was introduced in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the new constitution, senior ministers like the
interior minister, who is considered the most powerful portfolio
in the cabinet, could resign over corruption suspicions, local
media hailed.
</P>
<P>
This phenomenon is unprecedented in the history of Thai
politics, they said.

<HEADLINE> UN Urges Donors to S. Leone Peace to Act Promptly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 29 (Xinhua) - A high-ranking United Nations
Official Tuesday warned that the UN peace mission in Sierra Leone
might fail, if the donor countries didn't act promptly.
</P>
<P>
"We could lose the peace if we do not cooperate, communicate
and coordinate fully," warned the UN Deputy Secretary-General
Louise Frechette at a donor's conference in London, reported a
major Nigerian newspaper Daily Times on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
She said the conference "is an opportunity for all involved to
pledge themselves to just such a unified plan of action, with real
commitment and real resources".
</P>
<P>
Frechette insisted that the international community should not
fail in Sierra Leone. "Having taken on this responsibility, we can
not afford the price of failure neither in terms of human
suffering in Sierra Leone, nor in terms of the damage that such a
set back could inflict on the world's faith in the international
community's ability to address conflicts in Africa".
</P>
<P>
The UN official stressed that the willingness on the part of
the signatories to the Lome Accord was essential to the success of
the peace process in Sierra Leone. The stakeholders must express
their commitment by action, Frechette urged.
</P>
<P>
Britain pledged to contribute an additional 17.5 million pounds
sterling to help Sierra Leone recover from civil war. The British
Secretary of State for International Development, Clare Short,
made the announcement.
</P>
<P>
Short also stated that the creation of a democratically
accountable armed forces was essential to the long-term success of
the accord. Britain will continue to help in the process of
restructuring Sierra Leone's army, she assured.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Government Troops Defeat Rebels in Calulo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Angolan government announced here
on Wednesday that the Armed Forces of Angola have broken up the
attacks launched by the rebel soldiers near Calulo, a major town
in the northern province of Kwanza-sul.
</P>
<P>
Acting governor of the Kwanza-sul Province Serafim do Prado was
quoted by the official newspaper Jornal de Angola Wednesday as
saying that the government troops are currently pursuing the
rebels in the outskirts of the town.
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier this week that after intense combats,
the rebel soldiers had seized the town Calulo, capital of the
Libolo Municipality, located some 230 kilometers southeast of the
Angolan capital Luanda.
</P>
<P>
The rebel attack was one of the largest counterattacks launched
by the rebels against the towns under the government control since
January when the government ended its "Restauro Operation" during
which the government troops had recovered most cities and towns
occupied by the rebels including the rebel political and military
headquarters Bailundo and Andulo, both located in the central
highland.
</P>
<P>
Prado said that the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi still intended

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Legislature Passes Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's House of Representatives,
or lower chamber of parliament, Tuesday passed the long-delayed
year 2000 budget following the approval by the Senate the previous
day.
</P>
<P>
The eventual budget totaled some 677 billion naira (6.77
billion U.S. dollars) as against the 470 billion naira (4.7
billion dollars) submitted by President Olusegun Obasanjo last
November, according to the Post Express newspaper Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The House slashed six billion naira from the amount approved by
the Senate. The margin, slated to be spent on issuing of the
national identity cards, would go with a separate allocation bill,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown of the sectoral allocation shows that the country's
power sector gets the lion's share of 57.23 billion naira (572
million dollars), underscoring the importance the Nigerian
government has attached to improving its power supply.
</P>
<P>
Education places second with a 53.626 billion naira (536
million dollars) share, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The Senate said in a report passed with the bill that the
executive could still submit request for more funding through
supplementary appropriation bill if necessary, despite the hike.
</P>
<P>
The boost of the allocation was apparently made against the
background of the price soar on world oil market.
</P>
<P>
The Senate said in the report that it amended the budget bill
on a basis of a revenue from oil at 20 dollars per barrel as
against the 18 dollars per barrel benchmark in the original budget
bill.

<TEXT>
<P>
Interior Ministry Spokesman Onun Arkkramtaiboon issued an
official announcement on behalf of Sanan at a press conference
held at the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Sanan was not seen during the press conference.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Government Spokesman Akapol Sorasuchart said at a
separate press conference that Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has
received Sanan's resignation letter and the resignation went into
effect from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sanan's resignation came one day after the National Counter
Corruption Committee (NCCC) ruled Tuesday that Sanan filed false
statements to back his claims to have received a fictional 45-
million-baht (1.18-million-U.S. dollar) loan.
</P>
<P>
The NCCC made the announcement after a three-month
investigation following the opposition's allegation that Sanan is
"unusually wealthy" and made false statements about his assets and
liabilities.
</P>
<P>
Thai government ministers must submit their declaration of
assets and liabilities to the NCCC when they take office.
</P>
<P>
Sanan is also the Secretary-General of the Democrat Party, the
core ruling political party, whose leader Chuan Leekpai is the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He has played a major role in coordinating political parties
within the ruling coalition during the previous government
reshuffles.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that he is also a key figure preparing the
government for Thailand's next general election, which must be
called by November of this year.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Women Receive Less Education Than Men: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian girls and boys are
not having equal access to education because of old traditions,
said an article published by the Ethiopian Herald Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The article, entitled "Girls' Education: Still in Its Infancy"
said the literacy level of Ethiopia is very low while
participation of females at all levels of education is even lower
than the males.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, 77 percent of the Ethiopian people were illiterate.
Among the population aged 10 years and above, only 23 percent are
literate whereas women aged 10 years and above, only 16.7 percent
are estimated to be literate, the article said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995/96, the gross enrollment ratio of females in primary
school was 25.6 percent. The participation rate for girls has
increased from 16.2 percent to 25.6 percent, whereas for boys it
has increased from 23.2 percent to 43.2 percent for the period
from 1992/93 to 1995/96.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the gap between male and female participation
in schools is widening, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the article said, about 57 percent of the boys and 74
percent of the girls aged between seven and 12 years old did not
get the chance to go to primary schools.
</P>
<P>
According to the article, the overall participation rate (for
grades 1 to 12) is 29 percent for males and 18 percent for
females.
</P>
<P>
This somewhat indicates that more boys are coming to school
than girls, the article added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the reasons for women's low-level of education,
the article said that factors that affect girls' access to
education include customary attitudes, early marriages and
pregnancies, gender bias and sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
In addition, girls are traditionally responsible for heavy
domestic work. Even if girls and young women get the chance to go
to school, they are expected to manage both educational and
domestic responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
All this usually results in poor scholastic performance and
early dropout from the educational system, the article said.
</P>
<P>
To improve the overall educational system and enrollment of
both sexes at all levels of education, the Ethiopian government
has made new education and training policy which intends to create
various channels of communication to promote girls' education, the
article said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Zambia has predicted
an economic growth rate of 4.5 percent for the current fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Zambia governor Jocob Mwanza said positive growth was
expected in the agricultural, tourism and non-traditional export
sectors, according to Wednesday's Times of Zambia newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Other factors that would serve to support positive growth
include the injection of working capital in the mining sector as
well as the resumption in the balance of payment support by
cooperating partners.
</P>
<P>
Inflation, which stood at 23 percent at the end of February, is
 projected to close the year at 14 percent, the newspaper quoted
Mwanza as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mwanza however cautioned the possible effects of energy costs
on the final inflation targets, saying if costs in the energy
sector continue to rise they may disrupt the 14 percent inflation
projections.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Current Account Surplus Up in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's current account
surplus rose to 790 million U.S. dollars in February due to an
increased trade surplus and decline of the service account deficit,
the Bank of Korea said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The February surplus, 470 million dollars up from January,
brought the year's total surplus up to 1.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Exports in February totaled 12.4 billion dollars, up 29.7
percent from the same time last year because of strong
performances in sectors such as information and technology
equipment, automobile, heavy industries and chemicals while
imports reached 11.6 billion dollars, up 58.5 percent, due to
increasing import of oil imports and raw material prices.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in merchandise trade in February amounted to 720
million dollars, up 90 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thanks to reductions in patent royalty payments and
the travel account surplus of 50 million dollars, the service
deficit narrowed to 90 million dollars from 320 million dollars in
January and the income deficit was cut to 40 million dollars from
90 million dollars with improved operations at domestic bank's
overseas branches.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the capital account saw net inflow of 2.18 billion
dollars as 1.82 billion dollars flew into in country's stock
market from abroad and Hanvit Bank issued foreign currency bonds
of 850 million dollars overseas.

<HEADLINE> UK Car Buyers Offered 35 Percent Discount on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Pressure on car makers to cut
prices has intensified recently with the launch of Britain's
biggest discount service on buying cars on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The launch of Carbusters.com follows an extensive pilot scheme
in which motorists could buy 83 cars and save a total of 270,000
pounds (about 428,000 U.S. dollars) off the UK list price --
between 3,000 to 4,000 pounds (4760 to 6350 dollars) per vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme put forward by the Consumers' Association,
online buyers will save up to 35 percent on more than 180 models.
</P>
<P>
The Internet buying service was set up after the Consumers'
Association received 20,000 signatures at last year's London Motor
Show supporting the scheme.
</P>
<P>
The watchdog predicted that the launch of the scheme would
bring cheaper European prices to tens of thousands of UK motorists
and could force car makers to slash their prices to compete.

<HEADLINE> Rural Chinese Girl Undergoes Removal of Huge Kidney Tumor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese doctors at a hospital in
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has successfully
removed a benign tumor weighing 31 kilograms from the right kidney
of a rural girl.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Bose Prefecture Hospital said the operation
took 50 minutes, and the kidney tumor had a circumference of 140
cm. The patient, Tan Yufei, was reported to be in good condition
following the operation.
</P>
<P>
Tan is a native of mountainous Jingxi County on the Sino-
Vietnamese border. According to Tan's relatives, when the tumor
was first discovered in Tan's body when she was just 3 years old,
it was the size of a ping-pong ball. But she never received
medical attention because her family was too poor to afford it.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified swollen object inside Tan had been growing for
years. Before the operation, Tan had such a huge protruding belly
that she appeared to be pregnant with twins and walked with great
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
A work inspection team from the Bose Prefecture Government
finally arrived in Tan's hometown and happened to know of the
poverty of Tan's family and her illness, and they decided to bear
the cost of Tan's operation.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Opposes Kurdish State in Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Foreign Ministry has
made it clear that Turkey does not want to see a Kurdish state to
appear in northern Iraq, reported Turkish Daily News on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The message was conveyed to a visiting Kurdistan Democratic
Party (KDP) delegation led by Necirvan Barzani, head of the
regional administration in the KDP-controlled part of northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified diplomatic sources told the English-language
newspaper that they had held very fruitful meetings with the KDP
delegation although both Turkish diplomats and KDP representatives
had expressed their views to clarify some misunderstandings over
certain matters.
</P>
<P>
"We stressed the importance of Iraq's unity once more, and we
also reiterated that the problems of the northern Iraqi Kurds
should be solved within the territorial integrity of Iraq. They
said that they agree with Turkey on the matter of Iraq's
integrity," the officials were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that certain western powers had tried behind the
scenes to help set up a breakaway Kurdish state in northern Iraq in
an attempt to further weaken the Saddam Hussein government. But
plot was condemned by Arab and Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
For years Turkey has been engaged in a war against the
separatist Kurdish Workers' Party seeking to establish a Kurdish
state in the southeast which borders with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the KDP met with Turkish diplomats in the Foreign
Ministry, including Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Faruk Logoglu
and Foreign Ministry Middle East General Director Turkekul
Kurttekin. The delegation Tuesday met Turkish military officials at
General Staff headquarters to discuss security issues in the
region.
</P>
<P>
KDP is known to have given some logistic support for Turkish
troops crossing the Turkish-Iraqi border into northern Iraq to
pursue PKK guerrillas.

ANKARA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cumhuriyet (Republic):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, who was visiting
Turkmenistan, said on Tuesday that the country should give green
light to the implementation of the Trans-Caucasus natural gas
project.
</P>
<P>
Turkey could get 30 million cubic meters of natural gas from
Turkmenistan if the project comes into operation.
</P>
<P>
Demirel expected the agreement to be signed in Baku, Azerbaijan
where the pipeline transits, on April 7-8.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- A World Bank delegation, led by Lalit Raina, the head of the
Finance Sector Department of the international financial
institution, will visit Turkey in the first week of April and
examine initiatives for the formation of the Banking Arrangement
and Audit Board in the country.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
experts, will stay in Turkey for a week.
</P>
<P>
Sabah (Morning):
</P>
<P>
-- Huseyin Kivrikoglu, the Chief of General Staff of Turkish
Armed Forces, said on Tuesday that the army is not in favour of
interfering with the internal policy, but "we should be very
careful in our European Union (EU) candidacy process.''
</P>
<P>
Kivrikoglu made the remarks amid the EU criticism on conditions
of human rights in Turkey, whose strategical target is to integrate
itself with the EU.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- In his first public remarks on the failed summit with Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad in Geneva Sunday, U.S. President Bill
Clinton said Tuesday that it is now up to the Syrian leader to
provide fresh ideas about how to bridge gaps and move the Syrian-
Israeli peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that in the summit he had clarified to Assad what
the options were and heard from the Syrian leader what his needs
were, so the ball is now in the Syrian court. Washington officials
said Clinton was disappointed with Assad's intransigence on the
issue of the Golan Heights and other sticking points.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The Unites States administration has asked Prime Minister
Ehud Barak to slow down his moves to organize a multinational force
to fill the vacuum that will be left behind in south Lebanon after
an Israeli troop withdrawal from there.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the message, which was apparently delivered by U.
S. peace envoy Dennis Ross, Israel decided to postpone a previously
announced visit of Foreign Minister David Levy to New York for a
meeting with United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, at which
the two were to discuss the deployment of U.N. forces in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Maariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday branded the
police investigation against him and his wife Sarah as "ridiculous"
and said he had been "hunted" by the police out of political
motivations.
</P>
<P>
The police Tuesday recommended that Netanyahu be charged with
bribe-taking, fraud, breach of trust and obstruction of justice,
and that his wife be indicted for theft and attempted fraud, in an
alleged corruption case.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Barak said Tuesday that the possibility of the left-wing
Meretz party leaving the government is not on the agenda, hinting
for the first time that his proposals for ending the crisis between
Meretz and the ultra-religious Shas party call for compromises from
both parties.
</P>
<P>
Meretz is threatening to quit the government if Barak insists
that it give in to all of Shas' demands over funding and management
of religious schools. Barak said he would find ways to bridge the
gaps between the two coalition partners.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Indicts 28 Terrorist Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Military Attorney General
Mamoun Khassawneh has indicted 28 Arab nationals on charges of
conspiring to attack American and Israeli targets in the kingdom
during the New Year's celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen suspects, including 13 Jordanians, one Iraqi and one
Algerian, have been held in custody since December, and 13 others,
including Jordanians, Palestinians and a Yemeni, are still at large
and possibly hiding in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Britain, Lebanon and
Syria, Khassawneh said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials have contacted the governments concerned for
possible extradition of some of the suspects, the semi-official
Jordan Times reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Khassawneh said the suspects will be tried in Jordan's State
Security Court in mid-April and some of the suspects may face death
penalties if found guilty.
</P>
<P>
They had been charged with planing bombing attacks on United
States and Israeli tourists celebrating the New Year at Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The suspects were rounded up by police in December before they
could carry out the planned attacks, and virtually no terrorist
attacks were reported during the new year period.
</P>
<P>
Police found radio-controlled detonators, explosives,
ammunition, raw material for bomb-making and nerve gas hidden at a
farm outside the capital Amman, which they believe the suspects
would use in their planned attacks.
</P>
<P>
The suspects were also believed to be linked with the
Afghanistan-based, Saudi-expelled billionaire Osama Bin Laden, who
was accused of masterminding the 1998 bombings of two U.S.
embassies in Africa that killed 224 people.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department has put Bin Laden on its list of the
most-wanted criminals.

<HEADLINE> Thai Interior Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sanan's resignation came one day after the National Anti-
Corruption Committee (NACC) announced Tuesday that Sanan filed
false statements to back his claims to have received a fictional
45-million-baht(1.18-million-U.S. dollar) loan.
</P>
<P>
The NACC made the announcement after a three-month
investigation following the opposition's allegation that Sanan is
"unusually wealthy" and made false statements about his assets and
liabilities.
</P>
<P>
Thai government ministers must submit their declaration of
assets and liabilities to the Counter Corruption Commission when
they take office.
</P>
<P>
The source said the official resignation will be announced at a
press conference later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sanan is also the Secretary-General of the Democrat Party, the
core ruling political party, whose leader Chuan Leekpai is the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He has played a major role in coordinating political parties
within the ruling coalition during the previous government
reshuffles.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that he is also a key figure preparing the
government for Thailand's next general election, which must be
called by November of this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
The agreement was hailed by many subscribers in the Visayas and
Mindanao areas as a welcome development because it would not
provide fast and easy access to other cellular users in the
country, according to the Philippine News Agency said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ericsson is the world's largest supplier of communications
solutions that combine telecom and datacom technologies with
freedom of mobility for the users.
</P>
<P>
In a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE), Globe
officials said this is the third major agreement entered by Globe
with Ericsson thus bringing Globe investments with its supplier to
a total of 122 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
It was disclosed that Ericsson is expected to expand Globe's
GSM in the Visayas and Mindanao areas, which already started in
January this year and is to be completed by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
This agreement is part of Globe's 300 million dollars
investment for the year 2000 as part of its GSM network expansion.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Price Increases by 20 percent in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Prices of petrol and other
petroleum products have been increased by 20 percent in an
increment approved by Zambian Energy Regulation Board (ERB), Times
of Zambia newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
ERB public relations officer Faides Simunza who confirmed the
development on Tuesday attributed the upward adjustment to the
depreciation of kwacha and the price increase of petroleum
products on the international market.
</P>
<P>
She explained in a statement that the rise was due to an
increase on the railage prices by an average of 4.46 U.S. dollars
per ton of petrol, diesel and kerosene and fuel oil moved by
Spoornet of South Africa rail system.
</P>
<P>
Spoornet has been transporting the bulk of petroleum products
for Zambia National Oil Company.
</P>
<P>
But an insider said oil marketing companies applied to the ERB
for an increase over a month ago. They cited the rise in kwacha
cost and prices of crude oil on the international market as their
reasons for asking for an increment.
</P>
<P>
A liter of petrol is now selling at 2,232 kwacha from the
previous 1,861 kwacha (about 2,900 kwacha equal to one U.S.
dollar).
</P>
<P>
Long queues formed at some filling stations Wednesday morning
as many dealers had adjusted a few pumps while some pumps were not
changed.
</P>
<P>
This is the first fuel increase this year. The last upward
adjustment was toward the end of 1999 when the price was increased
by 20 percent.

<HEADLINE> Cause of Alzheimer's Disease Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The decrease of estrogen is a
major cause of Alzheimer's disease among elderly women, a group of
Chinese doctors at Beijing Union Medical College Hospital
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
They said their findings are based on a four-year research on
the relationship between estrogen and Alzheimer's disease and
heart disease.
</P>
<P>
Starting from 1996, they began to survey the incidence of
Alzheimer's disease among elderly residents in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
They found that 7.3 percent of the surveyed were suffering from
Alzheimer's disease, compared to 6 percent in European countries
and 15 percent in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Further studies showed that Alzheimer's disease among elderly
women could be related to a drop in the amount of estrogen in
their bodies, they said.
</P>
<P>
They also found that estrogen supplement therapy may help
protect elderly women against Alzheimer's disease, and plant
estrogen, which has fewer side effects, could be a great help in
the field.
</P>
<P>
According to them, the development of plant estrogen
supplements will become a new and important subject of their
future research.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Opposition Leader in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Informed Afghan sources have
announced the former governor of Afghanistan's Herat Province,
Ismail Khan, who escaped from jail in southeast Afghanistan last
weekend, has entered the Iranian territory.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Ismail Khan, a major opposition figure
in the Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, has entered Iran via the
Pakistani border, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency
(IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry has received information from the
local Afghan sources confirming Ismail Khan's arrival in Iran, an
official at the ministry's department for Afghan affairs told IRNA.
</P>
<P>
"We are now investigating the issue," said the unnamed official.
</P>
<P>
According to IRNA, the Taliban announced on Sunday that Ismail
Khan, together with Abdul Zaher, son of Haji Abdul Qadeer, another
opposition figure, and a militiaman escaped from jail in
southeastern Afghan city of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
An ally of former Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani, Khan was
the governor of the key western region of Herat for four years
until he was pushed out by the Taliban in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He was captured in 1997 in northern Afghanistan's Faryab
province and taken to Kandahar where he had been held since then.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan has been engaged in a bloody civil war since 1992
after Islamic groups toppled the former pro-Soviet government.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, President Rabbani's government was ousted by the
Islamic fundamentalist Taliban militia, which is now controlling
more than 90 percent of the country's territory.
</P>
<P>
Military clashes are still continuing between the Taliban and
the Northern Alliance headed by Rabbani, who has enjoyed Iran's
support in the past years.
</P>
<P>
Iran maintains that the Afghan crisis should be solved through
peaceful negotiations between different political and ethnic groups
in the country so as to set up a broad-based government.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Parliamentary Elections to Be Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean parliamentary
elections, originally scheduled in April, may further be postponed
as it could take three months to finish constituency demarcation.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe on Tuesday swore in the Delimitation
Commission, chaired by Justice Wilson Sandura, to determine
constituency boundaries for the forthcoming parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
Sandura told reporters soon after meeting President Mugabe that
the commission needed at least three months to complete its work,
meaning that elections may further be postponed to July.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe on Sunday announced postponement of the parliamentary
election to May to allow votors' registration and constituency
demarcation.
</P>
<P>
However, Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs
Emmerson Mnangagwa said the elections could go ahead as scheduled
because the commission's work could be speeded up since the
Registrar-General's Office was now computerized.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Surge in Tokyo, Nikkei Hits 40-Month Closing High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rose sharply in Tokyo
Wednesday, led mainly by high-priced information and technology
issues, with the benchmark Nikkei index hitting an almost 40-month
closing high.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange soared 332.31 points, or 1.63
percent, from Tuesday's close to end at 20,706.65, its highest
close since December 10, 1996, when it ended at 20,822.12.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, surged 52.08 points, or 3.10 percent, to 1,
732.84.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section increased to 622.17 million
shares from Tuesday's 530.26 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Toshiba was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Selling pressure ahead of March-end book closings has weakened,
while planned launches of new investment trusts by the end of this
week encouraged investors to buy stocks further.
</P>
<P>
High-priced information and technology issues led overall share
prices higher, while brokerage houses drew buying, reflecting the
recent active trading in the stock market, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Only four of the 33 business sectors -- marine transportation,
warehousing, rubber and mining faced selling.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, gainers far
outnumbered losers 878 to 400, with 107 issues closing unchanged.

LONDON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading British newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Proposals to soften Britain's drug laws were rejected by the
government Tuesday night amid accusations that ministers were more
concerned with their electoral fortunes than giving the
recommendations serious consideration.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Labor's honeymoon with the business community is over,
senior business leaders say.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Labor will fail to meet its promise to increase the
proportion of the GDP spent on education, new figures suggested
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>

set up to help business cover key jobs when staff take maternity
and parental leave under plans being considered by the government.
</P>
<P>
The Independent
</P>
<P>
-- In a climate in which government ministers are busy
attacking the "disgraceful" behavior of the BMW, and Germans
remain reluctant to eat British beef, it may appear an unlikely
alliance for England to join Germany in a joint bid to host the
football World Cup.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Bank To Provide More Housing Loans for Individuals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Chongqing Branch of the
China Construction Bank has decided to provide an additional one
billion yuan (125 million U.S. dollars) in housing loans for
individuals this year.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at stimulating the purchasing of more local
private housing, bank officials said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the bank extended a total of one billion yuan (125
million dollars) in housing loans to individuals, they added.
</P>
<P>
The Chongqing Construction Bank has to date granted a total of
1.6 billion yuan (192 million dollars) in these loans, giving
strong impetus to the sale of over 270 housing projects in this
largest municipality in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
This year, the bank has begun implementing new application
policies under which any resident is eligible to apply for these
loans to either purchase, build, or refurbish their apartments
anywhere in the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
These loans have a term limit of 30 years, and also have
guarantee clauses, the bank officials noted.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Unveils Biodiversity Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government
launched here Wednesday a biodiversity strategy to restore New
Zealand's dwindling natural heritage.
</P>
<P>
The strategy will aim to halt the decline in native plants and
animals due to increasing pressure from pests and human activity.
</P>
<P>
It comes after a number of environmental issues have plagued
New Zealand of late, while reports from the Department of
Conservation(DOC) highlight the struggle of native bird species in
the face of growing numbers of predators.
</P>
<P>
DOC has said that pests like possums, stoats and rats are
destroying native plants and animals, and this could lead to the
extinction of birds like the kiwi from the mainland within 50
years.
</P>
<P>
Also, fragile marine ecosystems are threatened by fishing,
according to DOC. New Zealand's coast has been recently hit by a
number of oil spills from fishing vessels in quick succession at
Stewart Island, the Chatham Islands, and the Poor Knights Islands.
</P>
<P>
The Forest and Bird Society of New Zealand and the New Zealand
Green Party have been calling for tighter biosecurity controls and
a revamp of quarantine regulations.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark launched the
biodiversity strategy at a ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony, New Zealand Minister of Conservation
Sandra lee said that her country has thousands of plants, animals
and species-habitats found nowhere else in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Without our indigenous biodiversity, there would be no kiwi,
no silver fern, no weta (a kind of tree), and no whitebait,
</P>
<P>
"We have already made a major international commitment to help
conserve global biodiversity," she said, adding: "Today we take a
major step to underline our domestic commitment to halt the
decline in our indigenous biodiversity."
</P>
<P>
"The challenge before us seems daunting," the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that maintaining natural heritage at present
levels will cost the New Zealand government an additional 25
million U.S.dollars per year on top of current spending.

<HEADLINE> Students Protesting Across New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Students are protesting this
week across New Zealand to highlight key issues facing Tertiary
access and participation which need to be addressed immediately in
the upcoming government budget round, according to Television NZ.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, 500 students attended a rally in Christchurch on South
Island, while Wellington-based Victoria University students
occupied their registry. Wednesday, protest action spread north
with Auckland and Waikato students taking action.
</P>
<P>
"Students are not prepared to sit around and wait for the
government to aimlessly address the major problems of Tertiary
education for the next three years," said Sam Huggard, co-
president of the New Zealand University Students Association.
</P>
<P>
"Students are demanding that the government address income
disparities by providing universal living allowances," he added.
</P>
<P>
The tertiary sector in New Zealand's universities is grossly
underfunded. This was proved by Tuesday's announcements of further
staff cuts and department closures at Victoria University.
</P>
<P>
"How many more institutions will be forced to cut back on
quality staff before the government takes action," Huggard said,
adding "Something needs to happen sooner rather than later, and we
are looking to the budget round for a fiscal commitment to
education."

<HEADLINE> India Wants Constructive Relationship With China:  Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We seek a long-term, stable relationship in which both sides
are responsive to each other's concerns," said the annual report
of the External Affairs Ministry for 1999-2000. "We remain
committed to the process of dialogue to resolve outstanding
differences and to build a constructive cooperative relationship
oriented towards the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
On the Indo-Pakistani relations, the report questioned Pakistan
's sincerity in seeking the resumption of dialogue with India,
saying that Islamabad's continuous calls for "Jihad" (holy war)
against India "can hardly be interpreted as messages for dialogue
and peace".
</P>
<P>
It restated New Delhi's stand that Pakistan must first stop its
support for "cross-border terrorism" and give up its "anti-India
propaganda" before any talks can resume between the two
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"These are not preconditions but the very ingredients to foster
proper environment for a meaningful interaction between the two
countries," it claimed.
</P>
<P>
The report went on to say that the international community
recognized that all outstanding issues between India and Pakistan
should be settled bilaterally in a peaceful manner. "There is no
place whatsoever for any third-party mediation," it stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the Indo-U.S. relations, the report, prepared before
President Bill Clinton's visit to India, said the dialogue between
External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh and U.S. Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott on non-proliferation and disarmament has
led to "some progress" in creating a better understanding of India
's security concerns by the U.S. authorities.
</P>
<P>
It also expressed the hope that the U.S. government would
completely remove its restrictions on loans to India by the World
Bank and other international financial institutions.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A massive search-and-rescue
operation is under way in the Gulf of California after a small
boat carrying a group of researchers from the University of
California (UC), Davis, capsized off the Baja California Peninsula,
leaving two people dead and three others missing, officials said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Four people have been rescued so far in the search of waters
about 400 kilometers south of the U.S.-Mexico border, the U.S.
Coast Guard said, adding that the accident happened late Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned for these researchers and their families.
Everything possible is being done to facilitate the search for
possible survivors," UC-Davis Chancellor Larry Vanderhof said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Officials said Mike Rose, a graduate student at the university,
drowned in the accident. A Japanese scholar, whose name was not
released, also died.
</P>
<P>
Among the missing was Gary Polis, the expedition's leader and
chairman of the school's Department of Environmental Sciences and
Policy, said Lisa Lapin, a spokeswoman for the school.
</P>
<P>
Besides Polis, the research expedition included several
students and a group of visiting scholars from Japan.
</P>
<P>
Polis is one of the world's leading spider experts. He and
other researchers were studying the ecology of spiders and
scorpions that inhabit the islands of the Sea of Cortez, the
university said.
</P>
<P>
The 22-foot-long open, inflatable boat was caught in strong
winds when it capsized, according to Antonio Cepeda, who runs a
small marina in the area.
</P>
<P>
Captain Max Montano, harbormaster in Bahia Kino, Mexico, said
the U.S. Coast Guard and the Mexican Navy were cooperating in the
search for the capsized vessel.

<HEADLINE> Condoms Provided in Hotel in Ancient Xi'an </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A hotel in northern Xi'an, capital
of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, has begun placing condoms
in its hotel rooms. Local social analysts say this move signifies
a big change in the thinking of mostly conservative people in this
ancient city.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Rong, manager of the Huahong Mansion, said his hotel
began putting condoms in its rooms on a trial basis last October,
and officially began the service this month.
</P>
<P>
"We are intending to provide better and more considerate
service to our guests," Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the trial period, the hotel only gave
condoms to registered married couples for fear of causing
misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
"Starting March 1, our hotel began placing them in all rooms,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
A guest named Liu said he was not surprised at seeing the
condoms when he first entered his hotel room, adding that he
viewed it only as a new way of improving hotel service.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that Xi'an, an international tourist
destination, is experiencing an 'encouraging' change," he noted.
</P>
<P>
A hotel attendant said he felt uncomfortable when he began
putting condoms in hotel rooms, but "now I feel it is as common as
providing toothpaste and toothbrushes."
</P>
<P>
Lan Hongwei, a Ph.D. in sociology, expressed his appreciation
for the hotel's pioneering move, saying, "When sex shops appeared
on Xi'an streets several years ago, many people were embarrassed
by just passing through them, but now Xi'an residents buy sex
products just like they buy soaps from the supermarket."
</P>
<P>
Since China instituted its family planning policies 20 years
ago, condoms have been distributed free of charge to couples by
family planning officials.
</P>
<P>
It has been estimated that China has 300 million fewer people
than it would have had without this policy.
</P>
<P>
Now the country has an estimated 200 million married people who
are encouraged to use contraceptive devices.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan Province
will hold a tourism festival in volcano-rich Tengchong County from
April 29 to May 3, it has been announced.
</P>
<P>
Tengchong County, which borders Myanmar, has 97 dormant
volcanoes believed to be most well-preserved and complete ones in
China.
</P>
<P>
At the event, parachutists from the National Parachuting Troop
are expected to create a world record by jumping some of the
craters, according to the organizers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a fashion model competition and folk singing and
dancing performances will also be staged, they noted.
</P>
<P>
The festival constitutes part of Yunnan's effort to enhance
tourism amid a national drive to develop western China. Earlier,
the province built a volcano park and a hot spring resort in the
county, so that Tengchong is able to receive more than 10,000
tourists.
</P>
<P>
The tourism festival will be held every year, organizers added.

in the planned development of the western area.
</P>
<P>
But the historian emphasized that there was still a long way to
go to recover and improve ecological environment in the area.

<HEADLINE> China Should Learn From Past Experience in Developing Western Area: Historian (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- China should learn from the past
experience in its present development of western area, said Zhou
Tianyou, curator of the Shannxi Historical Museum.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, also a historian and scholar on ancient history, said
that China should not seek short-term benefit by sacrificing long-
term interests.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a favorable ecological environment should be the
final goal of the development of western China.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi and neighboring provinces were once the political,
economic and cultural center in ancient China but began to decline
since the Song Dynasty ((960-1127), Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
The landlocked geographical location, the interruption of the
Silk Road, frequent wars and natural disasters were blamed for the
decline, said Zhou, a member of the Chinese People's Political and
Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
"But the most decisive factor is the deteriorating ecological
environment in the area," the historian said.

<HEADLINE> Activities Commemorating Ancient Kingdom to be Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region will organize a series of activities to bring
back people's memories of Loulan (Kroraina), an ancient kingdom
known as "China's Pompeii in the desert."
</P>
<P>
The ancient kingdom was located on the eastern tip of the
Taklimakan Desert in the southern part of Xinjiang. According to
historical records, it was a famous city at the juncture of the
southern and northern routes of the Silk Road some 2,000 years ago.
Because of diminishing water resources, the city was gradually
ruined and abandoned. It was discovered by a Swedish during an
exploration in 1900.
</P>
<P>
A group of scholars specializing in the research of Loulan will
set off for archeological investigation at the site, according to
organizers of the activities.
</P>
<P>
An exhibition displaying 140 cultural objects unearthed from
Loulan will also be held in the cities of Hami, Dunhuang, Lanzhou
and Xi'an. If possible, it will be shown in some foreign cities.
</P>
<P>
A website introducing Loulan will be opened within the year. A
set of stamps with Loulan as the main theme is being made.

<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- China's Minister of Culture Sun
Jiazheng has pledged to shape a new kind of culture in the western
region, combining local traditions with borrowings from
outstanding features of other cultures.

Sun also said this new western culture might push forward the
economic development of the region as planned by the central
authorities, the Shanghai-based newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ministry plans to organize a nationwide work

enhancement in the west.
</P>
<P>
As an important origin of the Chinese nation, the western
provinces are abundant in cultural resources, Sun said.

<HEADLINE> Loans to Help Poor College Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- China's financially strapped
college students will now be able to complete their studies
without worrying about money, said a Ministry of Education
official today.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education and Ministry of Finance issued a
notice last year asking colleges to spend 10 percent of student
tuition fees to provide poor students with part-time jobs to help
them complete their studies.
</P>
<P>
Also, at the beginning of last autumn's term, an experimental
loan system for needy students was introduced which allows a 50
percent discount on interest and a four year grace period after
graduation for repayment.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Education noted that a total
of 700 million yuan (about 84 million U.S. dollars) is set aside
to help cash-poor students at 136 institutions of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
The system began in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing,
Wuhan, Shenyang, Xi'an, and Nanjing, which have the greatest
number of universities. The program will be in place elsewhere in
the next few years, with the goal of helping poor students
complete college.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows that the average Chinese college student,
mostly supported by his or her family, has to pay an average of 48,
000 yuan (nearly 5,800 U.S. dollars) for four years of higher
education.
</P>
<P>
The average annual disposable income for a Chinese urban
resident last year was 5,425 yuan (about 654 U.S. dollars), and
the annual net income for a Chinese rural resident was 2,162 yuan
(260 U.S. dollars).

<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- China intends to create a highly
efficient national "crack team" for basic scientific research in
the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Science and Technology said
here today that China will give great financial support to about
30,000 basic research scientists and much more financial aid to
around 5,000 scientists who are the leaders of basic research
programs.
</P>
<P>
He made these remarks at a three-day national conference on
basic research which closed here today.
</P>
<P>
The official said China hopes to foster outstanding scientists
who enjoy international reputations, and a group of leading
scientists of major basic research programs.
</P>
<P>
China will also try to attract leading world scientists by
establishing state-of-the-art facilities, offering high salaries,
and taking care of housing and education for their children.
</P>
<P>
He said China will give great attention to fostering research
team which include a number of first-rate scientists.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Chinese scientists taking part in major
national basic research programs are expected to receive much
greater annual salaries in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day national conference, participants
discussed the major tasks facing China's basic scientific research
in next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
This research is expected to emphasize innovation rather than
simply copy the direction of developed countries, sources at the
conference said.

<HEADLINE> New Rules for Coastal Shipping, Fishing Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A new set of rules for management
of shipping service and fishing operations in coastal regions will
go into effect on May 1, according to a meeting held here today.
</P>
<P>
The rules, made public by the Ministry of Public Security,
will be of great significance for management of shipping and
fishing in coastal regions and for the prevention of marine
crimes and the maintenance of law and order in the coastal regions,
participants said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, the country's coastal regions have
witnessed rapid economic growth, and shipping and fishing
activities have been on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics show that by the end of last year, the
number of boats put out to sea had reached 310,000, involving 1.16
million people engaged in fishing activities.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, new situations and problems also arose, such
as fishing boats venturing out of the designated fishing areas and
an increase in marine crimes.
</P>
<P>
The meeting called on all coastal security forces to
enthusiastically make these new rules known to the public, and
carry them out according to the law.

<HEADLINE> Ground Water Level Falls Rapidly in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Water level in Dhaka city and its
suburban areas is falling rapidly due to massive extraction of
underground water by Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (
WASA)through hundreds of deep tube wells daily for the growing
population.
</P>
<P>
Ignoring the warning of environment and soil science experts,
Dhaka WASA has continued to extract the underground water,
resulting in the fall of water level by 24 meters till 1996 from
the acceptable level, The Bangladesh Observer reported here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The water level will drop by 36 meters by the year 2010 if the
extraction continues at the existing rate, soil scientists said.
</P>
<P>
A WASA report on "Static Water Level Measures" also admitted
that the water level in the city had gone down gradually over the
last few years.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the rate of fall in the water level
was 1.44 meters in 1995, 1.95 meters in 1996 and 2.56 meters in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The alarming fall in the water level in the city is caused
mainly by poor recharge in the ground water and the higher rate of
extraction.
</P>
<P>
Coupled with massive extraction of ground water, the
construction of increasing high-rise buildings in the city areas
has also contributed to land subsidence.
</P>
<P>
The increasing number of high-rise buildings might create a
vacuum in the underground, which would cause a massive land
subsidence at any time in the city, according to geology professor
Shaifur Rahman.

CANBERRA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A crude home-made bomb exploded
Wednesday outside the police station of the Alice Springs city in
Australia's Northern Territory, police said.
</P>
<P>
A second home-made device also went off in the city's suburban
storm-water drain, said Northern Territory police spokesman Gavin

</P>
<P>
The blasts came on the eve of the visit of British Queen
Elizabeth II to Alice Springs.
</P>
<P>
Police denied however that there was any connection between the
explosions and the royal visit, saying the bombs, made from soda
siphons and cardboard, were the result of childish pranks.
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries or damage and police said the bombs were
only capable of injuring a person holding them.
</P>
<P>
"This is one of a number of incidents in the last few months,"
Superintendent Gary Moseley said.
</P>
<P>
"We see nothing whatsoever between this incident and the queen'

<P>
CANBERRA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen men were undergoing
health checks Wednesday as a result of a fire which broke out at a
gold mine near the town of Orange in central New South Wales (NSW)
state, southeast Australia, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The fire erupted in the above-ground crushing plant at the
Cadia Hill mine owned by the Newcrest Mining Ltd.
</P>
<P>
A hospital spokesman said 15 workers were having health checks.
</P>
<P>
"It does not look like anyone will be hospitalized," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A fire brigade spokesman said ambulance officers treated
several men at the mine immediately after the blaze.
</P>
<P>
"No one has been killed, several miners were treated for
injuries by the ambulance," he said.
</P>
<P>
NSW Premier Bob Carr, who was in Orange Wednesday on a three-
day rural tour, said he was yet to receive a report on the
accident.
</P>
<P>
"Any occupational health and safety incident can take on very
serious connotations in a mine," Carr told the ABC Radio. "So I'm
awaiting a report."
</P>
<P>
"I was relieved to be told that there were no fatalities ...
But it is regarded seriously," he said.
</P>
<P>
A company spokeswoman described the incident as a small fire in
a building on a section of the plant known as the concentrator
where rocks are processed.
</P>
<P>
She said the blaze had apparently been sparked by a rubber
liner inside a steel pipe.

activated huge security doors Wednesday to keep rallying Catholic
school teachers from storming the building.
</P>
<P>
During a rally outside NSW Premier Bob Carr's office at

</P>
<P>
Costa said the Teachers Federation had accepted the government'

whether it would be back-dated.
</P>
<P>
The federation would not comment but is continuing talks with
NSW Education Minister John Aquilina.

<HEADLINE> Australia Welcomes OPEC Raising-Output Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Australia's peak petrol body
Wednesday welcome OPEC's decision on lifting oil output cap but
warned petrol prices would not drop back to March 1999 levels.
</P>
<P>
Nine members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) has decided to increase output by 6.3 percent, or
1.45 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Institute of Petroleum Deputy Director Ewen
Macpherson said Australian petrol prices would likely only drop a
few Australian cents in response, and it would take a couple of
weeks to flow through.
</P>
<P>
"There will be some impact on the market but perhaps not as
much as had been first hoped for," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think there will be some downward pressure on prices but it'
s a bit hard yet to know how much that will be," he added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. oil prices tripled to a March 8 peak of 34.37 U.S. dollars
per barrel following OPEC's decision 12 months ago to slash
production, sending Australian petrol prices edging towards 1
Australian dollar (62 U.S. cents) a liter in some regions.
</P>
<P>
Ministers of the 11-nation OPEC cartel announced in Vienna
Wednesday morning all members except Iran and Iraq would ramp up
production to pre-April 1999 levels, resisting U.S. pressure to
raise output by up to 2.5 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
OPEC, which includes Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait,
Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela, pumps more than 26 million barrels of crude each day,
or about 35 percent of the world's supply.

SEOUL, March 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Wednesday announced
suspension of livestock and meat import from Japan as an epidemic
suspected of being foot and mouth disease broke out in Miyazaki,
Japan last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean announcement came one day after Singapore
banned imports of Japanese beef following an outbreak of
vescicular disease among cattle in its Paju, where nearly 200
heads of livestock have been killed by the blisters on the mouth
and around the hoofs.
</P>
<P>
An emergency headquarters has been established to prevent a
further spread of the disease and has quarantined 78,000 heads of
cattle, pigs and deer in areas within a 10-kilometer radius from
the place where the first case was detected.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Agriculture and Forestry Ministry said it
could not rule out the possibility of the disease turning out to
be a highly contagious epidemic.
</P>
<P>
It will take South Korea one week to finish its full
examination and inoculation 150,000 heads of cattle, goats, deer
and sheep around the place where the first case was reported.

SEOUL, March 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's exports of textile
products continued to increase in February, reaching 1.27 billion
U.S. dollars, up 21.9 percent from the previous year, said the
South Korean Textile Industry Association Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Security Council Decides to Send Mission to DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Tuesday decided in principle to send a council mission to the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to "look into the peace process
there and the deployment of the U.N. forces" in the central
African country, where many-sided conflicts are under way.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced by the president of the Security
Council for the month of March, Anwarul Chowdhury of Bangladesh,
at the end of the closed-door council meeting that kicked off on
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The date and details of the mission would be discussed during
the next few days and a final decision would hopefully be made
next week, the council president said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council heard the briefing by Bernard Miyet, U.N.
under-secretary-general for peace-keeping operations, who just
returned from a trip to the African country, formerly known as
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Miyet urged the council to send a delegation to the DRC and
other countries involved in the conflict to stress the need for
all parties to abide by the Lusaka accord and to allow the U.N.
force to operate freely and safely.
</P>
<P>
A force of 500 U.N. observers and 5,000 troops was authorized
under the February 24 resolution to monitor the shaky cease-fire
in the African country, signed by warring parties last summer in
the Zambian capital of Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
However, the deployment of the forces will be delayed until U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan is satisfied it would be able to
carry out its duties in security and with the cooperation of the
warring parties.
</P>
<P>
After the closed-door briefing, the council president issued a
statement, saying that members "expressed serious concern about
the violations" of the resolution.
</P>
<P>
"Council members reiterated their dismay at the offensive
launched in the province of Kasai. They also reiterated their
concern about continuing fighting in other parts of the country,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Council members "expressed their strong support for the Lusaka
process, and demanded once again that all parties immediately stop
the hostilities and respect their commitment to the cease-fire
agreement," Chowdhury said.
</P>
<P>
The conflict, which broke out in August 1998, has pitted the
government of DRC President Laurent Kabila, aided by Angola,
Namibia and Zimbabwe, against the rebel groups backed by Rwanda
and Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Mission to Visit Kosovo in Late April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Tuesday decided to send a mission to Kosovo, Yugoslavia, in late
April to see how the U.N. Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo
(UNMIK) is functioning there and press for an end to ethnic
conflicts, the council president said.
</P>
<P>
The president of the 15-nation council for March, Anwarul
Chowdhury of Bangladesh, told reporters that the Security Council
made the decision at the invitation by Bernard Kounchner, the U.N.
special representative and head of UNMIK.
</P>
<P>
Chowdhury said that participants in the council mission would
visit Kosovo "toward the last few days of April," but he did not
mention which council members would take part in.
</P>
<P>
The mission was mandated to inspect the implementation of the U.
N. resolution of Kosovo and UNMIK operations there.
</P>
<P>
It also expected "to see what are the difficulties faced by
UNMIK, and to take a strong message of the council to the parties
concerned ...to end hostilities and engage in the restoration of
civic life in that territory," according to Chowdhury.
</P>
<P>
UNMIK and the international peace-keepers, known as KFOR,
entered Kosovo last June under the Security Council resolution
1244, adopted on June 10 at the end of the 78-day unilateral NATO
air strikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The security situation in Kosovo worsened since the beginning
of February, and Belgrade repeatedly accused UNMIK and KFOR of the
failure to implement the Security Council resolution, which
demands the full respect of the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia, the full disarmament and disbanding of
the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), and the guarantee of
safety and security of all ethnic groups in the Serbian province,
where ethnic Albanians form the majority of the province's
population.

<P>
TOKYO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Shinji Ono, one of Japanese soccer
's brightest talents, will be sidelined for a month after
undergoing ankle surgery on Tuesday, according to reports
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Urawa Reds captain, who played for Japan at
the World Cup in France, had an operation on his right ankle after
an old injury flared up on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He felt pain in the ankle during a warm-up for the Reds' home
game against Omiya Ardija, but played the full 90 minutes and
scored the only goal of the game from the penalty spot, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
With a busy year ahead on the international front, including
the Sydney Olympics in September and the Asian Cup in Lebanon in
October, the club decided it was better for Ono to have surgery
immediately to clear up the problem.
</P>
<P>
In July, he needed knee surgery after being chopped down in an
Olympic qualifier against the Philippines in Tokyo and was out
four months.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Street Gangs Said to Fund S. Lankan Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Some of Canada's most notorious
street gangs have funneled illicit profits to fund Sri Lanka's
Tamil Tiger rebels' separatist war, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs charged Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Those Tamil gangs operating in Toronto and Montreal such as VVT
and A.K. Kannan gangs have strong connections with the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement quoted a report by the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police(RCMP) as saying that a large number of LTTE members have a
presence in Canada and that they rely on Tamil gangs for fund
raising and intimidation. In some cases key LTTE figures are
active gang members, it said.
</P>
<P>
The RCMP report said these Tamil criminal groups had been
involved in a staggering variety of activities including extortion,
home invasion, attempted murder, theft, the import and sale of
brown heroin, arms trafficking, production and sale of counterfeit
passports, migrant smuggling, bank and casino fraud and money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
Canada is considered one of the key sources of funds for the
LTTE's war chest. Politicians there reportedly turn a blind eye to
LTTE activities for domestic political reasons.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 17-year-old war between
government troops and LTTE rebels who want to carve out a homeland
for minority Tamils in the north and east of the country through
guerrilla warfare as well as terrorist bombings.
</P>
<P>
In February this year Canada became a signatory to the U.N.
Convention on the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism,vowing
to crack down on organizations which raise funds on Canadian soil
for or on behalf of terrorist organizations.

<HEADLINE> Thai Deputy PM Indicted for Falsifying Assets Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bangkok, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's National Counter
Corruption Commission (NCCC) had indicted Deputy Prime Minister
Sanan Kachornprasart for falsifying his assets record, The Nation
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was based on the results of a lengthy
investigation, mainly into a 45 million-baht (1.2 million U.S.
dollars) loan allegedly taken out by Sanan in three tranches
between January and May 1997, commission spokesman Krirkkiat
Pipatseritham said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
If the NCCC ruling is endorsed by the Constitution Court, Sanan
will be removed from his office and face a five-year ban from
political activities. This is the second serious setback for the
veteran, after his wife was disqualified for a seat she won in the
recent senate election.
</P>
<P>
Sanan, who is also interior minister, is one of the most
powerful figures in the government and the ruling Democrat Party.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's shocking development stunned everybody. A flurry of
meetings was held between Sanan, his advisers and key party
members, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Evidence and the testimonies of Sanan, his creditor and other
people concerned indicated that the three loan contracts, dated
separately for each tranche drawn, were actually signed on the
same day, Krirkkiat was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sanan had knowingly submitted three false documents related to
his loan transaction to the commission, he said.
</P>
<P>
After examining evidence, the commission decided in a 9-0 vote
to hand down the indictment for the falsification of his assets
record, he said.
</P>
<P>
Commission Chairman Opas Arunin was quoted as saying the
commission could not verify if money had changed hands, hinting at
a possible bogus deal to cover up Sanan's true net worth.
</P>
<P>
Mandated by the constitution, the commission has the
responsibility to verify the assets of all holders of political
office, their spouses and underage children when they assume
office, leave office and one year after they quit office.
</P>
<P>
The anti-graft body, consisting of a chairman and eight
commissioners, only began functioning on November 18 last year
after the enactment of a constitutional supplementary law.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Flush With Cash For Olympic Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI) has received more support for its training program
for the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, and is now well past its
initial fund target, according to the Jakarta Post Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
PT Samsung Electronics Indonesia, which is the second private
institution after fast food firm McDonald's Indonesia to donate to
the cause, has pledged to provide 100,000 U.S. dollars in cash and
goods.
</P>
<P>
KONI Chairman Wismoyo Arismunandar will sign a memorandum of
understanding with a company representative at Hotel Mulia Senayan
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
KONI Vice Chairman Arie Sudewo said that PT Samsung Electronics
Indonesia would provide 70,000 U.S. dollars in cash and another 30,
000 U.S. dollars in electronic goods, such as cellular phones,
refrigerators televisions and video recorders.
</P>
<P>
"We will use the goods to assist our athletes. We will also use
the money for training and consolidation," he said, adding that
the amount of contributions exceeded the 6.9 billion rupiah (about
986,000 U.S.dollars) targeted for the Olympic preparation.
</P>
<P>
KONI has received 2 billion rupiah from the Gelora Senayan
Management Board and a 500 million rupiah surplus from last year's
Southeast Asian Games fund. The council is awaiting another 4.2
billion rupiah from the government.
</P>
<P>
McDonald's Indonesia pledged one billion rupiah for the
training last month.
</P>
<P>
"The donation is very useful for us to make up the deficit in
our training fund. But now the fund is more than enough. Before,
we were thinking about how to give bonuses to athletes who win
medals in the Olympics. Now we have a surplus," Arie said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Third in Tuberculosis Cases in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is third in the world
in the number of tuberculosis patients with more than 583,000
recorded infections last year, of which 140,000 died, according to
Health Minister Achmad Sujudi.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the figure put Indonesia in third place after
China with 2.5 million cases and India with 1.7 million on the
list of countries having the problem.
</P>
<P>
"From the contagious diseases group, tuberculosis is the
primary cause of death in the country. Around 400 people die of
the disease every day," the minister was quoted by the Jakarta
Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sujudi emphasized that there had been a marked increase in
tuberculosis since 1997 in conjunction with the spread of the
human immune-deficiency virus (HIV).
</P>
<P>
He explained that the virus stimulates the onset of the
tuberculosis germ which is already in the human body.
</P>
<P>
He said data from last year's patients indicate that around 70
percent of those infected were at working age. Even those who
recovered needed three or four months before they could resume
working.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the tuberculosis sufferers are poor people who are in
their productive age between 15 and 49 years. (Tuberculosis) is
the third most deadly disease in Indonesia, after heart attack and
respiratory tract infections," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since April 1999, the Indonesian government has formed an
integrated national movement to control tuberculosis, led by the
director general of contagious diseases control.
</P>
<P>
Through the movement, the government is hoping to reduce the
number of tuberculosis sufferers to 225,000 in the next five years
and to 75,000 in 2010.

<HEADLINE> China's Revolutionary Base Launches Green Campaign (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the 1980s, the Chinese government started working on the
problem of soil erosion, but achieved little due to its failure to
deal with the ties between grain production and environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China's grain output has grown steadily and
there are now sufficient stocks, creating good conditions for
implementing a massive farmland-to-forests campaign.
</P>
<P>
In August last year, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji declared in
this revolutionary center that the Chinese government was going to
carry out a farmland-to-forests policy in the vast area of western
China, which includes nine provinces and autonomous regions and
one municipality.
</P>
<P>
Under the policy, farmers will be compensated for giving up
their terrace land. A farmer will get 100 kg of grain every year
for giving up one mu (0.06 hectare) of slopping fields in addition
to a certain amount in subsidies for buying seedlings.
</P>
<P>
This policy soon won the hearts of many farmers, and in six
months, Yan'an has turned more than 160,000 hectares of farmland
into forests and grasslands.
</P>
<P>
In the years ahead, Yan'an will continue to turn 660,000
hectares of farmland into forests and grasslands, making up 80
percent of the city's cultivated land.
</P>
<P>
Yan'an Mayor Wang Xia said farmers are the biggest
beneficiaries of the policy, citing examples of 3,000 farmers in
Wuqi County who earned an average of more than 5,000 yuan (about
602 dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
With large areas of land covered again with trees and grass,
ecological conditions in the area have been greatly improved. To
many people's surprise, little animals such as pheasants and
rabbits have appeared again in the groves and on the grasslands.

<P>
XI'AN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Sixty years ago, Yan'an was the
bedrock of the Chinese revolution. Now it is undergoing a green
campaign to turn huge areas of meagre farmland into forests amid a
nation drive to develop western China.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers have given up their traditional ploughing and
cultivating and begun planting fruit trees outside their cave
houses on the barren hills surrounding their villages.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Yi, a municipal official in charge of the
area's ecological construction, over 160,000 ha of sloping fields
so far have been planted with trees and grass.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhanrong, a 60-year-old farmer in Jin Fuoping village of
Wuqi County, said he grew clover on his 30-ha field and planted
apricot trees in his courtyard and backyard, earning 20,000 yuan (
about 2,409 U.S. dollars) a year from the fruit.
</P>
<P>
" I am very glad I have found a better way to earn money after
ploughing and cultivating for my whole life," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shan Lun, an academician with the Chinese Academy of Science
who has studied soil erosion in the Loess Plateau area, said the
massive campaign to plant trees and grass will help Yan'an people
abandon their old ways of production which damaged the environment,
and establish a healthy and coordinated relationship with nature.
</P>
<P>
Located in the middle of the Loess Plateau in north China, the
cradle of the Chinese revolution used to be a land of green
mountains and clean lakes.
</P>
<P>
But decades of excessive logging and land reclamation to
produce enough grain to support China's revolution and feed the
local people has caused serious soil and water erosion in the area
and plunged local farmers into a vicious spiral of over-
cultivation and poverty.

<HEADLINE> WTO Entry Impacts China's Agriculture: Expert (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China will soon engage in free international trade of
agricultural products, which means its agriculture will be subject
to global changes in prices, market accessibility, trade structure
and trade rules concerning agricultural products, today's China
Daily quoted Chen Baodong, a researcher with Guangda Securities
Research Institute in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The country will also have to fulfill the obligations it
committed to during the 13-year negotiation for WTO membership.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the positive impacts are obvious:
</P>
<P>
China will benefit from the preferential treatment in free
trade, especially in tariff reduction, enjoyed by all signatory
countries to the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade, the
predecessor of WTO.
</P>
<P>
China will unconditionally obtain the most-favored-nation
status with all WTO members. These will give China a better
opportunity to tap international agricultural resources and
markets.
</P>
<P>
The entry will help China accelerate its agriculture reform and
establish an agriculture macro-control system compatible with the
market economy, thus enhancing the production of agricultural
products and sharpening the competitive edge of China's farm
products in the international market.

<TEXT>
<P>
As a member state, China will have a better chance to protect
its own trade interests. It will be eligible to resort to relevant
WTO clauses and its mechanism to resolve disputes to protect its
domestic agricultural production and market against the dumping of
foreign farm produce.
</P>
<P>
China is also qualified to participate in multilateral trade
negotiations to fight protectionism in trade of farm products.
</P>
<P>
The WTO membership will also dramatically reduce the amount of
unfair treatment imposed on China's agricultural sector by other
countries, including non-tariff restrictions against China's
exported farm products, thus facilitating their accession into the
world market and expanding their market shares.
</P>
<P>
Like a double-edged sword, entry to the WTO also brings some
negative impacts on China's agriculture:
</P>
<P>
China will have to open its domestic market and revoke all non-
tariff restrictions on imported farm products. As the government's
protective policies on domestic farm products begin to be phased
out, foreign farm products at lower prices are set to pose great
challenges to their Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The flood of foreign farm products into China will put heavy
pressure n the country's foreign exchange reserve, the financial
source of imports. The scale of influence of China's WTO entry
varies with different farm products such as grain, wheat, edible
oil, cotton and wool.
</P>
<P>
As global demand for grain keeps increasing, its price has
risen steadily in the world market. The trend gives China a good
chance to promote its grain production and exports.

<P>
The Chinese Government has therefore decided to increase its
investment in the agricultural sector and increase the supply of
domestic farm products.
</P>
<P>
During the Uruguay Round of Talks, some WTO members, such Japan,
the Republic of Korea, the European Union, and the United States,
promised to open their markets wider and phase out their
protective policies on grain products. This will be conducive to
China's grain exports.
</P>
<P>
Increasing wheat prices on the world market will force China,
one of the world's biggest wheat buyers, to reduce imports and
rely more on domestic wheat supply.
</P>
<P>
During the Uruguay Round of Talks, the United States and the EU,
both China's long-time wheat suppliers, promised to reduce
government subsidies on wheat farmers, causing price hikes in
their exported wheat.
</P>
<P>
So, China will have to turn to other countries such as
Australia and Argentina, that could supply wheat at stable and
relatively low prices.
</P>
<P>
China is a major edible oil producer in the world. Yet because
of inefficient processing technology and high production costs,
domestic supply has fallen short of demand. In the foreseeable
future, China will remain an importer of the product. Domestic
edible oil producers will face greater pressure from their
international counterparts.
</P>
<P>
China's current annual cotton output is about 4.25 million tons,
compared to 5.52 million tons that are needed.

Under the agreement reached during the Uruguay Round of Talks,
China is allowed to increase its textile exports. The country's
rapid economic development will also increase demand for cotton in
the next few years. To make up for the cotton shortages, the
country will have to expand cotton imports. This, in addition to
increasing cotton prices on the world market, will aggregate the
burden on China's foreign exchange reserve.
</P>
<P>
On the positive side, higher cotton prices on the world market
will help stimulate domestic cotton production, which in return,
may boost cotton supply.
</P>
<P>
With the reduction of government protective policies, China's
wool industry is bound to suffer dearly as it is no match to that
of Australia in terms of product quality and production scale.
</P>
<P>
The gap between sugar supply and demand will remain for a long
time. To satisfy a growing domestic consumption, China will
continue to be a major sugar importer in the world, increasing the
burden on its foreign exchange reserve.
</P>
<P>
It is worth mentioning that the entry into WTO does not
necessarily mean that foreign farm products will soon prevail on
the Chinese market. If appropriate tariff rates and quotas for
agricultural produce are set, China's agricultural production and
farm products market will be slightly afflicted with or completely
clear of the influence of fluctuations in the international market.
</P>
<P>
During the negotiations with other member countries, China
should uphold its position to join the WTO as a developing country
and only fulfill its obligations. The country should also work out
a rational tariff rate that can best protect its national
interests, the researcher said.

<HEADLINE> On-line Disputes Emerge in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- On-line disputes are emerging in
China and Internet-related lawsuits are causing problems for some
of the courts, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The rapid development of the industry is challenging the wits
and expertise of judges who lack related legislative support," the
English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Legal cases concerning network disputes, ranging from on-line
copyright infringements to plagiarism of homepages, emerged at an
unexpected rate last year. Such cases were rare in 1998.
</P>
<P>
It's no wonder that Xin Shangmin, director of the Intellectual
Property Rights Division of Beijing Haidian District People's
Court, called 1999 the "year of Internet-related lawsuits," the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Xin's court handled 17 cases involving Internet
disputes, more than half of the total heard across the country. It
heard only one Internet-related case in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The court, sitting in Beijing's Zhongguancun, known as China's
Silicon Valley, in the Haidian District, is often called upon to
judge computer and Internet-related matters.
</P>
<P>
"How to clearly and justly rule on the Internet-related
lawsuits -- which requires not only legal expertise but also IT
industry knowledge -- under existing laws has become a headache
for the Chinese legal community, because there are no concrete
statutes related to Internet use," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Problems include jurisdiction, the verification and definition
of damages and the validity of digitized evidence. There is also a
question whether the country's 1991 Copyright Law can be applied
to Internet-related cases.

<P>
A confrontation between Ruide On-line in Beijing and an
information service company of Southwest China's Sichuan Province,
the Oriental Information Service Corporation, appears to have been
China's first case of Internet infringement.
</P>
<P>
in the case, the Oriental's lawyers disputed the court's
jurisdiction in the case when it was first heard in the Haidian
District court last year, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Collecting and verifying evidence is another problem. The
possibility of concealing an identity causes great trouble when
someone tries to stake a claim to a contested identity.
</P>
<P>
Chen Weihua posted an article on a website last May under the
pseudonym Wu Fang. The article was later printed by a weekly
without his authorization, although he claimed "All Rights
Reserved: No Reprint without Permission" at the end of the article.
</P>
<P>
The weekly refused to apologize to Chen or to pay more than its
standard fee for contributed articles, as Chen had demanded.
</P>
<P>
Allegedly, Chen could not prove he was Wu Fang. Chen kept no
original version of his article and was not able to present any
evidence to support to his claim.
</P>
<P>
During the court hearing, the judges required both Chen and the
defendant to try logging on to Wu Fang's homepage. Chen proved
that he was Wu Fang because he was the only person who could log
on to the homepage, change its password, upload or erase files. (

Meanwhile, whether the Copyright Law can be applied to Internet-
related cases has triggered a heated debate among legal
professionals.
</P>
<P>
A case in point involved noted writers Wang Meng, Zhang
Chengzhi, Liu Zhenyun, Zhang Jie, Zhang Kangkang and Bi Shumin,
who accused last September a website of copyright infringement in
a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
The writers asserted that the website had put their fiction
works on the Internet without their authorization, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers of the writers held that copyrights are protected on
the Internet by the Copyright Law because its 10th clause allows
an extension from the listed forms of rights of use with the
abbreviation word "etc."
</P>
<P>
The defendants' lawyers argued that the Internet is a new
medium completely different from traditional media and should not
be subjected to the clause.
</P>
<P>
In its ruling, the court backed the copyrights of the writers
by saying that "no new work has been produced during the process.
The copyright owner of the work still has copyright over it."
</P>
<P>
"With the rapid development of China's Internet, a new
copyright law with more specific articles on Internet protection
is needed for judges to make fair decisions," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Legal professionals said they expect a revision of the
existing Copyright Law to include copyright protection that can be
applied to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
At present, China reportedly has 8.9 million Internet users.

<HEADLINE> IMF Delays Vote on Loan For Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund (
IMF)has delayed a scheduled meeting of its executive board which
was to vote on an additional loan disbursement for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Senior IMF Representative in Jakarta John Dodsworth said no
date for its next 400 million U.S. dollars loan disbursement has
been set. The executive board of the group had originally been
scheduled to meet on April 4 to make a decision on the allocation.
</P>
<P>
"Discussions are still under way and we are hoping that it can
be determined very soon. But, as far as I know, there is no set
schedule for the board meeting yet," he was quoted by the
Indonesian Observer Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Dodsworth warned Indonesia that it would have to
speed up the pace of its economic reforms, particularly on
corporate debt restructuring, to qualify for the loan disbursement.
</P>
<P>
The IMF is organizing a bailout cash package worth 46 billion
dollars for Indonesia, of which the IMF is committed to providing
some 12.3 billion dollars. It has so far disbursed more than 9.5
billion dollars. Before each tranche is disbursed, the IMF reviews
Indonesia's progress in economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia pledged in January to speed up efforts to tackle its
65 billion dollars private debt burden as a large chunk of its
corporate sector has stopped servicing its debt and many firms are
said not to be cooperating with creditors.
</P>
<P>
In its January deal with the IMF, the country pledged to tackle
the debt burden through aggressive action by the Indonesian Bank
Restructuring Agency (IBRA), the Attorney General's Office and the
Jakarta Initiative, a body set up to promote debt restructuring.

YANGON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has rejected a recent U.S.
report on the human rights situation of countries in the world,
accusing it of taking a prejudiced stance toward the country with
politically motivated attempts to meddle with its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The report, issued by the U.S. State Department, once again
failed to recognize the positive developments occurring in the
country, the Myanmar Foreign Ministry said in a press release
available here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The report disregards the fact that Myanmar is enjoying
internal peace and stability for the first time in the
contemporary history of the country," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
It also complained that the U.S. State Department had time and
again focused on allegations based on unfounded information and
facts from sources which had no genuine compassion to appreciate
the developments in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
"It would be hypocritical of the U.S. since it speaks of
championing human rights while neglecting the right of other
sovereign and independent countries to choose their own way of
lives and to mold destinies on their own," it said.
</P>
<P>
The press release charged that the United States always
interferes in other countries' internal affairs and misrepresents
the human rights situation in other countries while failing to
take heed of the right of all sovereign countries to choose their
own political system in conformity with their cultural and social
values.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Grapes Website Attracts Frequent Visits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Want to have the finest Xinjiang
grapes? Just click http://www.Turpan.com.cn and you can order your
favorite variety of grapes on your computer.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Zhijun, an information network developer,
said the website has attracted some 15,000 visitors since it
opened this year.
</P>
<P>
Most of the visitors ordered grapes, raisins and even
cantaloupes produced in Turpan, the biggest grapes producer in
China.
</P>
<P>
The website provides information on 120 kinds of grapes
produced there and ways of planting grape trees and making raisins,
according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Turpan produces over 400,000 tons of grapes each year, more
than one third of China's total annual grapes output.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of local people's incomes are from grapes,
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
But poor transportation and underdeveloped local markets have
long hindered its sales, Zhang said, adding that the on-line
service would help solve the problem to a great extent.

<HEADLINE> Environment Monitoring Station at Three Gorges Starts Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- An environment monitoring station
has started trial operation in Badong County of central China's
Hubei Province to monitor the environment and ecology in the Three
Gorges reservoir area.
</P>
<P>
The station is the second of its kind China has built in the
reservoir area of the giant Three Gorges water control project on
the Yangtze River, where natural disasters like landslides are
frequent and serious.
</P>
<P>
As construction continues on the world's largest hydro-electric
power project on the middle reaches of the Yangtze, concern is
mounting over possible negative impact that the work may have on
the ecology in the river, especially in the gorges area.
</P>
<P>
The project, with an estimated price tag of 203.9 billion yuan,
includes the building of a 1,983-meter long and 185-meter high dam
and installation of 26 generating units with a combined generating
capacity of 18.2 million kw and an annual output of 84.7 billion
kwh. A total of 1.2 million local residents that are affected have
to be relocated.
</P>
<P>
Situated on the Three Gorges and upstream of the dam, Badong
County has the most complex terrain along the Yangtze and suffers
frequent landslides.
</P>
<P>
The new station, financed by the Yangtze River Water
Conservation Committee and built by the Yangtze River Academy, is
meant to help speed up the work of construction and relocation of
people inside the planned reservoir area, improving the
environment and preventing natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Equipped with advanced technologies including aero-remote
sensing and telemetry, the station is capable of collecting data
from the reservoir area, so as to facilitate decision-making for
the Three Gorges project.

<HEADLINE> Revised Marine Law to Protect Ocean, Seas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- China's new Marine Environmental
Protection Law, slated to go into effect on April 1, is expected
to help the country expand its fishery industry, China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
Since ocean and sea pollution depletes aquatic resources and
endangers development of the fishery sector, a statute
strengthening marine environmental conservation is absolutely
necessary, China Daily said, quoting Zhang Hecheng, vice-director
of the Fisheries Bureau Under the Agriculture Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has recorded an average of 80 contamination cases in
China's sea areas annually in recent years, according to Liu Zheng,
another official with the bureau. This has resulted in yearly
losses of 150 million yuan (about 18.1 million U.S. dollars), Liu
said.
</P>
<P>
Marine pollution has caused annual losses of 240,000 tons of
aquatic products in the Yellow and Bohai seas, the bureau's
statistics indicated.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the 1982 version, the new marine code delegates
the power of environmental protection in piscatorial waters and
fishing ports to the fisheries bureau, which will also act as the
supervisor and investigator of water pollution.
</P>
<P>
"The law will have a significant bearing on protecting
fisheries resources and safe-guarding the interests and rights of
fishing firms," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has called on fisheries departments at various
levels to study the new law and distribute the code among the
fishermen, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The bureau will map out detailed provisions regarding
monitoring and protection of fisheries resources. It will also
conduct environmental impact assessments of newly-built and
expanded aquatic breeding farms, according to ministry source.
</P>
<P>
Supervision of various boats and ships in fishing ports will be
stepped up to ensure that they have installed pollution prevention
equipment and are not discharging effluents -- oil-containing
water and daily sewage -- into seas.
</P>
<P>
Fishery bureaus are also required to conduct studies of areas
where oceanic natural reserves may be needed to protect special
plants and ecology, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
When importing ocean plants and animals, Zhang said, scientific
research and approval procedures are needed to protect China's sea
life.

<HEADLINE> Former Indonesian President's Crony Detained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Former Indonesian President
Soeharto's close associate Muhammad 'Bob' Hasan was placed under
detention on Tuesday by the Attorney General's Office after being
declared a suspect in a corruption case.
</P>
<P>
Hasan, a leading conglomerate figure, is initially to be
detained for 20 days because of the possibility that he would
misplace or destroy relevant evidence, complicate the
interrogation process and influence other witnesses, Deputy
Attorney General Chaerul Imam was quoted by the Indonesian
Observer Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hasan was questioned for approximately seven hours at the
Attorney General's Office by prosecutor Suwandi on Tuesday and
declared a suspect in a Ministry of Forests Fund corruption case
at the end of the interrogation.
</P>
<P>
Although it is believed that billions of rupiah was extorted
from the fund, the deputy attorney general refused to specify the
exact amount of money involved.
</P>
<P>
The decision to detain Hasan, a minister of trade and industry
in the Soeharto administration, was the result of an earlier two-
month investigation by the Attorney General's Office into the
forestry tycoon's link to the corruption case.
</P>
<P>
According to Imam, Hasan's company, PT Mapindo, "made mapping
of forests and concession forests throughout Indonesia" in
violation of an agreement with the Forestry Ministry and appeared
to have extorted billions of rupiah from the ministry's fund.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to his declaration as a suspect in the case, Hasan
said he had answered many questions put forward by the prosecutor
but declined to go into further detail.
</P>
<P>
"It does not matter. It's a legal state I have to abide by," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The arrest is part of Attorney General Marzuki Darusman's
ongoing campaign against high-level corruption during Soeharto's
32-year reign and his successor B.J. Habibie's 17-month term.
</P>
<P>
Darusman was named attorney general when President Abdurrahman
Wahid assumed office last October.
</P>
<P>
Hasan, a timber tycoon and Soeharto's long-time golfing buddy,
amassed a personal fortune during the former president's rule,
during which he enjoyed a virtual monopoly over one of the most
profitable sectors of the Indonesian economy.
</P>
<P>
He is one of the largest single debtors of the Indonesian Bank
Restructuring Agency (IBRA), a state agency set up to revive
Indonesia's graft-ridden banking system.
</P>
<P>
According to IBRA, Hasan contracted debts of more than 710
million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Executives, Scholars Call for Less Government Control over China's IT Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua)-- Senior business executives and
scholars called for less government control and a better legal
system for the development of China's booming information industry
at the China Development Forum conference here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
When Wu Jichuan, China's minister of Information Industry,
predicted in a report that the nation's information industry will
grow at an annual rate of 20 percent over the next decade,
business leaders and scholars attending the forum responded warmly
by offering their suggestions and advice for the explosively
growing industry.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Lau, professor at Stanford University, said that
China has to reconstruct its information infrastructure to embrace
the web economy, of which a sound legal system is the vital part.
</P>
<P>
Robert Hormats, vice chairman of the Goldman Sachs
International, USA, cited the example of Brazil, where over-
protection of the computer industry hurt both local consumers and
manufactures in the long run.
</P>
<P>
The Internet can serve as a "seamless interface" between China
and the world, and foreign companies are very confident of its
future in China, but problems will arise if the government imposes
too much regulation, he said.
</P>
<P>
A senior research fellow from the organizer of the forum, the
Development Research Center under China's State Council, said that
problems with China's existing laws and regulations on the
information industry have aroused disputes.
</P>
<P>
The charge for telecommunications service, for example, the "
installment fee" that must be paid before a telephone can be
installed, and the two-way charging of cell phones users and
callers, have met with increasing criticism from the public, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the laws and regulations are out-of-date and there
still is not a complete legal system on information technology,"
he pointed out, saying that lack of transparency in existing laws
and regulations, as well as over-regulation from government
bureaucracies have caused some foreign investors to lose interest.

<HEADLINE> Strong Winds Kill Three Persons in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A strong two-day storm that swept
through Beijing has died down, but on Monday gale-force winds
killed three construction workers and caused property losses of
hundreds of thousands of yuan, local press reports.
</P>
<P>
China Daily says three construction workers died when a 20-
square-meter piece of iron wire netting and asphalt rolled off the
top of a two-story building in northeast Beijing, knocking four
workers to the ground.
</P>
<P>
All four were taken immediately to hospital after the accident
on Monday morning, but three were fatally injured.
</P>
<P>
Three other construction workers had a lucky escape when they
were caught by safety netting after being blown from the building
they were working on.
</P>
<P>
According to the Haidian District Meteorological Observatory,
the highest wind speed recorded on Monday was 21 meters per second,
or force nine. Experts said winds of this strength are rare in
downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The gales also blew away the second floor of a building near
Lize Bridge in southwestern Beijing on Monday, but no injuries
were reported.
</P>
<P>
A 15-meter-high, 4-meter-wide iron billboard fell from the top
of a restaurant in western Beijing on Monday afternoon, smashing
into a blue Santana car parked nearby, Beijing Morning Post
reported yesterday.
</P>
<P>
No far away, workers hurried to reinforce a billboard which was
dangling in the wind.
</P>
<P>
An Audi car in front of the hotel St. Regis Beijing was trapped
by two fallen trees, which were uprooted by the winds.
</P>
<P>
Only a few of the palace lanterns along the Chang'an Avenue
remained intact after the fierce winds.
</P>
<P>
But department stores benefited from the dusty weather, when
pedestrians fighting the choking wind stopped to buy hats,
sunglasses and gauze handkerchiefs to keep off the dust.
</P>
<P>
Sources with Beijing Fuxing Store said that the sales volume of
sunglasses increased to 12,000 yuan (1,445 U.S. dollars) from the
usual 8,000 yuan (964 U.S. dollars). The sales of windbreakers
have also seen a rise.
</P>
<P>
By yesterday afternoon, the winds had weakened to force 2-3,
said Zhang Jianzhong, a researcher with the National
Meteorological Observatory.

<HEADLINE> Agassi Beats Rafter or Quarterfinal Berth </HEADLINE>

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- American Andre Agassi, who won
a marathon game in the second set, beat Australia's Patrick Rafter
6-4, 6-4 Tuesday in the fourth round of the Ericsson Open, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded Agassi moved a step closer to his fourth title
at Key Biscayne and his first since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Rafter, seeded 15th, failed to convert any of his seven break-
point chances against Agassi, including five in the eighth game of
the second set. The score went to deuce 10 times and included two
close calls Agassi disputed, including an overrule by the chair
umpire.
</P>
<P>
But Agassi prevailed for a 5-3 lead when a weary Rafter hit a
backhand long on the 26th and final point of the game.
</P>
<P>
Also advancing to the men's quarterfinals were sixth-seeded
Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil, No. 14 Lleyton Hewitt also of Australia
and unseeded Wayne Ferreira of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Hewitt swept No. 3 Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia 6-4, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Kuerten beat Italy's Gianluca Pozzi 6-4, 7-6 (3). Ferreira
rallied past Slovakian Dominik Hrbaty 2-6, 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
No. 13 Jennifer Capriati, who eliminated Serena Williams in a
grueling duel Monday, lost to No. 12 Sandrine Testud of France, 6-
3, 6-4.

<HEADLINE> Yagudin Leads Men's Event after Short Programme  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICE, France, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian skater Alexei
Yagudin showed his rivals the difference between sports and arts
Tuesday night, leading the men's event after the short programme
at the World Figure Skating Championships.
</P>
<P>
Skating to the music of Nutcracker by Tchaikovsky, Yagudin,
twice world champion in 1998 and 1999, gave a flawless performance
on the Nice ice rink and displayed a series actions of musicians
in front of a packed crowds.
</P>
<P>
He was awarded three 5.9 points and five 5.8s for required
elements which includes one quadruple toe-loop followed by triple
axels/triple toe-loop combination.
</P>
<P>
Expectedly, the Russian had nine 5.9s for artistic presentation
from as many judges.
</P>
<P>
Going nervously into the short programme as the last one,
Yagudin managed to control himself. "It was hard to skate last
but I was able to cope with my nervousness and I'm pleased with my
performance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another Russian Evgeni Plushenko, who defeated Yagudin to win
the event at the European Championships in Vienna last month, was
second after the short programme.
</P>
<P>
Dressed like a sword man, Plushenko also had a brilliant skate
to the music of Sabre Dance by Aram Katchaturian, for which he had
six 5.8s for technical merit and five 5.8s for presentation.
</P>
<P>
American Michael Weiss, who double footed in quadruple toe-loop,
was third.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Elvis Stojko, overnight leader after the qualifying
free skating, was the only one who fell a quadruple toe-loop in
the last group this evening.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 world champion, who is making his tenth appearance at
the world championships, skated after Plushenko, who was standing
at the first place at the moment. The nervous Canadian even could
not finish the quadruple toe-loop and fell when he landed after a
successful triple Axel and triple toe-loop.
</P>
<P>
Stojko was obviously dissapointed for his performance when he
was sitting in the Kiss and Cry corner for the score. He was
fourth into the free skating.
</P>
<P>
"I felt really solid all the way through. Right after the take-
off,just right in the middle of it, it (the quad) started leaning
on me. Once that happens, you can't bore it out with your weight
on one side. I just miscued and just make sure I don't miscue in
the long programme. I am frustrated at this point," said the
experienced Canadian. "I shouldn't have missed it, because it had
been going well. It is dissappointing."
</P>
<P>
Alexander Abt of Russia was fifth and Chinese skater Li
Chengjiang,who makes debut at the world championships, finished
sixth after short programme.
</P>
<P>
The free skating will be held on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
European Championships ice dancing gold medalists Marina
Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat of France led their event after the
compulsary dance --Vienna Waltz and Argentine Tango. Italian duo
Barbara Fusar-Poli/Maurizio Margaglio and Russian couple Irina
Lobacheva/Ilia Averbukh were second and third respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, French pair skater Stephane Bernadis was attacked by
an unknown assaulant at his hotel room this afternoon. His left
arm was injured and the skater was treated on site.
</P>
<P>
The injury was not severe and the skater will take part in the
free skating programme Wednesday night.

<HEADLINE> Qatari Crown Prince Approves 2000/2001 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Qatari Crown Prince Sheikh
Jassem Bin Hamad al-Thani on Wednesday approved a fractional-
deficit budget for the fiscal year up to the end of March 2001.
</P>
<P>
The budget was set at 28 billion Qatari riyals (7.7 billion U.S.
dollars) with a projected deficit of 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The total revenues for fiscal 2000/2001 are estimated at 12.6
billion riyals (3.4 billion dollars), compared with 10.5 billion
riyals (2.9 billion dollars) for 1999/2000, said a statement issued
by Qatar's Minister of Finance, Economy and Trade Yousef Hussein
Kamal.
</P>
<P>
The total expenditures for the new fiscal year are projected at
15.4 billion riyals (4.2 billion dollars), up 1.2 billion riyals
(347 million dollars), according to reports from the Qatari capital
of Doha.
</P>
<P>
But the projected budget deficit drops to 2.7 billion riyals
(764 million dollars) from 3.6 billion riyals (907 million
dollars), as the new budget was based on oil price of 15 dollars a
barrel, five dollars more than last year.
</P>
<P>
Dividing part of the spending, the new budget earmarked 2
billion Riyals (555 million dollars) for completion of major state
projects, while 4.4 billion riyals (1.2 billion dollars) went to
new projects.

<HEADLINE> Barak, Arafat Discuss Israeli-Palestinian Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat made a phone
conversation Wednesday night to discuss the latest developments in
talks between the sides.
</P>
<P>
Barak hoped the dialogue could advance peace negotiations
between Israel and the Palestinians in order to reach a lasting,
just and comprehensive peace for the peoples in the Middle East
region, according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The telephone contact followed the completion of brainstorming
negotiations between mid-level officials from both sides at the
Bolling Air Force Base in southeastern Washington, which ended on
Tuesday with no visible progress.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian talks resumed a weak ago after a month-
old deadlock because of difference over Israeli troop withdrawal
from 6.1 percent of the West Bank land, which was eventually
carried out earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
During the Washington talks, the negotiators discussed all the
final-status issues, such as borders, Jerusalem, refugees and
Jewish settlements, as well as the scheduled third-stage Israeli
withdrawal from occupied territories of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat Wednesday told Voice of
Palestine that the talks was difficult, but very serious. However,
he added, there were large gaps between the two sides regarding a
wide range of issues varying from interim to permanent-status
problems.
</P>
<P>
The negotiating teams, led by Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran
and his Palestinian counterpart Yasser Abed Rabbo respectively, had
returned to the region Wednesday to begin consultations with their
governments.
</P>
<P>
They are scheduled to return to Washington on April 6 for
another round of talks with the hope of beginning to draft the text
of a framework agreement, as the deadline for such a accord is just
over a month away.
</P>
<P>
Barak also brief Arafat Wednesday night on the inconclusive
Geneva summit between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad and Israel's possible unilateral
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which was held last Sunday and regarded as the last
chance to revive the Israeli-Syrian talks, failed to bring the two
sides together as expected.
</P>
<P>
U.S. media suggested that the Clinton administration,
disappointed with Assad's insistence at the Geneva summit, would
possibly push forward Israeli-Palestinian talks and support
unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon in stead in order to
increase pressure on Syria.
</P>
<P>
Damascus demands Israel make an advance commitment to a full
withdrawal from the Golan Heights it captured from Syria in the
1967 Mideast War before their talks can be resumed.
</P>
<P>
Barak is trying to garner international support for his pledged
unilateral pullback and possible deployment of international peace-
keeping force where the Israelis vacated to fill the vacuum, thus
depriving Syria of a major bargaining chip at negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Syria, a major power broker in Lebanon, hoped to use Israel's
predicament in south Lebanon as a leverage to pressure for Israel's
return of the Golan.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 15-kilometer-deep "security zone" in south
Lebanon in 1985 with a self-proclaimed aim of preventing cross-
border guerrilla attacks on its north. But mounting Israeli
casualties have spurred a growing public pressure for a pullout. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet on March 5 gave backing to a key pledge made
by Barak to withdraw from the buffer zone by July, with or without
a peace deal with Syria.

JERUSALEM -- The High Court of Justice of Israel decided
Wednesday that hundreds of Palestinians expelled by Israel near the
West Bank city of Hebron can return to their homes and graze their
herds on their land there.
</P>
<P>
The court also decided that the above decision will remain in
force until an investigation is conducted into the case.
</P>
<P>
The court made the decisions after hearing a petition against
the expulsion of about 700 Palestinians from their homes in the
hill areas south of Hebron. These Palestinians were expelled by the
Israeli Civil Administration during the last three months of 1999,
which termed the area as "a military firing zone." (Israel-

The outcome -- 303 for, 202 against and 11 abstentions -- was
the first step towards final passage of the proposal, put forward
by Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit to clear the way for Demirel to

CAIRO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The national carriers of Jordan and Kuwait will each
double their number of flights between the two countries to four
per week from April 1.
</P>
<P>
The new schedule by Royal Jordanian and Kuwait Airlines was made
in response to the growing demand on air travel, as more Jordanian
workers are returning to the lucrative labor market in Kuwait after
the two countries normalized in 1999 their ties severed during the
1990 Gulf crises.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was isolated by Kuwait and other Arab countries for
siding and sympathizing with Iraq during the crisis, which was
triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Labor exports remain as one of the key foreign currency earners
of Jordan, and its expatriates brought home some 1.27 billion U.S.
dollars in remittances in 1999, mostly from Kuwait and other Gulf
countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- U.S. businessmen are showing more interest in Turkey's
energy and telecommunications sectors, Turkish Daily News reported
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. telecommunications giant SBC has built up an appetite for
Turkey's telecom sector and shown its desire to run a mobile phone
GSM network in Turkey. SBC recently announced that it has teamed up
with Turkish conglomerate Koc Holding to bid for a new GSM network
operating at 1,800 MHz.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. energy companies are closely watching the energy
sector and waiting for Turkey to draw up a final list of energy
sell-offs.
</P>
<P>
While the first round of the U.S.-Turkish Trade and Investment
Council meeting is now going on in Washington, the U.S. Department
of Commerce, which has named Turkey one of the top 10 emerging
markets, commented that the Turkish economy was on the right
course.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Major South Korean car maker Hyundai Company is
planning to build a bus factory in Konya, south of Ankara, Turkish
Daily News reported on Wednesday.
</P>

companies would be sold by the end of next year, during which other
companies will undergo reforms.
</P>
<P>
He told Kuwait News Agency Monday that a total of 314 government
companies should be sold by 2001, adding that the Egyptian
government intended to maintain 60 percent of shares of 22
companies.
</P>

Egypt launched a privatization plan six years ago. During the
period, 135 companies have been sold, generating 3.4 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Kuwait will take part in the "Arabian Travel
Market 2000" due to be held in Dubai on May 2-5.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait will be represented by Kuwait Company for Touristic

Eddif, told the press here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Eddif said the Kuwaiti company aims to promote the Hala February
Festival for the year 2001. The Hala festival is an annual event of
tourism and shopping activities organized by the Kuwaiti government
to help stimulate the country's sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait Airways, hotels and travel agencies will also take part
in the exhibition, Eddif said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 2,913 consumers and 139 tourism specialists showed up
at the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
The Arabian Travel Market 2000 is sponsored by the Department of
Tourism and Commercial Marketing of the government of Dubai, an
emirate of the United Arab Emirates. It will be the sixth time the
event is held in Dubai.
</P>
<P>

promotional films, books, publications and posters depicting
tourist and historical places in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Biltaji is expected to meet his Syrian and Lebanese counterparts
in Beirut for talks on tourism cooperation programs.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Arafat: No Compromise on National Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Palestinian National
Authority Yasser Arafat said here Wednesday that there would be no
compromise on the Palestinian national rights whatever the
conditions and power balances might be.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the pledge in an address to all Palestinians inside
and outside the Palestinian self-rule areas on the eve of the 24th
anniversary of the Palestinian Land Day that falls on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"On this day we announce to the world that there is no
compromise on our national rights whatever the conditions,
considerations and power balances are," he said, adding that the
rights will be safeguarded by "unshakable faith."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian legitimate rights, including the right to exist
on the Palestinian territory, the right to establish an independent
state with Jerusalem as its capital and the Palestinian refugees'
rights to return to their homes, are enshrined by international
legitimacy, Arafat noted.
</P>
<P>
The 20th century witnessed "the most horrible tragedy against
the Palestinian people," he added.
</P>
<P>
"However, we managed, through our strong will and determination,
to make the dawn of the 21st century a good omen for the emergence
of the Independent State of Palestine with Jerusalem as its capital
willy-nilly," Arafat stressed.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remarks one day after Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators wound up a new round of final-status talks in
Washington, without tangible results. The two sides have agreed to
meet again on April 6 so as to reach a framework agreement on a
final peace treaty by the September 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has repeated on several occasions to declare an
independent Palestinian state by September with or without an
agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian people, especially the Israeli Arabs, about 1
million of whom live in Israel, annually commemorate on March 30
the killing by Israeli forces of six Arabs during demonstrations in
1976 to protest against Israeli confiscation of their lands.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Mission Assists Hostage Exchange in Georgia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Staff of the United
Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) successfully
completed an exchange of hostages between the Georgian and Abkhaz
sides, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Four men held by the Georgians and seven men and one woman held
by the Abkhazis were simultaneously swapped in an "all-for-all"
operation brokered by Dieter Boden, the special representative of
the secretary-general for Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Two U.N. helicopters were used in the operation, which was
initially agreed by the parties at Boden's initiative early in
February, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The exchange, which was supported at the highest level by both
sides, ends a series of "tit-for-tat" abductions that have been a
cause of growing tension, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The operation went smoothly to the satisfaction of all involved,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The four Abkhazis held were two young law enforcement officers
taken from their post late last year, and two other men involved
in a shooting incident in January.
</P>
<P>
The eight Georgians were two men held since 1998 in connection
with charges arising from events in May that year, and six other
people kidnapped along the cease-fire line in December 1999 and
January 2000.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Hails Successful Transition in Guinea-Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Wednesday hailed the successful transitional process in Guinea-
Bissau that led to free and fair elections, saying that all
concerned were obligated to recognize and uphold the results.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation Council issued a presidential statement after an
open briefing on the current situation in the West African country,
expressing support for the newly elected government and encourage
it "to develop and implement program devised to consolidate peace
and national reconciliation."
</P>
<P>
A second round of elections, held in January, marked the end
of a transition period that followed a military coup in June 1998
that culminated in the May 1999 overthrow of President Joao
Bernardo Vieira.
</P>
<P>
The presidential statement welcomed the February 17 swearing-
in of President Kumba Yalla "and the return to constitutional and
democratic order in Guinea-Bissau following the holding of free
and fair presidential and legislative elections."
</P>
<P>
The statement affirmed that "all concerned, particularly the
former Military Junta, are obligated to recognize and uphold the
results of these elections," as part of a peace accord signed in
Abuja, capital of Nigeria, in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council encourages all concerned in Guinea-
Bissau to work together closely in a spirit of tolerance to
strengthen democratic values, to protect the rule of law, to
depoliticize the arms and to safeguard human rights," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Security Council also called on the
international community to support a three-month transitional
program drafted by the government, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The transition process has been aided by a U.N. Peace-building
Support Office in Guinea-Bissau (UNOGBIS), whose mandate, due to
expire on March 31, has been extended for a year.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. under-secretary-general for political affairs, Kieran
Prendergast, told the open Security Council meeting that "the
overall situation in Guinea-Bissau is peaceful and the
humanitarian situation has noticeably improved."
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the economic situation was worrying and
the government still did not have resources to pay long overdue
salaries to civil servants and soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Maintains for Nicaragua Right to Navigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica will maintain for
Nicaragua its claims over the right to navigate in the San Juan
border river, Foreign Ministry sources told Xinhua Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vice Foreign Minister Walter Niehaus will travel Wednesday to
Managua to examine with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Jose Adrian
Guerra, the preparations for the meeting of the foreign ministers
of the two countries foreseen for Monday in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of Foreign Minister Roberto Rojas of Costa Rica and
Foreign Minister Eduardo Montealegre of Nicaragua follows the one
held two weeks ago in Managua.
</P>
<P>
Organization of American States (OAS) Cesar Gaviria will attend
the meeting as "facilitator" of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica and Nicaragua seek a rapprochement of their position
for the solution of a dispute that has clouded the relations
between the two countries in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua barred the transit of armed Costa Rican policemen on
the river, which is under its exclusive sovereignty, in agreement
with the treaties in force.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica says that those treaties give it the right of free
navigation along the river, including the displacement of armed
policemen, which is opposed by Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica declared the dialogue concluded in February after
several months of bilateral negotiations and recurred to the OAS,
which appointed Gaviria as "facilitator" of the conversations.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue resumed under this new modality, without Costa
Rica renouncing to the possibility of recurring to an
international court if it does not achieve a satisfactory accord.

<HEADLINE> Argentina To Sell Presidential Jet to Highest Bidder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Fernando
de la Rua is thinking of the possibility of selling through an
international public bidding process the Tango 01 presidential
plane, official sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the same sources, a call to public bidding to sell
the presidential plane, a Boeing 757, aims at carrying out this
operation in the most transparent way possible.
</P>
<P>
The sources announced that De la Rua will take the final
decision on this matter on the first days of April, when he is
presented a draft on the conditions for this international contest.
</P>
<P>
De la Rua decided, from the moment he assumed power, to sell
the presidential plane acquired under the administration of former
President Carlos Menem to save public spending.
</P>
<P>
The plane has been used by De la Rua from that time only to
support several solidary actions, like the transport of food and
medicines to zones affected by natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The previous administration paid for the Boeing 757 almost 70
million dollars, and now its value, with only 5,000 flight hours,
and with the most modern technology, varies between 49 million and
51 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Says Time to Renegotiate N.Irish Arms Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said
on Wednesday that he cannot guarantee "the war will not start
again" if Northern Ireland's suspended power-sharing institutions
are not restored.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in west Belfast, Adams appealed
to politicians to come together in an effort to "make politics
work again".
</P>
<P>
Adams said he knew of "no sensible republican" who wanted
conflict to resume on the streets of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
He added that a symbolic decommissioning of weapons by the
Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) had not ended their killing
campaign.
</P>
<P>
His appeal followed a call for republicans to meet unionist
demands half way from Northern Ireland Secretary of State Peter
Mandelson.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said it was the will of the people that the cold war
should be ended during a speech in Belfast on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
"We must set ourselves in a new context, to recognize that
conflict and division only held us back.
</P>
<P>
He asked Ulster Unionists to rally round their leader David
Trimble and show they were committed to making politics work.
</P>
<P>
The governments in London and Dublin are still trying to inject
momentum into the stalled process with attempts to get unionists
and republicans talking again before Easter in order to reinstate
the suspended political institutions.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's republican Sinn Fein party said on Wednesday
it was time to go "back to the drawing board" and renegotiate the
issue of guerrilla disarmament in the British province's peace
pact.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein deputy leader Martin McGuinness said he did not
believe the key hurdle of arms decommissioning could be cleared
before the May 22 deadline stipulated in the British province's
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said on Tuesday there was"not
a hope" of achieving the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's landmark 1998 Good Friday agreement is
facing collapse over the arms issue and other controversies.
</P>
<P>
The accord was a beacon of hope for the province where some 3,
600 people died in the guerrilla war between 1968 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein said its allies in the Irish Republican Army (IRA)
will only tackle disarmament once a fledgling power-sharing
government which Britain suspended last month is restored.
</P>
<P>
The pro-British Ulster Unionists meanwhile have refused to
share power with Sinn Fein until they are given the "appropriate
assurances" on IRA disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Unionist hardliners said missing the May 22 deadline
will leave the Good Friday agreement dead in the water, and say a
new pact should be drawn up if there is no decommissioning by then.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Welcomes OPEC Oil Increase Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Wednesday welcomed the agreement reached by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Tuesday to pump more crude
oil, saying it is a good news for the U.S. economy and consumers.
</P>
<P>
The "announcement that OPEC members will increase oil
production is good news for our economy and for the American
consumer," the president said at a White House press conference.
</P>
<P>
"These increases should bring lower prices, which will help to
sustain economic growth here in America and also and very
importantly, throughout the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton said the U.S. government will continue to
monitor developments in world markets closely.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC announced that nine of its members would raise
production by 6.3 percent, or a total of 1.45 million barrels per
day (bpd), despite bitter opposition from Iran, the cartel's
second largest producer. The higher production would begin next
month.
</P>
<P>
Expecting the oil prices to fall in the next few weeks, the
president urged U.S. oil companies to do everything they can to
bring the savings to consumers as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the Congress to take steps to strengthen the
country's long-term energy security, including new tax incentives
and investments to support domestic oil producers and to promote
the development and use of alternative fuels and more efficient
energy technologies.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's decision to pump an extra 1.45 million barrels per day
above the cartel's official quota, along with more oil expected
from other non-OPEC nations Mexico and Norway,will narrow most of
the current 2 million bpd gap in world oil supply and demand, said
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson.
</P>
<P>
The extra oil should reach the U.S. market in about five weeks,
pushing down gasoline prices, Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
The average price of gasoline at the pump already fell 2.1
cents a gallon this week to about 1.51 U.S. dollars a gallon, the
first decline in nearly three months. "Hopefully, it's a sign of
better things to come," he said.
</P>
<P>
Now that OPEC has agreed to ramp up production, Richardson said,
it was not necessary for the administration to release oil from
the 569-million barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve to lower prices.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Not to Politicize Sharia: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds of people were killed in fighting last month between
Christians and Muslims over proposals to extend the application of
Sharia in northern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on an interview with the British Broadcast Corporation
in Nigeria's capital Abuja, Obasanjo said that the application of
Sharia involved fundamental human rights but it was up to
individual Nigerians to go to court, not the federal government.
</P>
<P>
He said the state of Zamfara, which has carried out floggings
and an amputation in its application of Sharia, was violating
human rights but this was not an issue for the government to get
involved in.
</P>
<P>
He denied that the government was being indecisive on an issue
about which Christians and Muslims feel so passionately.
</P>
<P>
Rather, the president said that Sharia was being used by people
who were losing out in the new democratic dispensation.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to leave no stone unturned and those people who
have done wrong in the past will probably fight back," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What we are going through, what we are doing here, is a
revolution of some sort and we expect that it will take some time
before things settle," he added.
</P>
<P>
The president said that he was relaxed and confident despite
the upsurge in ethnic, religious and communal violence that has
characterized the past year.
</P>
<P>
Although many Nigerians are calling for a loosening of the
federal bonds as a way of reducing regional tensions, Obasanjo
said he would always resist this.
</P>
<P>
He described such calls as emotional.

<HEADLINE> Russia, U.S. to Resume Discussion on ABM Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stephen Sestanovich, U.S. State Department ambassador-at-large
and special advisor for the former Soviet states affairs, said
Albright and Ivanov will continue the discussion on the possible
change to the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty signed by Moscow
and Washington in 1972.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration will decide whether to start building a
national missile defense system this summer. As a deployment of
such a system would run against the ABM treaty, Washington hopes
to persuade Moscow to agree to make some modifications to it and
Russia so far has rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a breakfast meeting of the Defense Writers Group,
Sestanovich said that discussion of ABM modification was ongoing
at various levels, including between Clinton and Putin.
</P>
<P>
"Our assumption is that it will continue next month when
Foreign Minister Ivanov is here to see Secretary Albright," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Sestanovich said that Russia shared the U.S. perception that
there was a threat from so-called "rogue states", which motivates
Clinton's moves toward building the missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that there were signs coming from Russia that its
parliament or Duma would soon consider a vote on ratifying the
START II arms reduction accord, which has been ratified by the U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
"They have to consider when to schedule it but there seems to
be a considerable confidence in the Russian government that this
is a near-term project," Sestanovich said.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed With Nasdaq Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Technology stocks continued to
fall Wednesday as cautious remarks by the Wall Street's bullish
analyst Abby Joseph Cohen still loomed over the market. But the
blue chip index rose.
</P>
<P>
At the close of session, the technology heavy Nasdaq composite
index fell 189.22 at 4,644.67 for a third consecutive session. The
index fell 124.67 points Tuesday and 4.47 points Monday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial
average rose 82.61 at 11,018.72 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index rose 0.79 at 1,508.52.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index fell as investors continued to sell tech
stocks for profit-taking on Cohen's remarks. Cohen told clients
Tuesday that many tech stocks were fully valued and had little
room for further growth and her comments immediately triggered a
big selloff on the day.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index has kept its leadership on the market since
the beginning of 2000 after an 86 percent rise in 1999. The
composite still is up more than 14.1 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index rose today as investors moved money into
pharmaceuticals and retailers from tech sectors. Merck and Wal
Mart rose, leading the Dow's advance.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 3.90 at 649.36. But the American Stock
Exchange index fell 15.61 at 1,000.90 and the Russell 2000 index

<HEADLINE> Cuba Highlights China's Role in Group of 77 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban government underscored
Wednesday the role played by China in the Group of 77 (G-77),
whose first summit will be held on April 10 to 14 in Havana.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Foreign Ministry's Multilateral Affairs director Abelardo
Moreno said that the role of China in the G-77 is fundamental, not
only because it is the main economic power, but because of its
attitude, in political terms, in the defense of the Third World.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat took part in a Round Table in which several
academicians analyzed international cooperation and the Havana
Southern Summit.
</P>
<P>
Moreno highlighted the possibilities for the start of
cooperation between the nations of the South, and explained that
Cuba will present at the Summit 69 projects of South-South
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat underscored that the main goal of the meeting
should be to arrive at joint positions that will permit the
advance of that coalition of 133 countries.
</P>
<P>
The First South Summit, which is expected to be attended by
some 60 heads of state, will discuss four main topics: the
globalization of the world economy, the North-South relations, the
South-South Cooperation and Science and Technology access.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Expects to Work With Putin on Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"He has expressed a genuine commitment to economic reform, and
the Russian economy is growing again, and a desire to put together
a first-rate team. And that was encouraging," Clinton told
reporters at a press conference at the White House.
</P>
<P>
After Putin was elected Russia's third president on March 26,
Clinton telephoned the new leader and congratulated him but
pressured him on the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
During the conversation, Clinton said Putin also expressed "an
interest in working with us to pursue matters of mutual concern,
particularly in the area of arms control and in some other areas."
"I'm looking forward to working with him on that."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the personal chemistry between the leaders of the
two countries, Clinton said he did like former Russian President
Boris Yelstin very much. "He had the sort of personality that...
it was difficult to remain neutral in dealing with him," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I did like him very much, but I also thought he was committed
to democracy. And I think the fact that he stepped down and that
we had a genuine democratic transition in Russia is some evidence
of that," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who is going to be replaced by a new president early
next year, said he hoped that he and his successor would have a
good relationship with Putin.
</P>
<P>
"The United States and Russia have vast national interests that
require them to work together on the things with which we agree
and to manage the difficulties between us where we have honest
disagreements," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"And the personal chemistry will come and go, depending on the
personalities, but the point is, the fact that I liked Boris
Yeltsin didn't stop me from differing with him when we were
differing, and it certainly never stopped him from differing with
me, in his classic style," he added.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the U.S. have differences over a wide range of
issues including the arms control, the expansion of the NATO and
regional security.
</P>
<P>
"And I don't expect that to change with President Putin. But I
think that the relationship is very important to the United States
and to Russia, and it must be worked on constantly," Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Asks Assad to Present New Peace Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S President Bill Clinton on
Wednesday repeated his call that Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
take steps for the resumption of the stalled Syrian-Israeli
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"If he disagrees with their territorial proposal, which is
quite significant, then there should be some other proposal I
think coming from the Syrians to say how their concerns could be
handled," Clinton said at a White House press conference.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the remarks three days after he failed to bring
the Syrians back to the negotiating table when he met with Assad
in Geneva on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The White House has said the failure resulted from "significant
differences" between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The "significant differences" lie mainly in a narrow strip of
shoreline on Sea of Calilee, which, before the 1967 Mideast War,
belonged to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syrians have demanded the return of the whole territory of the
Golan Heights, including the strip of shoreline on Sea of Galilee,
while the Israeli government, though acknowledging former Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin's promise to make a full withdrawal from
the Golan Heights, is reluctant to return that narrow strip of
shoreline because of its crucial water resources.
</P>
<P>
What Assad told Clinton during the Geneva summit was that
Israel return all of the territory it seized in the 1967 Mideast
War, which would surely extend Syrian sovereignty to the edge of
the lake.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's call was tantamount to asking Syria to stop short of
demanding a full return of the territory so that Israel could have
a full control of the lake.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called on Syrians and Israelis to restrain themselves
to show "a genuine desire for peace".

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls on Cuban Boy's U.S. Relatives to Respect Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday called on the U.S. relatives of the Cuban boy, Elian
Gonzalez, to follow the rule of law and respect the decision of
the judges.
</P>
<P>
"We all have to -- whatever the law is, whatever the decision
that is ultimately made, the rest of us ought to obey it," Clinton
told a press conference at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would permit federal authorities to go to forcibly
take the boy and send him to Cuba, Clinton said "surely we're some
distance from that" because the relatives of the boy will clearly
appeal if they fail in court.
</P>
<P>
"I would just hope that the law would be followed by everyone,
including them (the relatives of the boy). I think that there is a
legal process here. I have done my best to avoid politicizing it."
Clinton told the reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I think that the appropriate authorities, in this case the
judges, will make a decision, and when that is done, I think that
people on all sides should accept the rule of the court," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also expressed his opposition to "any extra pressure"
on the relatives. "I don't think they should be singled out."
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department has demanded Elian's relatives in Florida
sign an agreement to promise to surrender the six-year-old Cuban
boy if they lose their court fight. The family refused to sign
such an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Family spokesman Armando Gutierrez for the boy's relatives in
Florida said Tuesday that the authorities vowed to remove Elian
from the United States if an agreement wasn't signed this week.
</P>
<P>
The INS said Monday in a letter to the family that it will
swiftly end Elian Gonzalez's right to remain in the United States
unless his Miami relatives promise to surrender the boy if they
lose their court fight to keep him out of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The INS said the boy's parole would end at 9 a.m. Thursday
unless the family provides a written guarantee to give up Elian.
</P>
<P>
Elian, who is currently under the custody of his great uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, in Florida, was rescued on November 25 last year
from a shipwreck after his mother and 11 others died when the boat
capsized in the sea off Florida.
</P>
<P>
The INS ruled earlier this year that the boy belongs to his
father and should be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
However, the decision to return him was delayed after the boy's
great uncle Florida filed a political asylum for him. U.S.
District Judge K. Michael Moore ruled that only the U.S. attorney
general can grant political asylum to the boy.
</P>
<P>
The boy's father in Cuba, supported by the Cuban government,
insisted that his son should be returned to him while the boy's
great uncle, backed by some anti-Cuba politicians in the U.S.,
asked the boy to stay with him.
